<h1>About Avicus</h1>
The Avicus Network was shut down on January 25th, 2018. After two years of stagnation and decreasing sales, we have been unable to maintain and grow the server. While it is sad to say goodbye to Avicus, we are proud of what has been accomplished, and these past seven years would not have been possible without the dedication, talent, generosity, and creativity of you, the Avicus community. Thank you for being a part of this journey.
