I dislike abusive Mods. So far not one of my Kicks has been legitimate. Powering abusers. The caps one is the only legit reason, but i was probably screaming "DEFEND THE MONUMENT", which is juts my way of saying, "hey, we're loosing, do something, they're at our monument"&nbsp; The spleefing one, he spleefed me first and i did nothing too annoy him, it was the first 30 seconds of the game and he targetted me, so i chased him around harrassing him, then spleefed him to get revenge, which i would have left it at that, but i was kicked. The "inappropriate" is so vague its not even funny. I was discussing gays and their rights without being sexually peverted or rude and abusive, it was a simple discussion/debate/arguement&nbsp; and the mods reason for kicking me after i asked was i said something along the lines of "Doesn't matter which hand you use, so long as it's firm" Which i did not say because that is disgusting and rude. Either the mod is high or stupid, because he couldn't even remember what i said "exactly" when i asked him to repeat my exact reason for being kicked. "Inappropriate" yeah, great reason. Thats like hitler saying i killed 6 million jews because i found the way they dressed was "Inappropriate" Learn to justify your actions KooDaLord. Last one says i was kicked for "swearing" i didn't swear at all, YOU have a mod names TheDiamondGecko&nbsp;running around kicking people for saying "gold" instead of "butter" why the hell is he even a mod?!? What are this servers entry requirements?! Because that is pathetic with the last two. Step up your standards, this server used to be a good one.
