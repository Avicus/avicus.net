<h1>About</h1>
<div class='mh-75' style='overflow: hidden'>
Info: Hello, I am Blood_Archon, I have been with Mc Zone for over a year now (including my time on as Erye1425). Sfkwww and a couple of other skilled players, along with myself, had formed a team a while back and I was the offensive player along with Sfkwww. We both know each other and the only reason I haven't been on for a while was due to League of Legends. However, I am back and will be always be at your flag, taking it as soon as possible.


Talents: I am skilled with both archery and melee combat. However, my best expertise is parkour for I always, always go for the flag, no matter stands in my way. Normally, I am armor less, but I only get armor if I need it, someone is killed near me, or if someone gives it to me. Other than that, I use a speed potion to get across the map as fast as possible and take out either all or one of the objectives.


Nebula Info: I have been on this server for over a year, although my stats are for some reason reset, I still have the skill and talent that I always had. I have been with Sfkwww for several months as well, we normally try to take the enemy obsidian block on Nebula as fast as we can. Both of us are equally skilled in combat, strategy, and at parkour. One the thing though that makes me unique is being the first person (back when I was Erye1425) to take off my armor and run through the battlefield armor less, something Sfkwww
