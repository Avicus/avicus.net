Hey guys, I put one out about a month ago and got great feedback. So I decided to make another one :D<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://imgur.com/I6okWTR,Tc6BXZs,qL6coai,98piDhG">http://imgur.com/I6okWTR,Tc6BXZs,qL6coai,98piDhG</a><br><br>Decided to put Unix AND Campi Erbosi.

The first one isn't that good imo.<br>You should add buttons/levers (to the crafting tables) and make the entire ring out of crafting tables to avoid block placing.

@Spicy, I was gonna do that, but the game ended to fast :P I wasn't finished with EITHER defence.<br><br>@Cinnamon Thanks :D And on Campi Erbosi, I dont remember who it was but a mod came in and told the people to stop griefing the defence.

You are brilliant, you must be the first one here, after me who doesn't cover the monument. You should never cover it, you need a clear view of your monument and placing wood all over the place will never help, that's what many many players think.

You're welcome c: This is how&nbsp;I do it, I never cover the monument, I never use water, ladders or any other object like that. It has to be transparent. xD<br><br><a href="http://i.imgur.com/Db5yOlP.png" rel="nofollow">http://i.imgur.com/Db5yOlP.png</a>
