Tips to making a Gg defense that should hold out!<br><br>First, you're gonna need some gear and a friend or two. Strength in numbers.<br><br>The goal of making a good defense is to prevent the opposing team from breaking the monument (duh) but also not making them advance too close in which you are fighting three-four people within a hair.<br><br>To stop the enemy oppositions from advancing you kinda need to be a good bower, so they can't bridge too close.&nbsp;<br><br>Another way way people can come close to the monument is by skybriding and rushing hardcore. Some ways to prevent them are:&nbsp;<br><br>Use objects such as chests and crafting benches to prevent them from placing blocks. Now this can be evaded, by shift clicking and placing blocks, for rushers this is a pain in the booty. But for sky bridgers, not really. Another way to decrease their chance of placing a block is to place buttons on top of the benches. Now with 1.8, buttons can be placed on top and under blocks. Now instead of just needing to shift click, they need to also aim where they place their block, carefully not accidentally pressing the button.<br><br>Another way to stop ground rushers is to stop ground rushers is to use flowing water. Flowing water will act as an opposing force and be a pain to swim up while you are summoning an arrow storm on their heads. One downside with this strat is that if you snipe them off, they could catch this water spout and flow up without you noticing (implying that you are on a map with little land and large void.<br><br>This is the first part to the defense guide. +1 if you like!

That's because you can't build in the void on Wahiz

Why not have to fight 3-4 people when they're too close? More kills+more fun+could last longer.

<u>Part 3: Use your surroundings.</u><br><br>Pretty self explainitory. Use resources around you to help with your defenses. On the map with the mons called antenna and enrergy, there is a little house with obby surrounding a chest. Use the obby to give the monument you are defending a thick outer shell. And if you make it to the other teams's house, you can use their obbu.
