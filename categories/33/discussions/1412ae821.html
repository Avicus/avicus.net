Hey, <br><br>I've just started to realise how annoying void regions can be with maps. I used to be able to complete Arizona quickly through taking short cuts through the void before void regions were added. Almost all the maps have it now, and I just think that they should be removed. Void regions get rid of tactics and strategies. What do you guys/gals think?<br><br>My apologies for bad grammar, it's late.

That's because Arizona was DTM. It's CTW now, it's different.

In ctw it's bad to not have void regions. Imagine you are defending and suddenly someone just wall runs into your Woolroom and you can't do anything about it.

-1. that was the most annoying thing in game, when you cant properly defend. in arizona ctw, &nbsp;you couldnt defend in our own wool room only in the path to it, but if there was a shortcut that you couldnt defend there? annoying af, sorry but -1. i thnik every ctw map should have regions (sorry if you were talking in general, i was refering to ctw)

On some maps, there is a 1 block limit for wall walking, like Fissura. When I get hit off I usually place 2 MLG blocks and die because I landed on the second one, because of void regions. It's pretty darn stupid. So I recommend making the void regions at least 5 blocks thick, so you have enough to actually do something but not enough to build a bridge.

Fissure is a dtm map though and Arizona is a ctw. That makes a big difference as you can stop someone from getting the objective in dem but not in ctw.

It's really only CTW that has these void regions. Having two ways into the wool is a pain to defend.

CTW: Please no. Defending is already harder than everything else; I don't think we need to change anything.

The thing I don't like about the void regions is that you don't know where they are until you block glitch and by that point it is too late and you get punished

It will be obvious if the block glitch is accidental or on purpose. Sometimes mods get it wrong, I have seen before.

That's the same thing as removing the region completely.

actually, having void regions where you cant place blocks and stuff is what adds to strategy and teamwork that is needed to be able to win the match. having control is key, which comes from better strategics. IMO its better with the void regions

lol are you mad. don't get rid of void regions keep them. just because you can't use the void to get into other people's bases that doesn't mean you get rid of them. that just forces you to be more logical and play smart on the ground or perhaps make a skybridge. keep void regions and make it so that when you place a block it disappears automatically because i remember when people try block glitching they can quickly get back up because there is a 2 second delay on the block so devs try get rid of that pl0x
