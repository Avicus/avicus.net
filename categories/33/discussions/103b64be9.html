Hey guys<br><br>So it's been almost a month since Avicore came out (1 more day :P), and after trying out some of the new Avicore maps, and the McZone maps that I didn't get a chance to play earlier, I've come up with a list of tips to help you get the monument. Yeah, I made a similar post on the old forums, but not with the new maps. Enjoy!<br><br><b>The number next to the map name is the shortest bridging distance to the monuments, if you bridge straight<br><br>Some maps require what I call jump bridging, don't know if there's a name for it. Basically, you jump while bridging in a stair-like fashion. This allows you to go upwards while still bridging.<br><br>Wall sprinting is the art of clutching to the side of a map. Then sprint and jump while placing blocks under you. The angle that you view the wall at determines if you will ascend, descend, or stay level.<br></b><br><b></b>*You have to jump to monuments<br>**Jump bridging<br>***Distance is from monument to monument<br><br><b><i>Senex (24) -</i></b><br>- Convert sandstone to smooth sandstone<br>- Get on top of their soawn<br>- Bridge from their iron place<br><br><b><i>Senex 2 (27) -</i></b><br>- Bridge on the first level to the other team's base<br>- Once you're close, stack up and rush on the top<br>- Bridge to monuments from the first level<br><br><b><i>Quintus (20***) -</i></b><br>- Bridge as many monuments as you can if nobody sees you<br>- Break all of them at once<br>- Don't get shot<br><br><b><i>Ternio (17) -</i></b><br>- Bridge first, this is important because if you wait, the bow spammers will start shooting<br>- Get on top of their iron<br>- Jump 3 blocks down before bridging, this makes it hard for people to see you<br><br><b><i>Mystic -</i></b><br>- Don't get iron stuff or anything<br>- Rush to monuments immediately<br>- Red is easier than blue IMO<br><br><b><i>Castle Adventure (3*) -</i></b><br>- Get punch stuff if you can<br>- Get gold feather falling boots if you can<br>- Get to the overpass above the monuments<br>- Eat a golden apple for the absorption, otherwise you'd die<br>- <b>Drop</b> down to the monument,&nbsp;<b>do not jump!</b><br>- Bridge to other monument first<br><br><b><i>Luar (used to be 30, now i think it's 24?) -</i></b><br>- Get 3 diamond blocks if you can<br>- Get 3 iron blocks also<br>- Skybridge like 64 blocks up or until they can't shoot you<br>- Use minecarts or boats to get down<br><br><b><i>Halcyon (idk) -</i></b><br>- Get to the top of their spawn<br>- Bridge to the monuments from there<br><br><b><i>Teres -</i></b><br>- Rush immediately<br>- Top of back monument if they're defending<br><br><b><i>Dust Devils -</i></b><br>- You basically just rush...<br>- If they are defending, try going from the top or tunneling from the bottom<br><br><b><i>Rendezvous -</i></b><br>- Rush and bridge first, before bow spam starts<br>- Sprint to monuments<br>- If an iron guy chases you, clutch to the side of the wall and hide until they leave<br><br><b><i>Rendezvous 3 -</i></b><br>- Rush to the left/right side of your team's side of the map<br>- Pillar up to the roof thing (supported by cobblestone fences) and pillar to the other team's roof thing<br>- When the coast is clear (or when you feel like it) jump down and either:<br>1.) Get under their iron supply (it should be hollow) or...<br>2.) Wall jump on the side of their iron and wallsprint, or...<br>3.) Pillar on top of their iron and go from there<br>- Once you reach the monument side of their base, simply rush to the monuments<br>- Eliminate any guards if necessary<br>- Cover yourself as needed<br><br><i><b>Volcano -</b></i><br>- Rush on top of the volcano<br>- Tunnel if you are Human<br>- Stack up and dig in if you are Alien<br><br><b><i>Rigor Mortis -</i></b><br>- Rush out of spawn and into the woods (left/right side of spawn)<br>- Get to the side of/behind the other team's spawn<br>- Watch for defenders or people noticing you. If there are no defenders, simply pillar up the side and break. If there are, you may have to break it from the roof of the bell tower.<br><br><b><i>Venomous** -</i></b><br>- Use the jump bridging technique<br>- Get the right monument first, then left, then center<br>- Commit suicide after breaking a monument, it is easier than bridging to another one<br>- If you're lime, you could get on top of their spawn and bridge to middle<br><br><b><i>Decay** -</i></b><br>- Bridge from the top of the center mushroom<br>- Get on top of their brown mushroom<br>- Wait for defenders to bridge to their monuments<br>- Shoot them off<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -or-<br>- Jump bridge to their monument<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -or-<br>- Clutch to the side of their island thingy and bridge secretly to monuments, then stack up<br>- Do not try to tunnel this map, its gonna take a few years :P<br>- Clutch t<br><br><b><i>Frostbite -</i></b><br>- Bridge first, don't go for diamonds yet<br>- After they shoot you off, wait for them to bridge and shoot them off<br>- Get diamonds and rush<br><br><b><i>Divines -</i></b><br>- Get like 3 potions of health<br>- Rush on the wall surrounding the map, rarely will anyone be there<br><br><b><i>Campi Erbosi -</i></b><br>- Rush to the center bridge<br>- Try to get on the elevated sides of the bridge, and rush if you manage to reach the other team's side<br>- Wall jump if necessary, or go on the treetops<br>- When you arrive at the monument, cover yourself as much as possible (you'll need it) and break both monuments<br><br><b><i>Broken ages** -</i></b><br>- If you can't rush, bridge from your front tree to their from tree<br>- Use glass so there's no shadow<br>- Use jump bridging to get to their monument<br><br><b><i>Unix (4*) -</i></b><br>- Get on the tree by their monument<br>- Stack up 3 blocks and bridge 4 blocks<br>- You should be able to jump to the monument<br><br><b><i>Formorgar (0*) -</i></b><br>- Get on top of the place next to the monument<br>- Jump directly to the monument<br>- Jump to their spawn after that<br>- Jump to other monument<br><br><b><i>Abandoned Park -</i></b><br>- Pillar over your team's wall<br>- Go the side of the center stream<br>- Pillar over the other team's wall and break F-Right/Left first<br>- Run on top of the wall and break all the rest<br>If someone spots you:<br>- Hide underground/inside the wall until you decide it's safe. Sometimes if it's an opponent in iron or diamond, I'll wall jump and hide.<br>- Keep running<br>- Encounter them and fight (not recommended against tougher opponents, unless you have no choice)<br>- If you get a monument and you think someone is coming to get you, hide under the monument til they leave or just rush to the next monument :)<br><br><b><i>Wonderland (idk) -</i></b><br>- Get on top of their castle thingy<br>- Try to bridge all three monuments if you can<br>- Don't bridge all the way; you can jump<br><br><b><i>Sandstorm -<br></i></b>- Get iron armor in case you get into any PVP situations on the way there <br>- Remember to have sandstone somewhere in your inventory<br>- Sprint-jump all the way to the other team's side while sticking close to the mountains around the border of the map<br>- Get as close as you can to the other team's spawn (usually about 10-20 blocks away from the sand stairs they come across if they walk straight out of spawn)<br>- Find a sandstone block on the ground and dig it out, then replace the sandstone above you and dig 20 or so blocks down<br>- Tunnel all the way to the back of the map where it gets cut of into the void, behind the opposing team's spawn and make a &nbsp;bridge on the wall <br>- Then, once you get behind their spawn, pillar up<br>- Finally, go under in the place where there's a little pocket of air under the monument and mine it from there. Have fun!<br><br>Oh, and&nbsp;<b>always</b> take off your colored armor, except in Halycon, which you should also take off the iron leggings. Nobody wants iron diapers right?<br><br>I know there are some maps I missed, because I'm not familiar with all the maps yet. I'll update this list as we go along and more maps are added. If you want to request a map, leave it in the comments. If you have any tips, tell me and I'll add them.<br><br>Of course I'm not gonna reveal all my secrets on here, but these tips should be decent enough to get quite a few monuments<br><br>If anyone can tell me the exact distance to monuments for the maps i missed, that'd be great

Just a question, can someone give me a complete definition of this "wall" stuff? Things like wall jumping, wall walking, wall sprinting, etc. I know it involves placing blocks on walls and stuff, and I think I know what most of them mean, but I wanna make sure :P

And wall jump is where you jump off an edge and place a block on the wall under so you don't fall to your death, right?

Thanks so much for the tips!
