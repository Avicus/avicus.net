Too many complicated maps in Walls

(Walls) Let me say that the new maps are very intricate, they are works of art.&nbsp; The problem is that they are too complex that a person just starting out gets lost and feels overwhelmed as people rush around grabbing one of the dozens of chests.&nbsp; Heck, I get lost on the new maps.<br><br>It is 9:40 CDT, or 7:40 PDT.&nbsp; Prime time for people on the west coast (and MDT) to be playing, but NOBODY is playing Walls.&nbsp; I can tell you with great confidence that before the new maps were introduced there would be at least 20 people playing Walls at this time.<br><br>Summary:<br>Old maps:&nbsp; 20 players<br>New maps: 0 players<br><br>While you're at it, fire is still not working right.&nbsp; Please fix fire so that (1) fire spreads, and (2) flint &amp; steel works again.<br><br>Suggestions:&nbsp; Reduce the emphasis on grabbing diamonds.&nbsp; Reduce the number of chests, a person with iron armor should have a chance at wall drop.&nbsp; Reduce the number of chests - too many powerful items in them.&nbsp; Fix fire so that it spreads.&nbsp; Fix flint &amp; steel.&nbsp; Increase the frequency of the Tetris maps on the rotation, people know those maps since the subsurface is the same on each (great idea by the way).&nbsp; Maybe put the jungle and/or walls maps back into the rotation...<br><br>Thx.

What is the exact purpose of this<br><br><b>Edit:&nbsp;</b>^ That was before "Suggestions:" were added.<br>I'll start by pointing out people have started school so you'll rarely see anyone playing at night anymore unless it's weekend.<br>Walls and Jungle maps have been removed and will not be brought back under any circumstances (or atleast I don't want them back).<br>Tetris maps rotate quite frequently as there are four of them, so it shouldn't be hard to find them (by the way you cannot add rotation frequency to any maps).<br>I don't see what's wrong with new maps, I do agree players should limit the amount of stuff they put on chests and balance the amount of ores in underground areas, however there's nothing bad in having new, complex maps that have tricky gameplay in order to have variety. New players will get lost on&nbsp;<b>any</b> new map they play on. Just think of it as a new adventure, a land full of mysteries you have yet to explore. You aren't by yourself also, you can try interacting with your teammates or playing Walls with your friends, that way the feeling should be better.

To attempt to get you to decrease the frequency of the new maps in the rotation and to increase the frequency of the tetris maps and possibly bring back jungle/walls maps.<br><br>It is now 10 pm central time, there used to be three or four walls games going.&nbsp; Now there are zero.&nbsp; How do you interpret this data?

Nah, I think that less players are playing walls now (as well as other gamemodes) because of school.<br><br>I remember that when the avicore update came out and new maps were added to the walls, I refrained from playing them because they were all new and confusing and I didnt know them well, but as the time passed I got to know them better and now some of them are my favorites maps. What Im saying is that you should give a chance to the new map, and with time youll know them better.<br>Also, I personally love complicated maps because I think it makes more gameplay posiibilities, and that it's always excited ti learn new secrets about a map.

First,&nbsp;<br><br>ill agree to one point about one map. Lost island was a little big and deep, so that has been corrected. The other maps have less diamonds than &nbsp;other walls maps, but I am yet to be on any of the maps and have people say they don't like them, in fact most people really like the new maps..<br><br>Please also remember that the larger map, knights tower is meant to be played by lots of players, not 2-3. And I have been told many times that it is a favorite map of a few long time players. Blue cove is another map people seem to really like , surly you can't think that map is complicated...<br>&nbsp;As for the maps not being easy to figure out, I do not agree... Just have to play it...I do agree on one point , with the amout of players, it's had to get games, but that is across the board, all the game modes have fewer players... Nexus is a join anytime game so it is going to have a few players &nbsp;because if there are not enough players for walls and you dislike nebula - that's your choice... Although it had less players than walls at 8:30pm yesterday....in closing, it's not the maps, it's the timing.

As someone who does play walls I think most of the new maps add a new twist too walls. I agree they are different in the sense they are bigger (or it seems like it) but that is a good thing! Also school is a killer..

Tonight there were good crowds on the Walls maps well into the night.<br><br>The slowness during the week must have been because of school, though I would not mind the return of simpler maps but this is a personal preference.&nbsp; Simple, complicated, doesn't really matter as long as people play.&nbsp; That was my beef earlier, that nobody was on but again it was probably just because school had just started for a lot of players.<br><br>And for what it is worth I love the concept of the Tetris maps, where the underground is basically the same but with different surfaces.&nbsp; Lets people "learn" the maps and still have variety.&nbsp; I wouldn't mind seeing some more tetris maps added to the rotation.<br><br>By the way, fire still does not spread correctly.&nbsp; Thanks for looking into this.
