I'm just wondering when Avicus will switch to 1.8 because most servers out there have switched. Is anyone working on this already?

I find 1.8 somewhat unstable and not very fun to play with. When Mojang re-created the engine system, they did a pretty sloppy job of replicating everything - there's so much unneeded garbage in the code that it lags up the game.<br><br>I'm pretty sure there are plans to move up to 1.8, though. It will take a long time, however.

In addition, I'd like to mention that there are no Minecraft server APIs, as far as I know, that have updated to 1.8 that aren't incredibly buggy. Most of the servers out there that have updated are Vanilla. Bukkit's been busy with the whole DMCA takedown scenario and Sponge, a new API to replace Bukkit, is expected to come out in November.

1.8 is very good. You guys just need to follow Upsoar's fps guide it actually works! I would vote for 1.8 to come. And for the bugs. Its a new version THERE ARE GOING TO BE BUGS...

Servers (ocn, etc.) are not updated to 1.8<br><br>They are running a 1.7 version that supports people running 1.8 to join but the server it self is still 1.7.<br><br>And due to the DMCA stuff that happened with Bukkit and Spigot there might not be a 1.8 that will support plugins, or at least not soon.

"And

not be a 1.8 that will support plugins, or at least not soon.



"<br>Barely any big/medium servers have updated to 1.8. Some of the big servers are 1.9 compatible, but not 1.8. In order for this to happen, the legal issues have to be sorted out, like matic said. ^-^<br>And... 1.8 is worse than 1.7 imo.

at least Minecraft won't have to run off Java since Microsoft owns the game, which means more FPS I guess?&nbsp;(as I heard off, correct me if I am wrong)

As many have mentioned, yes bukkit has not been updated for 1.8 as of yet:<br><a rel="nofollow" href="https://storify.com/lukegb/the-tale-of-bukkit-for-minecraft-1-8">https://storify.com/lukegb/the-tale-of-bukkit-for-minecraft-1-8</a><br><br>So no Bukkit servers have been updated for 1.8 to my knowledge. The reason that you can join these servers on a 1.8 version of minecraft is because of the Handshake packet. The Handshake packet gives the server the version of minecraft the player is on. The server then compares it's version of Minecraft to the client's handshake's version.<br><br>To get this "1.8" effect you can simply modify the Handshake code. But if you go on a so called "1.8" bukkit server, you will find that no 1.8 blocks work and no features from 1.8 work on the server.
