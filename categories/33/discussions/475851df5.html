So, lately i've been wondering if i should buy a second screen or not and (i mean, im okay with just one but), as i see a bunch of people here have two, i'll ask:<br><br>What do you use it for?<br><br>Is it really worth it buying another one?<br><br>What are the good things on having two monitors?<br><br>What's a good monitor?<br><span><br>Has it changed anything since you got it?<br><br></span>

What do you use it for?<br>Usually people have a main, and a secondary, this can be used for anything, music, streaming chat, fourms, its just something to prevent clutter.<br><br>Is it really worth it buying another one?<br>Well it depends, if you use a lot of programs at once,listen to music a lot or other "lighter" things then yes, but if you usually run only 3 programs and rarely want to listen to music then its not.<br><br>What are the good things on having two monitors?<br><br>Preventing clutter, looking cool<br><br>What's a good monitor?<br><br>Hmm, Asus have good monitors, but I'm fine with my LG<br><span><br>Has it changed anything since you got it?<br><br>I don't have one, but for me it wouldn't cause I rarely have more than 4 programs open.</span>

I have a second monitor, so I'll answer these.<br><br>What do you use it for?<br><i>I use my second monitor to keep an eye on forums, Skype calls, TS, and other programs, it's a real help.</i><br><br>Is it really worth it buying another one?<br><i>If you have the budget, totally! I couldn't live without one, but I can't say the same about others.</i><br><br>What are the good things on having two monitors?<br><i>It helps you keep an eye on everything that's going on, and just more efficient in general.</i><br><br>What's a good monitor?<br><i>I personally use the Acer S231HL, but it's a little expensive and it's also 1080p. If you're on a sharp budget, get a 720p monitor and it works just fine.</i><br><span><br>Has it changed anything since you got it?&nbsp;<i><br>Definately! It has by far changed my efficiency and ability to keep things in track, in progress, and on time.<br></i><br><br><b>Hope this helped!</b><br><br><br></span>
