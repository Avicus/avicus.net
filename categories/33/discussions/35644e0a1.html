Whenever I'm defending I always ask myself whether to use Pressure Plates or Wooden Slabs. They share a similar purpose, yet I'm torn on which one is better. They both have their pros and cons<b>.<br><br></b>Pressure plates make noise when someone walks on them; this can alert you if someone has reached the monument.<br><br>Wooden slabs take longer to break than pressure plates (I think,) are more efficient to craft (I think?) and look almost identical to regular wooden blocks, which can confuse the person trying to break the monument.<br><br>What do you think?<br><b></b>

Slabs, make sure to use wood. Reason being is that they take longer to break and harder for the enemy to see that there are slabs thus giving you time to kill them in the confusion.

I use pressure plates because they use less wood and u don't need a crafting table for them

Another good trick is to destroy the whole floor of the mon ( until you reach bedrock ) the cover th top with fences, &nbsp;one wrong step and they'll fall onto the bedrock, far away from the mon. To protect yourself from falling into your own trap, add a little platform connected to the mon, made of glass. Cover the outside in fences so you don't fall down.<br>Follow all these steps and your duty as defender will be forfilled!

Depends. Pressure plates are easier to break, but near impossible to place on. But, slabs are harder to break but easier to place on.<br><br>We all know the best strategy is covering the monument with wood.

Pressure plates, slabs are easier for the enemy to maneuver on and place blocks to their advantage.<br><br>for those saying it's quicker to break, if you're a good defender you should be in a hard to get place bow spamming the enemy so they don't have time to break any block unless it's an instabreak

Wooden slabs are 4 times more efficient to craft, by the way, so if you're low on wood and don't have anyone you trust to give your stuff and suicide, wooden slabs are the way to go. Also, I'd have pressure plates on the run-way to the monument so you can hear them coming and prepare and then have half-slabs near the monument so they have to break the wooden slab to be able to tower up. Well, they could always just break the pressure plate and make a path from there to the monument area, but I don't think they'd be thinking very much ahead if they were in lots of pressure.

Yeah, the worst thing you can do is place tons of crafting tables as the floor on the run way to the monument and then put lots of random water so they'd get pushed back. They couldn't block-sprint-jump because they'd keep on activating the crafting table and it would take forever to just run because of all the water &gt;:3

You can easily block spam over slabs, levers are the best IMO because they take longer to break but they can be taken out with water so its best for maps with no water

Wood isn't a problem at all on most maps, you can even suicide to get more wood

Just be carful when placing water, it may run down the sides, letting enemies to climb up it. otherwise, great suggestion !

When you defend, you should <i>never</i> cover your monument with wood or any block that's not transparent or easy to look through.&nbsp; You should <i>never</i> use water either, there's always some players who bridge up in the sky and <i>water will prevent them from taking fall damage</i>. If you are playing on a map where you don't start with a regular axe, you should use wood slabs, not every one will think of crafting an axe when crafting the armor. <br><br>If you want to overdo your defence around the monument, you should do something like this. Don't forget the wood slabs above, I hadn't time adding it. Lol c: <br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Db5yOlP.png" alt="">

I always use a mixture of slabs and plates, and also signs, buttons, ladders, and levers. If you throw a ton of them around, it makes it really hard for other people to get to the monument.
