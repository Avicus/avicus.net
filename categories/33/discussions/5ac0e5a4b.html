So...poseidon has become the new op kit in walls since the new release.<br><br>Before players would complain about barbarian being too op because it added more strength. It was op and wasn't even the highest level kit you could get.<br><br>But now...barbarian is the highest level kit&nbsp; (44), but it's properties have changed.&nbsp; It doesn't become active until you kill someone.&nbsp; This is a disadvantage since before I would use it to kill a diamond person while being iron.&nbsp; Now my kit is useless until I kill someone.&nbsp; But that was the whole point to dominate on the first kill when running into the middle.<br><br>And now poseidon, a mid-level kit (14), has the regen properties where your hearts regen pretty rapidly while in combat.&nbsp; As long as you're in water you are regenerating hearts.&nbsp; This is a complete advantage.&nbsp; So now everyone is spilling water buckets around the maps and pvping in water!!!<br><br>Noboby uses barbarian anymore...now poseidon is the new op kit.<br><br>Please bring the old barbarian back so we can fight poseidon.<br>Thanks for listening. :)<br>

Counters to Poseidon:<br><br><ul><li>Pick up their water in a water bucket</li><li>Block their water off</li><li>Sprint-crit them out of their water</li><li>Dump lava on the source block</li><li>Ignore them and get the middle</li><li>Use another kit ability, ex: stomper them or combo them on horseback</li></ul><br>

Many of the new maps have multiple water sources.<br>Besides their own bucket of water, they have the ponds, swamps, fountains, and ice in middle.&nbsp; I would spend the whole game blocking up the water.<br><br>Plus, punch bows and even the flame bow do zero damage when they are in water.&nbsp; The regen is super quick.<br><br>But...I will try those tactics.&nbsp; Thanks.<br>

Holy cow - I was standing in a pond, kit Poseidon, fighting somebody else who was kit Poseidon.<br><br>He was banging away at me with a diamond sword, no damage.&nbsp; I assume I wasn't damaging him either.&nbsp; Eventually somebody else came up from behind me and knocked me out of the pond and I quickly died.<br><br>Anyway, point is that kit Poseidon is way too powerful for this game.<br><br>As long as we're talking about Walls - one of the maps had 15 minutes before wall drop.&nbsp; Way too long, I don't want to run around for 15 minutes for wall drop.&nbsp; I say make all of the maps 5 minutes to wall drop.&nbsp; If not, then ten minutes max.<br>

lol armored!<br>I've had those battles too! They go on for 5 minutes of more just hacking away at each other until everyone's armor breaks.<br><br>I like the longer time periods to get ready.&nbsp; In fact, I'd like to increase all the maps to 15 minutes, so I don't feel so rushed! I move slowly.<br><br>Actually, I just had and idea.&nbsp; What if the time was random for each map and sometimes it's 5 minutes, 10 minutes, or 15 minutes.&nbsp; You wouldn't know until you get dropped at your spawn point at the beginning of the game when they make that announcement like "You have 5 minutes to get prepared for battle".&nbsp; <br>Would that be hard to code?<br>
