stalemating sucks!!<br><br>to prevent it just make the obsidian become easier to break like morph the block like on ocn which makes it easier to break&nbsp;<br><br>Oby: start<br>Beacon 10 mins<br>Coal block 20 mins<br>Gold 35 mins<br>Ice 50 mins

This has been suggested before. And the reason of stalemates most of the time is not because of how long it takes to break the obsidian, that's only a very small factor.<br>Most of the time when stalemates happen, it's because either:<br>1. People are bow spamming like they're life will die without doing it.<br>2. There is one monument left and half the team is defending that one monument while the opposition is attacking 1 by 1 making it near to impossible to actually make it to the monument.<br><br>There really is no fix to stalemate, it's just on how the players in the game decide to play.

OOooo this would be cool. Though 10 mins seems too early to have a monument mode.

I don't think it's necessary, it's fine at the moment with obsidian since stalemate adds more strategy to the game, especially on maps like Clay Wars.

In my opinion a good idea, just the times need some tweaking. I'd say Ice after 1.5 hours and the rest somewhere in the middle :P<br>+1

Or, just have a different block as the monument..... If i remember correctly, Atlas will allow that.

Their cores change modes not mons, also they aren't the only server with blocks that can become something else. :P

It's hard to prevent stalemates without stealing OCN's idea. So what'd I'd do is focus on making stalemates fun. Idk how, but there are people on this server creative enough to find a way.

Hmm what if you instead of turning the monuments into different blocks&nbsp;<b>make all the pickaxes more efficient&nbsp;</b>as time progresses.<br><br>Pickaxe efficiency increases every 10 minutes to prevent Stalemate

map making 101: always ensure that the map has flow&nbsp;<br>the items make no difference, trust me. The actual map itself needs to be dramatically changed<br><br>crescent chaos shows this perfectly, which is why there's a lot of circles - and it's barely stalemate

I still think it's a very Overcast thing to do.<br><br>Besides, it's not like stalemates are a constant problem on Avicus, it's not something that needs to be fixed.<br><br>And personally, I love long games. <br>It creates awesome moments and set pieces.

Agreed.<br>Long games are much more fun in my opinion.<br><br>Having a bunch of short games would get so boring.<br>In moderate amounts ( which is what's currently happening on the server) stalemate are fun.

IMO matters what map is being stalemated.<br><br>A map like Quintus or Ternio can be stalemated for a very long time and still be fun. A map like Campi can only be stalemated for a certain amount of time and maps like Ravanged aren't fun stalemates.
