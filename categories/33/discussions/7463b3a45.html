<span>Hello everyone, my name is Mateo I'm from Argentina and I wanted to make this post to talk about the moderators (or rank), I have a couple of questions.&nbsp;How can you become a moderator (or other rank)? How are moderators chosen? Sorry if I'm wrong about something I do not know much English.<br><br></span>

Yes. But you need a better grammar to apply decent, and...<br>Necesitás una mejor gramática, y las aplicaciones no abren hasta enero o febrero.<br>No hay problema en ayudarte. :D<br><br>PD: Necesitás buen ingles para la entrevista, así que preparate.

Do they not allow you to write your application in Spanish?<br>That's a bit silly.

Mirá, amigo.<br>Yo te lo explico. Uno empieza si es aceptado de staff, como Mod Jr., y si lo haces bien te ponen a moderador,&nbsp;y así...<br>Pero si querés ser gold, emerald o diamond necesitás pagar-donar al servidor en <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.avicus.com/shop">http://www.avicus.com/shop</a>&nbsp;.

You don't necessarily &nbsp;need "good english," but being fluent in the language would help you communicate more with the community, staff, and overall server.<br>Not to mention that the main player base speaks English, as well as the whole website being written in English. Of course, there are quite a few Spanish-speaking members, but I'm afraid if you have to resort to Google Translate to speak, it might be a bit hard on you.<br><br>If you think becoming moderator is too hard, you are definitely encouraged to continue playing on Avicus, and with the community!<br><br>(Sorry if you can't understand this, I don't speak Spanish myself.)

Also, he will need to speak English during the interview; that might be a problem.

He can use google traslator during interview! :P (I don't think so, but, who knows?!)<br>If they can understand and he sounds like a good person, why he doesn't will be accepted!<br><br>You have high chances, my loved friend.

I think Moderators don't care about the grammar, they just look at the answer each person makes and if they're good or not, so yeah..

If you want to get a rank like the gold, emerald or diamond ranks, you can either but it on the avicus shop or you could just keep voting and u might get it :3<br><br>The way of how to get Moderator is you have to apply for it xD

We require you to be able to write a fluent application, do an interview, and be able to speak English fluently in game.<br><br>This is because English is by far the most dominant language on Avicus, and you need to be able to communicate with others.

Yes being able to speak English fluently is required, but being bilingual would be a major bonus!

1) Study English and attempt to become a mod<br>2) Don't study English and just play on the server, have a good time<br>3) Find a Spanish language server that you enjoy and become a moderator&nbsp; and/or play there
