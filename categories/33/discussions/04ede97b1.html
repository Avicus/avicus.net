Hi my name is pianopete im sure you have seen me on the server as this server is my favorite. I have been with this server since December 19 2013 so i am not new to the server. When i first joind this server all i would use was a bow for everything close rage pvp to far range pvp all i would use is a bow. So i have gotten quite good with a bow but these past years i have realized i am trash with sword pvp. I could use any and all help ;however, there is a problem. Since i first played minecraft i have only ever used a laptop. that means no external mouse or keyboard. It is impossible for me to play with a mouse and external keyboard like most normal players. However i have gotten verry good at this setup. so before you offer tips please fit them to my play style i will explain how i play so you can offer tips.&nbsp;<br><br>1. to move my head i use my thumb on the builtin track pad on the lap top<br>2. to attack i use the 'A' key<br>3. to shift i use the 'S' key<br>4. to shoot a bow or use something i press the 'u' key<br>5.to jump i use space<br>6. my hotbar slots are the number keys at the top of my key board 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9.<br>&nbsp;7. i walk using the arrow keys&nbsp;<br>8. to run i double tap the up arrow key or hold down ctrl to auto run&nbsp;<br><br>i know my play style is so diffrent but i have become so conformed to it i could not play any other way<br><br>so now that you understand how i play do you have any tips on pvp?

While the other controls look ok, I really think you should get a mouse. Just try and get used to it, it will help in your playing greatly<br>And I use A for sneak and Shift for left strafe, so you're not the only different one

Thats pretty similar to my setup, the u key is decently far away from the rest of your controls, so if you can pvp with that thats quite impressive.<br><br>Stay a trackpad god, trackpads are best

Clicking and aiming are pretty hard with a trackpad, so just autoclick and use kill aura so that you dont have to do either!

I used to play like that, getting used to default controls with a rubbishy wired mouse isn't too hard.
