<b>Hello guys this forum post is about BlackSniper's ban,<br><br><br><br>I think he should be un- banned, I know I got him banned but he didn't intend to advertise. I think he&nbsp;should get one more chance maybe&nbsp;just&nbsp; temp-ban&nbsp;for a couple days or weeks but I do not think he should have been given this perm ban, PeachyYas I know I told you it&nbsp;wouldn't&nbsp;be right&nbsp;to let a&nbsp;temp-ban, But I think its true he should get another chance, the game wasn't&nbsp;even super popular it was like a 8 person game. He has also spent much time on the avicus network if you see in his profile 14 days!!! prestige 3 and a donor, if you see on his infractions he has only gotten kicks... this is his first ban, he supports avicus a lot and plays&nbsp;lots, Even if you don't think it's fair to let this slide, think about how you let my brother&nbsp;slide? this&nbsp;wouldn't&nbsp;be the first&nbsp;acceptation&nbsp;in bans,&nbsp;<br><br>Best regards, Cezbla<br><br><br>#GetBlackSniperUn-ban</b>

no, advertising is a ban and he shouldn't be unbanned just because he's your brother and is a donor/prestige. besides, any infractions at all is terrible to have in the first place. if he wants to appeal, have him email support@avicus.net. he was banned for a reason.

Advertising isn't okay. It's always sad to see forum regulars and active members being punished, but it gives them no excuse to be above the rules.

Advertising is advertising. In the rules it clearly states advertising is against the rules and you will be permanently banned if you do so. Nobody has received a kick for advertising.<br><br><b><b>EDIT: </b>D00ZiE was </b>banned for autoclicker. It was a small client side modification that give him a small PvP advantage. I believe he received a 2 week temp ban for it. In reality, that isn't very small compared to using something like kill aura where some moderators can punish them for a month.

D00ZiE waited out his punishment? <br><br>It's quite hypocritical of you to call Avicus out on favoring as you just asked for someone to be appealed since he was an active member of the community.

Stop comparing other people's punishments. It is pointless and is useless for an argument standpoint for getting someone else unbanned. He was banned for advertising. Leave it at that.

You are not listening at all and you are making random accusations about him just wanting to take the mod's side. You can still have friends as mod, but you are just simply being annoying putting all your "I-don't-know-what-i'm-talking-about" text in bold and underline. Remember, this makes him less of a chance to be unbanned.

If a player advertises on Avicus they will be permanently banned.He can make an appeal if he wants to be unbanned. Drop the subject. Arguing for his unban will do anything to help him. If anything, it will harm his chances.

Haha. Jozz said the server name, not the IP. What MC said; That's blatantly advertising, especially saying "badlion.net everyone".

What's the difference between saying badlion or badlion.net
</blockquote>
</div>
Badlion is a server name. Badlion.net is an IP which you connect in Minecraft to enter another server, followed by you telling everyone to join it.

Agreed, even though i don't think that blacksniper meant to advertise it in a "bad" way, but advertising is advertising.

I believe its worth a ban. <br>1. the rules state you cannot advertise<br>2, when you advertise it makes people wonder about that server you advertised<br>3. They will probably go there to check it out<br>4. If they like it better than avicus they will leave us<br><br>...<br><br>Its just a way to stop losing our community

If I am correct he will appeal, if he hasn't already. It seems to me that he might have a case, but he still needs to wait. In fact, making topics like this is only going to hurt his chances, so I suggest that you don't make any more. As for that, this topic is going no where and getting a bit out of hand, so I am going to lock it.

I'm not trying to be a moderator. I'm trying to tell you how it's wrong and why he should be punished.<br><br>If my closest friend got banned for a proper reason I wouldn't be happy. But I'd understand why he was and I would definitely not create a forum post and/or topic regarding his punishment.
