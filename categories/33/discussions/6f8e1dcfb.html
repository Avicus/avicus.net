So many rumors have been going around about a change in the donor perks, or user benefits changing.<br>I'm sure many others are wondering what is really happening, I have no clue, but if someone with authority, or insight could tell us whats happening on the first of august (tomorrow)that would be greatly appreciated.<br>thanks,<br>Dom

There's going to be a change in donator perks, not sure what else though. We'll have to wait and see.

No exp boost and no donor kits. For this server,&nbsp;<i>that's pretty much it.&nbsp;</i>Also I think you can't join full games. Not sure about that one.

The only way that would affect gameplay is team-stacking. But then again, I could be wrong :P

Your rank will be purely for aesthetics and fun, anything that gives a donator an advantage etc. premium kits or xp boosts in a kitted minigame (nebula may still have xp boost because it has no kits)<br>so all the gameplay changing aspects will be removed, they may be replaced with trails, pets or hats in the lobby.

Not necessarily.. If they let non-donors get the kits/exp boost but make it really hard then we can keep what we paid for.<br><br>Also no offense but I was really hoping for an official response from one of the Directors/Managers.

That's fine,<br>and they won't give non donors the xp boosts (possibly access to the kits though) but If they make it really hard for non donors it would count as a gameplay altering advantage so.. :/

Hypixel did it with their coin boosts that donors get and Mojang said it was okay.

The xp boost must go as it directly affects gameplay (pretty sure Mojang mentioned donator multipliers in one of their statements). It allows donators to unlock kits faster. The donator kits obviously will have to be dropped. I think Avicus will be relatively untouched, so yay. Just worried about other servers.

&nbsp;I hope they just make it so all the kits are free, but make pyro, assassin and freezer at higher &nbsp;lvls and maybe douse pyro a bit (pun intended)

We'll be making changes as stated before. It's not known when or what will be changing but we must be in accordance with the rules Mojang sets in place. We'll do whatever we can to keep everyone happy. A more official announcement will come soon and changes will come later this month or early next month.
