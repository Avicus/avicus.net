I was kit stomper and dropped about 120 blocks onto somebody... and I died (and they lived).<br><br>Is there an issue with kit stomper?<br><br>Also, fire still doesn't spread right.&nbsp; Can't burn down skybases with flint &amp; steel ;(

I don't think it is.<br>I recently was stomper and was knocked out of a skybase about 40 blocks up.&nbsp; I lost all hearts, but one.&nbsp; Maybe it has a little protection, but it definitely is not the same as before the update.<br><br>I would like old stomper kit back please.

Fall damage is the same, whether you have diamond armor or not, it doesn't change the fall damage number if your in full diamond, the only thing involving armor that effects it is Feather Falling

@ES: The post is about what the kit does, I posted it without armor so that no one would be confused. The kit alone with no armor , no feather falling etc is posted above. &nbsp;No armor and with armor without feather falling is the same result.
