Was out of the game for some time due to a Skype Virus sending all contacts messages with links in them that look completely innocent, it is a Google link with your Skype name in it, its a Trojan virus in total, it puts a key logger on your computer and yea... its kinda shit, but i got it off just now, just in the nick of time before it could do some permanent damage. If you guys have this type of virus, don't hesitate to contact me in the forum post, i know well how to deal with these now.

It would be much easier to link you a video since you do not know what this virus is.<br>here:&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EzwRGZfcfA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EzwRGZfcfA</a>

Honestly, the Virus spreads to well due to how well it is made, it uses a goo.gl link with your skype name in the link..&nbsp;<br>Example:&nbsp;hehe (Random Emoji) hi! have you seen this photo? <a rel="nofollow" href="http://goo.gl/(">http://goo.gl/(</a>Random characters will follow with your Skype name)<br>But for as many friends i have lost due to this Virus on skype, i would like to equally punch the creator in the face as many times.

No government agency's give a shit about any of this, all they care about is national threats with big time criminals, not some pesky virus.

I've had all of those and by the way no need to cap the W lol. But as I was saying, I dealt with all of these types of malware and then some, like Pupware and stuff like that.

True, the government does not give a shit about your stolen minecraft or Skype account. They will rather crack down murderers or other bad crimes.
