Sorry, that might've sounded mean to you..<br>I was saying he must've appealed as he realised he misses avicus more than he realised so got it appealed.

Or he made this thread to try get attention which would just piss me off it he did that. There are far more productive and positive ways of getting attention.&nbsp;<br><br>Apologises if this isn't true but if you (you being the OP) did appeal for an unban then that is what this looks like, to me at least.
