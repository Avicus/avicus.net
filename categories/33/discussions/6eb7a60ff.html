Two is my fave. It's really long and fun for defenders... until everyone starts crowding your monument and filling it with wood.<br><br>1 and 3 I just don't like for some reason.

Rendezvous 1 for me. Rendezvous 2 is a little big but it does give the Rendezvous feeling. Rendezvous 3 doesn't really feel like Rendezvous although I can understand why.

Rendezvous 1- Simple, original and generally good gameplay. Nothing more to add to this, it's a simple map after all ^~^<br><br>Rendezvous 2- Doesn't feel like a Rendezvous map, CTW will always be the most viable option if you want to make the most of this map.<br><br>Rendezvous 3- An aesthetically fine tuned Rendevous 1, still kept the originality of the first Rendezvous, added some bells and whistles here and there, also LOTS more iron (somewhat fixes the problem of players jumping off with all the iron).<br><br>Rendezvous 1 will always be my favorite map of the three.

Rendezvous 3, fun to play with more gameplay options like beacons. It looks nicer IMO and is more fun to rush and the extra levels in a map makes it much more fun :D

It used to be #2 when it was CTW... not anymore.
I have the most fun on Rendezvous 3, since when I get iron it's easier to kill the non-armor people xD but also because it's the most unique out of the 3, in terms of layout and design. I still enjoy #1 and #2, though.

All three are pretty good, but they all have their pros and cons.<br>Rendezvous 1 is a classic, and one of the best McZone maps.<br>Rendezvous 2 is huge, and it's pretty fun to play on, but sometimes it's too big.<br>Rendezvous 3 is fun, but feels more like a scrim map. It doesn't have a Rendezvous feel to it at all.

I love all of them; my favourite maps on Avicus (and Halcyon). However, if I really had to chose I guess Rendezvous 2 would do it for me. I like it stretches far out, but not loads of ground to walk on (there are kind of 'ringy' bits and spaces where you can fall into the void). Also I beliebe (yes you heard me, beliebe) that Rendezvous 2 was the original rendezvous when Avicus was McZone? Correct me if i'm wrong.
