Well, you get damage when you hit the ground with them.<br>It's the same technique you use with minecarts.<br>And yes it's hard to defend with people coming down with boats, but just one shot is enough to break the boat and let them die.

^ What Rylo said. The simple thing that you can do is just shoot the boat and let them die. It's like leading your target when they're running across a bridge.<br><br>Except they're going down.<br><br>I've killed many people this way.

You shoot them as they're falling. Just like you do when people are running across a bridge - lead your target.

why should it be nerfed .-. it's a legit tactic like everything else. Also they aren't too hard to defend against. Seems like you have to learn how to deal with them

No, it was before AoA. Punishers lost in the last 30 seconds because a Dopamine used a diagonal minecart from the skybridge to drop into the wool room and get a touch to win the game.
