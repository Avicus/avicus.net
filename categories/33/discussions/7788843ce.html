<b></b><b></b>I was playing today and I saw a group of 4-6 people doing something odd and remembered a similar post like this. This thread is meant to be funny and means no harm to those doing these strategies. Please post a screenshot or leave a storry telling us of the weird things you saw someone doing, or did yourself. Click <a href="file:///C:/Users/sharland/AppData/Roaming/.minecraft/screenshots/2016-03-13_15.10.00.png" rel="nofollow" title="Link: file:///C:/Users/sharland/AppData/Roaming/.minecraft/screenshots/2016-03-13_15.10.00.png">here</a> to see and example. If that didn't work, try <a href="https://gyazo.com/b9413f3b688694ec62cab56e313677f2" rel="nofollow" title="Link: https://gyazo.com/b9413f3b688694ec62cab56e313677f2">here</a>.

I don't think the example you showed is a strategy to do anything.<br>But shops are quite common.

Sometimes, the best strategies are the weird ones where nobody would expect it. If it works well it can actually win you the game. Just gotta be original and think outside of the box :)

Many people despise the <i>box defence </i>or the <i>fence cube </i>because it's a stereotypical type of a cheep defence built by an unexperienced defender, but it actually works really well in MegaScrims. You have to see defending as a method to <b></b><b></b><b><i></i></b><i></i><u>slow down the enemy</u> not to stop them from getting to the wool, once you've learnt that and you start to let your imagination flow in a private server you can build incredible, effective defences. Try it!

I remember a weird one, and I wish I could find the screenshots, but my team any the other team decided to build a roller coaster on the map and were cross teaming. I joined late and was like "WTF" and tried to destroy the monuments but both teams tried to stop me and asked me to leave. Rather I made a minecart and tried out the coaster, lol.

It was on Justice, and there was about 12 of us, and we made a decent defense, but we made like, 4 minecart tracks and had 3 people on each, and we just kinda circled the monument... Was fun gr8 banter
