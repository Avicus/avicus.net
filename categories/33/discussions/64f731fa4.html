Nebula Observations

</h1>
For some two or three years now I've observed and played Nebula which has always been my favorite constant on the server, &nbsp;I still miss the packed days of survival games but that's another story entirely, and in that time I've noticed a lot of various trends and approaches taken in the game. I could ramble on about the whole collective I've gathered from my observations, but currently I'm more curious about what other players and spectators have seen of the great monument breaking game.

I can't remember when it was I first went on the server all the years ago, but the first game I remember playing was the good ole nexus. Survival games is still my favorite of the old ones and I even remember when control the hill was still a popular thing. Best Nebula match I ever recall being in was on Quintis and it lasted for two or three hours. Had all the elements of a good battle and then some. Kind of sad how Nebula seems to be one of the few populated gamemodes these days.

I mean nebula isn't populated because the server isn't populated :p

well that's obvious ;p<br>but back a few years ago all of the games actually had at least one decent size server going. Might be lucky now a days to happen upon a group in nexus, control the hill, or one of the other forgotten relics, but times changed.<br><br>This has been something I have always been curious about though. I've heard that they have teams for some of the different games, but I don't think I've ever seen an actual cohesive team play in Nebula. That would be a sight to behold.

I'd believe it. Can't remember when it was, but thought recently they had updated the lobbies to one of the older models they had when I had first joined.

Ya it really brought back some good memories. So if you're a ref, or at least someone who has been around the server for awhile, do you know if they've ever had actual teams fighting in Nebula or just the usual variant of 'mob squad' as I like to call them. Always wondered what it'd be like to see an actual cohesive team in action.
