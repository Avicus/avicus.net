Wouldn't it be better to just have a section for appealing?

Well, it depends. Do you mean as in locating the place to appeal or much quicker to get unbanned/your appeal read by staff?

I do feel like there should be an appeal tab on the forums.&nbsp; Just like Staff Applications and Player Reports, only staff can read the threads ( obviously you will be able to read only what you post ).&nbsp; This will help those who don't have an email or can't access it.

I agree with the first one but the second option begs the question, how do can players verify that it is actually them registering?

There isn't any section to appeal your punishments as stated above.<br>The only way to appeal a ban or an infraction is by e-mailing support@avicus.net.<br><br>Thanks and have a good day ^-^

Well if they did register, great. They could use the tab on the forums.<br><br>However if they didn't, they'll have no option but to email support@avicus.net, if they wish to appeal.&nbsp;<br><br>I guess if that was implemented, there'd be some way to appeal, whether that be on the forums or through the email.

So just like the staff applications, but Sr. Staff can see them&nbsp;<b>all</b>, not mods, however regular players- if sent one in- can only see theirs and the responses on it, just like the staff applications, with [Denied] or [Accepted] then a message stating why and what to next.<br><br>Would you prefer that to emailing&nbsp;<b>support@avicus.net</b>?

I would say have a completely separate page on the website, something like avicus.net/appeal, not related to the forums. That way if users want to appeal but didn't register for the forums, they would still be able to do it. It would probably show up under the "admin" section of the website for senior staff, and moderators won't be able to view them. They'd also have to enter their email address and that's how the response, as well as any future communication, would be delivered. Just a thought.

I was just explaining a flaw in the system that he was suggesting. If you a player registered by any way that did not include in-game, there would be no way of proving that player is actually who they registered as.

Hmmm never heard of that problem. Try reloading/refreshing the page and see if that helps.

Most likely your browser didn't download the entire webpage, so reloading should fix it. Nobody else has gotten it so it probably isn't a server bug.
