<span>Not a long time ago UR_NOT_WORTH_IT and Evocal made a thread like this, but it was about Senex and rendezvous.<br>Now... I want to ask you all, which one is your favourite Justice map?<br>I'm already guessing which one... xD<br><br>Mine is Justice 3 :D<br><br>(if you have seen Evocal's thread you might notice a slight similarity... Hehehe mwahahaha) and no, it isn't the idea or title.</span>

I haven't played 3 yet, but...<br><br>Justice 1 was great (for me) because of the limited ground space, therefore I could abuse the Punch I bows and my aim to the most. It was great for kill farming, but it led to unbalanced gameplay. Still quite a good map, though.<br><br>Justice 2 was probably meant for sword fighting and larger team battles - there's a ton of space to strafe, place blocks, etc. I could see an all out war happening on this map. It's pretty awesome, and it still comes with the Punch I bows for crowd management, more consistent and rewarding bow shots, and so on.

Justice 3... Amazing OCN style gameplay... now avicus players need to learn how to play like ocn'ers and it will be good.

Justice 2 and 3, not a fan of the original Justice since it becomes stalemate-y, and you either have to be very sneaky or skybridge to the monuments (which I personally am not a fan of doing so when I'm not in the mood to :P)

Never played Justice 3, but out of 1 and 2, I'd have to say I like 2 more because one is quite stalematey and has a lot of spawn camping.. Despite this, they're both amazing maps :D

Justice 3 is great if you ask me. If you don't get diamond right away you can start from iron and be smart to eventually get full diamond (I did it already c:) Also, the monument placement and overall gameplay of the map is perfect.

Haven't played Justice 3 yet, but 1 and 2 both have their pros and cons.<br>Justice 1 is smaller, and its a good map for kills, but isn't easily rushed. The gameplay style feels kinda like Luar imo. I tend to just skybridge.<br>Justice 2 is huge, and feels more like a Rendezvous-style map. It's my favorite out of the three of them. It's easier to rush, but also great for getting kills. The monuments aren't that far away either.
