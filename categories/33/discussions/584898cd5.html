I'm sorry is that bad? it's just opinions and thoughts it is a forum thread with discussions not all discussions have to be significant do they? &nbsp;if so i could try to delete them all..? &nbsp;i mean I'm just posting and doing what i want basically if that's a problem I'm sorry, and i try my best following rules so i don't think i'm doing anything wrong.

If she has proposed a solution to her problem then this would have been fine. But honestly the only things people can post about this topic are "yeah me too!!" "Combat loggers suck!!". This is not a thread which can produce a discussion, henceforth it is spam.

well you don't have to see i mean others do so as well and i don't have to state anything I'm allowed to say what i want to say as long as it's not against the rules and i don't think it's useless if i'm telling people to stop maybe someone will get the point and stop and i know that isn't easy to get through to people but i did say "stop people" because someone has to stop. if it really bothers you just stop posting and replying you don't have to read each topics on forums no one is forcing you too :P

I don't think too many forum regulars are going to be combat loggers, most are randoms (randies) Who will probably only ever play once or twice and forget about the server, obviously there are few regulars who combat log, and the best way to get them punished is to ask a staff member to stalk them, or to record them in-game.

We know we'll have to deal with combat loggers. It's just that there are SO MANY, and we at least want less.

I read everything. I just told You to deal with it and record/report them (if you can of course). There is ALWAYS going to be combat loggers so learn to deal with them.

Ok look.<br><br>We can deal with these combat loggers by reporting, recording, and some plugin the devs can make and there are constant threads about it. There are going to be combat loggers everywhere no matter what. ITs not a perfect world. Thats why we just have to deal with them. We can prevent it by plugins and reporting but there are still gonna be combatl loggers/ rulebreakers.

For the past 2 weeks I have encountered 1 combat logger.<br>Only 1.<br>Also the rules do not state that completely useless topics arent allowed.<br>But it does state that things that are more personal/things people cannot discuss can be changed by a staff at any time.<br><br>I suggest changing the OP to something slihghtly more discussable.<br>As well as add some punctuations please.<br><br>Other than that have a nice day.

did you even read my post? I just said some solutions to it. What i mean is, even though we report them, record them, ban them, and plugin to help report these combat loggers, They are still going to be there. They are gonna pop out. There is no server that has 0 rulebreakers. This is not a perfect world. That's why we have to deal with it. There could be less rulebreakers, but they are still gonna pop out.
