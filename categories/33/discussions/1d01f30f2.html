Hello everyone,<br>I haven't played avicus for a while because I'm grounded but, a map I made has been accepted and I have no idea how it plays. Can you guys tell me how it plays because I haven't able to experience it personally. I will provide info about the map so you know what map I'm talking about.<br><b>Map Name:</b> Cetacea<br><b>Player Limit:</b> 40 players<br><b>Teams:</b> Blue whales vs. Orca Whales (Blue vs. Black)<br><b>Monuments: </b>6 on each side<br>Picture: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/2BuWj" rel="nofollow">http://imgur.com/a/2BuWj</a><br><br>Thank you guys! Some information I would like is how long does it take to get the 1st monument, how long does a match usually last, spawnkilling? Too hard/easy to get monument, Any errors in the map, etc.<br><br>I am not looking for feedback on how the map looks. Just how the gameplay is now. <br><br>Thanks!<br>-PokerFace_Legend

Well try to ask a mapdev via the map district thread and NOT skype. I think they already tested it and they can tell you more...

If a map gets accepted, then the mapdevs will test it and if the map is good enough for the rotations it will be added into them....<br>And how do we know how it is when you play it?

We just tested it in the mapdev server. It has pretty good gameplay overall, but the killfarm potential is greater than Quintus. Though, it is a bit flat in my opinion, but still pretty decent gameplay.

Haven't played it yet, but "Accepted" means the Map Devs will test it, not put it into the rotations.

"<span>Shown is 1 of the 12 monuments placed across the map."<br>"</span>12 monuments"<br>wat. I actually feel that due to how close each monument is to each other, games could end rather quickly. At the same time, because of the amount of monuments there are, that could even it out a bit. Even so, that's a lot of objective farming I see there. x3<br><br>Tl;dr, gameplay might be better with only 4 monuments on each side. I'm honestly not sure. :P<br><br>EDIT: OH, it was already accepted. Well, I guess we'll just await feedback then, since I've never played the map before. x3

LOL. I thought it was in the rotations. According to the Map District, it said it was accepted. I thought this meant it was put into rotations.
