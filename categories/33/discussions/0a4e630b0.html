Hey everyone! Today I tried to <u><b>Breezily Bridge</b></u>&nbsp;at single player mode. But as you know, that's really hard to do, while I'm studying on it, I realised that I can do it for 5 blocks. It took my 4 minutes to be able to bridge. There are things that I know about it:<br><ul><li>Never spam click! Click at the time.</li><li>Always keep pressing 's', but press 'a' and 'd' one by one.</li><li><u>Never</u> shift.</li></ul><br>But these informations are not enough to be good at Breezily Bridging. Can you guys tell me what do to please?<b></b>

You legit just practice, while clicking your mouse at the exact time. I try not to think of other things and just let is flop :P I got 11 blocks by doing that. You should spam "a" and "d" keys a lot! Like 5 a's and b's pressed in 1 second; if that is even possible to do :P

Borra to be honest I never want to learn to Breezily, it's kinda pointless other than making fast bridges. I would just learn to jitter bridge instead; if you can jitter.

I can Ninja and NinjaStyle and stairbridge without shifting. I might be jittering. But I think that there is not a big differences between ninja and breezily. But anyway, learning something extra and something better never makes me lose something :P
