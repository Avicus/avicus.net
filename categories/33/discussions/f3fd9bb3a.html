So im a little new here, but i have a question:<br>for example, in the map i think its called Luar or something like that, if you are in the others team iron to bridge from there to the Monument, are you allowed to kill people there who is trying to kill you or is it considered spawnkill?<br>Ty for helping<br><br><br>-tapetepatoMC :P

You are allowed to kill them no matter what.<br>However, if they are in their spawn, you cannot hit them unless they hit you first.<br>But if they leave the room in which they spawn, you are allowed to hit them first.

You're allowed to kill people if you're in the other team's iron, as you're defending yourself. You are not permitted to kill newly spawned players in the spawn building, however. As long as you are in their iron and actively seeking out the objective (not just killfarming newly-spawned players), then I don't see why you would not be allowed to do so.&nbsp;
