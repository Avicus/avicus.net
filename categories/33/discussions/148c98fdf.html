Jubby &amp; Mustard?&nbsp;came up with this idea a while back but it never got much feedback, then I sprinkled a few ideas in.<br><br><b>There are X amount of minutes. There is 1 Obsidian block in the middle of the map, both teams are trying to break it and bring it back to their base. Although, the game is not over yet. Within those X amount of minutes, the other team is able to try and steal the monument from the other team and bring it to their base.<br></b><b>Everyone will have Diamond Pickaxes (Eff IV).<br></b><b>If the block is lost or thrown in the void, it shall respawn in the middle of the map once again.<br></b><br><i>Any feedback or suggestions are much appreciated.</i>

+1 This is a brilliant idea, though there should be something that prevents a team from winning if a player from said team is holding the monument at the time. The teams should only win if the block is in its specified location in one base and not in an inventory.

No, but you have the right idea. Instead of monument placement (where the obsidian will be placed) I presume the "region" module would be called in a fair bit.

Not sure I said this already, but if the monument is dropped, it's coords will be broadcasted, and it's timed. If not picked up in time, it returns to its original position.
