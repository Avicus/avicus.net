All new maps being added to Nebula is just such a hassle to deal with, trying to learn all of them and how they are just much more frustrating than the old simple maps. Let me reiterate on this. I have learned the concept of good maps and why they are good and fun for us to play.&nbsp;<br><br><b>A:</b> <b>Small Maps</b><br>-Small maps are simple to get across to the battle unlike alot of other maps where you spend half the game running to the other side and end up being ambushed by people waiting to kill you, either way. Small maps are the key to having a pvp filled game and not wasting time to just run across the map half the game.<br><br><b>B: Big Detailed maps<br></b>-This one is simple. If you dont have such a beefy computer, the map will make you lag, Alot. i know this from past experience and even the Avicus lobby, the lobby is over done, something that was fixed when it was never broken. The old MCzone map theme was great, small, simple NOT LAGGY.<br><b><br>C: Learning new maps<br></b>As new maps are added exponentially it is harder to come across 2of the same maps in a day. this makes it difficult to learn the new maps and strategize&nbsp;on them to find the best ways to use them effectively to your advantage. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><br><br><br><b><br><br><br></b>

In relation to point C, really just time and practice on the map will solve your issue in relation to that. You just have to give the maps a chance and before long you might be playing on it like it's a McZone classic!

But on relation C maps, they usually conflict with A &amp; B
