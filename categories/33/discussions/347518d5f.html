Yo whats up guys, new to the forums, but kind of a from start of the server till now player of wallsmc.com<br>yea fun fact, you can use wallsmc.com as the ip is others doesn't work.<br><br>Back to topic, I was just wondering if Avicus can bring back ghost squads<br><br>&nbsp; For those who do not know what Ghost Squad is, Ghost squad is basicly 2 teams with the maximum of 4-6 players PER team and they all have Invisibility II<br>&nbsp; And the game goal is to eliminate every other team players.<br>&nbsp; In the map, there will be some random placements of pressure plates and some lamps which will show your position if you step on them<br>&nbsp; Another way to take them out, is to look for those slight particals of the potion effect.<br>&nbsp; There are also kits in the game which was brusier (starts with a wood sword that has maximum unbreaking and knockback I) Archer (has 8 arrows, with a unbreaking bow, arrows can be retrieved if missed, and you can pick up others arrows) Scout (speed I, knockback II, sharpness I stick) blaze (a blaze rod that has fire aspect I ONLY) Chemist (2 posion I pot, not extended, 3 insta damage I pot, 1 potion of slowness) Healer (5 insta health (I) potion, 2 regen I potion) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; basically it, and these are these are some ideas for kits<br>&nbsp;Tanker : Resistence I for the whole game, weakness I also, wooden sword with unbreaking

Seeing this was already done and didn't go very well, I don't see it happening as a crapton of the community disliked the game.<br>Soz -1<br><br>p.s. Welcome to the forums, where we talk about random things that probably half the time have nothing to do with the server :)
