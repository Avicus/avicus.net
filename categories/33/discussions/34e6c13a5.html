<i>Well I thought of this idea a few days ago and I am absolutely horrible at writing.......... but here I go.I loathe proofreading so don't be surprised about punctuation and grammar errors.</i><br><br><i><br></i>Ok, some people saying recently that they want an Avicus tournament and I thought of an idea for a tourney that is relatively easy to do. My idea is basically a Nexus Tournament. Now before you go "Luxe, that is sooooooooooo boring". Hear me out.<br><i><b></b><br><b></b></i><b>1.Overview</b><br>Now that you know its a Nexus Tournament let me tell you what the twist is. The twist is teams will choose their teams at the start of each match and to some extent(depending on how well they do it) deny their opposition from picking the team they. How exactly will this work I hear you ask? (That's right i'm psychic. :D) Well the choosing phase(thats what i'm calling it for now deal with it) will consist of two segements the&nbsp;<b>bans&nbsp;</b>and&nbsp;<b>picks</b>(shoutout to DotA 2).<br><i><br><b></b></i><b>2.Bans and Picks<br></b>The bans and picks (as stated above) will make up the choosing phase of the game. The banning part consists of three sub-parts and the picks is relatively straightforward.<br><br><b>Bans&nbsp;</b>- The three sub-sections of banning section is a) the class ban, b) the class save, c)the team ban. The class ban as it states basically consists of your captain(I will go into depth about what a captain is later, I promise.) banning out one class that neither his team nor the opposition will be able to use in the duration of the game. The class save is where the captain of your team chooses a class which is moot from ban from both his and the opposing team and the team ban is where your captain chooses a whole line-up which you cannot use.(Use this when your opponents are consistently playing on set of classes).<br><br><br><b>Picks&nbsp;</b>- Is the bread and butter of this whole idea. This is where teams will choose a line-up that they will play with for the duration of the game. Of course the teams cannot choose a class which has been banned and cannot use the same exact composition that has been team banned. Some rules in picking:<b></b>Only&nbsp;<b><u>one&nbsp;</u></b><u></u> barbarian in your team (if he hasn't been banned of course), <b>No&nbsp;donator kits&nbsp;</b>are allowed.<br><br>Formation of the choosing phase:<br><b><u>Banning Phase</u></b><br><b>30 seconds for each team</b><br>Team 1 - Class Save<br>Team 2 - Class Save<br><b>30 seconds for each team<br></b>Team 2 - Class Ban<br>Team 1 - Class Ban<br><b>45 seconds for each team<br></b>Team 1 - Team Ban<br>Team 2 - Team Ban<br><b>60 seconds for each team<br></b>Team 2 - Team Pick (Their whole line up)<br>Team 1 - Team Pick&nbsp;(Their whole line up)<br><br>Each subsection can be timed simply by a <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.online-stopwatch.com/chess-timer/">chess clock</a><br><br><b>3.The Games<br></b>After the picking phase is done the game will go ahead as normal nexus and the team with the highest score in the end will win. If the game is a tie there will be a tiebreak round where you have one life and the team who loses all their players first loses. This tiebreak round will only be played in the invitationals and not in the group stages. If a tie occurs in the group stage it will just be counted as a tie.<br><br><b>P.S I have not considered teams sizes but I think something like 5v5 ,7v7 or 9v9 would&nbsp;be optimal. Also take of the difference between games and matches. The match is a set of games. &nbsp;</b><br><br><b>4.The Captain<br></b>The captain is the leader of the team and will be the one who dictates the banning of certain classes and line-ups. The captain also will also dictate his teams line-up with the teams input of course. The captain also has the power to forfeit his team the game if he or the team believes the game is lost. The captain has to simply type 'GG' into chat and he will forfeit the game.<br><br><b>5.Format of the tournament<br></b>I want the tournament to have a group stage and a invitational stage where the top teams in their group play off in a single elimination where only one team will win. Don't ask about group sizes and how the invitationals will work I haven't thought about it yet. Also I want group stage matches to be best of one, the invitational matches to be best of 3 and the finals of the invitational to be best of 5.<br><br><b>6.Maps<br></b>To be thought about and added.&nbsp;<br><br><b>7.Summary<br></b>Thank you for reading this idea of mine. Please don't be afraid to ask questions and add ideas of your own to this. There will be no tl;dr to this as it took me 30 mins to write and it to take you 30 mins to read. :P. Cheers!&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b><br><br><br></b>

Awesssomeee Luxe<br>Love the Dota reference :P<br>Some ideas:<br>-The teams should be clans :3<br>-Each player should vote for a map&nbsp;<br>-If the game/tourney is a bit short maybe there could be three rounds instead of the one?

If you want more opinions, you should ask in ~12 hours, when the Americans are all awake.<br>Personally, I'd like to see it.

Well, a Canadian is already awake.<br><br>I can envision us doing some sort of Nexus tourney, but I do believe Ivy has quite a bit of coding to do with the new 1.8 update and is also quite busy with school, so a tourney might not happen in a long while.<br><br>Take it from the Staff themselves, "Still in the works."

I think that disallowing use of the donors kits is a bit random... Instead why not just let everyone use them for the duration of the tourney?

Ok, fair enough but I don't want pyro as there is a glitch where you are on fire after death which is annoying.
