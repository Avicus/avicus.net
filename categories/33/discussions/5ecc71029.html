We'll, I was stupid this summer. I did not follow rules and now I'm perm banned. Just before u staff lock this post. This is not an apeal this is a thank you. <br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Thank you WallsMC/McZone/Avicus for being the best server in the world. Thank u for making Jan 2013 - August 2014 the best ever. &nbsp;I have had so much fun playing your games for so long. This summer wasn't the best for me bcuz I was a bit rude. I insulted staff members, myself and players who I thought were annoying. I'm truly sorry<br>to the community. All you players who rush with me in nebula and pvp with me are nice friends. I wish u well. So Gg avicus Gg McZone and Gg walls mc.

okay, but I think you only do it to play here again. You already got two tempbans for&nbsp;Excessive Infractions and you didn't do anything to be better or not getting any infraction. Now this happen and you can't play here anymore. I hope this would help you to respect the rules of other servers. This sounds rood, but I hope you never ever gets unbanned. I really don't like such players like you (rulesbreakers).

He got in 2 months 3 pages of infractions. Two tempbans for&nbsp;Excessive Infractions and more than 10 infractions for Caps. Do you want a player on your server with such a page of infractions? If he learned from his mistakes, then he would stop after the first tempban or maybe after the second one, but he didn't. btw It's my opinion.

Seriously? He's not asking to be unbanned, he is complementing the server, and saying how great his time has been here. You have no reason to call him out ._.
