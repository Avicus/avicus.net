I recommend these to be changed immediately and fixed all of this is mostly nebula<br><br>1. Spawning Bug (Ruins k/d) this keeps making you spawn where you die<br><br><br>2. Amount of points you earn from mining the monument(Why only 1 point)<br><br><br>3. TDM being in nebula and not nexus when nexus is based off TDM(Another K/D ruiner)<br><br><br>4. Spanky Spade. Why raise it to 30 points??? It would be impossible to get without the monument points. I understand u raised it because it was op but why change it to KB 1 and not keep it 7 points. Who would buy that? It's now the worst tool to u can use. It used to be the rushers most valuable weapon. This is hard for rushers to get now<br><br><br>5. The amount of hackers. Why are there more then usual now<br><br><br>6(recommendation) you should be able to message mods anytime. When I see a hacker and a mod is here watching I don't want to ruin their cover when they spectate<br><br><br>7. Fire resistance. What map would you ever need that? The only map with any lava is Tectum.<br><br><br>If you have anything else to add put it bellow.<br><br>hopefully this will be changed and fixed.

1. So true. You mean when you die, and spawn again in the same place where you just died?<br>2. I get 13 with 2.5x XP, but I still think that's too little. It should be like 20 for regulars, and to disable objective farming (Going to empty servers and breaking monuments) Ivy can disable them getting XP, although it says they got it, when there is only you in the server, in the game.<br>3. Nebula isn't only DTM. That'll be boring then. Also, I don't see how it's a k/d ruiner. You kill like a boss, your good.<br>4. 30 points not alot. I got 30 in 1 game before. :L<br>5. I can see the anti-cheat ivy has put in. It's so annoying though. &gt;..&lt;<br>6. What do you mean message them...<br>7. I've seen this, wondering what's the point of this. I have no idea what Tectum is, and will probably never notice it. :D<br><br><br>-------<br>Stuff to fix maybe<br>1. Da bugs.<br>2. The bugs.<br>3. All the frkin bugs. That's it.

TDM is in Nebula and not in Nexus because Nexus isn't TDM but KitPVP.

1. What you said is correct&nbsp;<br><br>2. &nbsp;I didn't mean xp. I meant the amount of nebula shop points u obtain<br><br>3. I replied to TheCalined about that already<br><br>4. The rushers barely get 30 points including how u get 1 point for every monument and most rushers avoid getting killed therefore avoiding to get kills<br><br>5. &nbsp;Agree<br><br>6. &nbsp;By message it would be like /msg moderator are you watching the hacker. If you say it in normal chat wouldn't they just stop/leave<br><br>7. I would rather have strength then fire resist
