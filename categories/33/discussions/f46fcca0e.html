<b></b>You spawn on your each individual plane, and have to jump down while flying. Gather resources from randomly generated chests in your air balloons, then once you hit the ground fight everyone. You are only able to PvP once you hit ground. You spawn at Y: 256, and work your way down on each colored air balloon. You can only enter your own balloons.

Seems like a really good idea, but what if someone just camps in one of their balloons for the whole game?<br>Other than that, +1.

I have an idea that could make this better, You could make it so that you slowly fall through the air, and there are random floating chests here and there, there are also hot air balloons which appear for 15 seconds then disappear, they have better loot in them, and like you said, once you hit the ground, you pvp.<br>There can also be powerups, like the eye of ender can become "Ender Smash"<br>So that once you hit the ground, anyone in a 10 block radius loses 2 hearts.<br>Also a Sugar can make you move more swiftly sideways therefore giving you more opportunities in chests
