It would be stupid to ban for such a thing. It's a tactic that requires skill and therefore should be allowed. Me myself have tried to master it with no luck what so ever.

Basically there are two ways to butterfly click, most people do it the incorrect way, which they get no vibrations with and the hammer motion of the second tap gives extra, illegitimate clicks due to a bug on most mice. Though most people don't know the proper way, which gives you vibrations and gets you more clicks, legitimately. Due to this bug it is largely considered cheating and banable on servers such as Badlion and OCN from my understanding. Most anti-cheats pick up the improper butterfly as autoclicker.

I only use it for placing blocks fast.<br><br>I'm sure I'll get banned for auto clicking by G Cheat on Badlion though, or even OCN or here, if I'm on an alt.<br><br>I've been practicing it with normal clicking and my aim is bad af. I get around 10 cps compared to my 5 normally clicking, and when i get someone in a combo, it's pretty damn over powered. It's kind of like when you put an extremely low sensitivity on and jitterclick, only with your normal sensitivity. Unsurprisingly, the best mouse for illegitimate butterfly clicking, is the DeathAdder. Not only it has big buttons, but the clicks are incredibly light. I have it, and it's a lot easier than a normal mouse.

Exactly.<br><br>That's why it's hard to know if someone is jittering/butterflying or autoclicking.<br><br>You'd assume an alt with 40 kills placing 3 blocks above the ground while block spamming is autoclicking. You check if he's a regular on OCN, Kohi or even Badlion, and he hasn't, or has rarely, played on those servers. Instead of going through the trouble of contacting a Senior Mod, the usual Avicus staff member, at least a couple of months ago, bans the player for autoclicking. That's what happened to Splade. You probably already know this, but a lot of people don't.

By spectating him, yes. Don't quote me on this, but I have seen a video of someone identifying autoclicking and jitter clicking in 2 separate 1v1s. He was a spectator.

That may be true, but you&nbsp;are most likely to get the first hit and keep the combo with a higher cps. (Then again, aim and ping plays a role in this as well.)

Fair warning, if you just slap your mouse button and get no vibrations for butterfly and do it a lot, you will break your mouse in probs around 1-2months. I'll probably do a butterfly clicking + difference vid on my channel for those who don't understand. Splade broke his mouse doing it slightly too hard in about 2 months.

Gcheat picks it up as autoclicking, that's why its banned on badlion

Fair warning, if you just slap your mouse button and get no vibrations for butterfly and do it a lot, you will break your mouse in probs around 1-2months. I'll probably do a butterfly clicking + difference vid on my channel for those who don't understand. Splade broke his mouse doing it slightly too hard in about 2 months.

Butterfly clicking is just like jitter clicking. Most people I've seen using it get better CPS + combos, but there mouse breaks quite fast.

My Internet spikes a lot and I occasionally get around 300 ms. My CPS still helps me get better combos. I agree though, strafing is a lot more important.

Butterfly clicking is cheating as it adds extra clicks that <u>you did not do.</u> The way servers like Badlion and Kohi pick it up is by using their respective GCheat and AntiSkid, <u>not by moderators watching them.</u> If it's allowed here, whatever but let it be known that it is the equivalent of a Razer Synapse autoclicker.

I do 3 CPS, and can still get huge combos on people, in badlion or kohi. Especially, the ones that are better than me. If you can strafe well, use the right tactics, its easy. Not just CPS...

Good one, no you can't. If you had 3cps you wouldn't touch anyone who had arms to play minecraft with.
