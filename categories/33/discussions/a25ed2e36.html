</div>
The problems with adding UHC, from a previous UHC host:<br><br><ul><li>Auto Hosting UHCs are hard to moderate, and aren't easy to fix if something goes wrong</li><li>Hosted UHCs need hosts (If Avicus needs hosts, I'm straight down on that list)</li><li>It takes a lot of time to code</li></ul>I personally like the idea of non auto hosted UHCs, for example, you could apply to be a host and host matches once a week or something. This may not work because of the player amount on Avicus, buts its getting better.

Considering the best ping for sword pvp is 100-150, pingers as they're currently thought of (less than 20 ping) don't exist

Im going to have to disagree, Huahwi is right about the pingers part.<br><br>There are no such thing as pingers, since if your a good player you can beat one. For instance all you need to do is strafe. I get 12 ms and people easily beat me, but thats almost always because of 20 fps.<br><br>You can beat a pinger, you just need strats.<br><br>As to Huahwi, I think he does suck, all I need is 60 fps and Im fine.<br><br>His PC is 2 good lol.

glad to see a reply like this, yesterday, idk how or what but i had like 300 ping on average and i took out a 4v1 of another team w/ my bad ping (but for that sequence i was getting nice hit connection/reach while i was strafing) and the fact that 2 or 3 of them had like less than 100 or even less than 75 ping on average and had full iron-iron sword (got called a hacker by the last guy i killed in the 4v1 cuz i 11 hearted him cuz i got like a penta-hit towards the last succession of sword-hit-trades) then another 2 guys came after and i killed them as well w/ 7 or 8 hearts left.&nbsp;<br><br>Picture of stats page w/ the 4v1 then 2v1&nbsp;<a href="http://prntscr.com/72sqo2" title="Link: http://prntscr.com/72sqo2">http://prntscr.com/72sqo2</a>

Wow, nice!<br><br>There really isnt such thing as a pinger, because all ping has his advantages.<br><br>For instance Miguel uses his lag, which is like 400 ms, to get extra kb. Its also a lot easier for him to strafe because everyone sees him as a teleporting nub! xP<br><br>In my case, I get 14-24 ms, and I take advantage of it by practicing my strafes and kb tactics a lot. Also when my aim is good I can combo someone easily or get double crits.&nbsp;<br><br>All Im saying is different ping has his advantages.

and sometimes i dont need to rely on straight up pvp, i can play defensive and use a vanguard (strong morale point/chokepoint) to get kills like using basic traps like holes then a 1 block gap so i can kill them under, etc.

tbh high ping 200+ makes it harder to play. Playing pub OCN is no problem, but you'll notice how much harder it is with higher ping once you get to high level of play (ie. tournament invitationals)

glad to see a reply like this, yesterday, idk how or what but i had like 300 ping on average and i took out a 4v1 of another team w/ my bad ping (but for that sequence i was getting nice hit connection/reach while i was strafing) and the fact that 2 or 3 of them had like less than 100 or even less than 75 ping on average and had full iron-iron sword (got called a hacker by the last guy i killed in the 4v1 cuz i 11 hearted him cuz i got like a penta-hit towards the last succession of sword-hit-trades) then another 2 guys came after and i killed them as well w/ 7 or 8 hearts left.&nbsp;<br><br>Picture of stats page w/ the 4v1 then 2v1&nbsp;<a href="http://prntscr.com/72sqo2" title="Link: http://prntscr.com/72sqo2">http://prntscr.com/72sqo2</a>
