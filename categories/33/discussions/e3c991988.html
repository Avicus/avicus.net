Hello, everyone!<br><br>I sort of decided to make a small guide on how to improve your PvP skill. Its gonna be an easy explained guide for everyone, even if you are new to PvP, or considered a "pro" at PvP. I'm gonna mention a few tactics, and how to improve your PvP skill in general.<br><br>Now, lets get started:<br><br><b>Strafing:&nbsp;</b>Strafing is probably the best way to kill your opponent on open fields. Basically, the concept of strafing is to move around your enemy in multiple ways while dealing damage to him, while you take no/little damage yourself. It requires rapid movement, a good aim and fast clicking. Strafing is a tactic that takes lots or practice to learn, but once you got the hang of it, its deadly as … uh. Anyways...<br><ul><li><b>Jitter strafing:&nbsp;</b>Basically what you do is tapping <b>a</b> &amp; <b>d</b>&nbsp;(right and left button) while you move forward. If you have speed 2, move right and left, and click very fast, the combos on your opponent will be insane. With the 1.7 sprint key its an extremely deadly tactic. Spam your sprint key and keep the aim at your opponent. Of course, the most difficult thing about it may be to hold your aim at your opponent while strafing. The best way of mastering this is to practice. This is the type of strafe I prefer to use.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Circle strafing:&nbsp;</b>Probably the most popular strafe. Its very easy once you get used to it as well. What you do is circling around your enemy in a full circle (you don't say?). If you do if fast and keep your aim at the opponent, it will be very hard for the opponent to hit you. Also, this one is good for use against block hitters. When blocking is slows down your aim, which makes block hitters turn around slower than strafers. Block hitters are basically helpless against a good strafer.<br></li><li><b>Semi/half circle strafing:&nbsp;</b>Pretty obvious, you do a semi/half circle around your opponent. Once you've gone one way, you switch. This needs rapid and fast movements to keep your opponent away.&nbsp;<br></li><li><b>Variate your strafing's:&nbsp;</b>In a long fight, try to variate your strafing. For example, if you always go to the left with a circle strafe, your opponent will suddenly find out, and it will be easier for him to block you. Try some variation, sometimes go right, sometimes go left, do some half circles combined with jitter strafing. Be smart!<br></li></ul><b>Critical hits: </b>Critical hits causes more damage to your opponent. Not only to their health, but also to the armor they are wearing.To critical hit&nbsp;your opponent you jump in the air and hit him&nbsp;<b>while falling down!</b> Note that, you can't crit a person if you're going up, you have to be falling down.<br><ul><li><b>Groups:&nbsp;</b>Critting is very efficient and deadly while fighting in big groups. Just keep on holding space (your jump key) in and hit your opponents.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Do it from behind/the side:</b> I would suggest only use crits when the opponent isn't looking at you. Come from behind or from the side and start jump on them. If you do it while fighting, your opponent can easily hit you and knock you very far away.</li><li><b>If your opponent&nbsp;doesn't have a helmet:&nbsp;</b>Then its the right time to critical hit. If your opponents helmet is broken, critical hit is extremely deadly. It's so deadly, that even if &nbsp;he has eaten a god apple you can kill him.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li><b>In tunnels:&nbsp;</b>If you're in a small tunnel, 2 block high, instantly spam your jump key, and click fast. This will get you critical hits on the opponent&nbsp;<b>twice as fast</b> when in open fields. This is very deadly, and with a combination with block hitting, its basically just a matter of time on how long your opponent will be able to survive.<br></li><li><b>Combinated with strafing:&nbsp;</b>If you manage to deal some crits on your opponent while strafing or after the strafe, you are already good. I like to do it when I know the opponent won't be able to hit me, like you can see if his aim is a bit off track.&nbsp;<br></li></ul><b>Block hitting:&nbsp;</b>Most of you already know what it is, and its very OP in server like Avicus where you have no enchants or speed. (This is why I mostly use scout in Nexus, then I can strafe better). Basically, pretty much everything is useless against block hitting when you don't have any enchants or potions. For those who doesn't know what block hitting is, you just right and left click at the same time. The blocking will reduce the damage you take, and the hit will do more damage on your opponent.&nbsp;<br><ul><li><b>In tunnels:&nbsp;</b>Just do block hitting and crits at the same time in the tunnel and you're pretty much unbeatable. Unless your opponent does the same, then its about who is clicking the fastest I think.</li><li><b>If&nbsp;you're trapped:&nbsp;</b>If you get pushed into a corner or something like that, block hit. This will make it easier for you to knock the opponent away, as well as you take less damage and make it hard for him to kill you.<br></li><li><b>If you get teamed</b><b>:</b> Unless you're EXTREMELY good at strafing, block hitting is the safest way. Of course, you can combine strafing with block hitting, which also is very OP. This also takes some time to practice, you don't only have to be a good pvp'er, you need to be smart and have good timing.&nbsp;<br></li></ul><b>The bow/Archery:&nbsp;</b>Using your bow.<br><ul><li><b>See the outcome:</b> A good archer is very good to see where the opponent is about to go. If you aim for the player, he will easily dodge it, due to the bow doesn't hit instantly after you shoot. Try and look and calculate where the opponent is about to go. If he is running to the left, aim a bit more to the left (depends on how far he is from you) than where he really is. The longer away he is, the more to the left you aim.</li><li><b>In close fights:&nbsp;</b>Don't pull your bow all the way back. I would suggest pull it to the second pull cross thingy, it does enough damage, takes way less time and makes your arrow go further. If you're longer away then <i>10 blocks from your opponent</i>, pull it all the way back. If you are within<i> 5-10 away</i>, pull it to the second pull thingy. If you're <i>5 or less</i> blocks near your opponent, pull it to the first.<br></li><li><b>Matsuzen tactic:&nbsp;</b>A well known tactic, basically, before you go to a fight, put some good shots on them. This will make them lower on health and make is easier for you to win the fight.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Your FOV matter's:&nbsp;</b>Your FOV depends on how you should shoot. If you play on Quake, you basically have to aim right at the opponent. If you play on normal you have to aim quite some hight over your opponent. This depends on how long you are from the opponent and what FOV you play on. I would suggest you to learn your FOV good.<br></li><li><b>Bow spam:&nbsp;</b>Also known as the "nub tactic". Well, it actually is pretty useful. Bowspam can knock players back, make them low on health before a fight, and push them back if you are low. Doesn't need very much more explaining, does it?<br></li><li><b>Use the bat:&nbsp;</b>As always, practice is the best way of getting better. One of the best ways to practice, if trying to shot a bat. Bats first of all fly, which makes it way harder due to the rapid movements. They are also very small, so they are hard to hit even if they stand still. The also go in&nbsp;<b>every&nbsp;</b>direction, so its hard to see the outcome. Players can't fly, they are pretty big, and they can't move as rapidly. The mostly used tactic to dodge arrows is the going right and left. This is quite easy to hit, basically, you only have to shoot in the "middle" of their movements. When they go to the right, they expect you to shoot to the right, then when you shoot, they turn left. The same thing on the other side. If you find a middle point, and shoot the other way as they go you hit them. Hard to explain..<br></li><li><b>"180":</b> When you are low on health and being chased by an opponent, instantly jump, turn around and shot them. This lowers their health, knocks them back and slows them downs, which gives you the opportunity to either regen health, eat or refill etc.<br></li></ul><b>General PvP stuff:&nbsp;</b>There is a lot of things that can make you a good pvp'er. People say you only need to click fast and have a good aim. Its so much more:<b><br></b><ul><li><b>Aim:&nbsp;</b>Aim <b>is</b> probably the most important thing in PvP. A good aim makes a good pvp'er. Look up reflex games, a very popular one that can in<b></b>crease your aim is osu! &nbsp;Personally the way I practice my aim is pot pvp'ing. It increases my aim skill, due to the movement, speed 2, and you know, PvP in general helps your aim. So just practice!</li><li><b>Hotkeying:&nbsp;</b>Practise getting things in your hot bar without scrolling with your mouse. Soup PvP and Pot PvP helps your hot keying a lot.&nbsp;<br></li><li><b>Click fast/jitter click:&nbsp;</b>Fast clicking is very important. People say it isn't, because Minecraft only can register a couple of hits per second, but they are wrong. The faster you click, the more hits you will be able to put in your opponent. Also, if you click faster than your opponent, you will get combos on him. And the last thing, which is probably the best, if you click faster than your opponent, you get the first hit. If you click extremely fast you will hit your opponent once as he is in within your range. This is very helpful, if you get the first hit you can start strafing and put a lot of damage into your opponent. Jitter click is basically when you fletch you muscles, and spam the crap out of your mouse, you do all you can to click faster. Real jitter click makes you mouse shake, and people say its harder to aim doing it. But you know, try and click as fast as you can, but make sure you still can manage to have a good aim.<br></li><li><b>Parkour:&nbsp;</b>PvP is mostly in terrain that has hills, water etc. Practice being able to sprint as well as doing the parkour. Use terrain to your advantage. Its good for running away and for chasing. If you're good at park our, you can run away from your opponent, as well as chase him. Practice!<br></li><li><b>Golden apples:&nbsp;</b>Use your golden apples efficiently. One regular golden apple gives you 4 seconds of regeneration 2. If you eat them constantly after each other, you will only get 2 seconds of regeneration of the first apple which in total only gives you 6 seconds of regen. Wait the regen out, and then eat another one. This gives you more health, and you will have to use less golden apples.&nbsp;<br></li><li><b>FOV and Sensetivity:&nbsp;</b>Of course, this is your choice. Find what you feel confident with. People say that quake pro is the best. I wouldn't say so. Ok, you get a larger field of view (FOV),&nbsp;<b>but&nbsp;</b>it makes it way harder to aim. The larger your for is, the smaller the other player get. This makes it harder to keep your aim at the target. If you play on normal, its very easy to keep your aim at the target, it also&nbsp;<b>goes slower</b>, so everything doesn't happen so fast, which makes it easier for you to aim. What I mean, if you play on Quake Pro with speed 2, everything will go extremely fast, and hitting your opponent will be very hard if he is strafing you. I would recommend normal. About the sensitivity its all up to you. Slower sensitivity makes it easier to hold your aim at the opponent. but if you can manage to play at a high sensitivity, i think it is better. It helps you get your aim at the opponent if he is strafing you. But, its all up to you, find one you feel comfortable with.<br></li><li><b>Mods:&nbsp;</b>Mods such as Optifine, Gammabright and HUD mods can help you <i>and</i> they are allowed. Use mods as your advantage. Note: Don't use hacked clients</li><li><b>Be hyped:&nbsp;</b>In order to play good, you must have to want it yourself. If your just not motivated to play minecraft after a couple of hours, stop it. Don't play just to play, play because you&nbsp;<b>want</b>. Go out with friends, when you come back, I'm sure you want to play minecraft, and that makes you better. I speak from experience.</li><li><b>Don't be cold while pvp'ing:&nbsp;</b>If you are cold your blood flow slows down, which makes your abilities to click fast, react fast and think fast slower. This is&nbsp;<u></u>something you should try to&nbsp;<u>avoid&nbsp;</u>when pvp'ing!<br></li><li><b>Listen to music:&nbsp;</b>Dubstep is a good thing here. Something that pumps you, gives you motivation etc. People prefer to play with music, I personally don't, since it kind off takes my focus away from minecraft.</li><li><b>Good equipment:&nbsp;</b>A good mouse and a good keyboard is a winner. Mouse is probably the most important thing. A good DPI and response time will help you very much. I prefer Razer, but people say you can get cheap, good gaming mouses for half the price. Its up to you. :)</li></ul><b><i></i><u>Update log:<br></u></b>-<i>Added more info about strafing</i><br>-<u></u><i>Added "Don't be cold while pvp'ing"</i><br>-<i>Added "In close fight" at "Archery"<br></i>-<i>Added "Variate your strafing's" in "Strafing"</i><br>-<i>Added "Your FOV matter's" in "Archery"</i><br>-<br>-<br>-<br><br>Thank you for reading, hope it helped! I could go more into detail, but is a basic, small guide so I decided not to. Tell me if you are wondering about something or have any questions about the tactics. Also comment if I should add something. :)<br><br>-pce

Regarding the Quake Pro thing, it is more effective if you have a larger screen (like a desktop instead of a laptop.) I, for one, use an iMac and it's practically a foot away from my eyes (probably not safe lol) so I can see my target whether I am shooting at them or sword-fighting with them.

I don't really see what you are trying to tell. Screen size variate, the length away from your screen variate and FOV variate. It's up to you, but I would recommend normal.

I guess my point was that a bigger screen is more advantageous because it just displays things larger than a smaller screen (and therefore it is more comfortable to use Quake Pro), but of course there are many other factors to include like you said.<br><br>Oh, and great job on the guide m8! :D

@CreeperJoe I could try! :p depends on how many who wants it, so I don't waste my time making a id that one person would watch. AND I only get like 10-20 fps while recording, so it will be kinda hard to make it, but if people want it, I'll do it. :)<br><br>@Carrie I'm glad I could help ya :D

This is perfect, however you should add:<br><br>When getting comboed:<br>-Don't give up just because you're getting comoboed. If you are in a combo the best way to escape it is.<br>-Blockhit (you already said this)<br>-Shift Tap. This will reduce the majority of knockback and you should be able to get a few consecutive hits on them.<br>-Blockhit and press s + space bar rapidly. This will ensure the knockback + the jump will propel you enough to escape the enemy's range.

I use it to see if he's still chasing me, and to determine whether he's far away enough from me to give me time to pop an arrow at him or eat a gold apple. It's nice to have eyes in the back of your head sometimes.

This is a normal pvp guide. I assure you that all of them look/are similar to this one. I'm sure plaza has better things to do than copy&nbsp;guides off the OCN forums, like maybe writing his own variation of it.

You need to add 2 more steps.&nbsp;<br><br>1. Blame lag every time you die. For example LAGGGG. Make sure to make yourself look like a complete wanker whilst doing so.<br><br>2.make a huge deal about when you kill someone. For example. HAHAHA NOOB or &lt;-------- BEST PVPER EVAR or just EzPz
