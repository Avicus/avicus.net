Mapmaking Question

After the "Omega Update", will mapmakers be able to use several different types of blocks for monuments (other blocks besides obsidian) (like on maps like Spaceship Battles on OCN)? I'm making a map and I was wondering about this, as I could have the map go two different ways dependant on what the answer is. This could be something to consider adding in the future as well, if no.&nbsp;<br><br>I was going to go for something like an obsidian monument and two monuments made out of other material to cannon down (optimally), as the map will include TNT. So I wanted a kind of interesting play style, where you would have to balance skybridge control and cannoning well in order to win. <br><br>Note: The map is mainly made of stone brick, so it won't be ravanged by TNT as much as maps made of other material, so the obsidian mon will still be reachable.

Not to burst your bubble with a question that's not answering your question at all, but...<br><br>If both teams have access to TNT, what would happen if someone blew up their own team's monument (seeing as its not made of obsidian)? Are there any boundaries or restrictions in your map that are in place for that?

<i>"You may not destroy your own monument."</i><br><br>It already applies to obsidian monuments, so I'd assume it would be for other objectives as well.

when robot, juano, burdie and me was making our tm map, we wanted to putthe monuments as lapis but we couldn't. This might change in the omega update tho

Haha, a friend gave the link to this thread. Sorry for the lack of reply.<br><br>I'm not sure the stance on Nebula having other monument materials, as it's become so iconic and having other materials could possibly be too easy to break. In terms of ability, I don't think it's planned in the update to allow other monuments to be used and I'm not sure if it's been thought about. I'll bring it up in the meeting tomorrow, and get back to you whether or not this is able to be done or not. Thanks for the question!
