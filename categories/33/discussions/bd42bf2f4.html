First, this is a Team Death Match suggestion.&nbsp;<br>I was thinking, what if there was a TDM that wasn't just to see how many kills you can get. <br>Maybe make it to where you kill people and they are on your team?&nbsp;<br>Have you ever played Sharks and Minos in elementary school? <br>Well, if you haven't:<br>1. Have players stand on one end of the room<br>2. Have 1 tagger<br>3. Have the payers run across the room and try not to get tagged<br>4. And keep going until there is 0 minos left<br>Avicus Version:<br>1. Make it the teams like the walls, to where when the games starts everyone is forced into joining and no one after that can join until the game is over (like the walls)<br>2. Split the teams as evenly as possible (like the walls)<br>3. Donors can't choose teams for this<br>4. Have a good size map<br>5. Start the game<br>6. Probably make it last as long as a Nexus game<br>7. When you kill someone they get transferred to your team<br>8. End&nbsp;<br>How do you win?<br>The team who has the most players at the end of the round wins.<br><br>What do you think?

Oh yipee! Another chance for some Paint skills :)<br><br>Merlin, do you mean something like this?<br><br>So, the black boxes with the gray stripes are "safezones." The black line is the border to the map. The red arrows show where the "minnows" &nbsp;have to go. The blue stick figures are the "sharks." The objective is to run in between the two safezones.<br><br><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/7X7Kfrn.png">

1. Make it the teams like the walls, to where when the games starts everyone is forced into joining and no one after that can join until the game is over (like the walls) <b>Unfortunately, can't be done with this current setup for Nebula.</b><br>2. Split the teams as evenly as possible (like the walls) <b>We don't have an automatic team splitter feature so it's even. Not possible either.</b><br>3. Donors can't choose teams for this <b>Not possible to restrict, has to be coded.</b><br>4. Have a good size map <b>Possible.</b><br>5. Start the game <b>Possible.</b><br>6. Probably make it last as long as a Nexus game <b>Possible.</b><br>7. When you kill someone they get transferred to your team <b>Not possible, either. :(</b><br><span>8. End&nbsp;<br><br>(This is answering your map submission, for which can be done in YAML and what can't be done. I&nbsp;recommend&nbsp;making your map DTM for the time being, or a normal TDM with&nbsp;block placing.)</span>
