Don't worry I'm sure they are well&nbsp;<br>prepared. Oh and the ranks can stay.. They just can't offer any gameplay advantages over players who haven't donated. Having a prefix doesn't affect gameplay so it's okay.

You have a point, and the answer is: They Won't. A server with 20 people that has a $5 rank is going to be their last priority, so big servers will be targeted first.

Hopefully they'll either nerf donor kits to make&nbsp;them more even with other kits, or remove donor kits altogether and think up new&nbsp;kits.

the thing was that the donor kits weren't even really that op. The normal kits have an even amount of pros and cons, but the donor kits may seem good, but they have quiet a bit of cons that can even the playing field. For example, lets take kit ninja in avicade for red alert, ninja, in a smaller map is really not that great cause you run out of room to run, so the normal kit is much better. These donor kits also have holes in them, and i really haven't heard many people saying that they are. I also have a question, will the exp boost be removed as well? im sorry if i'm bothering someone to answer this question, but i'd like to know.<br>Thanks for reading :D

Why are you being so hostile?<br>Either ways I'm not against or supportive against EULA,overall it helps introduce fair play amongst the community,but this will also mean almost no one will donate nowadays as they are just donating for pets,trails and ranks(I'm not sure about XP)

the thing was that the donor kits weren't even really that op. The normal kits have an even amount of pros and cons, but the donor kits may seem good, but they have quiet a bit of cons that can even the playing field. For example, lets take kit ninja in avicade for red alert, ninja, in a smaller map is really not that great cause you run out of room to run, so the normal kit is much better. These donor kits also have holes in them, and i really haven't heard many people saying that they are. I also have a question, will the exp boost be removed as well? im sorry if i'm bothering someone to answer this question, but i'd like to know.<br>Thanks for reading :D

In games with kits I believe so because it gives donors a gameplay advantage by levelling up faster giving easier access to kits.

I support the EULA. It makes a better, and more fair gameplay experience for non donors. Also, you're not donating for the right reasons if you're doing it for perks imo.

Hmm, I really dont like the EULA system, although it gives a more fair gameplay to regular players. In faction servers you can donate and get a Butt load of tnt, Gapples, God Swords, and more. But for some servers for example MCSG, will probably have a hard time getting through that. Not sure if Hive is going to get affect to much, but it will force them to make a down-graded package. For small servers, I know one thats been shutdown due to nobody donating and the owner ran out of money to pay for it. It really is sad that Mojang is doing this, I don't know why they just wont make a moderating team to "stop" servers from selling over $1,000 USD kits... Why not? I mean its just going to be easier for servers who actually follow the rules to keep going and be successful. I really hope it doesn't screw MCSG, Hive, Avicus, and Overcast. These are the servers I mostly play on and if they get shutdown, I'm just going to quit. Same with youtubers like Yogscast, they've made Minecraft very popular and now they have to deal with this. All I'm saying is that its just sad that they made this, but in some cases its good due to people who aren't able to donate have a fair game to play and such. So that's pretty much all I want to say :).

I have an idea... we keep the donor ranks (and people can pay for the ranks if they would like with hard currency) but you could also unlock the kits from getting an exact amount of soft currency which would be pretty high (since the kits are OP) and you wouldn't be breaking the EULA since it is possible to get the kits in a different way, its not pay to win if you can get the kits to win without paying &lt;3

This will be the last message I reply to from you and in future maybe show me and others some respect.<br>Just because you do not agree with my point or my views does not make me "stupid".
