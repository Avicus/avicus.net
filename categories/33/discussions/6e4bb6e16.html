This goes out to the server administrators and any "shop managers" if there are any.<br>I was just wondering what will happen to our ranks when August 1st comes around... Will you guys replace them with anything? Or Are we going to keep our ranks. I am talking about the 1.5x The xp, 2x the xp and so on, will we loose that? Because Mojang said in their post, "<span>We don’t mind you selling items in game, but they must be purely cosmetic. Pets, hats, and particle effects are OK, but swords, invincibility potions, and man-eating pigs are not. We want all players to be presented with the same gameplay features, whether they decide to pay or not." That was pasted.<br><br>What I am trying to say is, will we keep our&nbsp;multiplier xp thingie majigers? Like when it says 1.5x the xp.<br>Thanks!<br>MEwQ4 :D</span>

I know I'm no staff member here, but...<br><br>The XP multipliers will most likely be removed, since they give players an advantage that affects gameplay (most notably in Nexus and any minigame with a class system). No idea about the ranks themselves, but I could see them being tweaked a bit.

We will have to remove several features that supposedly make the gameplay unfair. Either the purpose of XP will have to change or the multipliers will have to be removed. We will be sure to compensate the best we can, though Mojang is making it pretty difficult. Do not expect anything that modifies an individual's gameplay (positively or negatively) as Mojang is strictly against this. Once we figure it out we will announce it properly.

I don't get why Mojang cares so much. In life, if you pay extra you get some sort of level up than someone that doesn't have it. Its like buying first class on an airplane. You pay extra to get something nicer. Mojang just doesn't want server owners to make a profit off of servers. (IMO that's pretty stupid.)
