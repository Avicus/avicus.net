A friend and me found out, how to strategically use the invisible fire to theoretically make a really good defence by totally covering the plains around the monument with invisible fire. Would it count as glitch abusing or just be another strategy to defend a monument? We aren't quite sure and thought it betetr to ask first, before actually doing it :) Another good thing about the defence, is also that the fire doesn'T end.

Probably abusing a glitch as you cannot see the fire. It could also bring considered cheating.

It's glitch abusing as you are aware of the glitch and use it to your advantage :c I like the idea though xD

Yes, it's considered abusing glitches and gives unfair advantages.

This was found more than a year Ago on MCSG, using the flint and steel on certain maps to light opponents on fire... But still abusing glitches..

Wat<br><br>@OP Now I realized that I've seen this. Isn't it a Minecraft glitch though, since it's been seen on multiple servers? Don't quote me on this but I heard somewhere that using Minecraft bugs isn't bannable.

would be awesome.<br><br><br>In gerneral, my friend and me also found out you can see the fire while being in 1.8( I was using 1.7.10 and couldn'T see it, he was using 1.8 and could) if the server is now only for 1.8 so everyone can see the fire, would I then be allowed to use it? As everyone can see and dodge it now.

Umm stupid Avicusrules, why was it allowed to play Avicade with this ultra xp-bug?<br>Why were people in Minotaur allowed to use the staircase-"Bug"? Invisible fire is a part of minecraft, it's not a bug. It is a part of minecraft.

Under the Avicus rules; Section A: rule 8, it states that it strongly suggests you email them if you find an exploit or glitch to support@avicus.net. You can use this for any future glitches or exploits but just for the best response and clarity I think to email would be the most opportune way to receive a response. (Even if it's a glitch within Minecraft itself, you will receive a well developed answer!)

On some maps there's fire that's part of the plugin or something, maybe the map. Anyway, it's impossible to douse, so you'll always catch on fire when you walk near it.
