Mojang wants gameplay to be fair for all users. So, now MineCraft servers are not allowed to make money off of ranks that have unlock able kits and stuff. You can still donate, but not for perks like unlock able kits and enchanted diamond swords and such.

EULA is an agreement you come by, everyday when you hit the play button on the start screen of Minecraft. But in the recent months mojang has been recieveing a MASS amounts of emails from parents, about being charged approximatly $10,000 USD for a "Vanilla item-Kit" on servers. Therefor they are reinforcing the rule of EULA to confiscate this problem, I am not entirely sure about this, and how much damage it can cost to servers. Now, some servers like the Archon might have to rely on charging people yearly to get whitelisted on the server. :)

Well... good luck getting unbanned :D. Mineplex really needs to step up their game with moderating their system -.-.
