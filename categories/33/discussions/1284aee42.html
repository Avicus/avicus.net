I haven't seen anyone mention it in months, but I want to bring up a topic about it. What were your opinions on it? Was it OP? Is the price to high now? Should they add both KB 1 and KB 2 shovels in the the shop? Discuss.<br><br><br><br>(For those of you who give to shits about me, I'm also back on Avicus. Yeah I admit it is kind of lame that I was only gone for two weeks but my life isn't nearly so f*cked up anymore.)

You are back!! &lt;3 :D<br><br>I loved the old spanky spade, because it was worth the points. I think they should make the current one knockback 2, because 30 points aren't worth knockback 1 spade. Also, they can also make the knockback 1 spade cost 15 or anything points, and the knockback 2 spade cost 30 points.

Mah boi ky! Good to see you back, bud. <br><br>I personally loved the Spanky Spade, as it seemed fair to obtain a pretty OP item if you earned it by racking up all of those points. <br><br>But yeah, maybe a Knockback I shovel for 7 points, and a Knockback II for 14 points?

yeah, I mean, you can even get knockback one on most maps from just enchanting your sword at lvl 1.

It was pretty OP on maps like Senex. You couldn't make it to the centre if the opposing team had a Spanky Spade. They'd spank your little behind right out of the world.

The spanks are so real! :D I have only bought the spanky spade twice, and one of the times I thought it I died two seconds later, however the other time I went on a 25 person kill streak, so it has its days.

I never really touched the spanky spade because the only thing I ever buy is gapples, but Knockback I swords are quite overpowered

It required a 25 killstreak, if I remember rightly, and it could knock people off most maps with ease. It wasn't OP because a 25 killstreak is nigh on impossible even for the best.

I think that if the Spanky Spade was lowered to 15 points, it would be a lot more achievable and useful for its price :3

If the map was an open plain, like dust devils, it was 100% useless. All it ever did for me was limit my ability to maintain a strafe tbh. Kinda overwhelming on Halcyon though. Gave you less damage. For me it was just an easier way to deal kb, which you cold attain adequate amounts of by sprint resetting.

I think like some people have said, there should be 2 spanky spades, one with knock back 1, maybe cost like 10-15 points or a knock back 2 for like 30-35 points? idk
