I decided to make a defense on Rendezvous II, which took a while, but about 30% through completion, about a dozen of my teammates decided to help :D. The defense turned out great, what do you think about it? We could have done more but the game ended xD<br><br><a href="http://imgur.com/feUgjmU,MJITQ9c,T1MoJ0y,150W5wg,BX8Dn72,OqsCThX,OnBbmri" rel="nofollow">http://imgur.com/feUgjmU,MJITQ9c,T1MoJ0y,150W5wg,BX8Dn72,OqsCThX,OnBbmri</a>

What was under the pressure plates? If it was solid stone, I would just skybridge, boat down, clutch to the side, and tunnel. If it was a base under it, then that's an OP defense.

under the stone was layered wood, I was gonna work on that next and fix it since I didn't make that part of the defense, but the game ended ;D

I would replace all the stone, wool and slabs with wood and wooden slabs, as you don't spawn with an axe (first picture). <br><br>If I wouldn't&nbsp;replace the chunk of stone in front of the crafting benches I would remove it all and just place wooden slabs and regular wooden fences random to make it difficult to just run past it (second picture). <br><br>I would also keep the front wall with levers but change out all the stone and wool with regular wood or crafting benches, I would also make the front wall at least two or three blocks with iron bars in middle so it would be wood - iron bars&nbsp;- wood (third picture). <br><br>I like the build around the monument though I wouldn't cover the monument if the block I'm using isn't transparent. You also have stone below the monument, I would replace it with wood and use slabs instead of pressure plates.

The pit is needed so you can see players making underground tunnel, and if they try to block it up behind them you can see it was not stone placed they it was wood, cobblestone or something like that.
