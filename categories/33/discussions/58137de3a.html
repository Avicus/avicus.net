Hey everyone, lately I've noticed amazing numbers of people on Avicus around the clock (24/7) but still nobody really plays Elimination..<br><br>Im just wondering, does anyone - including staff - know why nobody actually PLAYS Elimination? Is there something wrong with it or?<br><br>In fact the reason I'm even asking these questions is because in my entire year here at Avicus, I've never played a single game of Elimination.. there is just never enough people...<br><br>So yeah, thats my question, why does nobody play Elimination at all? :/

Well I play it but lag, glitches, compasses don't work and people don't stay the whole game.

I would play it a lot if it wasn't laggy, and if there were actually people in the servers.

Elim was my favourite game back in Avicus 1.0 because it was just like Classic MCZone HG but with levels☻<br><br>But now it's glitched, the compasses don't work and there is lots of lag &gt;:(

Yes, as an inconvienece it is quite laggy with numerous glitches within and there are also more preferred game-modes that players use aswell.<br><br>(Maybe Elimination could use a revamp?)

It is such a promising game mode, but nobody plays it and its laggy D:
