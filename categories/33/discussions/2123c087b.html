Well pretty much recently I've seen a ton of videos and posts about MCZone and it at its peek. I personally luved luved luved MCZone and thats what kept me playing Minecraft (I'm still playing minecraft mainly because of factions, walls and youtube). But anyway I've decided to start a campaign sort of thingy to bring back the mini games and reform Avicus to an amazing server. Yes this all costs money, instead you could take away all the dead mini games, eg Elimination, Avicade and CTH and replace them with things like Sky Wars, the old SG and so on so forth.<br><br>(This is just a suggest to bring it back because I know many people preferred it)

i agree. My time with McZone was short, but i sure as hell do remember to mounts of people in then hubs and the amazing SG, HG, Ghost Quadrant, Skywars and others that it gave us.<br>I agree with you man. The past was a beautiful place, and probably the best. Yes, what we have now is absolutely amazing and probably underrated, but the past had what he have now AND extra, crowd drawing activities.<br>+1 man, i want it back :(

That's a good point, I did join 5 months ago but as a new player I find it quite annoying how certain players can't seem to let go of the past. I made a topic a few days ago asking why Avicus changed from MCZone and someone said it was a number of reasons, one of those included the fact that the majority of gamemodes were completely empty.<br><br>I agree with D, why replace unpopular servers with more unpopular servers? That would take a lot of time to do, the servers would have to be shut down and staff would have to work extremely hard to exchange current empty servers for former empty servers.<br>Seems like a waste of resources to me.
