I used to want 1v1 on the server, then I realized it probs wouldn't fit well. IMO we need to make sure the servers can handle the player loads, as I think that is what's causing a lot of this lag, the player base has spiked hugely, meaning more stress on the servers. SG is very popular and brings lots of players in, so I feel like there should be some precautions before adding it

1v1 wouldn't be suitable for this type of server, but SG will be added in the next update, as Seth said.

<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They are actually implementing more PvP gamemodes, like SG, etc. But at the moment the development costs work, so it won't be in one second. One versus One PvP is not a good idea for Avicus, go to K**i or Ba****n if you want 1v1, but Avicus is unique and 1v1 is bad idea for this server.

I think most would agree that I have a sense of humor. However, you're going too far, and basically all your posts are either spamming or trolling.

So get a mod to forum ban me. If you want to complain about me contact a staff member, and he'll give a punishment if needed. Please, if you don't have something good/ serious/ funny/ interesting to say, don't.

Why would we even need a server? I mean what range of players would play! Australians would go play on AU kohi, Americans on US kohi. Then you are left one of the two major contributions to our server quantity gone. Many people would prefer kohi or badlion due to variety of skill. It isn't going to work if it was implemented.
