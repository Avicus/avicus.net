Hey guys and gals... so as you can see by the title people playing walls at times will take super long, like make a sky base and camp there for a good 3-4 hours.. i really dislike this in walls and i was hoping that maybe avicus could set a timer for a whole game? maybe like 45 mins - 1 hour maybe? it would be great<br>P.S Idk where to put this so move if needed<br>&nbsp;Thanks :D

I just don't really like this idea, &nbsp;the whole thing of walls is to get a good strategy, imagine finally getting full diamond where you don't know where the diamonds are, &nbsp;crafting and going up, &nbsp;and having the game end, &nbsp;plus sky bases and that hard to get. Past.<br><br>If this were to be added make it 2 hours<br>And ps. &nbsp;I've played a ton of walls games and never had a game go over 1 and a half hour

YES. And basically, whichever team gets the most kills will get xp

-1 I want walls to take as long as it needs to take because it is a very tactical game. Also, what happens after the timer ends (if it did happen)?

I thought there was something like a 45 minute limit?&nbsp; Or was in the old days?<br><br>I remember games being timed out.

-1 I think the walls should be as long as it wants... So I think the walls shouldn't have a time limit and sometimes when ur tired of pvping go camp in a sky base and make it all cool and fashony so if u do make it atleast 1 1/2 hours!!
