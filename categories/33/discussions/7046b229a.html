I don't know why but the other post that I had was archived. If that was a staff member can you please not archive this, I'll do it myself. So basically since I can't really respond to all of you h8ers, I've decided to make this "Part 2." So basically I'd first off like to say, I cant go on any teamspeak servers, and I can't go on any regular Minecraft servers because this community is rude. Also, a lot of you people were saying stuff like,"Devouch, this kid jumps teams everyday." Reallly dude, are you blind? I've only been on one team so far! I know I have some people supporting me here and I appreciate you guys. But seriously, I'm quitting. I'm going back to OCN where we have a nice community! &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ~Bye.
