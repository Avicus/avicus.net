I understand the desire to add new maps, but why get rid of these older maps?<br><br>These maps are great because success depends on which kit you start with and teamwork, at wall drop normally the best you can have is full iron armor, sometimes enchanted, sometimes not.<br><br>With the new maps at wall drop if you don't have full or at least partial diamond you are at a severe disadvantage, so the game becomes "who can get to the chest and get the overpowered loot first" and "who can get to the diamonds first"?&nbsp; Seriously, games on the new maps are all about developing routines to get the loot and diamonds.<br><br>I'm not saying to go back to where the only maps are Walls and Jungle (and Village), but please keep them in the rotation.<br><br>And a suggestion for new maps - no diamonds except in the middle (like Jungle)!&nbsp; Makes things much more fair at wall drop and lets you spend time on building things before wall drop rather than just going on a diamond hunt.

Gameplay in both maps is very, very limited, food resources (as stated by other players before) are sparse and those maps aren't even made by Avicus players, so we'd rather stick to maps that actually belong to us.<br>Please refer to this topic for more reasons that convinced us to take our decision:&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://avicus.net/forums/6c781c6c5">http://avicus.net/forums/6c781c6c5</a>

AP! Great topic, but... The Jungle and Walls are the only maps that people don't play much. If people played them more I would be all for keeping them, but the jungle is on every server not being played just about, and when that map rotates around, players go to hub and leave it for dead and walls is 2nd on that list. I am with you, I like the older maps, but no one plays them, so I voted for them being taken away. I would rather play on a map with people than be on a map where after the walls drop 3-4 people are left or it takes 20 min to get a game going. &nbsp;I was thinking of building a map that does not have diamonds, and seeing if the map devs like it, but has a little better game play and that is kit focused - to replace the walls/jungle style. I agree with some other posters, I am not a fan of the Tetris series, but that series is built well and fit resource wise into rotation ( to me the game play is so/so) and the tetris maps are never stuck in the rotation :). I hope that we end up with a great walls rotation where we like most of the maps, and we don't get into a situation where we have so many servers stuck on the same map. To me it is all about the fun, and the fun happens when players stay and play regardless of anything else. I think the walls game mode should have 200-300 people playing it at all time, and that is the only reason I started building maps.

I'm going to be honest, I never play these maps. Whenever I join a walls match I check the rotation. If either The Walls or Jungle is up next I'm out. Resources are scarce and I just don't enjoy them as some of the newer maps.

Because these maps I don't played ever the walls. I played them long time ago on the hypixel server and it was crap. I had nothing and my health was only a half heart because I doesn't found food. At this point I never ever played walls. In the last time I played walls often, but all left, if jungle or The Walls were next.

Food was a problem but not that long ago more animals were added to the Walls &amp; jungle maps, and hunger no longer goes down on those maps prior to wall drop.<br><br>The village map hasn't been around for a while, and I liked the simplicity of that map too.

Ok, my brother told me this, and I didn't believe him, and now I'm probably gunna go cry somewhere.... "The Walls" is my favorite map, and I always use kit cook on it because of the golden apple and really because no other kit is useful to me (except some of the one i haven't unlocked). And food scarce on "The Jungle"? Wheat and coco beans= unlimited (basically) supply of food. Just my thoughts...

Okay I have read through all the posts and what I see is that people's main issue with the maps was the lack of resources, e.g iron,food etc.&nbsp;<br><br>So how about a<b> compromise</b>? Simply <b>add more sources </b>of food (animals, crops etc.) and more minerals (gold, iron etc.).&nbsp;<br><br>This way people who did not like the maps might now enjoy them since their problems were addressed and the people who want them back get them back, just improved!

I get what you are saying, but don't you guys sometimes edit maps before you add them into rotations for various reasons?&nbsp;<br>Adding a few more crops/animals and ores is hardly changing the map at all really so I don't see any harm in it.

My opinion is that Jungle is a really cool map but it might need some more food.<br>The Walls is also a good map but same thing, it needs more food.<br><br>Some people don't like these maps because there isn't much food in The Walls and Jungle if you don't get the wheat.<br>The map is really classic and I think it should stay but not be in the rots that much.
