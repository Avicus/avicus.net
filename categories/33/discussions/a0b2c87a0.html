How about you file a complaint or suggest some things instead of bitching on the forums just to hurt peoples feelings.<br><br>There were reasons why Jozz received the position permanently and I agree with all of them.

errrr, I still call back for howsie to come back, since in jozz's post he said it was "temporary", so howsie was gonna come back. Howsie worked his butt off and was really efficient as well, when he was slow for apps he came back in efficiency. Since jozz became director (no hate intended) he has been working faster but you guys promoted a guy who was NOT active on the forums and the criteria clearly stated you NEEDED to be active

you can't just say that "jozz is nice, that's it," and think that isn't offensive. Jozz has been trying his best as a director. He's doing what he can and I think it's good that he was promoted to Director! ^~^ Like what Nolan said too, things are more efficient with jozz. If you think jozz is just "nice" you really don't know him. &nbsp;Not to be rude about this but you know that that is a bit rude.

I say keep jozz and bring back howise. Jozz is a fast worker but not too efficient and Howsie is a slightly slower worker but he actually does the work efficiently. With both of them combined = awesomeness in server

It's not like howsie was kicked out. He quit. Right when jozz got promoted to director, we already knew howsie was probably not coming back. Howsie gave up his position willingly, and basically quit Minecraft as a whole. Also, don't get me wrong but howsie did not exactly want to do the work for the server. There is a lot of confidential information about this that I will not disclose.

I think that whenever someone makes a decision to give up their position of power everyone should respect it.<br><br>If you find that Jozz is horrible then give constructive reasons why and stop openly disrespecting him.<br><br>In my opinion, he seems nice and is trying his best.&nbsp;<br><br>&lt;Offtopic&gt;<br>Weren't the Ezblas quitting Avicus? Sorry, just asking.<br>&lt;/Offtopic&gt;

No, that's not actually what happened. As I said, there's a lot of information that the public is unaware of.

Look guys, I am going to be dead honest.&nbsp; People don't know what they have until it is gone.&nbsp; This server is special.&nbsp; Never in my life have I seen a server with this much love before.&nbsp; When i got Minecraft last year, this was my first ever Multiplayer server.&nbsp; I was the biggest noob in the world.&nbsp; I couldn't pvp to save my life.&nbsp; When I go on other servers, I don't feel as comfortable as I do here.&nbsp; Also, this is the first server where I have been active on the forums.&nbsp; When I see people fight, in game and on the forums, it breaks my heart.&nbsp; So until this server closes (who know when), lets enjoy it until it lasts. &lt;3
