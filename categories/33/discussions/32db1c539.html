So while I was banned I was thinking about all the upcoming features to avicus. Mostly on nebula. We are going to be getting CTW! But I was think about a a new gamemode that I'm not sure if it exists already.&nbsp;<br>Here it goes:<br>it will be a bebula styled map. 10 minutes on the clock. Each team has 1 - 3 monuments. Every kill is 1 point, BUT you can mine the monuments, and they will be 5 points.&nbsp;<br>After a monument is destroyed the player will be teleported back to spaen and the obsidian will be replenished by a spawner or something. To make it a bit easier for the rushers( since you can keep going back) the defenders will not be able to build around a certain radius of a monument(Kind of like capture the wool)<br><br>I know the wording and formatting is really bad, if someone can fix it that would be appreciated!

This isn't a bad idea! :D I would highly suggest that monuments should be worth more points maybe like 10 or even 15, Because in a game of nebula a team can get 10 kills in a matter of 30 seconds. So I do like this idea a lot!! I would just say that we should definitely add it just make monuments worth more points.

Well, Bebula sounds interesting for this, Bebula would be a good gamemode for this.<br><br>Bebula.
