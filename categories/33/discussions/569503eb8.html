I didn't do this, but I watched someone on my team (on Quintus) walk through a bridge backwards to get to the enemy side, walked through the spawn backwards, and get to back middle to win it.<br><br>He fooled purple by walking backwards?!?!?!

Trapping two or more diamond guys in a 1x1x2 hole, placing water in there, and covering it. Best way to kill multiple diamond guys at once, and it's even better when people combat log while being trapped.

This happened 9 month ago on Luar if you remember it. Both teams made a epic railroad cart sequence and made a truth. When I took advantage of this, guess what: My team got MAD at ME for breaking the last monument. My own team even tried to kill me...<br>The round lated like 1hr, and the railroad was awesome! I think someone was recording, but tbh i dunno who. I don't know what they were goin for. Probably just having fun. They tried to make another railroad next game, buy 1/2 the people lost hope in making a railroad.

The weirdest strategy I used was on one of the maps "<b>Senex"</b>, I can't remember the name tho.<br><br><i>I killed an orange player, wore his orange dyed leather helmet, and walked to their monument without being spotted, and mined the monument :3<br></i><br><i></i>It's funny how they didn't notice my purple nametag xD

Not really a weird strategy, but I saw LeafeonMessiah pull of a strange, clever one with a staircase. Essentially, if the opposing team makes a wooden box around the monument, you can break one of the pieces, then replace it with a staircase, so it's not very noticeable. Then, you can just reach though the hole in it and get the monument. Pretty cool :3
