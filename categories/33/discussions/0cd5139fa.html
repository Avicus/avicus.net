Just wanted to see what people would think and this is a discussion I want people to share their points of view, vent frustrations, etc. Feel free to share.&nbsp;<br><br>P.S: I personally find it annoying as a rusher, but others may think differently.

Usually people who try to bowspam aren't good at it anyways, so I don't find it that annoying.

I've never actually bow-spammed before and I don't want to try it out because I know how much it annoys people.. I just find it easier to kill them with my sword x3

It is absolutely useless damage wise, you deal little to no damage with those arrows being shot successively ....<br><br><br>Bow spamming is really stupid and I would rather shot 2 arrows 6 blocks away from a guy (Fully charged shots), then rush im with the sword...<br><br>Who even bow spams?

I rarely encounter any good bow spammers, until I met lyyris. Plus the only thing that people do on Iron OCN in badlion is bowspam. It's honestly not that bad, just outstrafe them.

I don't use debuffs but I don't care and bitch about it if I get debuffed. It's part of the server, get over it. If you hate debuffs that much go to debuffless server.

I bowspam. Works whenever someone is about to dive at me and the void is right behind them. I bow spam and they get knocked in the void.<br><br>It also works for games that have Power +X bows. Very deadly for these.<br><br>Just like everyone has their own preferences for PVP so do us bowspammers.&nbsp;<br><br>But I do not like it when ppl use 3rd person. Their hitboxes are too OP.

Bow spamming is a completely effective and legit tactic, it's not nooby, nor illegal, but it is annoying for other people, so I do use it if I am low health and running or just need to get people off my tail.

Don't insult the art of&nbsp;<b><i><u>bow spam</u></i></b><i><u></u></i>, bow spam isn't "a shitty way to get advantage on someone" .... it's perfectly valid and legal tactic.

Eh, bow spamming is a legit tactic. However, imo everything short of hacks/cheating is legit. I don't use it loads or anything but it is very useful for taking down a better armed opponent at a closer range. Bow spammers aren't very difficult to kill if you know how to handle them. I like what Pie said, if its in the game I'll use it. :) Also the definition of bow spam is often lost. Bow spamming is: when a player draws their bow just enough to allow the arrow to be launched anymore is just half/quarter charging, which is very useful to gain an edge over an opponent by putting their strafe off tempo. Bow spamming can be used to keep opponents away until you regenerate a bit and their health is slightly depleted.

I don't have a problem with it, it gets used on me rarely but when they do I just pull my bow - deliver some shots and by that time they would be using their sword on me.

Bowspam is effective from a<br>long distance (10-20 blocks) but is bad to use when your opponent is in hitting distance.

People don't Bow Spam properly. There is a technique to it where you can get fast speed on the shots but the shots will deal a decent amount of damage. I know this technique and I only use it in MCSG.<br>Idk how many people know this technique but I hope Lyyris know it :P
