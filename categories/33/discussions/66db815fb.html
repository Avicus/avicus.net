<b></b>So basically I'm a horrible rusher. I joined 7 months ago but I only have 5 monuments?!<br><br>I just don't know how to get past players and sneak around the world without getting shot off as much as I do. My K/D is 0.5 and I don't know what to do to improve:<br><b>- PVPing<br>- Getting to monuments<br>- Getting shot off the world as easily&nbsp;<br>- Getting to&nbsp;know the&nbsp;map as well<i></i><br><br></b>Any help would be much appreciated! :D<br>Thanks!<br><b><br></b><i>- MiningFlamingo</i><b><br><br></b>

If you want to improve your PvP skill, I recommend you start with strafing. Youtube is a great source.

I agree with jozz; that is technique that I use. Just find one player to fight and start moving clockwise around him while hitting him at the same time. Strafing allows you to hit your opponent while making it more difficult for him to hit you back.

<b>Rushing:</b> If possible, try bridging or wall running on the side of the map, skybridge with minecarts or boats, dig underground. There are other strategies, but it mainly depends on the map. Whatever map it is, use that main strategy.

Just be careful not to jump-hit someone when you're standing next to a cliff or void because your knockback will be higher if they hit you!

When I practice rushing I either do it on a private server or on a survival world. Usually I just make a huge wall and I just go around wall jumping. Or I have 10 stacks of glass and I practice stair casing without shifting up to block limit.

Use your friends/team mates as a distraction. Somehow manipulate them to go to a crowded area. While everyone is eating that bait run past them :D Not really workable, but it's fun to do xD<br>Edit: JKawesome had a thread for all teh maps about rushing. I'll try to look for it and put it up.

If you want to improve your KD, don't rush. But if you really want, I learned how to rush a few months back from watching sfkwww's videos over and over.

For PvP as said before, strafing. You can shift to reduce knock back as well, practice baiting people into trying to get big hits on you then strafing them, always sprint while strafing so your movement's faster therefore making it easier to strafe. For rushing learn how to MLG block place and practice bridging quickly, rushing is a lot of good decision making basically, just learn you don't always have to rush on one side, if there are too many defenders go to the other side. Remember you can dig down as &nbsp; well to avoid kill farmers and defenders as well as making bridges low so they're harder to spot.

I made a rushing tips post a few months back, if you want you can go find it. I'll give some general rushing tips:<br><br><b>Always have a distraction</b><br>If you want to rush, it is always best to have a distraction. For example, a mistake a lot of rushers make is running to the monument and trying to kill all the defenders, which is pretty much impossible. However, you can use that guy to your advantage. Rush right behind them and while the defenders are distracted, surround yourself and break the monument.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Don't go into a fight you can't win<br></b>This is a pretty straightforward tip, but it's unbelievable how many people jinx it. If you see a diamond guy, don't try to kill him...you can't, unless you're Cayden. Just run past him; if he chases you, spam blocks in his face and somehow hide. If it's a void map, clutch to the side and dig in. When they jump down you can knock them off.<br><br><b>Don't be seen; blend in<br></b>Again, another basic tip that people don't care about, or don't do well enough. If the monument is out in the open, wait until the defender is crafting, or distracted, or something. Don't run in there and expect to kill him. If you're not seen, its really easy to break monuments. I once played a Frostbite match that had a glass box with 10 diamond guys in it. I went in there and pretended to be a defender, then broke the monument without them noticing at all.<br><br>So, those are just some general tips that rushers should follow. Hope I helped
