For one, I think the /msg is a great tool and I love it so much, but I think some things about the tool needs to be tweaked.<br><br>1: &nbsp;/msg should work for every player, no matter if they are your friends or not.<br>2: /r should be added so that its easier to reply to messages you receive.<br><br>kthxbai

+1<br>The second point is good but<br>I think we should only be able to message &nbsp;moderators regardless if they're your friend or not.<br><br>It would also help if could actually add friends on the forums.

I agree with point 2.<br>However, I do see why /msg is only for friends. It's possibly to prevent spam from random players, yet I do think that staff should be able to and receive messages from anyone.

It can also prevent advertisers aswell, it would &nbsp;be chaos if anyone could private message anyone.

I guess I understand, it would work better if there was a 'add friends' button.
