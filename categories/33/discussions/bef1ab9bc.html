I had been playing for like 8 months here now. In fact this is the first server I had accessed with my account when my friend (forcefully) told me to join.<br><br>But after one month of playing I got accepted as a builder in a creative server (not named) And I began to build there, I made more friends and even got a slightly higher rank. However, whenever I have the time I still play on Avicus. But recently, I got involved in an enormous project and that was it. 100% of Minecraft time on that server. So yeah, I'm going tp quit now because of that.<br><br>I'm not trying to be mean, but I find some faulty bits in the server that pulled me away from it. A server usually has good features, this server has lots. However, I felt happier in that other server than Avicus because there is more of a community there, and everyone gets involved. It's not a place where people throw insults when they lost. Personally, not trying to be mean, I like chats with friendly messages instead of tonnes and tonnes of death messages.&nbsp;<br><br>I know that nobody knows me on the server, but I find building better than fighting and killing. Cya :/ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>(daymn this font looks fancy)

The game community is so different from the forum community. :P Most people don't even consider them part of the "committee" ^-^<br>Anyways, have a fun time building! ;p

As my student teacher said when she left earlier this year "Bye and have a good life!" but in all seriousness, it's sad to see you go m8 and sad to see another one leave the community. Miss you ;(
