OK so I've been playing and pvping since 2013, and every time i'm on avicus someone will kill me with one hit due to their knock back..... I've seen many tutorials on how to cause it but sprinting, hitting their legs, and even using Speed potions hasn't helped me at all. Do <b><u>Not</u></b> comment down here if you're going to have a salty opinion to this thread. Please someone reply to this, I'm just curious, and want to learn this technique.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;-Cyanide :D

What I do is just click my mouse very fast, which should give you a bit more knockback.

Hitting people while they're in the air tends to knock them back a good bit. So try and time it when they jump? idk

Their are many ways of getting alot of knockback. The probably well known one is hitting him while in the air. There is also a less known one. Everytime you are starting a sprint the first hit will deal extra knockback, the others will give them normal knockback. What you can do is spamming W to reset your sprint. I would try to sync it to your click speed as iti is also a little bit of a gamble, cause if you are doing it wrong the enemy can easily get you into a combo. Another way is a strategy called hybrid blockhitting. What you have to do is hit the enemy, block once, hit, block .... Because of the blocking you are going to reset your sprint and deal extra knockback. This technique is way harder to learn but if you got it you can do god combos.<br><br>Sry if there is any miss information. I'm not the best.

You can blockhit in 1.8, but it just renders differently.

I have three main ways I use to get knockback.&nbsp;<br><br><b>tl;dr: Crouch, block-hit, and shake your head.&nbsp;</b><br><br>Number one, it's important to understand that you get the highest knockback when you first start sprinting. You can take advantage of this to get some really amazing knockback. To do this, you must time your crouches. After you start sprinting, continue holding down the sprint button. Then, use your crouches to reset your sprint, making you start sprinting again, allowing you to get the best knockback. Once you get a lot of experience with it, you can start timing them to always get the highest amount possible. Also, crouching decreases knockback on <i>you</i>, making it even harder for your opponent to avoid getting knocked into the void.&nbsp;<br><br>Secondly, don't be afraid to block-hit. This can be quite beneficial because it obviously decreases damage and-- correct me if I'm wrong-- can let you reach a bit farther, allowing you to get those few extra hits. <br><br>Thirdly, quickly shaking your head in a "condensed" manner, so to speak, is also a good idea. Maybe it's just me, but I've noticed when I quickly shake my mouse around in a small amount of my screen, I tend to get more knockback and hits. <br><br>Enjoy c;

Second: dont crouch if you play against good players you can do this in avicus or something but dont do it in 1v1's against high elo players<br>Crouching while stop your sprint so it makes your reach not far enough to hit someone sometimes

Oh, yeah, since I assumed this post was made for information regarding Avicus PVP, I put this in because, after all, from my experience, it's one of the biggest factors that affects knockback. But yeah, I wouldn't recommend doing this in a 1v1, either :p<br><br>Also, I've done a lot of experimenting, and it definitely seems to me that shaking your head does, in fact, increase your knockback :I<br><br>P.S. <br>Your IQ remains relatively the same, regardless of age ._.

Oh, yeah, since I assumed this post was made for information regarding Avicus PVP, I put this in because, after all, from my experience, it's one of the biggest factors that affects knockback. But yeah, I wouldn't recommend doing this in a 1v1, either :p<br><br>Also, I've done a lot of experimenting, and it definitely seems to me that shaking your head does, in fact, increase your knockback :I<br><br>P.S. <br>Your IQ remains relatively the same, regardless of age ._.

Since you are 'experienced' could you beat someone like dualz or mlgtino<br>cuz i just watched one of your 1v1 vids where you were getting rekt by a random while giving tips to players that are better then you<br><br>you could be good in avicus (ping) but you wouldt be good in any fachtion server or in a fight against a decent player

Yes, it is just a game. I'm sorry if I angered or offended you in any way; I was only trying to help SirCyanide by giving any information I knew about getting knockback on a server I've spent a lot of game time on. Yes, I'm not even that good at PVP, and those people could completely destroy me. I don't quite understand why you keep wanting to point out how bad I am when all I do is try to help someone who needs it. Also, I don't think I ever said anything about being good in the first place. I just know how to get good knockback xD<br><br>Once again, I apologize for whatever I did.

Another way to actually get more knockback (in addition to what I told you on the first page), is to kind of shake your mouse very slightly from side to side.&nbsp;<br>I'm starting to do this more in my videos, and it's definitely helping me to deal more knockback. :)

So many cringeworthy posts that are so incredibly inaccurate. I'm going to shed some light on this.

"<br></b><span>I'm sorry what? That's not even how KB mechanics work. If you do it's either because you have 0-50ms (very good ms) or the 80-120ms, typically&nbsp;referred&nbsp;to as the "spanish knockback". Minecraft is one of the&nbsp;most ms based games out there and ping affects pvp skill so much. Also the reason why "ping warriors" don't take any KB.&nbsp;<br><br></span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; "><b>"blockhitting gives you more kb"<br></b>Myth. It barely gives you any KB and if someone is sending you flying it's either because they are hybrid blockhitting. (Or the ms range i mentioned previously)&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; ">That's how you get insane reach usually.

Play on Badlion ranked ladders and Kohi ladders, etc. Don't try to perform a certain playstyle, have people improve your current technique and you will develop your own unique pvp style. You will get good trust me. And use a sprint key if you aren't (it's 1.8 already for god's sake)<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b><br><br><br></b></span>

W spam (it's called wobbling btw) only works if you time it right. The whole point of it is to re-engage your sprint to get the initial hit KB effect. However if you time it late you won't be sprinting when you engage your initial hit and it will fuck you over completely. time it too early and you won't get the effect. You don't need to wobble all the way when engaging in the combo itself.

I fight some impact members on a daily basis and i've been on OCN for a year +. p sure i know my famous players, thank you very much. Also i know trail from like 10+ months ago, i haven't talked to him since then tho. Also i said it's not a requirement. If you molest your w spam constantly during the combo you will fuck it over.

I fight some impact members on a daily basis and i've been on OCN for a year +. p sure i know my famous players, thank you very much. Also i know trail from like 10+ months ago, i haven't talked to him since then tho. Also i said it's not a requirement. If you molest your w spam constantly during the combo you will fuck it over.
