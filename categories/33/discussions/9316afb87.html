Title says all, spawnkillers, fast hit glitch, contact me when this glitch will be fixed, this is like kill aura and really really anoying. Goodbye Nexus :/

That's a random glitch who is doing 5 hits in one hit only...

Supposedly, Nexus now has very good hit detection which makes it very difficult to play for some people.

People have been complaining only about Nexus. I'm not a huge expert on the subject I was just relaying what I had heard :c

This glitch makes you hit as fast as the game lets you (4 Hits/sec) and it looks non-legit. Not even the best autoclicker can do that, i don't think.
