OK, someone is in Nebula, they are playing and then suddenly you break a rule that they only did one time and get temp-banned for it no second chance. I will be standing up for them the next time a staff member does that because they nee a second chance so if they have their warning, they will often won't do it again. if your child goes on the computer for too long, you'll ground them just like that decision is final? If some pre-school kids were misbehaving, you would punish them? I don't believe in no second chances, I would just kick them even if they were hacking; so can you please give players a second chance? It's called courage.

Kick a hacker? Dude they obviously know they are breaking the rules, as every server has ruled against hacking.&nbsp;<br><br><br>Also as as a player it should be your responsibility to know the rules.You should also have some idea of what the rules may be if you haven't read them, still

I don't believe in no second chance rules, I don't believe in instant discipline, believe people should be spared which is not that hard. It is easy to lose your cool I admit but maybe if you thought about what you are doing, you can calmly tell them to not do it again. I have a disorder that I go berserk but I know how to deal with misbehaviour.

D00ZiE, a kick is a second chance because you can go back and know what you can do and what not do. Grounding your child isn't a second chance so temp-ban isn't.

May i just point out this is not preschool.... The server , i would say consists mainly from 12-17 year olds,who mostly &nbsp;understand basic rules and punishments.Also how would a screen saying "you have been banned" make someone terrified? If it does you may want to seek some medical help.By the way... don't "tell" the staff how to do their job if you wanna complain about &nbsp;a certain staff member contact Fluenza_.<br><br>Basically can you please accept the fact this will never happen.Giving a hacker a second chance is like giving a serial killer a second chance they have already destroyed enough of the community that they don't deserve to comeback...<br><br>Also if they really want to say sorry they may appeal at , support@avicus.net and then they may get a second &nbsp;chance.<br><br>This topic should be locked before this goes to a complete flame war at mooncat , we don't mean to make you feel dumb.We are simply saying why these rules are in place otherwise the server would be chaotic.

It's acceptable for any length. It is a second chance, but to be honest. If someone is breaking the rules the first time, then continue to do it. They should be temp-banned/banned.

That's no different from a kick.<br><br>And also, the second chance isn't the tempban IMO. It's whether or not they choose to appeal. In which case, it's their problem then.

Im just saying...<br>You would make a really bad parent if this is the attitude you're gonna put up.<br><br>Think of it this way....If you give your child a second chance&nbsp;<i>every</i> time they do something wrong, they are just going to do it again, thinking that's all that's gonna happen to them.<br><br>Just like with a hacker. If you just kick them, aren't you just kicking them from the game, only to have them come back on with the hacks a couple of seconds later? Kicking has no impact on hackers....
