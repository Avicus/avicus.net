So, i've read the staff team post, about the account hacking website.... Now can someone in FULL Detail explain, What the website is, What it does, And how did it force staff to message players to log on to the site, I did not hear full detail about this, so if anyone could explain that would be great :).<br><br><b>I have:<br><br>Deleted Skype, Deleted TS, Deleted MC (For now), Deleted my E-Mail, etc.&nbsp;<br><br><br><br><br></b>***I am fine with this being locked due to: Privacy, Spam. :)<br><b><br>Have a nice day!<br><br><br><br></b>

OKAY. No need to freak here, take a deep breath. So, I'll try to explain all I know.. Or at least what I've heard. This link was a scam of The Hive's website, it would make it so you had to log in or register to view a discussion. Some of our Avicus players signed up, what this did was key log them. Then the compromised accounts would send the link around to their contacts, a whole chain. If you clicked on it, it shouldn't put you in like any danger. But yeah, don't need to worry! You'll be fine :)

Don't worry, I got worried too. I ended up changing pretty much my password for everything. Then my freaking sugar effect kicked in and I realized that I would be safe as removed the person from my contacts, blocked them and deleted the conversation.. You know in case you just so happened to click on it by accident, but clicking on it shouldn't put you in danger.

I was given the link by a random person on TeamSpeak, (All TS servers can be found with a server list, so random people come on every once in a while) that didn't seem to be Avicus related.<br><br>Currently no, we may be able to get it if we encounter him on TS again, but since he doesn't appear to be an Avicus player, there isn't a need for it yet.

Some websites have "Auto IP" or whatever, and when u click the link it automatically steals your IP without even knowing, then using that IP "Adress" you can get into online Data, However the owner of their accounts can restore them, in a matter between 3 minutes and 4 years. I have been coding for about... 5-7 years, and i do understand some of their knowledge. But if they use your IP to get your security information, you can simply call the FBI to track down the IP User :)<br><br><u></u>If it is not an IP stealers just an account corrupter, then... LEARN TO CODE WOULD YA!?!

Yeah, let's focus on hackers instead of murderers and bank robbers.<br>Phishers are not the easiest to catch anyway.<br>Not to mention the FBI focus on more advanced hackers such as DDoSers

It was from The Hive, notice in the URL it says Hivecm, not Hivemc. Yes it looks legit, but if you signup with your Skype/minecraft email and password, it is logged and used to get into them. I unfortunately put my Skype email in, but I instantly changed the password, I knew something was wrong. Then I messaged all my contacts (164 people) and warned them about this.

This morning Jozz send me a link. He said "why you swearing at me ?" and i clicked it. It was a link to the HiveMC forums (sowwy if advs) but with mc in reverse ("cm"). I just checked jozz account and saw that he gets banned for compromisses account (already unbanned btw) and now im scared....<br><br><b>EDIT:</b> I didn't read the replies of this posts. Seems like the hack is already deleted or something. When i clicked it says the page was not found or something like that.

Some websites have "Auto IP" or whatever, and when u click the link it automatically steals your IP without even knowing, then using that IP "Adress" you can get into online Data, However the owner of their accounts can restore them, in a matter between 3 minutes and 4 years. I have been coding for about... 5-7 years, and i do understand some of their knowledge. But if they use your IP to get your security information, you can simply call the FBI to track down the IP User :)<br><br><u></u>If it is not an IP stealers just an account corrupter, then... LEARN TO CODE WOULD YA!?!

Just about all website record your IP address. Ip addresses can not get access to security information. They are easily accessible as well.

And this is why link safety is more important than ever.<br>See, look at this.<br>[Removed for Secruity Purposes]<br>That link contains a keylogger, because that isn't a real gyazo link. &nbsp;Look at it again, and see that it says gyazo.in, not gyazo.com. &nbsp;Always watch what links you click, and do not click on redirects such as bit.ly.<br><br>If I'm not allowed to show that picture, please remove it.

Well.... Interesting... Get the server to get his IP (If he joined the server) and contact the FBI so they track em down!!!

The FBI doesn't care about "hacked minecraft accounts." Contacting them is just as useful as calling an ambulance because you got a paper cut.

This, they will only pretty much look into it if a few bank accounts got hacked or something else.

You're safe as long as you DID NOT click ANY links from a staff member on Skype, so as long as you didn't do that, you're fine.
