I hate TDM's it does not deliver fair game play to most players, It rely's on players to have Ultra good Ping (Avicus server response time to their computer) and a big deal of it is just luck.. i would not like to hinder my KD ratio on some kid that doesn't need skill to kill me. all is said. end of story.

I don't think we'll see CTW around anytime soon...<br>And yes Notal, I meant game boards like TDM01, TDM02, however there won't be that much boards for it, atleast 2-3 would be fine :)

Will OitN or whatever it's called be still in the rotations? I like that as it's nice to break up from all the DTM once in awhile.

I mean I Don't think it should be fully taken out because there are some good maps but then also why do they have nexus but I want OITN in nebula its so much fun and makes your KD higher.

Thanks Evocal for being so creative with the TDM maps! Even though it is a fun game, could we make a separate mini game for team death match? Maybe you could make a One in the chamber mini game! Or it could be included in the nexus mini game.

It doesn't really rely on ping. This is just like any ordinary nebula game except of the fact they are couting kills as a score. Rage is Ping based doe :c

Wait, so we're getting a seperate board for TDM? Yes! IMO TDM belongs in Nexus and I hate waiting for them to rotate to DTM.
