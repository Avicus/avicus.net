I'd prefer Frostbite&nbsp;to be removed as suppose to remaking/editing Frostbite. It's an MC Zone map, and I wouldn't want to see it edited again, or remade.

No no no. This map is perfect as it is, might add iron closer to the castle because of killfarming but otherwise this map is perfect.

I agree. No offense to the map developers, but imo McZone map edits are generally making the map worse.

I personally think that it is the best map on the server. It's the only map that people&nbsp;work well together to make defenses. It also gives the rushing community a real challenge being:&nbsp;the huge gap between the islands, the huge plain to run across, the many diamond people to avoid, the raised monuments, defenders, and the&nbsp;wacky spawn block protection where you cant build up at all (only thing that should be changed). Also, I think the extra armor helps rushers out so that they can take less off, and the efficiency picks make it a bit easier with all the challenges. The&nbsp; problem isn't the map, it's the community. Not everyone rushes or can do it very well, and this gives them practice, which after so many stalemates, I fell in love with rushing on it. (Tip: use diamond to rush) That's my opinion, but so far I can see I'm alone on this opinion. :P<br>To bad

Many of them were too close to the spawn and even shooting in the spawn. That's not killfarming, that's spawnkilling. There's a difference.<br>This video may as well be a player report.

Frostbite used to be my favourite map when I was on McZone, but now I think it's a bit OP. I think we should remove it because another problem with the map is it is almost impossible I find to rush because diamonds would just be camped around their spawn and people sometimes when they have a full set of diamond armor, people will grab the diamond blocks and throw them in the void. Defeats the purpose of the diamonds. I actually think if there were no monuments and no void to fill in it could be a great Nexus map.

In my opinion, frostbite is one of my favourite maps, if not my favourite. You can either set up awesome defences atop castle walls, build awesome sky bridges or long looping ones that go around the map and finally, have an awesome rush with your teammates. In my opinion, if someone sets up a kill farm against your team, it's your fault for letting them on to your island in the first place and not being ready. Sorry but I love frostbite.
