New walls kits?

I feel that walls is slowly going down. In my opinion I still love it and all the new maps coming in but it still needs something. Most of the kits are great but there are some that need fixed or just removed. Stomper as an example, It's way OP and has been for a while. It needs to not hurt teammates and do a lot less damage to other players.<br><br><br>My ideas for some changes to kits or new kits:&nbsp;<br><br>-Stomper, I have already said that above.<br><br>-Cow, I understand it's a low level and it can't be to OP, but it needs to have better saturation. You eat the grass and almost instantly its gone.<br><br>-Civilian, maybe a stone sword instead. or a stone pick and a cooked pork chop. Not to OP but it still helps. I have joined many games where I don't have time to pick a kit and civilian isn't helpful at all... all I can do is just throw out the stuff.

Easily counter stomper, wear a helmet.... (and if you think stomper's OP, look at MCHG)<br><br>Cow is really a useless kit, +1<br><br>Civilian is meant to be useless. It's the starting kit. Mine and stuff.

sorry I didn't get to finish. My iPad messed up and I couldn't see farther then where it is now. I'll just finish the post here<br><br>-Miner, stone pick efficiency 2. Still not to OP but dwarf needed something new and so did miner and civilian. So Tia is what I've come up with.<br><br>-Dwarf, Iron pick&nbsp;<br><br>- summoner, it gives you mob eggs that are pointless. it needs only animal eggs. Maybe spiders for string but everything else just doesn't make any sense to have,<br><br>-posiden, maybe regeneration 2 instead or just regeneration 1.<br><br>-Stomper, Another thing we could add to that. Instead off transferring the damage to other players. maybe it gives you a regeneration for a period of time or another potion effect.

I have not put anything down yet - but I agree that some of the walls kits could use a refresh. I would like to see some slightly more helpful kits sooner in the game, to keep the new player excited about getting to the next level. The starting kits , in my opinion, should be about helping the new players survive better, getting equipped quicker, Defensive in nature. &nbsp;The later kits more focused on the direct PVP interactions as you already know how to prepare and how to do it quickly, but still not making the player over powered. We should also look at the mid range kits as we have some that get used very little.

Just realized it will probably be pretty powerful for sky bases so maybe make it a higher level if you do end up making a kit for it.

Nerf the speed 2 kit. In my opinion stomper has always needed a nerf, but since everyone uses it nobody will agree with me.

It normally takes 3 bones give or take to tame a wolf &nbsp;- with my luck anyway...<br><br><ul><li><b>Snowman~</b></li><li>Level: 9</li><li>Starting items: 10x Snowballs.</li><li>Ability: Hitting enemies with a snowball gives them blindness/slowness. 33% chance of getting 2 snowballs after killing a player.</li></ul>I do not know the timing on each part for the blind/slow, but please let slowness last a little longer than blindness. It could be used to slow runners and to get away making it useful. If the blind is the main part of the kit it will be rarely used.<br><br><ul><li><b>Spider~</b></li><li>Level: 19</li><li>Starting items: 1x Stick.</li><li>Ability: Right click your stick of webs to shoot a cobweb. Constant Jump 2 effect.</li></ul>Just want to make sure this kit has a web cool down of a few sec. filling the map up with webs can be problematic in lots of ways.<br><br><ul><li><b>Smelter~</b></li><li>Level: 21</li><li>Starting items: None.</li><li>Ability: Right click a furnace while holding any ingot/uncooked meat to instantly smelt it.</li></ul>Can this Kit come with an Anvil? Seems like that would make the kit really cool on some maps.<br><br><ul><li><b>Cookiemonster~</b></li><li>Level: 28</li><li>Starting items: 5x cookies.</li><li><span>Ability: Right click a cookie to gain a random positive potion effect. 25% chance of getting a cookie per kill.<br></span></li></ul>Can the player start with 10 cookies? some maps do not have a way to make more cookies... also can the effect last longer than 6 sec? can we go for 15 sec+? I have used this kit and it is really tough to get any benefit from such short buff periods, it most of the time just turns into a chore that is not worth remembering to do.<br><br><ul><li><b>Wither~</b></li><li>Level: 32</li><li>Starting items: 1x Stone hoe.</li><li>Ability: Hitting players with your hoe (scythe) has a 50% chance of giving your enemies the wither effect.</li></ul>As this kit stands today its really hard to get any use from it. the damage is way to low and the switching weapons to the hoe and back most of the time turns out badly... and if you hit and no effect the other guy is going to start the fight ahead.. If the kit is designed like it is today it will not be used often.<br><br><ul><li><b>Ghast~</b></li><li>Level: 33</li><li>Starting items: 1x Fireball.</li><li>Ability: Right click your fireball to shoot fireballs.</li></ul>As this is a new kit it may be designed great, but if the fireball is anything like the fireball on missile wars it will be pretty useless. If you have to stop, place aim and shoot/hit - I would rethink this kit.<br><br><ul><li><b>Maniac~</b></li><li>Level: 45</li><li>Starting items: None.</li><li>Ability: Gain strength from your kills.</li></ul>Can this STR buff last longer than 6sec? &nbsp;10-15 sec?<br><br>Last may I suggest:<br>&nbsp;a <b>TNT bow Kit?</b><br>Bow and 5 TNT arrows get 1 TNT arrow on player kill&nbsp;<br>small cool-down on shooting arrows. like 3 sec. would be great if the arrow was able to act like an arrow and not TNT , so it could stick to &nbsp;a skybase etc...<br><br>Thanks for reading - I know a lot of the kits will have to be balanced, but for now I hope you consider some of my views. Thanks again.

I agree with polar for all of what he said but I'd like to add stomper in there to :P What percent of your fall damage is transfered? if it's 50% or above it needs to be reduced lol CUZ if someone can jump off of 50ish blocks and kill you so easy it's too OP.... my thought was that either -it's doesn't transfer fall damage and you just simply don't take fall damage or -it only transfers like 10% because as of right now it needs a nerf lol

My opinions:&nbsp;<br><br><b>Miner</b>: Raise the level. Iron Pick is op at the start of the game<br><br><b>Cook</b>: 5 Cooked Steak isn't much. Maybe raise it to 7-10?<br><br><b>BeastMaster</b>: More Bones<br><br><b>Posiden</b>: I believe this fishing rod would be op. Pulling players off their sky bases and what not. Specific amount of uses for 1 rod? Like 4 pull-backs?<br><br><b>Healer</b>: Lessen the amount of gear obtained<br><br><b>Spider</b>: You should have a specific amount of times you can use the web<br><br><b>Smelter</b>: Should have a specific amount of uses&nbsp;<br><br><b>Sonic</b>: Needs to be speed 1 or higher level<br><br><b>Cookiemonster</b>: Needs more cookies. 5 isn't much<br><br><b>Leech</b>: I don't see how this is different from using a splash potion of healing. Lessen the level since it's not too op including after a 1v1 you have time to regen hearts.<br><br><b>Wither</b>: Maybe Sharpness 2 Hoe? It's not really powerful.<br><br><b>Fireman</b>: Maybe a flint and steel or regen in lava like Poseidon?<br><br><b>Assassin</b>: How will this shuriken work? Will it be like throwing a snowball and how much damage would it be?

As for my thoughts on Kit &nbsp;levels I see no problem getting an Iron pick at lvl 1, I mean its an iron pick... Newer players will love the ability to &nbsp;get ready faster. I think all the kit levels are fine in my opinion. They all need game play testing, and I am sure things will change, but good job +1.

nice post, i agree with stomper, and the cow one could be slightly altered i suppose, +1<br><br>Also with the level kits that require premium, i think keep the premium for that level, but maybe next to it have a kit for the same level that you don't need to be a donator to get, but they aren't quite as OP :)<br><br>Other than that, like you, i still love walls :)

yea OPTOBAT I agree I like that with the premuim kit thing ^_^ it would add more kits and I think a new feeling to play for those people who are like 1 or 2 lvls below a premium kit... it gives then a reason to keep playing to get the other kit not just to get to the lvl and get nothing out of it

My thoughts:<br><br>Beastmaster needs more bones, say, 8x or 10x bones.&nbsp; You should have a very good chance of getting three wolves, with five a lot of times you only get one or two wolves.<br><br>
Lumberjack:&nbsp; make the axe so it does the same damage as an iron sword, plus the wood cutting abilities.<br><br>Archer:&nbsp; give the bow punch 1, or if possible give it a random attribute like maybe 1/3 chance punch, 1/3 chance flame, 1/3 chance power 1.&nbsp; No need for bonus arrows with kills.<br><br>Sonic:&nbsp; It has to have a time limit, else people will just run around avoiding the attackers. Maybe a five minute time limit?&nbsp; Give me a permanent speed 2 boost and I can make a game last over an hour.&nbsp; Speed 2 is a 40% speed increase.<br><br>Assassin:&nbsp; Same thing, speed 1 (swiftness 1) is a 20% speed increase.&nbsp; Don't make it permanent, make it a potion with maybe a five minute time limit.<br><br>I don't think Spider would work as a kit.&nbsp; You can't give somebody unlimited spider webs.<br><br>While we are talking about Walls:<br><br>1. Fix fire so that it spreads.&nbsp; Burning trees / skybases is a part of the game.<br><br>2. Change it so that leaves can decay. <br><br>3. Get rid of the "no shooting over walls before wall drop" rule.&nbsp; Before that rule was made it was a race to gather stuff and build quickly, of you could always build further back.&nbsp; Honestly, ask the more experienced players if they like this rule and you will hear a strong "no, get rid of it".<br><br>4. Stop saying that going to the alternate world (when killed by a spectator) is "glitch abuse and you go there we will ban you".&nbsp; It is not glitch abuse.&nbsp; As long as you are not holding up the game why not go there and have fun?<br><br>5. Stop accepting new maps.&nbsp; There are some really good ones out there (thanks to Polar, Itaity, etc), pick ten and use only those maps for a few months.&nbsp; Let people get used to the maps without having to learn new maps all the time.

Ok so<br><br>1. I agree<br>2. I agree<br>3. In the "build phase" there isn't supposed to be PVP so you aren't supposed to kill players<br>4. I believe this rule is only on nebula since in nebula you can break blocks there&nbsp;<br>5. The matches would get boring without any variety. Switching maps around will show variety in the maps avicus uses

4. I believe the "Do not abuse glitches rule" applies to all gamemodes. Going into a survival world is a glitch since it was not intended. While there may not be anything bad about it per say, the rule is the rule and I don't think this is an exception

Normally I would have a debate point, but today, I am just glad people are talking about walls. I don't know how things will work with ability vs potion, I just ask that things be tested some before final release. I am also glad the devs &nbsp;are looking into new abilities and kit types. So thank you for that. As for the fire I do miss that, but I think map makers should have the ability to turn off fire on maps that are designed to not burn, &nbsp;but I would think most maps should have the ability to burn. I am thinking lag is the reason for the no burn. Again thanks everyone for working on the walls game mode.

(Yes I know this is a BIG bump)&nbsp;<br><br>I had a few more ideas. :)<br><br>- add a jukebox and a random disc to lumberjack? just to make it a little more fun. :)<br><br>- (a little off topic) but maybe a post that has everything for each game mode that is going to be added? Like: Kits, spawns, abilities, ect.
