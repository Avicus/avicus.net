Every time I see the broadcast that titans is the next map a plethora of complaints appear in chat. It doesn't feel right to have a random pot pvp map in the rots. If Avicus were to make more pot pvp maps then maybe they could have their own neb server, but for the time being it's just an eyesore. &nbsp;Maybe the devs can turn it into a dtm/tdm map? <br><br>If you have any other suggestions I would love to hear them.

I think he means without potions, meaning like all of our regular TDM/DTM maps we have. tbh I don't like that map either, it seems way to hard to kill people and it ends up in getting teamed up on or kill stealed, I agree with d00zie

I think it gets a lot of undeserved hate because it is different. The same thing as Clay Wars. I suck at pot pvp but I still find the map fun because it has a different style of gameplay that all the other maps in the rots. Sure there may be a few problems with it as I said earlier, but it's a decent map.

I like it because it's fun, pot pvp is my style, and your team mates actually help, plus kill stealing is technically teamwork so I don't mind. The one thing I don't like about this map is the fact so many people go into the opponent's spawn.
