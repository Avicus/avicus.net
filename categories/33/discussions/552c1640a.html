i understand about his a lot of infraction but the thing is, if he's changing and you just banned him for too many infractions, that is BS tbh. it's like killing a final chance to that person to change for the better which is a very sad thing. or, a mod should have told him like for example: "this is your final chance. if you commit another infraction, you'll be banned immediately."

Think of it this way:<br><br>One of the Jr Mods has lots of infractions (like 10 or something).&nbsp;<br>Then out of the blue one of the mods ban him for too many infractions. What's the difference between that and what's happening now?<br><br>Honestly, he might've learned his lesson. I see virtual nothing correct with banning him for doing nothing.

Strongy, I know that you may have changed, but 19 infractions?! &nbsp;There was a lot of times to change your ways.. I know how you feel honestly, I was demoted on a server without any warnings. The thing is though: I had a pretty good idea this was going to happy due ro my "immature" behaviour and role play.. But ever since I've was demoted I've met a bunch of new, even more friendly friends on Avicus. I wish you the best of luck in your new adventure if you aren't unbanned! :D

I know i derserve this ban but I am not coming back so I wanted to say good bye to everyone so bye and as Awarriorvenom said avicus doesn't need me they don't and they don't need a lot of players but I NEED avicus so much.avicus was meant for people to play on and have fun but not be needed theirs a lot of hackers still around E.g their is jeromeservent with ai bõ the has been banned once for aim not and still uses it . Theirs probely a lot of players that you don't need so mods make sure if you see someone hacking ban them like you usually do but they get unbanned sometimes and comeback on agian hacking so we have to be careful to make sure they make the community happy and &nbsp; I am sorry for all my bad behaviour everyone is free,to judge me but I had improved and i probely wont comeback cause a ban lasts for what 3 months and I can't even survive 3 days without playing on avicus çause it is soo fun and addicting. Thanks for all the helpful kind mods and for the spawn campers like alekpower -_- and thanks for their wonderful job in the game I am happy of every single mod including Joan,dicta,Nolan,emerald, and everyone else and most of all izjust4fun has been the kindest mod to me and is the most helpfull mod I have seen all though all of the other mods are still great. But thankyou for all your support guys. Sorry i am leaving it was my fault not anyone else's have fun all others playing avicus and. Am very sorry if I got you upset and annoyed But sorry. I am going for i long while and i probely wont comeback GoodLuck and keel up avicus amazing work which will one day be the best server on earth! I have done a lot of bad Things lately and I would like to change 1 rule on avicus...... That if,you have soooooooo many infractions that you &nbsp;risk a ban for too many infractions the mod can only ban you if you do something wrong again. A lot of,the time I get kicked for caps not knowing I have caps on . And I know that attracts a lot of the people so everyone time kk look at my keyboard and i type i make sure that it's not on caps. I will remember all the friends I had on avicus and I am literally crowing right now so please change that rule i think its unfair unless they do it agian becuase i generally just said, hello and emerald said goodbye in short terms :Strongy1210: hi emeraldsword85:goodbye.. When I looked that. Got banned . Agar ant has been a. Silent man on the forums not the most popular but he was very kind he requested as many people friend ship ass possible and that takes a long time . He is a great role model avicus can take after, he respects people all the time and has soooo many friends yet he remembers all of them.good bye everyone I am sorry that I have to go and for everything I have done that wasn't right.

This is silly. Let me say, yes Strongy's infractions list is quite obnoxious and every growing, but aside from that he is one of the nicest, passive people of this sometimes feral community. I also want to point out how he uses past tense, and how he says he has changed. I for one believe that he has changed, and come to be an amazing mature (more mature than he was at least) and selfless person. We all make mistakes, and he has made apparently 19 outstanding ones. I know these are his fault and he may have to deal with the consequences, but lets be honest: You can't keep every little 'swear' word to yourself can you? Spamming stuff in caps, its human nature to react like this and we have all done it, realizing it or not.<br><br>Now Emerald, I'm going to take a punt at you here, but you really haven't done anything wrong. As far as I know Strongy just said 'hi' and had a ban slapped on his face. This 'too many infractions' rubbish, is absurd and down right silly, as people can not sometimes help their reactions, whether they have an issue or not. NOT SAYING ANYONE DOES, but maybe take that into consideration. I know everyone is just like 'Oh ignore it' or what ever, but it just gets annoying. This really (IN MY OPINION) was not the way to respond to his infractions list, as long as it may be. I'm not going to tell you how to do what ever, but that was just baffling to me.<br><br>If you don't agree with me or this stirs too much trouble, I will archive or undoubtedly a Moderator will. I also just want to say that this may seem rude, but i really believe that this was unnecessary on Emeralds behalf. I don't want to cause a flame over this so please just... I don't know, I am being hypocritical here...<br><br>Please don't hate me because I had a swing at a Moderator, and a great Mod at that.

This is silly. Let me say, yes Strongy's infractions list is quite obnoxious and every growing, but aside from that he is one of the nicest, passive people of this sometimes feral community. I also want to point out how he uses past tense, and how he says he has changed. I for one believe that he has changed, and come to be an amazing mature (more mature than he was at least) and selfless person. We all make mistakes, and he has made apparently 19 outstanding ones. I know these are his fault and he may have to deal with the consequences, but lets be honest: You can't keep every little 'swear' word to yourself can you? Spamming stuff in caps, its human nature to react like this and we have all done it, realizing it or not.<br><br>Now Emerald, I'm going to take a punt at you here, but you really haven't done anything wrong. As far as I know Strongy just said 'hi' and had a ban slapped on his face. This 'too many infractions' rubbish, is absurd and down right silly, as people can not sometimes help their reactions, whether they have an issue or not. NOT SAYING ANYONE DOES, but maybe take that into consideration. I know everyone is just like 'Oh ignore it' or what ever, but it just gets annoying. This really (IN MY OPINION) was not the way to respond to his infractions list, as long as it may be. I'm not going to tell you how to do what ever, but that was just baffling to me.<br><br>If you don't agree with me or this stirs too much trouble, I will archive or undoubtedly a Moderator will. I also just want to say that this may seem rude, but i really believe that this was unnecessary on Emeralds behalf. I don't want to cause a flame over this so please just... I don't know, I am being hypocritical here...<br><br>Please don't hate me because I had a swing at a Moderator, and a great Mod at that.

Thing is, I doubt this was just Emmy's decision, I'm sure there was a debate about it in the staff chat and Emmy just happened to be the one to punish him. He deserves the ban, especially after all of this forum spam.

Honestly, Too many infractions is a BS way to punish people, or at least the way it happened to him.<br>Hi!<br>You have been banned from the server.<br>Reason: Too many infractions.<br>You should have at least waited until he did something wrong.

You should be able to control yourself from getting punished at the 3rd infraction, not the 19th.<br><br>Anyways, this thread isn't really going anywhere, Emmy made the right decision here.<br><br>I am going to lock this, you can e-mail support@avicus.net to appeal, or contact a manager+ on Skype.
