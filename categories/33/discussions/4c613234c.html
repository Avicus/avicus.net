This was initially planned before Avicore came out, but since there are two empty slots in the Hub, I was wondering why not make a new game. If you're going to say "The Game Committee is dead" or "No more games will be accepted (unless this is an official message)", then don't read on. However, if you want to help make the server and the community larger and better, then, by all means, read on! And please, every single piece of feedback is accepted, so please tell me if anything is confusing, over-powered, or just plain boring!&nbsp;<u><br><br>BackStory</u><br><span>The year is 3050, and the world is in ruins. During World War III, the U.S. Army created a weapon of mass destruction, a missile that, when detonated, would spread a lethal bacteria that would slowly kill the brain of the affected. Unfortunately, the General fell asleep at the main computer and his face hit the detonate button. But instead of releasing one missile, it&nbsp;released&nbsp;all 5 thousand&nbsp;missiles. The majority of people were affected, except for the few &nbsp;who got to safety. These people now have to protect the only thing that is keeping both them and the world alive, The&nbsp;<i>Heart Shard</i>.</span><br><br>There are two teams, survivors and zombies. The survivors are in a multistory building, with one side open with holes for the zombies to enter in. The survivors start with the kit they choose (specified later on), and building materials to clog the holes (16 cobblestone, 16 wood planks, 16 wool). Then, there are the zombies. They start off with the kit they choose, and after each death move to the next kit (confusing right now but read on!).&nbsp;<br><br><u>How to Win<br></u>The survivors win if they keep back the zombies for 15 minutes from the wool at the back of the building (called the <i>Heart Shard</i>). The wool is a 3x3x3 block of red wool, so you can't win by breaking one wool. The zombies win if they break the wool. Pretty basic.<br><br><u>Phases</u><br>There are two phases in the game, the preparation phase and the attack phase. The preparation phase is 3 minutes, and the attack phase is 12 minutes (15 minutes total game). The preparation phase allows survivors to clog up the holes.&nbsp;<b>IMPORTANT: THE HOLES ARE SOMEWHAT CLOGGED WHEN THE MAP STARTS, BUT IT IS EASY FOR ZOMBIES TO BREAK THROUGH!</b>&nbsp;During the preparation phase, the zombies select their kits in a enclosed waiting zone overlooking the map. Since there are 3 sections of kits, people have to choose wisely and therefore need time.<br><br><u>How is this unique?</u><br>So, a game of attackers vs. defenders, so creative, right?&nbsp;<b>WRONG</b>. Remember how the disease makes the infected humans crazier slowly? So, the zombies start off with their first kit, which is a basic kit with not very good perks. The zombies die once, then they move on to the next kit. Then the next. Then the next. There are only 3-4 lives for the zombies, but when they reach one heart they give off a symbol. This is when teammates become important. They can revive fellow zombies, using a golden hoe, called the&nbsp;<i>Undead Touch</i>. The hoe has a durability of ten revives per each life, so there aren't unlimited revives. Continuing on the one heart idea, reaching one heart, the nearly dead zombie gives off some kind of signal, such as a sound. However, when they make this sound they also give off music notes for 2 seconds, so those without sound can also revive. Now to the kits...<br><br><u><b><i>KITS!!!!<br><br></i></b></u><u>Survivor Kits</u><br><b>Level 1 Kit</b>: Random Straggler: Just this random guy who wants to live, not really special.<br><i>Starts with:</i>&nbsp;Full leather armor (choose colo(u)r dye)&nbsp;with protection I on chestplate, normal (or infinity) bow, 2 stacks of arrows if not infinity, stone sword with knockback I<br><b>Level 3 Kit:</b>&nbsp;Clueless Combatant: Who? What? Where? Give this guy a sword and he will fight, even if he doesn't know what for.<br><i>Starts with</i>: [To be added]<br><b>Level 5 Kit</b>: Death Dealer: He/she has just learned about what happened, is ready to fight, not that knowledgable about combat.<br><i>Starts with:</i>&nbsp;Full chain armor with protection II on chestplate, same bow as above but has power 1, stone sword with sharpness I knockback I (or II?)<br><b>Level 7 Kit</b>: Smart Soldier: He/she was just got out of army camp and now has to show off their skills in the battle to the death<br><i>Starts with</i>: Full Iron armor with green dyed leather helmet, Rifle (Bow)&nbsp;with punch I and power I, combat knife&nbsp;[iron sword] with knockback II and sharpness I<br><b>Level 10 Kit</b>: Sumo Wrestler: Big, Fat, and Strong. When you need to use brute force, this is the guy.<br><i>Starts with</i>: Full Iron except Black dyed leather pants. Has Stone Sword with Knockback V (Reason for Stone) and Bow with Punch II. Also has 2 Splash Potions of Weakness (0:30) and has infinite slowness 2.<br><br><b><i>*Kit Idea*</i></b><br><b>Level 50 Kit</b>: Death's Touch: Killing has never been so easy<br><i>Starts with</i>: Katana [iron sword] with sharpness III, Poison Dart Gun [bow] with 3 darts [arrows] and power IV punch II (Reason for 3 arrows){<i>ARROWS CAN BE PICKED UP}</i>. Full Leather Armor dyed black except for helmet which is a Wither Skelton Skull.&nbsp;<b><br>Remember, this is a level 50 kit!!!</b><br><u><br>Zombie Kits<br></u><i>All zombie kits have wood axes and pickaxes. This is to allow them to get through barriers. However, they also have&nbsp;<b>mining fatigue</b>, so they can't break through very quickly.</i><br><br><b></b><b></b><b><i>1st stage (Disease has not set in yet, almost human)<br></i></b><b>Level 1:</b>&nbsp;Vengeance Seeker- Why you? Why not them?<br><i>Starts with</i>: Leather hat dyed white (disease has aged their bodies), chain chestplate, iron leggings and boots. Kitchen Knife [Stone sword], sling shot [bow] with 15 stones [arrows]<br><b>Level 3:</b>&nbsp;Angry Psycho: Don't get in this guys way...<br><i>Starts with</i>: Iron helmet, chain chestplate with projectile protection I, iron leggings, leather boots dyed red. Hatchet [stone axe] with sharpness I, Handgun [bow] with 30 bullets [arrows] and power I.<br><b>Level 5:</b>&nbsp;Mental Hospital Patient- This guy has been in a mental hospital for 15 years, and has escaped. What will happen to those in his path?<br><i>Starts with:</i>&nbsp;Syringe [Iron sword] with sharpness I, shotgun [bow] with 20 bullets [arrows] and power I plus punch I (This is why there are 20 arrows)<br><b>Level 10:&nbsp;</b>Kamikaze- A real team player. This guy will lose one life to blow up a hole in the barricades defending the survivor. Get ready to rumble!<br><i>Starts with</i>: Wood sword with knockback I, rifle [bow] with 10 arrows, 2 automatic TNT, and one&nbsp;<b>self-destruct</b>&nbsp;[looks like skeleton head]. Has full leather armor all dyed black so it can sneak to the front lines.<br><b>IMPORTANT: The TNT that the Kamikaze has does damage to the survivors like TNT in water, except it also damages barricades. It does not damage the original building itself. The TNT does as much block damage as a normal TNT. The self-destruct destroys as much blocks as 3 TNT exploding side by side. This also damages the opponent, but not teammates themselves. Finally, right before the Kamikaze uses self-destruct, it turns red and a gold helmet flashes on and off on its head. The fuse is five seconds. The kamikaze will not explode if killed during this 5 second pause.<br></b><b><i></i></b><br><u>Shop</u><br>A shop could be something that both sides could use. Points would be earned by killing members of the other team. Kind of like Nebula.&nbsp;<br><i>Survivor Shop:<u></u></i><br><i></i>1 Point- Slapball: A snowball that does knockback 2 on whoever it hits! Good for keeping the survivors from being swarmed<br>3 Points- Potion of Regeneration (0:45) Good for an extra boost when getting mobbed<br>4 Points- Barrier blocks- These are random blocks that come in groups of 16. You click on the random block (possibly a chest item) and receive a random group of blocks! Great for reinforcing blockades and keeping out the zombies!<br>5 Points- Splash Potion of Swiftness (2:00) Give everyone nearby some speed! Good for getting from floor to floor quickly&nbsp;<br>7 Points-&nbsp;<b>DONATOR ONLY</b>- Boom Ball- Similar to the Grenades from Nebula, but there's a catch! When you throw this bomb, everyone in the explosion radius only loses 3 hearts! The main purpose is to create craters in the ground to make it difficult for zombies to get to the building<br><i>Zombie Shop</i>:<br>1 Point: Bloodlust (0:30) Need that extra boost? Buy this and kill those survivors!<br>4 Points:&nbsp;<i>Undead Touch</i>&nbsp;Refill- Reviving teammates is a tough job, and you can't do it forever when the golden hoe breaks. Right? WRONG! Get another 10 teammate revives for only 4 points!&nbsp;<br>5 Points: Launch Pad (Block) Its been boring walking, but now you can fly! Buy this launch pad and place it down, walking over it will boost you 10 blocks forward and up, and you take no fall damage! May death rain upon them!<br>7 Points:&nbsp;<b>DONATOR ONLY</b>&nbsp;Acid Spit (Egg) Those survivors have an eagle eye! Not anymore! Throw this egg filled with your chemical waste and blind those fools! The egg has an effect radius of 5 blocks, so try and go for the clumps! (The egg causes blindness II for 5-10 seconds)<br>10 Points: (Possibly&nbsp;<b>DONATOR ONLY</b>?) Auto Revive- There are some days when teammates are lousy and only want to help themselves. Well, don't rely on them! Get this auto revive, and when you reach low health, right click the Survivor Brain (In inventory it is Magma Cream)<br><br><u>Map Description</u><br>A map would be fairly easy to make. All that is needed is a zombie spawn, rush zone, and a survivors building.<br><img alt="" src="http://i58.tinypic.com/14ik780.png">

So.. basically turf wars, CTH, and somewhat of TF2 mixed together?

Not really turf wars because there zombies can run anywhere, not really CTH because there is no objective you have to control, and I don't really know what Team Fortress Gameplay is like. The closest game this comes to is Rush from Battlefield 4 because there are Attackers, Defenders, and one objective that the attackers have to destroy.
