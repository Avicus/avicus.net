<span><b></b>So I was going through my recent discussions and found this. I wanted to bring this up again.<br><br>What the title says<br>put down what you think<br><br>Keep the Speed. Get rid of fire resistance it is useless. Change it with like a different but usable potion like Night vision.&nbsp;With night vision you will be able to see underground better. (Same points as speed and level)<br><br>Nebula shop is in need of Blocks like 16 wood logs and 32 glass (on most maps I keep running out of blocks.<br>(Wood = 3 points glass = 2 level 1)<br></span><span><br>Keep normal spanky spade. Lower points to 10<br><br>Keep the gold apples&nbsp;but reduce the amount f points to 5 for 3 apples<br><br>Change the flame torch to like magma cream(therefore u won't accidentally place it and loose the enchants). The name would be Flaming Orb<br><br>Arrows are good but on Venomous TDM I'm sure it should be removed for that map<br><br>Jkawesomes suggestion:<br>"</span>Another suggestion is to add a YML option where map makers can customize the nebula shop for specific maps"<span><br><br><br>In Total my nebula shop would be:<br><br><b>3GoldApples</b>(Same level/5 points)<br><b>Speed Potion</b>(Splash and Drink) same level/points&nbsp;<br><b>NightVision</b>&nbsp;(Splash and Drink) same level/points as speed<br><b>Jukebox/Disc</b>(Same Level and Points)<br><b>16 Wood Logs</b>&nbsp;(Level 1) 3 points<br><b>32 Glass</b>&nbsp;(Level 1) 3 points<br><b>SpankySpade (</b>Knockback 1) level 10/10 points<br><b>Flaming Orb</b>(FireAspect1) Same level/points as Flaming Torch<br><b>Arrow(16x)</b>&nbsp;same level/points<br><b>Arrow(64x)</b>&nbsp;Same level/points<br><b>Snowballs(16x)</b>&nbsp;Level &nbsp;1 - Same amount of Points&nbsp;<br><b>5 extra slots on the bottom for YML Customizable Add-Ons</b><br><br><br>Some small ideas that I doubt would be good:<br>3 Enchantment Bottles for 9 points level 1<br>1 Instant Damage Potion(splash) = 10 points level 1<br>&nbsp;15 TNT = 30 points level 30<br><br><br></span>

+1 to jkawesome's idea<br><br>also, add an invisibility potion for VERY expensive.<br>it would have to be tons and tons of points to not be op, though, like to the point where you could only use it towards the end of the game as a last resort for your team.

Everything seems pretty good, but I'm worried about the Spanky Spade being too overpowered on matches like Clay Wars with lots of void space...

Your right.<br>i removed spanky spade.<br><br>@Spock The invisibility potions are too over powered. And it won't be "last resort" since the Points carry on from game to game in the rotations.

You can buy items with points. Open it by right clicking the nether star.<br>You get points by killing people, and by destroying monuments.<br>Yes, open the point shop.<br>They reset when you leave that rotation.

The Point shop or the "Nebula Shop" is the nether star on the 9th slot of your inventory.&nbsp;<br><br>The point shop is used to give you items for the kills or the amount of monuments you get in 1 game. Points don't carry on from one match to another (Cronus to Apollo)&nbsp;<br><br>You can see how many points you have by right clicking the nether star<br><br>Points "expire" once you leave the match you're in(leaving from mczone01 to hub)<br><br>Edit: Ninja'd

Killfarm on Quintus, then with enough points, killfarm while being invisible.

Add in custom potions. Like invisibility for 30 seconds by with mining fatigue 2 and slowness 1.&nbsp;<br><br>Or something fun, like a sharpness 5 stick or a pet wolf with regen 1

I reckon they should add some kind of like mega, super, powerful enchanted sword that has like 10 - 15 attack damage, BUT costs lots of points, so the only way you could get it is by playing almost an entire rotation to save up points to get it :)

Doesn't really matter if it takes the entire rotation to get, sounds extremely op in certain maps.<br><br>For example, I'm not sure that sword would work on Venomous DTM. Killfarm paradise.

Omg please add blocks... It would be paradise for defenders and attackers(Specifically rushers)! Also kind of off topic, but I want to mention it. Does anyone get annoyed when they drop something and its soulbound? So you can't get it back? Ex. a Pick or Wood

Yeah I have to agree that it's going to be game breaking even if it is like 100 points. It'd suck to be the other team. Imagine this on Quintus.
