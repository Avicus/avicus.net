Hello Avicus,<br><br>I know 80% of the community hate the gamemode walls. I am basically just saying I know why you hate it. You know nothing on any map. You get leather helmet and just leave before the walls drop.<br>I am doing this for you guys so you can get into the gamemode walls.<br>Some walls players and I are doing something for you.<br>I will bump this post when we are scrimming. We will teach you the walls maps from top to bottom.<br><br>Format:<br>Team:<br>Timezone:<br>Can you play&nbsp;<b>Right now?</b><br><br><b></b>Post in this then I will invite you. After I invite you type<br><b><i><u>/server scrim02<br></u></i></b>This will change but I will bump this :D<br>GLHF

I don't like it because I can't be asked to mine iron and I rather be spending 10 min on nebula rather than getting ready for the walls to fall

The problem I have with walls is that there is so much overpower stuff. And in some maps, just finding normak iron is a pain.

I think that some maps have way too much OP stuff as Robin said. Most of the time I'm happy with full iron then the walls drop and someone with full diamond enchanted and a sharp 5 sword rocks up and 2 hits everyone xD

Of course xD But if there was ever a walls tourney let's say, the OP stuff would have to be removed I think.

I only play a little since I don't like wasting 12 minutes and getting no credits. But that's hardly ever the case.&nbsp;<br><br>Most ts of the Walls PvPers are actually not so hard to kill even if they have better gear then you. I also like playing CTH and Nebula more because of how fast paced they are.

I consider myself a good walls player, but sometimes I don't feel up to playing. It's not a bad gamemode; I like how dynamic it is, yet it's hard to get the right amount of players on the right maps that cater well to my playstyle. For example, a 16 player game on Mesoplanet would be a no for me.

Walls is a nice gamemode, but I'm really impatient to wait for walls to drop. And on some maps, iron and other things are a pain to find. Also, the lack of map knowledge hurts. It's still fun though, still don't want to waste 10mins gathering resources to get killed 1 min after the walls drop.

Rilo, I love walls but like Glitchy said its all preference. &nbsp;They don't want to wait for the walls to fall, they don't want to spend time stacking up, they just want to pvp. &nbsp;Personally I like the survival aspects to walls and the different varieties the game brings. &nbsp;Avicus is a pvp server and I'm not saying Walls isn't but thats pvp is only a small part in walls. &nbsp;Thats maybe why many new people in Avicus play walls.

Solution: Walls DTM.<br><br>Basically, Two teams, big walls map. You get killed, you're out of the game. Your whole team dies, other team wins. Both teams have say, 1 or 2 monuments. Works like normal DTM, you break the monuments, you win.
