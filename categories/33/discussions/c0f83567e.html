I know this has been said before, but it only comes around when a regular on the server is banned for cheating. To prevent this, I highly encourage people to use common sense and see previous rulebreaking patterns on other servers, so that your team does not get a poor reputation, or is blacklisted from an event.<br><br>There are some ways to do background checks on your players. I would recommend looking up your member's username in Google, and putting "appeal" before or after the username. Some servers have public appeals or mentions on forums, and you can hear how they responded to their ban. I'd also check other competitive servers like OCN, Badlion, Kohi, and Kratous to see their punishment history. If they are willing to hack on those servers, then it's worth questioning whether or not they will do it here. I had this problem on Avalanche and other users: I'd do these checks, and it helped me weed out bad players by focusing on them more.<br><br>Also, before you accept a member, be sure to ask about their history. Anything that can be a precaution, I recommend looking. One more thing that I've seen is looking at their previous YouTube videos to see for any suspicious activity: if they combo someone 30 times and the person they're fighting can't get out of the air, or their click speed is consistent or wacky, you should look for little 'ticks' in their fighting behavior.

If a punishment for hacking was appealed, people tend to realize that the punishment probably wasn't true

Yup, agreed. Other servers have different ways of approaching punishments so it's unreliable. If you were recruiting staff this would be essential, but not for a (somewhat) public event...

Actually it can find who's hacking easily. But If there would be better staff members this problem would already be solved.

Doing background checks in the way you described, by putting higher concern on some players who've been banned before, that's definitely appropriate. Taking background checks way out of proportion from that would be ridiculous (e.g making a background check &nbsp;a factor that gets them banned) Background checks shouldn't be used when decided whether to ban people, it should be used to decide who to specifically target and watch closely when many people are being suspicious. At the end of the day, other servers aren't avicus and if people want to hack on other servers and not avicus then they're not breaking any rules (unless they're a staff member because somewhere in the policies there was something hazey about maintaining a good rep or something-ignore this if it's been changed-intentionally vague about policies because I don't want to get punished).&nbsp;<br><br>And as people say, background checks can be false/unreliable. Other than that seems great.

Talking about background checks, Ingigo was banned on Badlion&nbsp;<b>Judgement Day 7</b> and was&nbsp;<b>not the evidence</b> for his ban, but may have swayed a few people to believe he might've been hacking.<br><br>Same with Max (Bloodoh).

This actually is not really the best of ideas, considering Background checks can be&nbsp;<b>false.&nbsp;</b>On top of that if a user was banned for hacks, for example on lets say OCN but they really liked Destroy, so they came on Avicus to have a fresh start, wouldn't it be a bit unfair to them just to not give them a chance&nbsp;<b>to make things right</b>. There for I disagree with any of this, because you&nbsp;<b>should&nbsp;</b>be given&nbsp;<b>multiple&nbsp;</b>chances and besides if you are really concerned about the wrongs and rights of players you&nbsp;<b>won't&nbsp;</b>have anyone in your team, everyone makes mistakes and we all admit we've done it more than once so there for I&nbsp;<b>disagree&nbsp;</b>with this feature.<br><br><b>Thanks,<br></b><i>Tiger</i>

This isnt a feature this is something enforced by team leaders.
