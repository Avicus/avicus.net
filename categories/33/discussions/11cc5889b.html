This discussion hasn't received many threads lately.&nbsp; Are there any new strategies and tactics that anyone uses that they would like to share?&nbsp; Always working on expanding strategies and tactics.&nbsp; I am just wondering if anyone below has anything they use that works well for them and explain it.&nbsp; Just would like to see what others do.&nbsp; I have read a few of the last threads but would like to see more input from others.&nbsp; If you have any strategies you would like to share comment it below.

Uhh. I always try and wait for the right moment to rush. A lot of people run straight in and find them selves having to handle a 4v1. Just wait and be patient i guess

My strategy which I personally don't recommend is to run in into enemy lines and try to knock as much people as you can into the void.. works well if you don't get caught, but very low success rate<br><br>My other strategies include:<br>straight on pvp, with the sword, usually trying to get them stuck in a chain of attacks in a straight line (it can kill the best but its a CAN kill, its mainly luck when I get them stuck in a chain..)<br><br>Shooting, run and attack, run away after a few hits, place blocks to try to slow them down (making a quick wall), and repeat

Thank you to profbananaslug, OCDs, and Codyno. &nbsp;All very great and helpful strategies. &nbsp;Another bonus is that they are were brought to me by very great pvper's who know what they are doing. &nbsp;I found prof's post very vivid and descriptive. I found codyno's do's and dont's to be a great way to organize his points and &nbsp;all of his strategies have really proven.very useful. &nbsp;OCD taught me to avoid rushing into things as I can be quickly overwhelmed. &nbsp;All feedback on this post is greatly appreciated. &nbsp;If you came here to see the strategies of other avicus players these are 3 guys you can trust. &nbsp;I hope to see Absolab, Dev_Revs, and TheFloorisAvicys comment as well.

PVP:<br><br>Bowcombo: Its pretty sweaty but basically use your bow as a rod and, as people run towards, fire a bowshot so, and then get a couple free hits.<br><br>w-tap: Basically, use labymod or 1.7, and after you get hits, stop holding w while the person's avatar is still red, then once its normal again, hold it again. Youll ifgure it out better as you get used to it.<br><br>Jumpcritting: If you hit the person out of your reach you can get them back into it easier by jumping.<br><br>Strafing, aiming, and clicking fast are also important but theyre pretty self-explanatory

None of these work on you because it's impossible to combo you.

I can give bow/anti-bow strats, from my experience.<br><b></b><br><b>Bow Strats:&nbsp;<br></b><ul><li>One shot at a time. Seriously, the biggest mistake I see people do is fire a shot, and then they stand there while aiming another shot. Normally, that's enough time for somebody to not only notice, but hit you once or twice. Fire a single shot, and move--it doesn't even have to be to cover, just move anywhere.</li><li>I'd add an addendum to the people who said to fire a shot before engaging in PVP: only do so as an ace up your sleeve, and only if you're the defender. If you've revealed your bow already, the aggressor knows that you're intending to do that, and so can avoid your shots, thus wasting your time while getting in your space. Meanwhile, as the aggressor, firing a bow shot is not good because you lose your momentum, which not only allows you to be shot, but gives teammates more time to arrive. Rush, and hope you get first strike.</li><li>If you want lots of kills, I would recommend camping mid, or at least getting as close as you can to a "mid." This is the strategy I employ, and it tends to work extremely well against rushers. Not only that, but you also usually get the advantage of people not able to fire at you, since you're too far to hit. Since a lot of people like to rush over defend, this will probably net you a lot of kills on maps like Sunbeam Temple and Kollad, where you have an Infinity bow and the two teams are spaced out enough. This strategy tends to fail on a lot of multistage maps, since there are enough paths to take that it's usually too hard to counter rushers. Examples of this would be Proelium and Camel, where there are multiple approaches to objectives.<br></li><li>Practice a lot, and try to learn the approximate heights to aim at-- ideally, you want to use only one shot against a rusher for a kill. If you're able to hit a rusher in one or two shots from 30+ blocks somewhat often, I'd say you've learned this.</li><li>Be extremely aware. Note where the enemy team is at all times. You don't have to go after a rusher if he/she gets past you, but communicate with your team what you know-- this helps your defense.</li><li>Note that if any part of a body sticks out, you can hit that person-- practice some tricky shots. For example, the arm or the head of someone behind cover.</li><li>Finally, figure out a priority for hitting targets-- that is, figure out which people you try to aim for first. For me, since I'm in mid a lot, it tends to be Rushers&gt;Enemy mid&gt;Enemy archers&gt;Enemy defense, but do what you think will work for you. Experiment with your order.</li></ul><b>Anti-Bow Strats:</b><br><ul><li>Mix up your movement. Learn how to make yourself appear random. For example, if you're the aggressor in the "bow before pvp" example, strafe left and right. If multiple people are targeting you and shooting, make random movements that throw off their shots. More than likely, they'll stop paying attention to you to shoot at someone else, allowing for a counter-attack. (Note that this doesn't really work if 4+ people are firing at you, as someone will probably still focus on you, but it's still avoidable.)<br></li><li>Unless your opponent is much higher up than you are, use a 3 block high wall as cover. 2 blocks usually still expose your head to getting hit by any low arrows.</li></ul>Wow, this was a lot longer than I thought it would be. That's all I can think of right now. Enjoy!

W-Tap - Probably one of the things i do the most, W-Tapping resets your kb and will make you deal more kb to your opponent.&nbsp;<br><br>Strafe - Just go to the left or to the right while fighting someone, probably one of the basics when it comes to pvp. Really easy to do.<br><br>Circle-Strafe - This is more advanced and is used more in potpvp. Basically while fighting someone and you get a combo, you walk in a circle around them, you need to have fairly high sensitivity or a HUGE mousepad to do this (i think). Prtty useful in potpvp.<br><br>Bow-Combo - When you're about 5-7 blocks away from your opponent running towards you, just simply shoot an arrow, it doesnt have to be fully pulled back, as long as you can shoot an arrow on your enemy. This will knock them back about 1-2 blocks, you run towards them and start comboing them.<br><br>Camshake - not really sure about it, just shake your mouse a bit in a fight, you usually camshake while jitterclicking. This doesnt help for everyone but it helps for some.<br><br>A&amp;D-Tap - This is also quite complicated, you switch between A &amp; D after every // every second hit while comboing. If you play normal (without speed) switch between every hit, if playing pot (with speed 2) switch between every or every second hit, depends on how coose you are to your enemy.
