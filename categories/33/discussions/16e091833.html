Imo, no. K/D doesn't show that there was an entire team of knights on the other team in CTH or that you were rushing in Nebula. You could just kill farm and pull a great K/D out, you could rush a lot and have a terrible K/D or be a good PvPer who doesn't have good kits yet. So my question to you is do you think it counts or do you think the opposite? I respect everyone's views so feel free to share.<br><br>-ShadowSlayerZ7

There is a good excuse for rushers with a low KD. As a rusher, I tend to get targeted by various people pretty often, and that causes most of my deaths. Also, rushers are the ones who usually fight people in heavier armor than themselves, since most defenders would be in full iron/diamond armor. If you had to fight full diamond guys every day while you have no armor, then of course you might have a low KD.

I don't think much of K/D, I actually think clans should come up with new ways to determine whether a player is good enough to join, like set up a small server and get them to fight someone to see how they go or just watch them in a Avicus game.

ok. KD is good and bad IMO<br><br>It is good because it keeps oyu motivated to do better.<br><br>IT is bad because it isn;t a factor to judge people off of their "pro ness in pvp" Like seriously. A guy with diamond armor on Qunintus could easily rack up a lot of kills and say to be "good at pvp" Like wut .-. And someone could just build a huge scatter cannon and can just kill farm all day.<br><br>Take Cratain for example. If you see his OCN profile, he has a really bad KD.

A KDR is just a few numbers on your profile that most people who don't know you judge by. Personally, I am not the greatest in PvP, yet I still have a KDR of 3.9 mainly because block hitting and crits are OP in tunnels, and I'd like to reach prestige 5 so I just kill people (and killfarm occasionally), and still my K/D still sits at 3.9 ._.

I don't rush much, unless I'm with others. I tend to defend - so I don't get many kills - but because I use a touchpad, when it comes to PvP I generally lose. So therefore I don't care anymore because I have a bad K/D, but some people do, and others don't.

When I played, I had a goal to become one of the very best at least on Avicus, at my best my K/D was over 15+. You do get motivated and feel you achieve something when you are able to prove yourself, even though it's just a game. I acknowledged you do get targeted if your K/D is better than most of the players on Avicus, I even was told "I will decrease your k/d" and "I target you just because of your k/d" many many times.

We all do play (or played) for different reasons, you maybe play for the rushing-aspect and I played for the pvp-aspect and I do think the stats and K/D says much about how good or bad we actually are. If you rush you will have more deaths than kills and a low K/D, and different way around, if you only pvp or combine pvp with rushing you might be able to get good stats and higher K/D. I don't think you should look down on yourself, if you really think you are good, prove yourself, I'm pretty sure I'll look forward to it! :)

Depends on your playstyle. In general, it does not, because some players are decent and have (example) a 0.3, or 05 KD, while others are terrible, yet have a 3.0 KD (ahem, me), due to either OP kits, or Combat logging. However, it can be a decent indicator, depending on what the player in mind actually does ingame. If 2 people do the exact same thing, you can identify who does it better, simply by looking at their KDs.. Sometimes.

No, it doesn't really, but it is good to keep a moderately high one in case teams want u. a 1-1.5 is a solid K/D.

K/D doesn't matter. Minecraft is a game, not a competition for the most kills. It's to have fun and meet new people. ^.^

I don't think much of K/D, I actually think clans should come up with new ways to determine whether a player is good enough to join, like set up a small server and get them to fight someone to see how they go or just watch them in a Avicus game.

Although it doesn't matter, it does mean something. You can't have a 20K/D and be bad, although you can have a 0.5K/D And still be good.

I think a skilled Pvper that Rushes with ought dying and having at least 2 KD is good. Someone who rushes and has bad KD means they only good at getting the monument. When it comes to 1v1 I thing the KD person would win. But you should look at the Pvp KD, because falling out of the world really does not count as a pvp death. :D

Nah, KDs just ruin your fun. Instead of plowing into a group of enemies, by yourself, and seeing how many you can kill before you die, you'd more likely be smart and quite boring, in my opinion, and retreat. You just spend so much time worrying about a number on a video game, you don't really get the full enjoyment of it :c
