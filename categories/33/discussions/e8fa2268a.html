It's insanely flukey and ping based. Diamond OCN is much more accurate.<br><br>For instance I 8 hearted Glitchy on Iron and 3 hearted him on Diamond, it really does make a big difference.

I can safely guarantee that Stan is better than 99.99% of all people to ever log on to Avicus and play for over a day. By all means, Stan is a god to Avicus. I can also assume that you have a much better ping to Avicus and combo'd him when he had no armour or something (I'm not sure which map Ternio is though to be honest)

It's allowed on MineHQ. Also, he pvped without it for a long time. He is even better without it. Also, all these kids nominating their team mates is quite funny. I really can't tell if they are trolling or not.<br><br>I haven't ran into an avicus regular who is 'amazing' at pvp, except for Tresh414. For some reason, people judge pvp skill on here by how many kills they get in nexus or nebula. There are unbalanced kits, people who would rather win than 1v1, and so on in these gamemodes.

If Bajan played here, I'd totally pick him! Too bad he's off owning better people!&nbsp;<br>*Cracks up*<br>Sorry xD<br>Anyways, I think the best is either Tel or Gonzo.. Tel almost always gets crits on me and has some awesome strafing and I can usually not even get a hit on Gonzo when it's a 1v1.. But really, there are a lot of awesome people on here :D

Player X. But there's someone who is really the best pvper since he always joins hardcore tournaments which is he always challenges other hardcore players from servers which has the hardcore pvpers (i forgot who is he but juano told me one time about him . Sadly, he's about to quit minecraft because of no tourneys around yet)

Depends what you mean by best pvper. What is the factor or combination of factors that make a person good at mc pvp. Lots to pick from: team worker or leader, rusher or defender. But in my personal opinion best " pvper " was yoah.. 1Th... Pizza347? I think and myself. But saying that we should have more tournaments going on for this sort of stoff :)

I like how everyone here being named is well known in the community. Maybe, just maybe, the best pvper on this server is someone we havent seen or fought before! MIND BLOWN.<br><br><br>it could be a noob who logs on 2 a month or something!
