First off, i don't know if this mini-game idea follows correctly in the section used but whatever..<br>This mini-game is called LightsOut and i think would follow in a popular game. The idea of this game is there are 2 teams:<br>- Dark<br>- Light<br>The main theme of this mini-game is that there is 2 teams that fight it out, with normal weaponry and kits that they would get. Each map would have NO light source or containment.&nbsp;<br>Each person gets 3 stacks of torches, their goal is to light up an entire map in order to map the map full brightness and win the game.<br>Once a teams side of the map is FULLY lit up, with no containment of darkness the game ends.<br>GOAL------- Light up the opponents side of the map with torches to make it fully bright with no darkness with kits and PVP styles.<br>The other team CANNOT break the torches that were placed.<br><u><i><b>KITS AND MORE&nbsp;GAME PLAY&nbsp;VIEWS WILL BE ADDED SOON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</b></i></u><br>EDIT: Must stand near each torch for about 4 seconds before placing another one.

Well it seems simple, all you have to do is make a suicidal run and spam torches. Also what type of light level would be considered, lit?&nbsp;<br><br>But I would play it +1

When I first saw LightsOut in the title, I thought you were talking about the old Nexus map. This is cool too XD
