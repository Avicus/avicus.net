<span><span><span><span><span><u></u>Some of you have probably seen my defense guide. Since I'm also pretty good with cannoning, I thought I'd make a cannon guide also!<br></span><br><span><span>1.<b><u> Mounting Blocks</u></b></span><br><span><span><b></b><b></b></span>Every cannon needs a mounting block. For myself, I usually use a fence post as a mounting block. This gives a medium/level angle shot, which is the most effective to most situations. </span><br>If you're looking to take out a skybridge, use a fence as a mounting block. This allows for a high angle shot that is useful for taking out skybridges.<br>Slabs. For most encounters, these are not the way to go. But if you want to hit a target lower than what your cannon is at, slabs are great! They fire at a low angle, which is perfect for taking out underbridges, etc.<br></span><br><span><span><span>2. <b><u>Cannons!</u></b></span><span><b></b><b></b></span></span><br></span></span><span>I put all the pictures in an album at <a href="http://imgur.com/a/G8xso" rel="nofollow">http://imgur.com/a/G8xso</a>&nbsp;they are in order.</span></span><br></span><br><span>The first one is the basic cannon<span><br><span>This is the easiest cannon to make and fire, but not the best. To fire you simply push the right button, and then the left.<b></b><br></span></span></span><u></u><br><span><b><u>Next we have the whiskey cannon, a great line fire cannon!</u></b><u> </u> This is a great cannon because they are very easy to make, and you can make them very fast. I put the basic one first, and the upgraded one next.<br></span><b></b><br><span><b>The next cannon is the whip. (the one made out of cobble)</b><br>This cannon is a cannon on steroids. It packs quite a punch and can hit targets pretty far away. <br></span><br><span>The 4th class of cannons is the diagonal cannon.<br></span><br>There is an automatic version and manual version. I put the manual first, and the automatic second.<br></span><br><span><span><b>The next class is the Icarus (player launcher)</b><br></span><br>Icarus cannons are great cannons to launch your team over to the enemies' side.<br><span>The first Icarus is a basic one. This can't launch you very far, but it is good for short ranges. <br></span><br><span>The second Icarus is the GameMode 1 Icarus. It was designed by an OCN team for use in a tournament. A heads up, this requires 1 repeater<br></span><br><span>The last Icarus is the most difficult to build, but the best one. This is the CLAF Icarus. This Icarus was designed by xCLAFx on OCN. This requires 2 repeaters. <br></span><br><span><b>The last cannon, and maybe even the most important to know is the arc/skybridge counter cannon. </b><br></span><br><span>This is easy to make, and very variable, which allows you to change things to suit what you need. I'm going to give you the basic one. You can change the angle of the shot by adding fences, the amount of charges, etc.<br></span><br>Thanks for Reading! :)</span>

I have a couple I can show you. What types do you want? Cannons that can blow up in water? Cannons that can shoot high up? Cannons that can do major damage? Redstone-less cannons? Icarus?

This is really, really helpful to me. I've tried to experiment with different cannons from other guides, but failed, while the pictures on this one were clear enough to help. Thanks for making this!

Using the scatter cannon I made this really "weird" cannon and it's not even useful. It's a 2 man scatter cannon. 1 person loads the ammunition and the launcher while the other guy prepares to jump on an icarus. This "scatter<br>cannon" is half scatter half icarus. It's really weird though but it can do damage AND send players 30/50 blocks away

And you also should show diagonal &nbsp;scatters and diagonal icarus's And redstone less cannons.

i would have to agree with muk but your guide is good as well. Maybe needs a little bit more detail and a little more cannons. Dont forget chaos cannons, disposable icarus, dispencer cannons, and redstone less cannons and scatter cannnons.<br><br>Otherwise great guide and i hope this guide can be more further expalined!
