There is currently a plugin that is supposed to stop team spleefing, however there is no way to completely prevent it from happening.<br><br>If this does continue to happen to you, &nbsp;the best option is to report the player and wait for a staff member to deal with it.

How are you so sure that a staff member has responded to the report, but has decided the accused player has stopped?<br><br>The alternative is to file an online report with suffice evidence.

Its just that people are supposed to get kicked when they get reported or warned but sometimes the reporter is wrong then they get kicked , So when i report someone They dont get kicked , but i dont know if they get warned they should tell you if they got warned , tempbanned - banned , or kicked you could add that as a plugin for your server to inform the person that they got delt with or not , but sometimes people hack and they dont get Warned , Banned - TempBanned , OR Kicked and sometimes thats frustrating .

The reporter is not supposed to be kicked / warned if a Mod sees that a player is not breaking the rules, you are thinking of abusing /report where people write random reports like '/report nub26 This guy is a nooby nub plz ban!' When players are reported they don't get an automatic kick or warn, staff must see proof before they can take action.<br><br>And with all the new mods there can be upto 4 - 5 mods who all rush into a single game when a report comes in.

(Not to be rude) You done make too much sense pickle<br><br>Topic talk:<br>The plugin... What i think is that you should REALLY be active during the gameplay, thats one chance not to get team spleefed, I would suggest taking a "Screenshot" of the death message, or use a recording software to report players, cause you can upload not only to youtube but to other websites (Virus-free) and link it as a report, however if that footage is just a troll, you might be punished :P. &nbsp;:), I have reported Multiple people by footage, using either "Fraps" or "Action" as a recording software :) and i dont usually drop bellow 400 fps whilst recording &amp; using shaders &gt;:D. Good luck m8!

There is no way to stop spleef. I personally use it against the other team by making a false bridge, standing below it and breaking blocks every time a enemy player stands on it

I entirely agree with zacd. A screenshot won't help unless you can catch one at the right moment. Plus the person might be shifting in order to hide their name. The absolute best option is to capture video evidence.<br><br>And please do stay on topic~ The forums are not a place for chatting.

Who actually has their recording ready to catch a team griever? No one that paranoid. &nbsp;Quite honestly the only thing someone can do without any visual proof is word of mouth. If there is serveral pointing the same person well you can't possibly still not take their word. &nbsp;My suggestion doesn't even matter because Avicus doesn't exactly do that. I agree with zach, if you want to successfully catch a team griefer record it but theres a 20% of that ever happening.
