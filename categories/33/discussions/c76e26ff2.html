To the Mods and owners of Avicus&nbsp;<br><br><br>You NEED to add them back please they made avicus different from other servers and also its something that people looked forward to getting when they bought a rank. because im buying a rank soon but i want the grenades to just try them out and it would also be great if you could add them back permanently because all of the donates loved them. i mean im still going to buy GOLD but i think that its not just me that wants them back. So if Funky, Howsie, AviGill or any jr mod mod sr mod or anyone that is in touch with them just tell them to read my post thank you.<br><br>Mrme2298&nbsp;<br><br>:)

They were insanely overpowered and it wasn't really PvP/fit in nebula.

Wait, so you were going to get gold, and then want grenades purely for because of the fact that you wanted to use them to get lots of kills? D : &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;

Really, I think we need to bring back and buff the TNT. Make it for everyone, too, while we're at it. It looks like so much fun to mess around with but they were over-priced and under-powered :c

this would make it fair. how about make grenades available to everyone but there's only slight difference. for non donors, it will take you for 15 points with 5 grenades and for the donors it will only take you 10 points to get it. and fix the shop because everything is so damn expensive. spanky spade for 30 points with only knockback 1? that's ridiculous. spanky spade for 7 points with kb 1 is already fair and cheap. 3 golden apples for 8 points? make it a little lower. some people who are new can't get much points than you thought. if grenades are available for everyone, people can have the chance to kill multiple of players (when they have achieved their hard work) and use it as their escape weapon. <br><br>#bringgrenadesback

They ruined the game. I'm glad that they removed it. @Carrie Make it available to everyone? That's a no-no for me. That would be the worst thing ever. Also they were OP as hell. It takes around 6 grenades to kill someone in full diamond or less. Saw it in a video of sfkwww. <br><br>#dontbringgrenadesback

I went on 30-35 ks on Quintus once with 2 stacks of grenades, it was an absolute massacre. They affected gameplay terribly and while they were fun, they were unfair.

remember, it's way hard to aim if the enemy is strafing. there's a technique called "strafing". it can doge grenades

How do you "doge" grenades?<br><br>on topic, grenades are hard to strafe because they have a large impact area, and a good grenade thrower will aim for the feet and ground under them for insane KB as well.<br>-1 for grenades

Grenades have a pretty lager AoE. Take it from someone who played CTH verses 9000 demos in CTH. Excpecially when you are fighting someone, it's hard to dodge a grenade (unless they suck at aiming the grenade, and it is really just point and click)

As a few have mentioned the EULA [Un]fortunately disapproves of such items. It is great that Avicus is abiding by the rules. A server co-owned by Mr. Sparklez has a very heavy pay to win element and they are going to have to update fast.<br><br>Personally I had no issues with grenades being pay to win as I died a grand total of <b>once</b> by 'nades. GG. (So if I was a non-donator I would have one more death because of the grenades)
