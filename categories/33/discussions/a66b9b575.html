Was never on McZone but from what I hear it was a hot mess. Lots of players but equally lots of chaos. Now currently we have less players but a bit more order and control at least.

I played on McZone with another account which now belongs to my friend, but the community back then wasn't as great as it is now. I remember that people in-game were swearing all the time, and just treating each other like garbage. I see a very big improvement now, because many players remind others to watch the language, and those types of gestures in general.

I was part of the WallsMC back in Feb or Jan 2013. It was no hub server or anything. Once you joined it put you in a walls game. So no one really talked, no one was popular. Then McZone came in, the server became more popular and other cool stuff. But like Porky said, a bunch of garbage started happening. Now there is an improvement I dont know as if September<b> because </b>i got perm banned in August<b>. But this is the first server i've joined and my favorite for a long time. </b>

I'm going to give my general opinion on this all:<br><br>McZone - Great quality server, okay quality community.<br><br>Early Avicus - Good quality server, outstanding community (everyone was nice, friendly, no staff tryhards, lots of support and almost no forum spammers).<br><br>Today - Awful server quality (lag, maps gameplay vs. aesthetics issues, extremely immature player base), bad community (mod tryhards as far as the eye can see, everyone being immature and carrying a negative atmosphere like myself, corruption everywhere, lots of forum spam and general issues, lack of organization, etc).<br><br>But that's just me, disagree or not, my thoughts won't change.

I loved avicus before 1.8. I gotta be honest I think 1.8 messed with server lag and a lot of other things that everyone has been seeing. but before that I loved avicus. It seemed like everyone knew everyone and if there was a hacker there would be like 3/4 ppl recording. and a tin of ppl would use /report.<br>but ever since 1.8 it seems like everyone hacks and I don't know anyone beside the mods and like 5 other ppl that accually play :/

I played MCzone for a while, but I was like 10 so i can't remember :l lol
Early Avicus was pretty good though.
Current Avicus is basically as MLGtino said but there are a lot of ragers, hackers and swearers. I don't mind, as the game is still playable and the lag has been recently fixed. Its still my favourite server though.

I've been through both communities, so I'll explain both.<br><br>McZone - A community who complains way more than they should, immature overall.<br><br>Avicus right now - I'll admit, the forums have mod tryhards. Some of them think they're so cool. Then you have some of the avicus "pro" pvpers where they think they're so good they act like they're the king of pvp.
