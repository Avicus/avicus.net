<h1><i>Appreciated if read</i><i>.</i></h1><br>As you may know, Elian_Garcia has been global banned from Avicus for<i>&nbsp;</i>supposedly "Fly Hacking". I don't believe he was fly hacking as I was in a Skype call with him, and he has screen shared me. He told me he has forge, and he got banned for "hacking". But as many of you would know... Forge does work with any Hacked clients. I would be pleased if you would unban Elian_Garcia for it was not an appropriate ban.

Don't request locks on other player's topics, there is no need to lock it unless it breaks forum rules.

Not this shit again.<br>Can you guys just please write "Do not make a forum post otherwise you will not be unbanned" as well in the infraction? Because these are getting really annoying.
