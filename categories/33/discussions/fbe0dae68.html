Hey guys, I thought I'd spark up a discussion.<br><br>So today's topic will be the&nbsp;<b>sprint key</b>. If you don't know, this was added in Minecraft 1.7 and allows you to re-initiate your sprint if you hold the sprint key down. <br>It may not sound like much, but this has practically changed the face of Minecraft PvP. Before, it was difficult to initiate combos and whatnot because of the double-tapping (which was a bit buggy at times and caused trouble,) but with the sprint key, it is so much easier to perform advanced techniques.<br><br>What are your thoughts on the sprint key? Do you use it? Are you with or against it?<br><br>Personally I am a big fan of the sprint key, as it has made my PvP experience (and Minecraft experience in general) better. It also lets me parkour with much less hassle (parkour with double tap... *shudder*) However, I understand how people would disagree because the skill gap is much smaller now.

I thought Better Sprint Mod allowed you to keep it on without pressing a key. Don't quote me on that, though, since I've never used it xD<br><br>I keep my sprint key at "shift," and my sneak key is F :P

I agree with it. It makes everything so much more convenient and reduces hassle. I hate that glitchy doubletap sprint. Pretty much every single combo relies on that now. If you got hit once the combo was over. Now I feel like you can demonstrate your skill with great combos, and if you get hit once, most of the time it doesn't disrupt the combo. Unless you do what I do and walk straight into their combo and counter-combo them hard when you hit them a certain way...&nbsp;<br><br>Edit: Sprint is Control

I really wish they didn't add the sprint button and they should have just made the double tap not buggy. It made PVP a lot easier, I'd prefer more tactics when pvping and not just aim click.<br><br>Kind of hard to explain.

I have mine on the Control Key, and I'm constantly holding it down unless I'm hitting. If I'm hitting or breaking something then it switches it to right click for some reason. If I'm PvPing I just hold it down in between swings and tbh I'm actually pretty good at it :D

There are a lot of tactics other then "click and aim", you need to do a lot more to be a top player. You have to experiment different things.

I sometimes use BSM on Kohi, I don't know which one is better though. BSM is easier to use however the sprint key reacts alot quicker. My sprint key is set to left shift and I had to change crouch to left Ctrl.

My sprint key is ALT and shift is c.<br>Tip: I just a couple of days ago found out that holding down the sprint key and tapping w as fast as you can, along with a circle strafe will lead to some SERIOUS combos.<br>I mean i seem to get a lot less knockback with it and people find it harder to hit me when i get in a bad spot using this.

The sprint key is extremely useful. I have it set to my control key so it won't affect my crouch. I find I can crit. hit and strafe much easier with the sprint key.

Tbh, Mojang made a mistake adding this. First off, In survival, you can Double tap W no problem, and when it comes to PVP then that counts for "Skill"... You dont simply just double tap and kill your opponent...<br><br>But my Sprint key is on Button 4 on my mouse ;)

I think the sprint key made me way too OP. Since Im on a mac I can set the sprint key to caps and I don't have to hold it to sprint, but I do have to reset(double tap caps) it every time I press esc, open inventory, and other stuff like that.

I tried using shift and pinky stuff for sprint, but It hurt when I used the control button and I'm used to shifting to crouch so I use Q.

False, there is an option in BSM that allows you to constantly sprint (essentially auto-sprint).<br><br>Going to add, that when you use BSM and pull off a combo, you don't stop sprinting. This causes insane reach which is totally unfair on the user who is playing vanilla PvP.

I'm not talking about AutoSprint, I'm talking about using single tap/pressing/holding a key down to sprint or 8 block, which I mean "response time" as to how fast pushing the keybinded button/key reacts. You're talking about a different part in BSM.

Well, you said it was autosprint, and obviously you could tell if someone was using it right? That's a&nbsp;Moderators Job to tell if someone is using that.&nbsp;Since it is "unfair to players who is using Vanilla PvP."

I have always kept my minecraft keys at default, considering I am very used to them. that also means that I tap the "W' key twice to sprint. I am very used to that and I think is effective enough for me to get a kill.
