So I received a verbal warning for killing somebody before wall drop (Walls, one of the Tetris maps) - we had both skybased above 20 (the height of the sand walls) and I shot him.<br><br>Look, that's what I do, I trade shots with people in skybases before wall drop.&nbsp; Some of the time I get killed, other times (probably 2/3 of the time) I am able to kill the other person first.&nbsp; Before wall drop.&nbsp; They shoot at me, I shoot at them.&nbsp; It is my strategy.&nbsp; It is the strategy of dozens of other players.&nbsp; This is a part of the game.&nbsp; <br><br>Why is this even a question?&nbsp; Is somebody really trying to say that sky base warfare is against the rules?&nbsp; It is understood that if you sky base people will be shooting at you, and that you will be shooting at them.&nbsp; It is part of the game.&nbsp; There is no glitch.&nbsp; <br><br>You don't want to get shot at before wall drop?&nbsp; Don't build up in a sky base near the center before wall drop.&nbsp;&nbsp; Really, it's that simple.<br><br>If you (as the developer) want to stop this then make the walls 100 blocks high instead of 20, but don't accuse me of cheating for shooting people across the walls, as they are shooting at me too!<br><br>By the way, this only happens on Tetris maps due to the elevated chest with the Tetris bow, diamond helm, etc.&nbsp; This never (or extremely rarely) happens on other maps.

Seeing as the first 10 minutes of a walls game is supposed to be a grace period...it would seem pretty odd if the were to allow the killing of other players before the walls dropped. In the 10 minutes you get before the walls drop you can mine, farm, enchant, brew, and build a skybase, without harm from other players. Next time this happens, report the player shooting at you and don't shoot back :P

The game starts the second the game starts.&nbsp; It says "The Match has Begun", not "Grace Period has Begun".<br><br>The catch in the game is that you can't move beyond your quadrant before wall drop.&nbsp; That's it, if you can manage to kill other people before wall drop then it's fair game, but the only way to do that is to shoot them.&nbsp; <br><br>I have played this game since MCZone days and can say that sniping people on other quadrants has been around since the beginning.&nbsp; It is a part of the game. The only reason it has (apparently) become an issue is because many people now skybase near the center of the Tetris maps to get to the elevated chest, and yes, people trade shots.<br><br>Look, if it were truly a grace period then you wouldn't be able to die from anything.&nbsp; Shooting people is part of the game.

well i would say stop it until/if it becomes allowed, as i reported a player (not naming) who shot a couple people, and he just got punished.. like, a couple hours ago... that's proof enough for me
