</h1>
I was playing Nebula on CherrylandMC and i see a lot of people trolling with TNT.<br>This is really annoying and lags a lot.<br><br>So my suggestions are:<br><ul><li>Disable TNT block damage.</li><li>Remove <b>all</b> the TNT from chests and put on the spawn kit 8 of TNT (or more, or less. I think 8 is right)</li><li>Add a prevention to carpet bombing(1). Maybe an area on the sky when you can't place TNT.}</li></ul>(1) Carpet Bombing is make a platform in the sky. Make a hole on the center and throw Primed TNT to areas with a lot of players.<br><br><b>EDIT:</b>&nbsp;Ok, looking at all the feedback i throught: What about two versions of Cherryland? One with TNT + TDM and other with the suggestions i said before + DTM?<br><br>~<i>Netux</i>

No, but I understand the griefing, everything else I disapprove, I want a lot of tnt for use so I can make my cannons ._.

This is a good idea but it would really take the fun out of the TNT...<br>Maybe there would be two types of TNT: blue and red. Red would be for the red team and blue would be for the blue one. If you have a blue TNT, you could not blow up any blocks on blue's side. If you have a red TNT, you can not blow up any blocks on red's side. Blue team would get blue TNT and red team would get the red one.&nbsp;<br>I have no idea if this is possible to code-- these are just ideas :3

Perhaps we can put 32 or 64 pieces of tnt in spawnkit? With redstone?

I'm really fine with the TNT.&nbsp;<br>Personally, if someone is griefing with TNT on that map, and you report him ASAP, I know that many moderators will come quickly.&nbsp;<br>The griefers will be able to be removed very swiftly, and I find the cannons that other people make really interesting!

Give it time and Avicus users will eventually learn how to tnt just like OCN. Carpet bombing is part of ocn :/

I support this but I don't like having 2 versions of maps in different folders.<br><br>What I am going to do is add bedrock slipped under the grass, add TNT filters to disable block damage everywhere besides the monument area and front lines, and make a flashy message specifically saying "You may not explode TNT here." because I see no other reason to be putting TNT in your gold area. However, the other team can go on your side and grief it; just not your own team. Another thing is I'm going to provide water and move the TNT chests toward spawn and make it a rule to not carpet bomb spawn from the clouds.
