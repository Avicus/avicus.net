Without naming any names, I believe that in many cases which I have witnessed, if it is getting towards the end of a nexus match some donors will leave and join the team that is winning. Even though winning doesn't make you any better I feel that they do this just to make themselves look really good and so that they can think and feel that they are better than anyone else.<br><br>What's your opinion?

actually if you win on nexus you get points so... i agree it's not good to switch teams at the end just because you want to win.

It's not our concern however.&nbsp;<br>The donors aren't "cheating" because there is no rule saying you can't join teams when a match is about to finish; in the intention of winning.

This doesn't affect anybody else, but we did pay for it. It may be cheap, but it's not in the rules (as far as I know) to not be allowed to do that.

I paid for gold, so I can switch teams if I feel like it. Most of the time, I'm enjoying myself so much I forget to check the time and change for the xp. It doesn't impact&nbsp;<i>your</i> game in any way. Also, recapping what jozz said, there is no rule saying you can't do that so how is it "cheating". Anyways, nuff said.

Sure, it's cheap but it's not really that big of a deal. It doesn't really heavily affect gameplay, it just kinda makes em look like a nub. It's only like 8 XP.<br><br>To the people who are saying "we donated, we do what we want with the perks":<br>That's really stupid to say, because that's like buying a gun from a store for "self defence", then you go murderer someone for no reason.

That right there. &nbsp;Pisses me off. &nbsp;But it is mostly non-donors I have seen do this, or they go on the other team to break down the defenses at the monuments and then switch back. &nbsp;I have seen this so many times o_o

Why don't we change it so that you gain xp from the amount of time you've spent on a team? For example every minute your loyal to your team you get 2 xp points :)
