A video won't help you learn any faster, you need to just go into a single player world and practice

It's all about the rhythm. You're going to have to try and find the rhythm yourself by practicing a lot.<br><br>It took me a while to find my rhythm, but once you find it it's fairly easy.

When I first started off, I used to normal bridge. Then I got into trying to shift, un-shift, shift, un-shift quickly until I got the hang of it. I started practicing ninja-bridging before the quarter-finals of ToC :D. And from then on I could do ninja staircase bridging and practicing breeziling staircase atm :). Don't worry it won't take too long to do it, just go into a singleplayer world and keep trying :)

Always ninja bridge in the side where ur least likely to get knocked off so for example: on a block go the left edge of it and start ninjaing and if u start to sway a little to the right just keep going left.

I guess you mean shroom bridge?<br>Just go to singleplayer, start making a normal bridge, every once and then just unshift and shift in time, Try to do it more and more.<br>I took me like 4 tries then I had it.<br><br><br>Imo, you jitterclick when you shroom bridge, try to time the clicks instead.

It's just practice. And the stuff about practicing in single player, that's only partly true. You have to practice in Multiplayer too, to develop an instinct, because in single player it's a lot more easy.

For me it just came naturally, after I was doing a ton of shift staircase bridging on hypixel skywars. After a while I could feel something in my fingers, like I'd want to go faster with my bridges but I didn't have the skill to do so.&nbsp;<br><br>Then in a high stress situation (OCN ranked), I just spontaneously started to ninja staircase without ever having done it before, and ever since then I've had it, as well as normal ninja bridge.<br><br>If you can't seem to get it while practicing, I suggest you just play a lot more while trying to do a bunch of shift staircase bridging, and try to go faster and faster when doing it, which will bring you closer to doing a ninja bridge. Regular shift bridging won't really help that much, as it's not something where you can go faster in any way.

Ahh, you mean the pressure of bridging with people around shooting and stuff? The urgency makes you fail.

I just listen to music with a very distinct beat, and time my clicks and shifting/unshifting with the bass and snare drum.

You unshift on the block and shift when you are about to place the block. It literally took me 1 day to actually get quite good at this.

Ninja bridging is not that hard, it took me an hour to learn. Like the others said, go on a single player world and just keep on practising.
