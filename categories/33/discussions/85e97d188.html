There is no such thing as ultimate defence, it depends on the map, the number of defenders, and other factors. I created this thread because I want to know what works well, so just comment with a description of your favourite strategy to protect the monument. Thanks :)

Mine is to dig everything out on the monument Island, apart from the obsidian block and the bedrock, and build a wood base with many floors such as a sniping tower and a storage room for armour and blocks used for building etc. I make sure not to cover the monument so we can see if someone is mining it. Also have no bridge connecting the monument island to the main island with spawn on so we could easily snipe the person who is building a bridge to get a monument.

I use a strategy somewhat like ZaCrowGaming's, but less complex as you need to watch out for incoming rushers as well as building an OP defence. I also prefer not to build a bridge to spawn as this allows for wasy access and easy opposing team griefing. Here are some of my defences: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/sVPgl">http://imgur.com/a/sVPgl</a>

If the monument is on an island, I'd make a blow slightly below it with slabs and use slabs and trap doors to protect the monument.&nbsp;<br><br>If it's "on land" (ex: rendezvous) I like to dig out the ground then add crafting tables and buttons on the bottom. Under the monument I will put alternating fences and buttons<br><br>If its CTW, I like the do a similar thing as above but with a crafting table/possibly water wall.

destroy everything except monument, place buttons on the side of the bedrock platform and pressure plates or buttons on the top, maybe build a wall around it with wood and arrow holes so you dont get killed immediately

Wait. Why do this when you could just watch the monument and not block it up? Are you a big block hitter or something?

The box strategy is a good defense if you need to set something up quickly and if the rushers don't come in big groups.

yes but the light will come through the little hole and alert the defenders. also if you have trapdoors around the obsidean you will know if someone is mining it

First off. You must get it in your head that there is no defense that can defend from all. There is a way to break a defense and you must find the weaknesses in your defense and yourself.<br><br>Monuments are the primarily used objectives in avicus and they are usually obsidian blocks. You need a way so that a player isn't able to block up in the monument. If there are blocks in the way it is harder to kill your enemy. Blocks I would recommend are<br>Buttons<br>Pressure Plates[Top]<br>Slabs[Top and Bottom]<br>Trap Doors<br>Levers<br>Signs<br><br>Blocks that I wouldn't recommend<br>Full Blocks<br>Glass<br>Leaves<br>Ladders<br><br>It is a great idea to see how many blocks you have and to see how many you need for the defense. If you have a lot of wood and are comfortable with trap doors then I would suggest that, if you are on a map with very limited items, I would suggest using buttons as it is only one block for one.<br><br>Taking out the environment around the monument would be good. They can hide in the terrain and also if they fall from bridging it would take longer to block back up. Using slabs to cover the bottom once you hit bedrock is suggested by me because it takes less blocks and it is longer to break. If you have the time and recourses. pressure plates can work but slabs can do the job just as nice.&nbsp;<b></b>It is suggested to take peeks at the monument a few times if digging a pit so you know if someone is breaking it or not<br><br>The one thing I dislike is a house-type defense. They don't work well. Someone can hide in the house easily and break the monument. I said this before and I will say it again, one of the defender's biggest fear is not knowing where the offender is. This goes for covering the monument in full blocks as well. They can block up and hide in the monument area. There is no defense between him and the monument if this happens. Glass and Ladders are the biggest myths that almost everyone uses. Glass is a good block in sense because you can hear them if they break the glass...but no extra blocks can go onto glass and so it is VERY easy for an offender to block himself and break the monument. Ladder work better but...I rather use buttons. Ladders do not allow someone to break the monument on the side they are on. But, if there is a skybridge and the guy is lucky enough to jump into the monument area. They have a chance to kill you or to break the monument.<br><br>The last real thing is about you as a defender. Try to get the best armor possible and lead no bridges to your defense if the monument is on an island. If you are making a "Defender's Hut" then you need to make it very simple and easy to use. It should only be made by glass or other items that you can see threw. Make a one high wall on each side so it isn't easy to fall off. Make sure it isn't too close to your monument or it can be used against you if they kill you and use that hut to break the monument. I would like to compare this to the finals of OCN's tournament when they used Balloons DTM as a map. It has obsidian monuments. The teams were Ambush and Gm1. On Ambush's side they didn't have a "defender's hut" but Gm1 did. There is no real "right way" in using one. As long as you have a good way to shoot enemies and can't die easily on it. Know your weaknesses and strengths so it can be better on where you place in your defense.<br><br>My last piece of advice is to don't worry about failing. I try new defenses all the time. Some are good, some make my avicus team cry, some look like a space ship from Star Wars[I actually did this by mistake]So this is my suggestion but there is no real "One way" in defending. Just try it and see what makes you comfortable and what can makes the offenders cry.

Yea i agree with that. Using pressure plates and buttons is a good way to stop the rushers blocking themselves in.&nbsp;<br><br>Sometimes it can be really tempting to concentrate on making the defence nice and pretty instead of making it practical xD I think that once you have a defence set up you should just focus on watching the monument instead of always trying to make the defence better

Yes in the common sense it isn't good to have your defense cluttered. I would suggest after you make a basic defense is to expand into what you notice you are weak with and what you are strong in. In all honesty just experiment
