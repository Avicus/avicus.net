Hallo forum-user! :)<br>I want to address the topic of <b><i>camping.</i></b><i></i><br>So when I play Nebula, I usually tend to play in the "frontlines" or "midfield" position, which is where I basically prevent the other team from getting to our side. This usually involves sniping people off bridges, creating fortified walls, etc.<br>However, whenever I kill people, there's always that person that says:<br>"omg wtf u freaking camper"<br>"camper im reporting"<br>"lol u nub camper"<br>Now I know that this so-called "camping" may seem unfair, where people try to get to the other side and I happen to kill them.<br>But let me tell you something.<br>You're the one who's coming to <b>me</b>. Whenever someone accuses me of "camping," they always try to rush through the same route <b>ever single time.</b> And you know what the results in? Me sniping you off your little glass bridge on the side of Halycon. It's <b>your</b> fault that you happen to rush on a predictable path that will ultimately lead to your <b>death.</b> If you really want to get to the monument, try something new! A skybridge? Underground tunneling? Below-map bridging? I realize that I may be staying in one spot sniping helpless victims off into the void, but you should use this fact to your advantage instead of me using it to <b>my</b> advantage.<br><br>And if you think "camping" in the middle of the map is bad, what about people who play defense? It's practically the same thing, except they're literally puppy-guarding the monument with their lives (well, some people are.)<br><br>Also, I don't just camp or kill farm each game. I do, in fact, rush. I do, in fact, play defense. I do, in fact, make skybridges, I do, in fact, mess around with friends and do nothing. And I do, in fact, play my role as a midfielder and frontlines guy. It's my niche, and other's niche as well. It's how I play the game, and it's my preferred and most-developed playstyle. It's how I have fun. But most importantly, it's how I help my team the most and others appreciate that. I buy time for the rushers to get the obsidian and I relieve the pressure of the defenders defending our own monument. I distract the other team from noticing that giant skybridge in the, well, sky. I omit dangerous threats that try to cross the border between the teams. And I said before, it's how I help my team the most.<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ random divider line lol<br><br>I'm sorry about my rant, I just wanted to get that out there because these accusations toward me/others have become <b><i>extremely </i></b><i></i>prevalent and <b><i>extremely</i></b><i></i> annoying.<br><br>Do you think "camping" is frowned upon? Or, more importantly, do you think that "camping" is a threat to the overall gameplay and thus should be against the rules?<br>Post your comments, please. I want to hear feedback. And thanks for reading &lt;3

There are so many ways to get around on each map that it really isn't that big of a deal if you ask me

I totally agree! Camping is no more effective than rushing or defending, it's simply a strategy in which some people have a hard time facing. It's not like you're gaining anymore by camping than you are by rushing. It really is the person who keeps coming to you's fault-- they can rush somewhere else or find a creative way to take on you on but they just kinda keep on rushing thoughtlessly and then complain about you stopping them. The only way to be unfair or "Cheat" on this server is by finding an exploit or hacking; you can't cheat by following an effective strategy that helps your team. They know you're there yet they still refuse to keep on coming because they don't want to go anywhere else for whatever reasons they have. Then, once you shoot them off, as you said, they complain about you comping, or really themselves being so insane. There are ways around it, they just choose not to take them. Awesome topic-- I hate peeps like this, too.

Exactly. Open world maps like Fantasy aren't exactly the one to "camp" on, but maps with void, like Halycon and Justice, are prime examples of maps where I get accused. It's also interesting to note that maps with a middle island encourage "camping" even more, such as Senex and Justice.
