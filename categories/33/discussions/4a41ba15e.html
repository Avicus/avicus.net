W tap or no?

So i've been pvping for a while and I hear w-tapping decreases kb somehow and lets you combo more easily. I don't w-tap because I think it's weird and I don't see many pvpers doing it so I just wanted to know if I should develop a new tactic because over the past couple of weeks i've upped my kill/death ratio by 0.05 using my normal strafe and I'm trying to reach atleast 2.00 so I'm wondering if w-tapping will speed up the process at all.

W tap helps a lot imo, my sprint key is Q so I tap that not w but I think it makes It makes it a lot simpler to get kills as u rely a lot less on strafe and block hit and u can just get double hits after the kb. I'm pretty sure ur ping is good too so I recommend tryin it

Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States.

Well, from my personal experience I only can use the w tap tactic on players which play less (I can't use it against ppl like you) and most likely therefore have lower clicking speeds. It never works against good, like, professional minemen, or I just do it wrong.
