&nbsp;So Im Currently Playing a walls game, And im kit stomper. I built Really high and stomped on a team of 4 and killed them all. But, It says they were killed by themselves. So i didn't get the Kill. Wondering if this issue could be fixed.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;Part II:<br>Yesterday i was teamed with Other Skype friends Who were also stomper. I was on the ground and they were Building up. One was shot off and landed by me and killed me. &nbsp;We were on the same team and stomper killed me.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Just a heads up Walls players and stomper users.
