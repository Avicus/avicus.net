Do you need a rundown on each of the gamemodes and how they are played?<br><br>Regarding the lack of players, there isn't much we can do about it. We could potentially have an event where we play all of the gamemodes, if you would like to see that happen. It depends on if the community would like to do that.

^ yes.<br><br>Imagine if we had Mosh Pit, which is a gamemode on Call of Duty Advanced Warfare, which is a mixture of gamemodes, sometimes blended into one.<br><br>That's a sick idea.
