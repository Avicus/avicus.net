Hello, this is going to be my "Defense Posts", where I'll be showing you people out there some of the most effective ways of defending! ***<b>Any Admin please give me map downloads of at least 2-3 maps that are still active! This would be gladly appreciated!&nbsp;</b>So here is the first Defense (Not a map on the server, just a First time defence with a 19x19 area)<br><br>A 19x19 &nbsp;Void defense by:&nbsp;<b><i>vsplesk101 &amp; Overcast!</i></b><i></i>&nbsp;<u>Please read the <b>signs</b>&nbsp;in the Photo album for understanding of this defense!</u> :<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://imgur.com/a/t4g7k">http://imgur.com/a/t4g7k</a><br><br>&nbsp; More coming soon...

I can think a bunch of ways to make this better, try putting crafting tables behind the buttons in the wall. And instead of buttons in the obby, put trapdoors. Hope this helps.

Trap doors? why? buttons are harder to aim at, I agree with the crafting tables but... I dont see the trap doors to be in them :P &nbsp;@cedd2701<br>*EDIT:<br><br>Oh on the objective?... Ye this server doesnt have many rushers, Cause when you jump on top of it its easy to hit the Trapdoor and blocks yourself in... so i use buttons cause its easier and i rlly dont see a diffirence :P. I think trap doors makes it worse (My opinion) :P

This is a horrible technique. Not on all maps U can do this. Some maps don't have wood. Others are too thick to make a pit. There is even bedrock in most maps! Ballzis technique is better. He is willing to hand train then on different maps. Using a picture is horrible. If u are going to do this ask for peoples skype and go hand train then to actually get different defenses on each map.

his "hate" is actually constructive criticism just rephrased it a harsher way, the "snow queen."
