Nice idea, executed poorly though. It's actually kinda easy to get the monument. All you need is 2 guys distracting the defenders while one guy stacks up and surrounds himself.

First time someone is capable&nbsp;of defending their monument <i>almost</i> the right way it should be done, you should never cover the monument, <i>IF</i> you do, use glass, iron bars or any other transparent block. It is why I will say it is an ok defence. *thumbs up*<br><br>I tried this out when I started to play on Avicus, tell me if someone will get to the monument without me noticing xD It's quite impossible actually.<br><br><a href="http://i.imgur.com/Db5yOlP.png" rel="nofollow">http://i.imgur.com/Db5yOlP.png</a>

1. No, you can't bridge from below, you would be detected right away as there is only void all around you and your wood/glass bridge would be spotted right away. <br>2. If you tried to boat down, I would add wooden slabs over the iron bars, as you don't spawn with an axe it takes you extra time to mine the wood by hand and there's no tool to mine iron bars quicker. I'm 110% sure I would see you in just a second. (I tried it out with Eric and he couldn't get to it at all. &lt;3) <br>3. How do you attack from behind when there's void surrounding the monument?

It's easy to attack from behind.<br>Make a sky base going 50 blocks behind the monument. Pour water down and go lower. Bridge towards the monument from behind.

Actually, Seth knows what he's doing. These are tactics that I would be using to get this type of monument, and it has worked quite well in my past experience.

Is this a challenge? ;) xD <br><br>I'm not saying it's a perfect defence or it's the best defence, I'm giving him a couple of ideas of how he can make his defence better. I'm sure though, you would not get past me, even if you so made a skybase 100 blocks behind the monument. I know it takes three hits with a bow to kill you (rushers always take off their armor), I know exactly where I should aim and exactly when I should release. I know I should aim and release when you are running, when you run and jump at the same time and get hit by an arrow you take more damage then when you just walk or stand still. Water will not help you in this either, how many buckets you place, the water will just work against you, not with you. I know exactly how I should aim to hit you when you are hiding behind your wall and how I should get you both from below and above. I'm always moving and I always look behind me, I'm sure I would spot you :)

You're wrong in one part: rushers take off only&nbsp;<b>colored</b> armor, not all of the armor. Correct me if I'm wrong on this, but from what I remember, you spawn with only 1 or 2 pieces of leather, and the rest gold and iron on Sandstorm, so it would take more than 3 hits. Also, you have a good defense plan, but you forgot the possibility of a full diamond guy charging in and distracting you when Seth bridges. In that case, even if you could kill the diamond guy, it would probably be too late.
