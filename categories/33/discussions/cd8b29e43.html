If you want a new PC, and you don't want to build it, I really recommend Xidax, they custom build computers, and have lifetime warranties on all of their desktop builds. &nbsp;Really high-quality company.<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://xidax.com/">http://xidax.com/</a>

Thou shall not need an HDD with 4GB of space, (unless you do a ton of recording and editing and need *that* much space)... Depends really on your needs.<br><br>Boot and run the OS from the SSD, and just store whatever you need to store on your HDD.

Don't go with sli or crossfire. They both don't support minecraft so only one GPU will work.

In most cases runs minecraft at an Amazing&nbsp;<i><b></b></i><b>1500&nbsp;</b>Fps if using shaders, recording and max settings - Lowest settings, without shaders-And recording it does about 2000-2500 fps, At a budget at 5k You can get on for 10k Which i actually have spare (Im not rich, this is hard earned money). So yea... I will be replying tomorrow again at 10AM Central time :) Hope to see you there! :)

A single 780ti beats a titan black for half the price..<br>And a titan black is a graphics card? not a pc<br>And you said your friend had that alienware pc for over 3 years,<br>the titan z only recently got released.<br>And I'm sure you'll only reach 3k fps+ With either an overclocked i7, or an overclocked i7 extreme series cpu.<br><br>And tell me, which gpu can beat a 780ti in SLI?<br><br>And how is it possible that with an i7 4960x, 32gb of ram (assuming some is allocated to mc) and a titan z, you got 400-800 fps?<br><br>I get 300-650 with an i7 3770, 8gb of ram and a gtx 660?<br><br>And if this "titan black" you speak of actually is a pc, why are you getting it if its 25k and your max budget is 5k?<br>And I understood you had 10k spare, 5k + 10k = 15k.<br>Tbh, I think you're a bit lost.

Did you get the Intel Core i7-4820K, 4930K or the 4960X?&nbsp;<br><br>IMO the 4960X is just overkill and mainly intended for bragging rights. Only difference is the 12MB and 15MB of cache, other than that the 4930K performs almost exactly like the 4960X.<br><br>And the Titan Z... Just... *sigh* You're better off with a Nvidia GTX 780Ti.

If your gonna say i ignore everything, please leave. And i have chosen the graphics card for the Gaming performance to be NVIDA GeForce GTX 780... and for General Performance i got the Titan Z.

All I was trying to warn you about is that: Alienware rip you off big time.<br>And that the titan z isn't worth it's cost.<br>At half of the price you can get the r9 295x2 which out performs it.<br>And if you're going to spend that amount of money, why not get a 760/770/780 for the moment and wait for the new 800 series?<br><br>Sorry you took offence to my posts.

They do have liguid cooling, the thing about that is:<br><br>Expensive, however doesnt make noise...<br>Expensive, (If you have the money and you have a loud room get it).<br><br>Aurora R4... Its just a little better, bigger, stronger, power. :)

You are correct, Alienware has their "Premium Liquid Cooling" system made by Asetek, model is 545LC, and all they do is remove the Asetek logo and just stick an Alienware logo on it.

Yeah, I decided I'll wait for the same until I buy any parts. Going to the U.S. Mid way through next year, so I'll likely buy it over there as they sell them much cheaper.
