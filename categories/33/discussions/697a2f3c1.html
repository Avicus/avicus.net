Don't think so poorly of yourself and the discussion. Many people end up posting something without realizing it's already been posted.

One of my best gameplay moments was when I was in a HG back in MCZone, and some guy had built a skybase. Myself and this guy were the only ones left and I had 1 egg in my inventory. I waited until he was on the edge, and I threw my egg and knocked him off to win :p. Also, making a bunch of awesome friends over time on the server :D
