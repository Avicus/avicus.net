Recently, there has been some DDoSing going around and even some account hacking from some guy.&nbsp;<br><br>If you did not know, the guys name is lelddos or something like that, and he has already hit many major servers, including our friends at OCN.<br><br>All I ask is that all of you change your password just to be safe, I would hate to see any of your accounts being hacked.

This one is actually pretty serious, the guy made a list of 1.8k+ accounts with their info.<br>I didn't see anyone on the list that I recognized, but I would still advise that you change your password.

I will send the link to the staff via a report.<br><br>I don't want it to end up with people that are already banned here, because then they could just use it for ban evasion.

Many names on that list were real (Although a couple hundred were fake).<br><br>Either way, you cannot log in with the credentials that the guy posted in that link I shared with the staff, so there isn't that much of a worry.<br><br>However, if someone happened to know the player's email address (Assuming they have a mojang account) they could still get into it.<br>One of the accounts was a friend of mine's, and since I knew his email address I could access it.<br><br>Of course, I told him and he changed his password and such.
