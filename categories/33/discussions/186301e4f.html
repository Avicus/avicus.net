If CTW is going to be added with the current state of the YAML it will just be a bridge fest of endlessly high sky bridging and just overwhelming defenders with water or other means. Another equally game- ruining possibility is that people will just bridge endlessly out to one side bridge forward and bridge in. Also with no-shift bridging it people can bridge even faster to get to wool rooms.&nbsp;<br><br><br><b>What needs to happen.<br></b><br><b></b>In the YAML an&nbsp;<b>easier</b>&nbsp;<b></b>to restrict sky bridging and a way to restrict bridging out to the right and left <b>before&nbsp;</b>CTW is out.

This also can achieved, if you make no build regions around and above the map. As long the plug-in doesn't supports this, you'll need these non-build regions. Other than that good suggestion. I'll add this to my map as long it isn't supported plugin sided.

I disagree. Restricting gameplay only worsens the situation. As the current YAML module stands, we allow limitless skybridging; giving freedom to players. Do you really want players restricted to certain areas to bridge? It just adds a whole different aspect to the gameplay; encouraging players to skybridge.

For the Yaml you just could define everything as a non-build region and inside you'll make  a build region with a higher priority. Only 2 more simple regions. It wouldn't be so much work, unless you have to do it at every nebula map.

I get your point but I haven't seen this way used in any DTM map I just want to remind map makers of how this will ruin CTW and to remember to implement it in their maps. But it would be nice if there was a simple a way to do so.

Yes but limitless sky bridging every match does not allow for other strategies and de motivates the minority of people who defend. No matter how high you build a wall or a pit a sky bridge will always get over it. Skybriding every match gets boring and stale quickly as it is almost always just a race to get the highest sky bridge up..

No I'm not saying to remove it. I'm saying to limit it so it's not as over powered and people will try other strategies.<br><br>Also it demotivates defenders because they know no matter how high they build a wall a person can get over it. So what's the point of defending if your attempts will be futile.

Incredibly high skybridging isn't really that useful for CTW. You gotta remember, once you get the wool you have to get back up to your skybridge, which is a hard thing to do with defenders shooting at you.

I agree with you on this one. Also there should be block placing restrictions when placing blocks in the void because the people will just wallrun and it will be too easy to get captures. The best height limit in my opinion would be 20-30 blocks because that's not too high or low.

It differentiates the gameplay here from that at vercast.<br>U-bridging is not a term in overcast, because their plugin allows map makers to add limits around the map.<br>Extremely high sky bridging has the same fate too, most map makers choose not to allow it.<br><br>This server is not Overcast.

I highly agree, these bridges would ruin CTW and the style of it. CTW matches tend to last long and with endless skybridges and bridges off to the side, CTW will be too clustered and it would ruin the game mode imo and a few others agree with me on this.

OK my turn,<br><br>IMO a limit has to be somewhere, I'm taking it that wool rooms have protection for attackers, eg. you can't sit in your own wool or build there, like OCN. All you have to do is bridge 200 in the air and just water drop into wool room and because defenders can't go into own wool room, they cant do much. Sure they can shoot you but you'll just fall into your own water. Also in regards to sides, this can go either way but i reckon it should be limited so each team isnt trying to outflank each other 100 blocks wide of the map. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Just what I think, Nathan

I haven't played much CTW; only in scrimmages and a few times on OCN. However, sneaking along the edge of a map is, in my opinion, a really useful tactic for tight situations, at least in DTM. It isn't that hard to defend against...just place buttons along the side..., but players should be able to build at least one block into the void. I agree that players shouldn't be able to build massive, 200 block high skybridges, or 100 blocks out into the void, but we should at least have some way to sneak besides tunneling. Again, I don't have much CTW experience, but this is based on my past experience in DTM.

YA as people previosly stated, CTW is a special case. CTW needs to be limited in order for better gameplay. I mean, if someone can bridge from one enemy wool room to another with out restrictions, it would pretty much suck. What makes CTW good is that it is challenging. ITs like capture the flag. Capture the flag would be ruined if there was no limits right?

There's a difference between in extra challenge for defenders and an exercise in futility.<br><br>In CTW with 200 block high sky bridges you can't shoot people off and as Nath said you can just bridge to the wool and just water down. Also we must also consider the fact that defenders have the least motivation to do what they do.<br><br><ul><li><b>They very rarely get appreciation.</b></li><li><b>What they do is very boring and menial but a&nbsp;necessity &nbsp;(digging pits, building walls and generally just digging stuff out).</b></li><li><b>You don't get the same thrill as you do when you rush when you are defending.</b><br><br></li></ul><span><br>So do defenders really need another challenge, as to counter an impossibly high sky bridge where if they shoot people they will simply respawn come back and keep continuing.<br><br>Hypothetically if there are 15 defenders versus 10 attackers on a sky bridge even if&nbsp;the defenders&nbsp;shoot them off they can just keep coming and coming, so the attackers win 9 times out of 10. Like Zombies in Call of Duty.<br><br>I understand defenders do what they do by choice but do they really need another challenge?<br><br><br></span>

I don't agree with you here, you said players should be able to build out one block, I disagree. This is not the point of a CTW, CTW are on the main paths, not on the side of them. In that case what's the point of having paths? Feel free to 'argue' with me about this ;).

In that case, you would need to make the map in a way that discourages building along the side if the map, otherwise it becomes to easy.

I don't agree with you here, you said players should be able to build out one block, I disagree. This is not the point of a CTW, CTW are on the main paths, not on the side of them. In that case what's the point of having paths? Feel free to 'argue' with me about this ;).

"In that case what 's the point of having paths?"<br><br>You could ask the same for DTM, or any other gamemode. Sure, you could sneak slowly along the edge, but if someone were to rush on the main path successfully, they'd beat you. Also, of course you wouldn't be able to build anywhere. But there are some useful tactics, like clutching to the side to prevent a death, then speeding off the enemy. You probably wouldn't be able to sneak too close to the wool room like that though. You have some good points there.

If find it game breaking actually, because you can spend 30 minutes setting up an awesome defence only for it too be beaten by someone rushing along the sides. Also, if you can't build a long the side, how can you clutch? ;)

Let's take rendezvous 3, for example. You would probably be able to clutch on the front side of the map, but not anywhere beyond the iron/spawn. That way you have a way of sneaking through the front lines/midfielders, but still have to get through the defense.

OK my turn,<br><br>IMO a limit has to be somewhere, I'm taking it that wool rooms have protection for attackers, eg. you can't sit in your own wool or build there, like OCN. All you have to do is bridge 200 in the air and just water drop into wool room and because defenders can't go into own wool room, they cant do much. Sure they can shoot you but you'll just fall into your own water. Also in regards to sides, this can go either way but i reckon it should be limited so each team isnt trying to outflank each other 100 blocks wide of the map. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Just what I think, Nathan

With wool, you have to get back out as well. Pillaging back up to your bridge doesn't help because you'll get shot off, so your only option is to charge through their defenses.

There's a difference between in extra challenge for defenders and an exercise in futility.<br><br>In CTW with 200 block high sky bridges you can't shoot people off and as Nath said you can just bridge to the wool and just water down. Also we must also consider the fact that defenders have the least motivation to do what they do.<br><br><ul><li><b>They very rarely get appreciation.</b></li><li><b>What they do is very boring and menial but a&nbsp;necessity &nbsp;(digging pits, building walls and generally just digging stuff out).</b></li><li><b>You don't get the same thrill as you do when you rush when you are defending.</b><br><br></li></ul><span><br>So do defenders really need another challenge, as to counter an impossibly high sky bridge where if they shoot people they will simply respawn come back and keep continuing.<br><br>Hypothetically if there are 15 defenders versus 10 attackers on a sky bridge even if&nbsp;the defenders&nbsp;shoot them off they can just keep coming and coming, so the attackers win 9 times out of 10.

YA as people previosly stated, CTW is a special case. CTW needs to be limited in order for better gameplay. I mean, if someone can bridge from one enemy wool room to another with out restrictions, it would pretty much suck. What makes CTW good is that it is challenging. ITs like capture the flag. Capture the flag would be ruined if there was no limits right?
</blockquote>
</div>
Then perhaps don't put wool rooms right next to each other. It adds new things for map makers to explore rather than just making the usual two lane CTW, where the wool rooms are next to each other, separated by fancy coding, they have to implement ways to have a similar effect using just the map, which differentiates gameplay in perhaps an interesting and fun way and distances us from the gameplay from the only other server offering a similar gamemode, OCN.

You guys all failed to mention a point, yes you do have to return the wool to their base but when players create 180 block high bridges it is a real pain to try shooting them off, most of the time the bridge wouldn't even render let alone an arrow covering the distance. &nbsp;<br><br>It just needs to be reduced to the point where we can defend but keep the tactic.

Given the fact that we want to be original, we don't want to do this. CTW are great. People need to learn how to defend against skybridgers. I have seen plenty of high sky bridges fail.

In my opinion, what Luxe is saying is right. There has to be restrictions to how far you can build up because if you can skybridge, CTW will be too easy. CTW is a difficult game which is why I enjoy this gamemode. Nebula, is too easy because many people sky bridge and the monuments are gone. That is my opinion, simple as. Also, on the edge of the map, I want a one block gap where you can place a block. This is because when someone knocks me off, I want to Block Place as I find that very unique in Nebula. That is all I want to say. Peace Out.

Who said you were not allowed to balance out the the factors?

You talk about balancing but having no void regions would make the gameplay more unbalanced then the current Nebula
