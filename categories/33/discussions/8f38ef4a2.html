Welp, another discussion... So i've been recently listening to music more often, and talking to my friends on TS, Mumble, And skype, believe it or not i actually think i got a tad bit better at pvp from this :P.. So i created this for (music perposes) to suggest music, (If you do not agree that music helps you, nor talking to friends, Please dont hate :/, it works for some)<br><b>FOR NERDS:&nbsp;</b>Music improves Focus by about 20-35%, and just painful things that may happen in lyfe. So if you agree with me, I'll just make a Top 10 Song list you might want to give a try and see if you imrpove! :D<br><br>*NOTE: This doesnt work for some people (But i suggest you give a try!)<br>TOP 10:<br><br>10. Pirates of the Caribbean - He's a Pirate | Link: (Soon)<br>9. PegBoard Nerds &amp; Tristam - Razor Sharp | Link: (Soon)<br>8. Tristam &amp; Braken - Flight | Link: (Soon)<br>7. Rezonate - Canvas (Good for relaxing) | Link: (Soon)<br>6. Tobu - Mesmerize | Link: (Soon)<br>5. PegBoard Nerds - New Style | Link: (Soon)<br>4.5. Grid 2 (Full tracks) (Relaxing) | Link: (Soon)<br>4. Disfigure - Summer Tune | Link: (Soon)<br>3. Matthew Koma - One night (vicetone Remix) | Link: (Soon)<br>2. Sway - Still Speedin' | Link:(Soon)<br>{1}. Stephen Walking - Elder Scrolls Dubstep (Skyrim fans will love this) | Link:(Soon)<br><br>***Make your own top 10! Speak out!<br><br><br>If this helped you... Let me know :3&nbsp;<b>Have a nice day!&nbsp;</b>[Eh... Ill get hate for dis topic :/]

Music probably won't affect much, if you do listen to music while playing don't have it up too loud.<br><br>Playing with friends helps, although it can only improve you as a team player, you need to figure out how to PvP by yourself.

I believe music doesn't help you directly - however, it aids in focusing your mind and letting go of the painful things in life, as well as getting pumped up and excited. It could very well help in PvP.<br><br>And friends definitely help; it's just fun to talk to others while playing. I don't know if it helps PvP, but it could. And working as a team definitely helps, as proper coordination, cooperation, communication, skill, and friendship between 2 players can dominate a whole team.<br><br>EDIT: I have a bunch of playlists on Soundcloud that I use. Sometimes I get them on plug.dj and play there C:<br><a href="https://soundcloud.com/cinnamoncroc/sets" rel="nofollow">https://soundcloud.com/cinnamoncroc/sets</a>

Music does not help me, in fact, it makes me worse because it lowers my FPS.

Personally, I would suggest large albums (about an hour or so), so if you're in the middle of a fight, you won't have to skip an ad or pick a new song. Here are some amazing songs by the Glitch Mob: the first is electric trance and the second is very energetic electric (not sure exactly what type of music it is), which is exactly what you want to PVP to. You might also want to check out Infected Mushroom if you're liking the electro. The songs sound quite strange and quirky at first, but once you listen to them, you really get into them and start to enjoy them.<br>Anyways, they help your PVP a ton, so I'd recommend you listening to them :3<br><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVqPx5mUj0g">Glitch mob- Drink the sea</a><br><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHfha6YxldA">Glitch mob- Love, death, immortality</a><br><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uloBD9xxwZ0&amp;list=FLufDgYExmmatP2xj-HzOXBQ&amp;index=10">Infected mushroom- Army of mushrooms</a><br><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yyb3Yp8CqeQ">Infected mushroom- Friends on mushrooms</a><br>Enjoy and good luck PVPing! :D
