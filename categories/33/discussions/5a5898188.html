Hey everyone!<br>So as you may know, I am very new to minecraft, &nbsp;and as such I don't really know what I'm doing. I'd like you guys to write one (or more) tip on how to be a better player on avicus. This can be as specific or general as you like, and can be a tip for a specific game mode or just general advice! Hopefully this will help me and anyone else who is in a similar situation :D<br><br>Thanks! And also thanks everyone for being such an amazing community, you guys have a really welcoming environment.

You've had MC for pretty much 1 or 2 days now. It's hard to get right into the PvP aspect right away but you'll see that you will get better over time. I guess maybe just look up videos on youtube to help you but tbh the best way is just to practice.<br><br>Aight and if you want a tip, maybe try circling around your opponent when PvPing so it's harder for them to hit you, but you get more hits on them.<br><br>gl mang

You don't have to be incredibly good at PvP to be good at Avicus. Players like Merp who get really bad ping and aren't the best at PvP can really shine due to the fact that they don't focus on credits or kills or PvP, they focus more on the monument. They are sneaky and have lots of techniques other, better PvPers strive for. At the end everyone has their style and it's better to have a good understanding of how competitive minecraft PvP works before getting into things like ninja bridging or fast skybridging. Try to find where you like to be on maps and try to learn the maps. I've found it easy to rush a lot of maps from looking at the map in a layer type of organization. You could rush from the sides, the middle, the same from below or from high up. And you shouldn't be afraid to try new things if you aren't succeeding in what your doing, but that doesn't mean give up.&nbsp;<br><br>Overall try to get in contact with a couple of good PvPers you see in game and ask them about the basics of PvP. Try to get a decent understanding of...<br><br>-Strafing and the different kinds of strafes<br><br>-Types of bridging<br><br>-Knockback increasing<br><br>-Comboing<br><br>-What FOV and sensitivity is right for you (you''l want to experiment a lot with this)<br><br>-Using the right items in the right place and time<br><br>Hope this helped, I'm coming back from vacation tomorrow and I don't have much time now so you can add me on Skype if you want help. I have a pretty decent understanding of the basics and how to get you started. But I always recommend going to other people as well because I'm not the best player in the world and I have things to learn as well.<br><br>Skype is SevoMC.

If you want to get competitive, don't join a tryhard team. I remember when I first joined I used to be mad when someone called me bad. Now I get triggered and break my keyboard&nbsp;<br><br>No jk but for real, have fun but don't become tryhard. If someone calls you bad or some shit, your response shouldn't be rage. You shouldn't care

Don't try to get competitive yet just have fun, get a feel of the server and you'll get better at pvp regardless.

Some of my tips:<br>-HAVE FUN!(Can't stress this enough)<br>-Don't worry about your stats just have fun.<br>-Try and be sneaky<br>-Learn techniques from other players(I learned how to ninja bridge from this we had a bridging lesson in bleened rings I think)

Really what I did, was search up how to pvp in minecraft 1.8 and came up MCSG rod PvP god Huahwi where he was giving some good SG pvp tips and tricks, but can easily be used also in any PvP situation.<br><br>The video I used:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPiMMla-mwU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPiMMla-mwU</a>

Just try to enjoy the game and try not to put yourself down if you keep on dying.&nbsp;Just keep practicing and you will succeed!&nbsp;Learning how to ninja bridge really helps&nbsp;with Destroy the Monument so I recommend that you learn it. (I thought myself)
