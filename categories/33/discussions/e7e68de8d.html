So, whenever I play Nebula, I always feel like something on the PVP aspect is missing. I thought about it and realized "maybe it's fishing rods and flint and steels"! Before the most recent update flint and steels were craftable. I remember playing this map, it was the old walls waiting room(if anyone remembers) in the centre chests, there were flame bows fire aspect swords and iron. Back then my goal wasn't the flame items it was always some iron. Our spawning island have gravel so... I made a flint and steel. I remember just having a great time flint and steeling the other teams, comboing them and like eight hearting full iron people. We didn't win, (someone snuck up on our monument) but that game was so much fun. The same kinda thing happens when I get a rod. So my belief is that if the staff allow flint and steels and maybe start you with a fishing rod the game would be more enjoyable. Ok, I know what you are thinking, couldn't people rod people off bridges? Or flint and steel teammates? Well I'm thinking maybe you have to pass a certain level to start with these items (maybe like level 30 or 40) because when you are ranked that high usually you won't be a troll. So this is just an opinion please give feedback in replys.

Fishing rods you can craft on some maps and are fun to combo players with. Flint and steels? Hell no. There is enough team trolling already, even with Prestiged players.

I like the idea but with the trolling like kycrafft said, even with higher pretiged players can be SO annoying and would just create more of it if the staff added FnS. With the rod it can sometimes be hard to use because of the ping most people get on avicus&nbsp;(good ping on avicus is probably about 80, just a guess) but it's still fun to have a rod anyway. I was thinking they could be shop items, maybe not the FnS but definitely the rod. But I find that the point of avicus is that it's all about strafing and using your bow as a rod. I feel like adding the rod and FnS would take away from that, making avicus one of those generic PvP servers.

Well FnS can help players get better at strafing. Since you have to always be aware that the opponent might have an FnS so you strafe more. Honestly, FnS might be bad but I will always love it &lt;3

You can craft fishing rods on maps like Senex III, Rendezvous, and Crescent, and I've been able to put it to good use on those maps. They have enough room for adequate strafing and fishing rod use.<br><br>As for flint and steel, we've had enough problems with team trolling before. Honestly, I don't think we will enable it back in.

I don't really think fishing rods are very needed in this case, because bows act like fishing rods if you use them correctly.<br><br>People typically use fishing rods to create knockback and stop the persons sprint for an easy strafe and hopefully a kill. But a bow and arrow acts as the same thing, just a little bit slower because of the charge back.<br><br>It works like this: You're being chased by someone. You're a reasonable distance away from the person and have managed to regenerate some hearts to stand a fighting chance. Usually in this case, this would be the time you turn around and fishing rod the person. But it could also be the same time to turn around and shoot the bow as well. It creates the same amount of knockback a fishing rod would do without the punch enchantment on it, then as the arrow hits the person, and deals more DAMAGE than the fishing rod, you pull out your sword and start to attempt to kill the player. <br><br>I for one think this is a more effective way to kill someone because you can deal more damage.<br><br>This is my opinion why fishing rods are not needed, because every game in Nebula, you usually start with a bow with arrows. You may not all agree with me on this, because many of you probably have never tried this.

Indeed, and if people still want to make fishing rods they can do that themselves.

I do that all the time. Although, it just doesn't feel or quite work the same... thanks for the explanation for everyone :D

I'm sure a lot of people use this tactic actually.<br><br>The only problem is that bows break your sprint and cause you to move slower. This can be problematic on head-to-head confrontations, though I do agree that a bow is better when you're being chased.<br>A bow is also slightly more functional due to the fact that it can charge up, so if you have time you could possibly charge up your bow for faster and more lethal arrow damage. Though, since the majority of your 1v1 confrontations will be head-to-head, a fishing rod may be beneficial.<br><br>Obviously it's down to personal preference at this point, but both items have their merit. Of course, since the bow is a staple to the Nebula layout, more people will be using it.

I really like the idea for fishing rods, even though I don't have any skill using them but there is a lot of flint and steel team trolling so probably no for fishing rods.

I think this will ruin the gameplay.<br>Flint and steels will just encourage team griefing and trolling.<br><br>Fishing rods would be used so excessivly that the PVP will become a pushing around contest where there'll be no real PVP. It'll just be a bunch of people knocking each other with fishing rods.<br>This could also encourage team griefing and trolling.<br><br>-1
