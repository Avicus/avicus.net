What ever happened to boats because I remember being able to do <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiPM_j1G3-4" rel="nofollow">this</a>. I can't do this anymore. Is this intentional and if so, could I have a valid reason?<br><br>Thanks, Whittleby

They were removed during the Avicore update? Or somewhere around that time. The only reason they don't work now is because the bs NCP plugins. Minecarts still work in a similar way if you're looking for a replacement.

No they weren't. Kyudo was using boats against us, remember?

NCP plugins aren't used on scrim servers and official ones afaik that's why it worked for them.

Well how come some people can use boats and others can't. That seems a little unfair to me....<br><br>Maybe someone should contact the devs to see whether they can fix this issue.
