So as everyone knows, the goal of Avicus is to consist of unique mini games, and contain nothing "bland." But from the feedback people have been giving us, It's coming to the realization that this attempt in making Avicus unique has been going downhill. I mean, I'm sure you all can agree. We now get an average of 130 players on at a time, when it used to be between 1,500-2,000 in McZone. So, we need to find ways to improve the qualities of Avicus one step at a time. Any feedback is accepted, unique or not. We&nbsp;<i>need ideas.</i>&nbsp;<br><br>Thanks for reading. -Jake

What about a game kind alike this...<br>I don't know if this is already a thing, so someone correct me if it is..<br>Basically, what you gotta do is..<br>There are 4+ teams, each team's section of their base has certain areas / panels of wool or something..<br>Basically, what you have to do for each team is to acquire and maintain as many of the other team's panels, and vice versa, and whoever has the most under their control gets points annually, like in Control the Hill.<br>Sorry if that didn't qutie make sense :P

When ivy code gets time from school... thats when it improves..<br><br>But my idea is that we have skywars... I think most uof use agree that its not unique but its popular &gt;.&lt;. Plus when ivy gets back he can code a better plugin for it, than most coders :D

Elimination=broken i mean legit hunger games.&nbsp; i believe it would bring in more players because "Nebula" and "Nexus" aren't traditional names for games like Walls.

You're absolutely right. An SG gamemode would definitely bring in the players, and keep them. But Nebula and Nexus are most likely staying, considering right now Nebula is our most played gamemode and Nexus is our only TDM based gamemode. CTH shouldn't really be based on TDM because they don't count score by kills. But otherwise yes, SG would be great if we added a bunch of unique maps.

I love Nebula and Nexus (my two favorite games) i am just saying that the names aren't usual games for MC and that might confuse some new players who are looking for "popular" games that you might find on other MC servers.

It would be awesome to re-add minigames such as skywars and SG, but it'd be good to try out a couple new types of minigames. There are plenty of minigame ideas created by the community in threads and such.

Mostly, I feel the decline in numbers is from the server lag and bugs ^-^ Hopefully...

Well, Avicus don't need to be Unique, McZone was the <u><b><b>best</b></b></u><b></b> and one of the most populated servers in mc why? The variety of gamemodes they had, SkyWars, SG, HG, GS, and the parkour that never came... anyway what I want to say is that Avicus don't need to be 101% Original, what keep the popularity and a great community is the <b><u>variety</u></b>!

Survival games with a twist and good maps will be sure to attract people. On any mini-game server, it continues to be one of the most popular game modes.

Avicus has too many Bugs, this is not attracting many players to the server, as they see the server as being broken, Ivy (I know that he is busy :3) should at least get some people as Devs. A person who I think who should be rightfully Dev is DCRaven. Trust me, the guy is a talented Coder, knowing a lot of Computer Languages and he is a very talented person. Ivy should have some time at least to get some decent Devs. Do a Competition in the forums about coding, where they will have to develop a plugin or something similar for the contribution for Avicus, then we choose the most talented and sophisticated Coders. Here, we shall get some Staff to interview these guys/girls and then we choose 3-5 people to be Devs. Also, we will have to remove and add some Minigames. First of all, we will have to remove all the Minigames that isn't used, such as Elimination and CTH and we replace these them with popular minigames. Elimination should be replaced with Hunger Games (Maybe Soup PvP could be included in this game to increase the range of people) and CTH with Skywars. I have also noticed in the Hub that there are two new spaces which shows that there is going to be two new minigames, it is most likely to be Survival Games which is absolutely great. &nbsp;SoupPvP and PotPvP should be introduced, it would again increase the range of people we could have in Avicus which is great. Maybe Factions could be introduced as I know that it is quite popular through Minecraft. I can write more but I do not have time, read and contribute some constructive criticism against my comments.

Hmmm.. How about implement Kitpvp? With an Avicus twist of course, maybe like special items? Such as, everyone gets full iron diamond sword and scattered across the map there are chests with diamond stuff, and golden apples and the first player to a 10 kill streak wins like 10XP( no ranks)?Alos make it so the chest are randomized so nobody can tell where they'd be. And that you get like a random effect like mining fatigue every kill so it gets really challenging.
