Could I just point out to any regular player that plays on Nebula, if someone is good at playing minecraft and the aspect of pvp is mastered; this dose not mean they are hacking. By saying in global chat that this person is hacking 1. Your breaking rules 2. If you will say I'm hacking, I will personally target you 3. You are waisting moderators time with fake reports. So if you see someone hacking ask someone experience about their opinion. <br><br>There is a numerous amount of times that I will be reported because some some kid thinks I'm hacking. <br><br>Regards to all players that get accused by kids.

Mostly because a more mature person would follow they rules and not scream out on the chat that you are hacking. If the player is hacking then go and repot him but is there a need to scream it out?

We can't really do much about it, as well as the moderators can't do much either. I'm being attacked with this every game I play and I do understand why I am, but if someone thinks I'm hacking they should just report me. It's where the issue starts, not all players have read the server rules or even visited the website, so how should they know they are not allowed to accuse anyone of hacking? Should Avicus force all players to read and accept the server rules before they are able to play? I'm not really sure it would be a good thing as well as I don't think it would stop the hack accusations either. I just ignore the accusations and I think you should as well, if someone's accusing me multiple times, that's when I report them, but when it's just a single time or twice I don't really mind as I haven't done anything wrong and specially not hacked.

There have been countless amounts of threads like this before. They serve no purpose and are only made to brag about ones PvP skills. Seeing as this is practically spam, I'm going to lock it.
