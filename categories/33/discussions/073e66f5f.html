I was playing Nexus today and people were telling me I was lagging because I couldn't see them and I kept dying. I restarted mine craft and got back in, I was still lagging so I went back into Nexus. I didn't know which map we were playing so I just ran around swinging the sword at people. My mine craft game crashed then I went back in and saw I was banned.&nbsp;<br><br>It said Kicked whilst connecting to Hub3: You have been banned<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Reason: Hacking<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Date: 22/12/14<br>I dont know if its true or not. But I don't hack but ill take it anyway. Although is there anyway I can get unbanned because its my favourite server and only.
