Okay, I'm getting tired of people complaining over and over again about Rendezvous 2, so here's what happened:<br><br><b><i>Why isn't it CTW (Capture the Wool) anymore?<br></i></b>Back in MCzone, Nebula did support what we know as CTW. However, in Avicus, CTW is no longer supported, so you won't find it anywhere in the current Avicus.<br><br><b><i>Why was it transformed to DTM (Destroy the Monument) in Avicore?<br></i></b>Rendezvous 2 was originally a CTW map, so in order to make it work, I changed it to DTM.<br>I basically removed the wool chests and added monuments in the rooms. That's it.<br><br><b><i>Why was it added back? We don't like it!<br></i></b>Well, according to me, a lot of people loved Rendezvous 2. I was pretty dissapointed to hear CTW was no longer supported so I did the following:<br>-Tried to locate ParaPenguin.<br>-Asked him for permission to edit his map (CTW -&gt; DTM).<br>-Edited the map successfully, then it was officially ready for when Avicore would be released.<br><br>However, players do not seem pleased with this.<br>I did take my time to make Rendezvous 2 come back to Avicus, because it was originally not planned to be added back in Avicore. I did it because I thought everyone would think of it as something positive, seeing an old map come back to Avicus.<br>Anyways, it's up to you:<br><b><br>Should it stay? Should it go? Want it to be modified?<br></b>Please, tell me what do you think about it.<b><br></b>

I liek it, but you can't get into your own team's monument, so if another team gets into it, you can't fight them head on,

that means you can get the gear inside your own monument rooms which defeats the purpose of getting into the &nbsp;enemy's room and if you don't like people getting in there then defend.

It seems rather broken tbh. Everything about&nbsp;it just SCREAMS CTW, yet its a DTM. I am personally not a fan of the map at all unless it is CTW.

I like the map, but the monuments, they just.....don't fit, but I'm not sure how it can be edited to still be the same map, but have a different objective....

At the very least, take away the protection in the monument rooms. They ruin the protection of monuments.&nbsp;

I love it. Take away the monument rooms, the monument area protection&nbsp;&amp; the op items in there...<br><br>or even better get CTW back &gt;:D<br><br>

You can't just take away the protection. The monuments are very close to the spawn, and it would take quite an effort to break it.<br>

Very good point, I just don't see it as a DTM map, varying from the messed up monuments to the incredibly long void gap between island, it makes the gameplay too choppy.

It's a good map. I think that you should at least remove the monument room with the restrictions of going inside it because it is now way too easy to get the objectives. Maybe make that area a bit further back or sidewards. Also, please remove the OP items inside it.&nbsp;<br><br>Please keep Rendezvous 2. However, I think that removing the protection would be the best choice. Better yet, remove the OP items inside it as well.

I like it as DTM, because It would be impossible to get in the monument and get the wool then try and bring it back to your spawn, that would be insane (not quite though).

Basically, people are able to run into the monument rooms, knowing that they will not and cannot be followed in. You are no longer required to be stealthy and actually break the monument, you are only required to enter a protected region, entering which offers a guaranteed break. Leaving the rooms but removing the code that denies entry to the other team, and removing the OP gar would make this map far more fun. As it stands now, all you have to do is get into one of the monument rooms, and you're essentially guaranteed to get into the other two.&nbsp;

The following changes have been made to&nbsp;Rendezvous 2:<br>-Removed chests containing op items in monument rooms.<br>-Removed monument room protection.<br>-Replaced bedrock under monument room with cobblestone, so tunneling is now an option.<br><br>I hope the map is now more enjoyable for all of you.<br>Thanks for sharing your opinions about this&nbsp;map :)<br>

I would like it if you could go into the monument room. If someone gets near the monument its pretty much broken.<br>

The team spawns are pretty dim and boring. Maybe some color could be added to them?

How hard would it be to add CTW back?&nbsp;<br>Like, could you do where there is like a monument or something and modify its block drop to drop a wool, and when you return to your base there is a certain place where you can only put that certain type of wool, and when you put that wool there it adds a point, but also then disables modifying that block so ppl can't repeat score, then first one to three wins?<br>There was stuff about triggers and regions in one of the posts, so i'm just guessing.

I like the map, it just doesn't have very good game-play for builders. Like, you really don't <i>need</i> to build anything besides a wall for defense. It's just so well made, you can just sprint-jump everywhere with no problems. I think in order to have more fun game-play, it should be modified by removing the tunnel in the stairs and making the steps up to the second floor one-block-wide so you can't just sprint jump everywhere without putting any work into it. Then, if you put work into it, you team can get to the center more quickly and win the game because of your building. Maybe that's just me, but for a big builder, I think this map has a lot of potential but needs to be less fully-made.

You need to get rid of the gear in there and get rid of the region protection in it.<br><br>There you go! A DTM!<br><br>Edit: It seems that you already did lol
