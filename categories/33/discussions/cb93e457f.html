Hey guys! Overnight I was thinking of avicus and new game types which could be cool. I then came across the idea "Minecraft Survival Games! AKA "The Hunger Games". We had it on McZone, it was really popular as well.. I don't know if people want it now. But it is really cool and hopefully the Avicus Staff can possibly consider it! Thanks!

They should replace Elimination with Survival Games, because Survival Games is popular and enjoyable, while even though Elimination is fun, almost no one plays it.

If we did re-add it, we'd need ideas to make it more unique. Tons of servers have survival games, it'd be nicer to do something more interesting.

Having kits "than you can upgrade ur kits with money not in-game" could be considered pay-to-win going against the newly installed EULA that we all love. That will probably not be happening.<br>I overall kinda like Survival Games though and believe it should have more thought in the staff team.
