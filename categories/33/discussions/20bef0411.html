Overhead bridging is arguably the most effective tactic available to the player in Nebula. It allows users to build above the enemy, sustaining damage only from the occasional arrow. From the bridge the player can easily jump off onto the enemy monument and win the game. However, there are many things to consider while bridging.<br><br><u>Height<br></u><br><u></u>Height must be taken into consideration while bridging if you wish to win the game. If you go to high you will not be able to come back down and you not be able to jump onto the monument. I suggest that you build 20-30 blocks high. This way you will survive a fall onto the ground and will not be noticed by the majority of the (extremely pesky) enemies. You should build up your bridge using a spiral staircase design, as opposed to a straight staircase design. The straight staircase builds towards the enemy and is more likely to be noticed. If your team has access to water(usually found near your iron source in some maps) you can build as high as you like and use the water to get back down safely. However, you will be noticed by more members of the opposite team.<br><br><u>Defences</u><br><br>Bridging, while efficient, is very dangerous for both you and your team. Scores of times I have been shot down while bridging and just as many times I have shot down other people. I suggest that you bridge with two other teammates, one to build the bridge's defences(in order to block arrows) and another to shoot at the little, annoying people scurrying down below. If you are on your own, look up every 10 seconds &nbsp;to check that no one is trying to build up to you. If they succeed, you might as well give them safe passage to your monument. Utilising towers on your side of the map is sometimes a good idea, for as each map is symmetrical, you can build to the other enemy tower and climb back down(remember to be wary of enemies trying to take over your bridge).<br><br><u>Timing<br></u><br>It is necessary to start your bridge at the correct time in order to minimise the number of enemies eager for your blood. If the map has a central island with chests, start the bridge when the other team is fighting or looking in the chests. In other maps start after the opening scramble and most people are engaged in fighting.<br><br>In conclusion, overhead bridging is a very viable alternative to open fighting and use of it greatly increases your chances of winning.

Along with this, they do not advance the bridge along with gaining height. Also, you it is easier to bridge faster via ninja staircase and no-shift bridge with a straight staircase than to make a spiral staircase. Straight staircases are easier to start and faster to build. Using any type will get you noticed, so it might be better just to not use spiral staircase.&nbsp;</span>

Kycrafft, on nebula most maps give players 4 stacks of wood and 2 stacks of other blocks, more than enough to build the staircase and the bridge. I did make a mistake is saying the spiral staircases are less like to be noticed but they are farther from the enemy and less arrows will reach you. I believe that if you have the experience you will be able to build a spiral staircase just as fast.

This is a good guide however I don't like skybridging as I feel it takes away part of the fun a spontaneity of a match but I know many disagree with me
