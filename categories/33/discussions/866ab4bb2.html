Okay, here's what I'm talking about. CTH is a great game, but nobody plays it!! D: I know so many people that love the game, and love <i>Avicus</i>, so I have no idea why people don't play it! I am close to Prestige, and so are many other players that I know. So log onto Avicus, and play CTH!!&nbsp;<br><br>:-D

The fact that there are so few people on deters other players from trying to start a game.

Get say, 4 people into a game. Then go tell people to "do /server cth(server here)!" Say that twice, then go to a different server. Once a game gets going, people will join and play.

First, we need to start getting players for more Nebula/Nexus games (Top gamemodes in our server), then we can focus on CTH <br>There has been a lack of players in the server and TS lately so I don't think we can do much, hopefully, the Winter Update will bring more people but sadly I think CTH is being removed :(

Honestly, cjrford, CTH is just never played on as much, compared to nexus and nebula. I think that it would be sad to say goodbye to CTH, but it will make our server more centered around nebula! Which is a great thing!

Poker, the video was meant to be private and my youtube video manager doesn't let me to change it to private while uploading, and after uploading.&nbsp;<br>I don't think someone except the staff and mapdevs is allowed to see it.
