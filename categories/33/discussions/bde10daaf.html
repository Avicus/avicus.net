We seriously need some kind of plugin that kills the player on Nebula when logging out. This has happened to me almost 4 times by Warbry and Jovani &lt;------(Idk his full ign) Anyways this is starting to happen to more and more people and no exp comes out of it when they log out as they are either falling out of the world, almost getting slain, etc. Anyways i already know that theres a topic about this by Fluffypoofy however i figured that enough is enough and we need to do something about this. Please take this into consideration Staff.

I saw some servers that had plugins that would say "You have combat tagged [player name]. You may not log out." Then, when you're out of PvP, it says something like "You are no longer in combat. You may now log out." When you DO log out while in combat, it will say '[player name] logged out while in combat."

But it spams the chat and looks ugly<br><br>@OP<br>What is someone was a K/D farmer (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://avicus.net/_ikillyou">like my alt</a>) And they crashed? &nbsp;That would be the most annoying thing in the universe. The best way to deal with loggers is to increase the harshness of the punishment or to ask mods to prioritise combat loggers over things like team griefers, who can be kicked once and will likely never come back.

About the spamming chat thingy it wouldn't be for players it would be for staff members and that would help a lot.

This is a better post than fluffypoofy's as this gives a suggestion.<br>And I think you can change the plugin so that It doesn't say anything in the chat, and instead of just INFORMING you that someone combat logged, it could auto tempban for 2 days maybe?

i told him to post something like this since he was having trouble with combat loggers last night he's my younger brother. anyways &nbsp;but i think auto temp ban would be fine. pfft and people who calls everyone "HACKERS" in chat i think should be temp banned for 5 mins I've been seeing that a lot and it is against the rules~ and have a little message saying "/report (a specific player) not everyone is a hacker."

Use the style of plugin HCF uses.&nbsp;<br>Use the scoreboard as a timer, so when you're damaged a 15 second timer starts under the title of "Combat Tag" and let it count down.

Or ya know, do the smart thing and make spawns 1-way and prevent spawnkilling entirely

Meh, I guess I'm the first person to here to completely go against the idea.&nbsp;<br>I really don't think combat logging is a really big deal...&nbsp;<br>Like it happens once of ever 20-30 kills for me.&nbsp;<br>-1 &nbsp;<br>I think the regular system should be kept due to some issues that NuclearDucky stated.
