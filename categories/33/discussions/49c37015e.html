If a spectator kills a player in walls they tp to a regular world. FrankenRavi killed me then I killed him by knocking him off a high place as a spectator. Then he spawned in a random world with two signs. The kill.<img src="http://i.imgur.com/wXvBOQz.png%5B/IMG%5D" alt="">The sign that was there with a lot of swearing.Remove this if you want just thought I would show it. <img src="http://i.imgur.com/YwhVs8g.png%5B/IMG%5D" alt="">The other sign. <img src="http://i.imgur.com/UNx2SZ5.png%5B/IMG%5D" alt="">

No, Ravi killed 99 and before 99 died he knocked Ravi of a high place. So after 99 died Ravi died from 99 who was a spec since he died.

I just killed someone in a walls game after I was dead (with a fire aspect sword), and he got tp to this world, and there was crafting table in it. I think that this world doesnt regenarate and a random dude put those signs there

G_Skippy wouldn't do that. It was most likely a randie that got glitched into the world :)

All you have to do is rapidly spam trap doors and you get heart as a spectater and then you die and go into a world like you showed
