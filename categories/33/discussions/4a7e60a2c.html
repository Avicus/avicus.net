I believe there was a tournament back in McZone. They hosted the matches on private vanilla servers and the moderators and tourney officials recorded the winnings accordingly. Idk though xP<br><br>But a tourney plugin would be super helpful

That isn't fully true. I was on a mczone team and we made it to the finals and had a good chance as we were close to the monument (a few players), but then there was a problem and the server crashed. We had to restart the match and we got wrecked the second game losing the match.<br><br>(However we still did great)

And if we have a Tournament we can't "stop" OCN teams from being able to join. You can't have a tariff for OCN teams
