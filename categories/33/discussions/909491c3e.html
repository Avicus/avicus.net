I save em up, and when i get to a TDM map, i cash them in for tons of arrows. Its go to be &nbsp;feeling assured that you wont run out of arrows to snipe with. (Usually TDM maps are one shot kill, and don't provide you with many arrows)

Gapples on maps with no drops or killfarms, arrows on 1 hit maps, and speed pots when I'm in a rushing mood after a long killfarm.

You know you can use /match in nebula to see how many victims you have slayed?<br><br>@op I usually don't spend my points unless I need gapples or speed pots. And spanky spade isnt as overpowered as it used to be ;(

Nothings really worth it any more. I do sometimes get into a situation where I have one heart and no golden apples, so I buy some.

Mainly Golden apples. For like 30 points, they should add enchant upgrades on your sword/bow/pickaxe/armour. You could choose the enchantment and they more points you get, the higher/stronger the enchant. Be aware that if you die, you lose it.

The nebula shop could really use some better items. I like to get the torch but it should be fire 2 and/or something you can't place.
