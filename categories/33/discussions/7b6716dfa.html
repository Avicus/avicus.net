Why was the map Luar changed? It was the last good map in my opinion. :C

What happened to it? I know things are being done with other maps too. There is a beta Frostbite and Alpha Complex team names have changed.

I saw it. In my opinion, I liked the old one better, but the new one has its unique qualities as well. For instance, the cobwebs make skybridging possible again :P

I guess we'll see how it goes, personally, I'm intrigued by the extra islands.<br>I wonder how they'll affect the gameplay as time goes on?

Seriously what I don't get is. How everyone despises and says NOOOOO when people suggest changing MCZone maps (quintus and frostbite) when they have very obvious flaws but if a map dev does it's all good.

So when we ask to change a map they "think about it". But when we like a map they screw around withy it and screw it up.&nbsp;<br>This looks cool and all but I liked the old luar....

I definitely feel like the extra islands on the new Luar make the gameplay better. In my opinion, I would always leave if I saw Luar next in the map rotation, because it was small and didn't seem to interest me. I love maps with multiple islands; more places to rush, more places to hide. +1

+1.&nbsp;<br><br>Also, I feel like this renovation of the map only makes it easier to rush and makes it look a tad more aesthetically pleasing. I prefer the old Luar.

Although Luar isn't particularly my favourite map, I don't feel this change served any purpose. As D00ZIE stated above it makes rushing easier, in my opinion it shines brightest in what makes it unique. It is not easy to rush. That feature lets the game progress and overall create momentum.

I loved the previous Luar and it was one of my favourite maps.&nbsp;But I guess&nbsp;it was small and quite close quarters for PvP. Saying that, I do like the look of the new Luar and think it will make some pwwwwitttyy sick&nbsp;PvP. Its just a bit sad to see the old one go. Maybe they could've done Luar II. But hey, every map has to go eventually, or people get bored and leave the server.

There won't be any time for PvP because the map will be over 2 minutes after it starts xd

The issue is that Luar was a killfarming map, you're basically changing it into something it's not. From kfing the rushing from what I hear. Frostbite you can still kf on, but it isn't a stalemate at mid and when one pushes the other isn't screwed. I always found Frostbite boring so I always left anyways. Luar was fun to kf.

Yeah, I really would have liked to have seen the old one stay and this one named "Luar II" would have been better.

I think it's better now but I don't &nbsp;think they needed to add gravel = Team Griefing and the excessive amount of diamonds and extra items in chests. Such as cobwebs and knock back sticks 2. Very over powered.

Honestly, the new map made it easier to rush/finish on. The old map had some really interesting aspects and mad rushing more challenging.<br><br>And besides, Luar used be like this: If you could break both monuments, then you would have no problem with any of the other maps.<br><br>Just my opinion...
