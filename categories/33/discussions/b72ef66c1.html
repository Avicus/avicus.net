So apparently the knockback is going to be fixed with the next update. Opinions?&nbsp;<br><br>Imo, it's going to seperate the good PvPers from the people who kb abuse because you can actually preform normal combos and use normal kb techniques. It forces people to learn how to PvP better and not abuse kb, use wierd kb tactics, etc.&nbsp;<br><br>It also removes those moments where you hit someone 3 times on a bridge, they stay on, but when you hit them once they barely move, w/o beaner ping ( which is when you have 80-150ms usually, which causes you to take almost no kb).&nbsp;<br><br>I will admit though...It was fun abusing the wonky kb xD

I don't think "abuse" is the right word, more like using it to their advantage,

I put abuse as in they use it too much, and since the server has broken knockback, but that word works too.

I'm ok with the people who use it to their advantage once in a while, but as you said, the general reference is to the people who always use it to their advantage.

I found it funny how if there was a knockback II item on the map, the player getting hit would basically fly across the map. Good times..
