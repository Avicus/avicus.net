Hello people of Avicus,<br><br>I am BoB_2317 as you can tell from my username. I would just like to express the frustrations I find on this server involving hackers. This is my opinion and you are all entitled to your own. Recent events on nebula have shown that the maturity of some on this server to be going down the toilet. Just because someone kills you does not make them automatically 'hackers'. To be honest, many of you can not tell the difference between someone who hacks and who does not. In that statement brings my frustration. The false accusations on this server is leading to many people being reported for hacking, so on so forth. If you do not know what your talking about, I think you should keep your opinions to yourself. Because I aim my bow and shoot at you does not make me a hacker because you think im using automatic bow. I also have a little thing called speakers on my computer and I turn them on when I play, so when i hear you tunneling and I kill you, it does not mean I x-ray. This is one of the few exemples in which, not only I, but many other very good players such as Dixie_Chick, carrie_may and many moderators and admins as well. (Not saying that I'm good but you get the point.) I have been nothing but tolerable with the majority of you but this is coming to a point were im being reported because I know how to play and dont result to hacking to be able to kill someone.<br>So if your one of these people, I advise you to grow up and stop.<br>Thank you guys for your time because you decided to read this topic. I'm sure many of you agree with my statements made above.<br>I am still a happy avicus player so don't you worry! <br>I hope to see many more of you out on the battle field and for those who I have not met yet, I'm sure your all fantastic people!<br>I hope you all have a wonderful day<br>BoB_2317

The maturity isn't going downhill. People always, and I mean ALWAYS will accuse you of hacking on any server.

I get these "hackusations," as we call it, very frequently.<br>Honestly, I just got used to it. You might get scared of being reported, but mods know what is right and wrong and they have "training," as you may call it, to decide what is punishable.<br>And once you get used to it, you'll take it as a compliment :)<br>However, if they start verbally abusing you because of it, feel free to /report them.

Nope. That was parodying the tons of people who make prestige topics. You yourself made attention regarding your ban, so if you think that's immature look in the mirror :/

I've been reported numerous times, and I have no infractions (as of yet...)<br>Mods will know what is wrong and what is right. As long as you are open to others and follow the rules, there is no chance you will get banned or kicked because of false reports.

I am aware of this and have become very tolerable. I just wanted to inform those people who make 'hackusations' aware of how immature it is.

Here's what you should do: if someone calls you a hacker because you killed them, here are some replies:<br>- "&lt;3"<br>- "thanks!"<br>- "./report [your username] hacks"<br><br>Always works :P

Bro, if someone says YOU hack then take it as a compliment. If someone says someone hacks, it's really nothing to be annoyed about.
