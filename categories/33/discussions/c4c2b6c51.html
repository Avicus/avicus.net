Congratulations. Keep in mind, however, that in most scrims neither team has its full roster, which can throw tourney games either way. Maybe more in your favor, maybe more in ours.

I really think that no one is the Best, I think that everyone has a chance of winning, because it is mainly teamwork, some of it is PvP, I admit but then most of it is Teamwork. Get this idea of being the "Best" out of your mind because that is not what makes us, it is friendship and teamwork that defines us! Alright, do you get the idea! I understand that many people will flame and rage at this comment but I don't care. I am saying what is logic!

But you were not in the team at the time of the scrim. So you would only be able to go on opinions that are most likely biast. Because i know if my team were smashed in a scrim (like against your current team) i would try and twist the story a bit.

I scrimmed against you guys multiple times while in Immunity, we wrecked you, Immunity are a very honest team and none of them would ever twist the truth, especially Robo and Hak, they are great guys.

.... No you haven't because we have only scrimmed immunity once and we won with 2 wools to zero in 15 mins. I wasn't questioning Robo and Hak's honesty i know first hand that they are great guys however as i said before everyone bends the truth a little not discluding me.

I scrimmed against you guys multiple times while in Immunity, we wrecked you, Immunity are a very honest team and none of them would ever twist the truth, especially Robo and Hak, they are great guys. It's completely pointless to actually lie to people over a scrim, they mean next to nothing.<br><br><br>EDIT: I don't know about avicadian heroes though, they barely ever scrimmed and their pure PvP skill is something you don't just&nbsp;beat 'hands down'

All Avacadian has is sword pvp skill for the most part. They try to sword rush you all the time and have no concept of tactics (I'm talking about RFV tactics, which is understandable that they might have a lack of tactics for it. But just all in all, they have no idea how to frontline properly)

I really think that no one is the Best, I think that everyone has a chance of winning, because it is mainly teamwork, some of it is PvP, I admit but then most of it is Teamwork. Get this idea of being the "Best" out of your mind because that is not what makes us, it is friendship and teamwork that defines us! Alright, do you get the idea! I understand that many people will flame and rage at this comment but I don't care. I am saying what is logic!

I agree with your post but mainly this thread is for the people who are either cockey of their team for winning a few scrims againts big teams. Or people who care too much about people not thinking their team is the best. Flame at me, I am just stating what I am seeing. I put down a team I thought had some skill and left. But everyone is flaming when it is simple just to say a team you respect and leave.

Someone rename this thread "Insult avicadian heroes work as a team". I mean come on. Most of the people posting on this topic are OCN regulars who have had a lot of experience with tournaments. Most of us avicus players haven't played in many tournament's if any. Cut Avicadian Heroes etc some slack please.
