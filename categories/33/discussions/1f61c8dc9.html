so after some dank pvp in the avicus league, I thought it would be good to share how we manage to win, this are my tricks<br><br><b>1- fun</b><br>joking or telling jokes before the match is always crucial, if you don't get fun and you are serious you won't be confident of yourself or of your team, so joking will always make you be relax<br><br><b>2- surprise factor</b><br>don't practicing isn't bad at all, it's fun to see and be like "WOAH, we're playing this!" I like susprises so I love to have the maps we play as a surprise instead of checking them all the time, also making strats 5 minutes before is really cool because you need to think on the right strats in 5 minutes instead of in 7 days<br><br><b>3- barely getting people</b><br>it's good to not be 8 players, with 6 you are fine because you can belive that you can beat people with being less than them!, it makes you be more confident!<br><br><b>4- getting people 10 minutes before</b><br>people need to sleep so don't force your teammates to join TS3 3 hours before, with having them to join 10 minutes before it will be okay because they have rest enough so they can do good pvp<br><br><b>5- make ur teammates laught at you, if they don't they aren't your friends</b><br>I love to laught at my teammates and at myself, it's fun so this is like the first point but idk just to mention it, laught with your friends!<br><br><b>6- don't be serious<br></b>being serious is okay sometimes, but not being serious is cool! try it, I do it and i love not being serious when I am able, also it makes you feel more free and be able to be more creative, don't be like President Business!<br><b><br>I hope this help you guys!<br><br><br></b>

All these tricks work badly for me lol. I find being ready and serious helps me, but a little sense of humor helps.

Who gave you strat sheet ;-;, you missed a few though<br><br>1. Play loud ear rape music whenever someone is running at the monument, away from the monument, to skybrige, to defend or to make armor, this ensures that your entire team knows whats happening<br><br>2. Yell at your teammates to hold them accountable for them screwing up<br><br>3. No defense.
