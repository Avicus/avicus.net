This kit is OP. I was fighting this guy and I got like 5 hits on him (Sharpness I Diamond sword against iron armor enchanted) he starts running and soon enough he goes into water, turns around, fights me and I die. I'm sure he was at like 3 hearts or very low and I would of killed him but instead he regenerated a bunch (I don't know how much it regenerates) and killed me. It's really bugging me as it is unfair.

Also another time was when I was beating this guy with full diamond, guess what he does? He has a water bucket and just tips in on himself and it's just stupid.

Honestly, I would just block off the water/pick it up. If he is in a pool of water, place lava on the block above one of the water sources towards the middle and turn it to stone.&nbsp;

But you can be creative to make sure the Poseidon is not in the water.&nbsp;

No he runs into the open and puts water on himself and he just swims on the water source block.

You can, but it's not making poseidon less OP, and by the time you are trying to doing this it will inflict you damage, and you wont be able to inflict it any damage at all (unless you can 1 hit kill it). What im saying is that it needs a really big nerfing because it is far more strengh then any other kit and avilable at level 15

It should be a different potion effect, strength? He can move fast and it should work like the regen where it gets applies for 4 seconds intill he gets out of the water.

Poseidon is op, it is the new barbarian, but really... Every time you have a lot of kits like we do, one is always going to be better, that's just the thing that you have to get over, but I see Poseidon is not nearly as op as barbarian, because barbarian can not be taken off by another player, and you can kill a person thats in water, but you have to hit him repeadly. I kinda like this kit like it is because you can stop it... And I had the best fight ever Poseidon vs poseidon

The powerfulness of this kit ruins the game.&nbsp; While the person is in water you can't kill them.&nbsp; Bang on them with a diamond sword while they have no armor - won't hurt them (if they are kit poseidon).<br><br>Suggestions:<br>(1) make it so that Poseidon gives you strength (instead of regeneration) while in water; or<br>(2) make it so that Poseidon just lets you breath underwater<br><br>If you make it so it gives you strength (but not Super-Regeneration), you can still damage them and kill them.&nbsp; Kind of like a poor man's Kit Barbarian.<br>

Other Suggestions:<br>(1) make their&nbsp;regeneration&nbsp;process slower (if possible)<br>(2) give them protection effect instead of&nbsp;regeneration<br><br>

I agree with No. 1 of the other suggestions. I thought that Poseidon would have been like regen 1 or something, so that you can easily get into water, and gain 2 hearts or so.
