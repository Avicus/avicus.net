<span><span><span><u></u>Hi everyone, Vo here! Today I am giving you guys a guide on defending. I am some experience with defending and decided to make a guide to help those less-experienced defenders out.<br><span>1. <b><u>Covering the Monument</u></b></span><br><span>Most inexperienced defenders cover the monument up. This is <b>NOT</b> a good idea. This allows for enemy players to sneak in, and cover themselves up. Since you had the monument covered up, you can't tell if there is a enemy in there or not. Leave the monument open and away from where anyone could reach it and not be seen.</span><br><span>2. <b><u>Defensive Strategies</u></b></span><br><span><u></u>Here is some strategies that I use when defending. When the monument is on a floating island (like most maps) in the middle of a circle, like this:</span></span><a href="http://imgur.com/X0sYSLM" rel="nofollow">http://imgur.com/X0sYSLM</a></span>I just get rid of the building, and dig a pit to bedrock. Now once you are at bedrock, the next best thing to do is to lay down some pressure plates on the bedrock. This is a great defense because it prevents water drops (most of the time) and makes the enemy unable to pillar up to the monument.For CTW's when there is a lane, not just a little island, the best thing to do is this: <span><span><a href="http://imgur.com/4BISXfZ" rel="nofollow">http://imgur.com/4BISXfZ</a><br></span><br>This prevents water drops, and breaking through the crafting tables makes you get pushed back by the water.<br></span></span><br><span>3.<b><u> Teamwork</u></b><u></u></span><br>The key to any great defense is teamwork. With 2 people working on a defense, you complete the defense twice as fast, and the defense will probably be better. The "buddy" system in defending is also great because it allows one person to actually "defend" and fight off enemies, while the other continues working on the defense. <br><span>4. <u><b>The Dreaded Skybridge</b></u></span><span><u><b></b></u><b></b></span>Every defender's worst nightmare is the skybridge. Here's some ways to take care of that problem. <br>You must have pressure plates (or slabs, plates are better)! Most skybridgers like to jump down and water drop. Having pressure plates prevents this. <br>Taking out skybridges: <span>Now, this only goes for TNT maps, but someone on your team can set up a arc cannon to take out that skybridge. Otherwise, a person or people on your team can build a tower or staircase to the skybridge and attempt to take it over. <b>NEVER</b> bridge to meet the front of the skybridge, you'll easily get shot off. Try bridging to the middle of the skybridge, so when you pop up, they'll be on the edge and you can easily knock them off.</span><br>That's all for now, with 1.8 coming this will be updated. Thanks for reading :)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><u><br></u></b></span>

Thank you, I hope new players read this. It's <i><u><b>EXTREMELY </b></u></i>frustrating when your team members cover the monument, then you fix it up, come back 5 min later, and its all covered again.

This defense is weak when it comes to skybridge attacks...and people can knock you off.

I don't really agree with 1. You can cover the monument with glass but its only useless the opposition is skybridiging.

I just realized that on TNT maps with dispensers, you can AC-130 the defense. RIP all the time and effort

Ok. I'll help with this.<br><br>#3- Teamwork, to me, is what makes mining Monuments easier. Just Bait one of the out, kill them, and kill the other ugh after you regen. If it's a team just separate them and you can kill them easier(Mining a monument when 2-4 guys trying to find me(Note I placed all those blocks :p) Skip to 5:05)<br>(Video of baiting:&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=f7bf_N_fH64">https://youtube.com/watch?v=f7bf_N_fH64</a>)<br>#4- Do not stack up at all costs even if it's right next to your spawn. It will give them a path down
