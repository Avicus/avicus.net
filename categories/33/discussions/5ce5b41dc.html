I don't know if this has already been discussed on the forums, as I wouldn't know because there is no search bar, but I am going to make a topic about it regardless. Usually, my technique on the walls is to rush the middle and take all the chests, but sometimes I prefer to make a skybase and snipe people from above. In the old walls, they had a set height limit and you could build and expand your skybase constantly even after the walls drop. In the new walls, however, all of this has changed. There is now no sky limit, but after the walls drop you can only build your skybase up not out. If you try to expand it says you can't because "you're not allowed to build in the abyss." This new rule has taken away a key aspect of the walls. I don't know if you took it out purposefully or if it was an accident, but either way I suggest you fix it because it will make for a better experience when playing the walls.

You mean you can't build from one quadrant to another?<br>

No, you can't build out at all.

You can never build in the void. Otherwise, you can build wherever you want.

I'm kind of confused... Do you mean that you can't build to the left or ight or anything once you go to a certain height?

It won't allow you to expand your skybase horizontally. It also won't allow you to bridge after the walls drop. I'll video it today so what I'm saying will be more clear.
