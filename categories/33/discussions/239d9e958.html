I have now very often heard the complain, that the kit Pyro in nexus is way to OP.<br><br>Also I have now often been insulted as a noob or coward or other, just because I use it. But if it is OP, why is it still in the choice? And why should I be a noob and bad PvPer just because I use it? Could the staff somehow clear it, because it is really annoying? Or change it, so that it isn't so good? Also, many are bothered by the fact, that it is only for donators. <br><br>I would like to see these things changed if possible, seeing as they ruin the game fun.<br><br>Greetings Forscher

My opinion: The kit is a way too op to be in lvl 24. Change this to lvl 36 and leather armour, then everyone would be happy.

Oh, gosh, block-hitting to go along with that would not be a good combination xD&nbsp;<br>Maybe make it so the fire aspect weapon wouldn't do very much damage and the weapon used for killing would be a golden sword..<br>Kinda like a Flaming Torch in Nebula, except it does a decent amount of damage :3

I don't have a problem with Pyro, though I do see why some people dislike it. What I WOULD like, though, is to have an accessible pool of water near every team's spawn so I don't have to suffer fire damage after I get killed by a Pyro.<br><br>Honestly I think leather armor is nerfing it a bit too much, but that's just my personal preference.

Well it does that plus fire damage, that slows you if you don't have a key set to sprint, and it blinds you, and you're so hard to kill with chain that it isn't even funny. And the fire ends up doing more damage than a diamond sword I believe in the end. So yea, it's kinda completely broken.

I have to disagree with some of your points.<br><br>Yes, fire damage can be annoying, but most of the time you'll have a golden apple to mitigate that damage. I don't think it would end up doing more than a diamond sword in Nexus anyhow, mainly because of how fast-paced the game can be - you will most likely die to another player/the Pyro before fire damage has a major effect on you. In regards to being "blinded," most people use texture packs that feature low fire, so for most it's not a big deal anyways.<br><br>The fire breaking your sprint and the buffed armor is what makes Pyro deadly, though with a matter of skill and practice I think it's perfectly fine. Pyro can be dangerous, yes, but in the long run I do not think it is broken at all.

Trust me, I see people who couldn't even touch me if we had the same kit, kill me with half heath. It literally has ridiculous amounts of damage and tankiness. It's the most broken kit in Nexus.&nbsp;<br><br>Some argue Freezer is more OP. Tbh, no. It freezes you for 3 secs, in that time they have to walk over and kill you. I find a lot of the time I end up getting un-froze with half/quarter/third health and proceed to kill them. Freezer is OP but at least I can see and it does less damage and offers less defence.

I use a low fire texture pack, but what about the players who aren't as serious about PvP? It's kinda a bother to install and find a low fire texture pack just so you don't get rekt by Pyro...and a lot of times I find myself out of golden apples anyways. The same could be said about using Snake over Warrior. Why use the poison damage when you could have upfront damage? Because it's the same in the end and it gives added benefits to it as well (poison damage interrupting sprint). Pyro offers the best defence you can get with very high offensive levels which allow you to dive into the enemy team and kill 1+ people before getting killed.&nbsp;<br><br>I have the skill to beat most players on Avicus to be blunt, you know this. Yet it's still difficult because that fire ends up doing so much, just as Snake would. You can eat an apple, but in the middle of a fight you can't exactly do this. You require the same+ amount of apples anyways.

It's basically the Heavy class but with the fire aspect. If it changed places with heavy in terms of the levels then it would make sense as it would then become one of the last classes to unlock.

Look, here are the reasons of its OPness<br><br>1. It's got better armor than normal (it's literally heavy but at level 24 and fire aspect!)<br>2. Did I mention it's level 24? That's not very hard to reach, especially with an xp multiplier and outclasses all kits near it<br>3. The fire. Yeah high fire can be annoying but it has bigger problems. You can't run away because you are on fire, the fire breaks your sprint and messes up your combos which can cause you to get rekt, and it will do extra damage both during the fight and after death, taking down your health and leaving you vulnerable to other players even if you get the kill. <br><br>I would rather fight a barbarian than a pyro.

I agree that pyro is a bit op, but i'd still fight a pyro rather than a barbarian.<br>I mean, i get a 4 hit combo on a barbarian, they hit crit me twice, i lose 9 hearts and well after that it's just who gets the last hit.

What sucks Is that it makes the only combo I can use on Avicus harder to use then normal because of the constantly breaking sprint, (I have two, Hybrid blockhit 8-block and the Zigzag combo I made up) which is my Zigzag combo.

It is too stronk. Pls nerf the armour the axe isn't too bad I guess. BUT please fix the f**king fire glitch for the love of god<br><br>P.S: I don't think anything will happen. Let me ask you a question. How many good ideas have been in the forums?A lot. How many have even been implemented/fixed? Pretty much none.

It's not OP people just think it's OP because that's their first thought when they see fire. It's really not that incredible. One thing you could do though is just give it to non-donors as well. Then it's not pay2win which nobody likes

I'd rather have it removed tbh. But this is a great idea. It feels too pay-to-win.

I'd be ok with the kit if the damage from the axe wasn't so high. The fire does all the damage in the end. It ticks rapidly over a relatively long period of time doing half a heart each time. The fire damage ends up doing as much damage as the Axe itself and maybe more.
