Hey Everyone,<br><br>I was on Nebula the other day with one of my friends, and we decided to make a bridge out to the side and hit the other team from there.<br>But, we randomly saw the border of another map quite far out from our bridge.<br>We didn't get a proper chance to explore it, but it had lava and water flowing down the sides, and was very tall.<br>I was just on another game using the same tactic, and I saw the same thing.<br>Is that just the outermost border of the map, or is it actually the beginning of another map?<br>Do all the maps sit next to each other on one massive world?<br>Any help would be appreciated&nbsp; :)<br>Thanks

Ohhh I think you mean like the normal world? with caves and such.<br>Yea that's a glitch. If you try to create a void world on a server with a plugin, the plugin only makes a big void hole in an normal world.<br>Just a advice, don't bridge to the lava and so on, you could be punished for abusing glitches.<br>It's also already reported at github. And I think it will be fixed in the next update!

it was most likely the actual minecraft world. if you go out far enough on some maps, you hit an actual minecraft generated world, but you're not supposed to go there

Most maps have this but don't abuse this it's the borders and all maps are on different worlds !

That's technically abusing glitches, so don't build out to those structures/chunks if you see them. If you do, you will be punished.
