Alright, it seems like there is a lot of rant about how the "Spanky spade" is too expensive. Personally, I love how it's 30 points to buy one, instead of 7 quick kills.&nbsp;<br>My points on why I agree with the change:<br><br><span>◇ It completely ruined the gameplay. One person could&nbsp;annihilate&nbsp;the the opposing team! It now makes the match even...<br></span><span><span>◇ Everyone seemed to be too <b><i>reliant</i></b> on it too.<br></span><span>◇ It now encourages other items to be used.<br><br>Now it's your turn;<br>Discuss why you agree or disagree with this change.<br><br><i>Reminder: Keep things mature, and please refrain from starting a flame war!</i><br><br><br></span></span>

I'm fine with the price, it's not too hard to get yet not too easy.<br>Reason: 1 kill = 1 point<br>Break a monument (If I'm correct) 3-5 points.

I think it should be 15. 15 kills is not an easy/quick feat, or breaking a monument and getting 5 kills, breaking 2 monuments, blah blah blah. 15 sounds pretty reasonable to me.

In my opinion it was a terrible change. I only bought eggs and the spanky spade because it was worth it but since eggs were removed and the spanky spade was nerfed and made very expensive &nbsp;I hardly use the shop any more.

I reckon 15 kills is fair. Not everyone can get 30 kills in a game because some aren't very good at PVP. It is effectively limiting it to the good people which therefore means it makes the good people even more OP and gives the ones that aren't so good no chance at all. Just my opinion

I think its too expensive (in level needed), it clearly says you need 30 points (witch I can get easily) but you need to also be level 30, if anything I would change that lower or take it off completely the level required, only thing I can't get witch is useful

Make it 15 points and kb 2<br><br>Honestly, it's OP and UP at the same time. Now before you go hitting players with it, know it's wood sword damage. If you are on a non-void map or a map with walls or barriers so you can't get knocked out of the world, you don't do a whole lot of damage. But it's still very useful. If you see a player who has better armor than you, whip out your spade. If it is a void map, they will see it and consider you now a dangerous player to approach. Also, you can use it to push players back, allowing you to clear out the are I from of you spawn. And yeah, you can hit full diamond guys off the edge. HOWEVER, the spanky spade is best used in conjunction with armor, since your hits will do less. And it's important you keep it hidden sometimes because when I see a guy with a spade I immediately shoot as many arrows as I can at him.<br><br>&nbsp; So is it OP? In the right hands, hell yeah

One person on a open map like halcyon could wreck havoc.&nbsp;<br>Inmediately can get rid of every diamond armor player on the other team. Really op<br>maybe lower it's cost to 25.&nbsp;<br>On other maps like volcano or teres, a ss is only good for keeping diamonds at bay.

In my opinion, 30 points is okay. 15 points is easy, because that's just a ternio match if it's 5 points per monument. And even if it's 3 points per monument, it's just a quintus match. 30 points would make it so that you either have to stay on the same server for a while, or you have to be really good at pvp or killfarm

Honestly, spanky spades didn't seem to work with me for some<br>reason, I hit a player several times and get killed in attempt to knock it off, if I'm going to<br>knock someone out of the map I'll snipe them or spam them with my regular sword, much more effective (in my case) now that they've nerfed it so much and made it so expensive I doubt I'll ever use it again, I don't like how your hunger bar goes down so fast now either, the only thing I use the nebula shop for now is buying food or apples, such a shame, it has become too overpriced as well, imo, I don't completely &nbsp; agree with the new prices or nerfed items

@JKawesome<br>tho, most people don't stay on a server long, usually I just pop in, and pop out once the match ends, unless there's a good map upcoming in the rot...<br>Shop items should be designed for one match only.

Well, I personally think they're really under-powered right now and pretty much useless. Like, it's gotten 8.56 times worse when Avicore came out (4.28 times more expensive*2 times less effective). I can never even get 30 points and if I ever did, I wouldn't want to spend it on a knockback I diamond shovel :P<br>Why not change it 21 points-- I feel like that's a good price :3

Back in the olden days when golden apples&nbsp;<u><i><b>ACTUALLY</b></i></u><i><b></b><b></b></i><b></b> dropped it was pretty easy to get 7 points pretty fast. Nowadays even when you save up 30 points to buy the damn thing you barley get to use it due to the fact that golden apples don't drop so you can't get health back as quick. <br><br>I would be fine with it being 20-30 points IF golden apples dropped.<br>But as of now without golden apple drops, 10-20 points would be more suitable.<br><br>EDIT: I have not been on in a little bit so they may have fixed that glitch :P

Woahhh. Ok, lots of new info streaming into my mind right now.&nbsp;<br>Based upon the info from this post, I do also agree that the Spanky Spade seriously needs to be nerfed.&nbsp;<br><br>Knockback I, 30 points and level 30???&nbsp;<br><br>I'm pretty sure the points do reset... so getting a 30 kill streak is pretty dang hard. And then the monument grabbing isn't important because you usually die after getting a couple/few monuments or the game is over and then the points transfer...&nbsp;<br>But back to the point, a 30 kill streak is pretty dang hard, unless you're in Zalidor or Quintus crushing the foes, which you don't really need a spanky spade for.&nbsp;<br>Seriously, I think the points should be lowered to 21 to keep the "Multiple of 7" thing going, make it knockback II and just get rid of the level requirement. I seriously do believe that the level requirement should be rid of because we want new players to experience a cool trademark of Nebula, the spanky spade.

i hate the spanky spade.... i really do... i dont even think it should be allowed, personally whenever i am killed by a person using a spanky spade i get extremely angry because using it takes absolutely no skill at all and just launches you off a cliff/bridge/tower/ect..... if it were my choice i would make the cost higher, like 50 (i know that sounds ridiculous but i hate it just that much).

Yeah i agree with D00ZiE, unless golden apples start dropping again the spade needs to be cheaper and have kb II on it. KB I is kind of useless and getting a 30 kill streak is now harder than ever because golden apples don't drop so you have to buy them as you are fighting. I also agree that the requirement level should be kept because it is a little change and it means that people with a higher level do get rewards on nebula which is something everyone complained about on old Avicus; however now it's here then people start moaning about it

imo I think the Spanky Spade is expensive. Yes, the knockback is ridiculously powerful (especially for low ping players like me) but honestly the price is so high that it's practically non-existent in play now. 7 points was a bit too easy to get, but 30 is just extremely high (especially when the price for gapples/other items have increased as well.) As many people suggested a price of 15 points would be more reasonable; a happy medium between 7 and 30.<br><br>Also, did you guys nerf the Spanky Spade as well?
