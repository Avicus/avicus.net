Don't make so many threads like this. Some things I'd like to point out for you:<br><br><b>KitPvP</b><br>This was originally planned to undergo testing by me (with a map and all, plus the YAML features) but after asking the community a couple times whether it be in-game and the forum, it got negative feedback and shot down pretty quickly. Not only this, but it'd take a lot of time to maintain it and is yet another unoriginal gamemode that wouldn't heavily attract due to the nature of the server. It doesn't really fit and even if we did, there's still lots of kinks to work out when doing this kind of thing.<br><br><b>Roleplay</b><br>I'm not sure what you mean like this, just an RPG server? Because if we were, it would take a long time to not just build, shape, and edit up the maps, it'd be more stress on both mapdevs and staff due to the hardness of maintaining it. Wouldn't be automatic like other servers and moderation, especially for this would be next to impossible if we were going to have it fair and like the usual roleplay. The coding would be tedious and some RP servers have taken over a year to code, so this is not a priority of ours. One last thing... balancing. Going to be too difficult and anything else in mind regarding this, just elaborate.&nbsp;<br><br>These ideas from what I understand are both denied..

You still need to elaborate. Besides, making roleplay like that with tons of roles would be next to impossible to code.
