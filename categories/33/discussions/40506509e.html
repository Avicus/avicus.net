Hey guys, so after a weeks delay im finally able to show my&nbsp;<b>Rigor Mortis Monument Defense Setup</b>&nbsp;I've Created!<br><br>So 1st off the main idea of the defense is to create a staircase which leads upto our monument defense and at the same<br>time continue up into the sky into a skybridge.<br><br>So ive managed to make it so its possible and efficient for both offense and defense.<br>This entire defense takes around more or less 10-20 mins to complete&nbsp;<i>SOLO or WITH TEAMMATE(S)</i><br><br>*This can started in multiple ways but the one thing that makes all the difference between getting defense/offense up their is<br>the staircase going up from the spawn point into the 2nd floor and into the monument defense. Which is why i recommend<br>by starting the staircase as soon as possible/at the start of the game, 1 or 2 players can do the staircase while 2-3 others beign the monument defense itself at the monument.<br><br>1st Picture Shows the standard scrim staircase layout with the trapdoors on the railings to prevent the staircase being<br>blocked off by attacking enemies (but keep in mind thats it going to be a 3-wide staircase just to compensate for the symmetricy from the spawn point to the monument platform so it can still get blocked by enemy attackers/rushers so becareful and make sure to have axes ready.<br><img class="image" src="https://i.gyazo.com/bb2aeeaed19070d4fdcf96968429b1ae.png" style="width:auto;height:auto;max-width:100%;max-height:100%;" title="Image: https://i.gyazo.com/bb2aeeaed19070d4fdcf96968429b1ae.png"><br><br>2nd to 4th Picture shows the main monument defense itself, from the monument centerpiece being covered by trapdoors and slabs with fences on the slabs, then fence posts with signs and pressure plates ontop, then within the depth of the setup are fence gates placed facing opposite of each other or making like a cycle sort of pattern (it can be left closed or open) and under neath can be placed is a crafting table with a torch which acts as a contemporary alarm system during the primary completion of the monument defense,&nbsp;<i>'contemporary' because the defenders have the option of making a room underneath or players can remove the front of the church underneath and the monument defenders can just leave the torch as lighting. </i>(using gyazo links cuz forums for some reason not allowing me to drag more than 1 picture onto the post)<i><br><a href="https://gyazo.com/65cc5b1cddf91f1f13409983dba6e7f3" title="Link: https://gyazo.com/65cc5b1cddf91f1f13409983dba6e7f3">https://gyazo.com/65cc5b1cddf91f1f13409983dba6e7f3</a><br><a href="https://gyazo.com/c4faf391ac7f836ce4cf458a93048736" title="Link: https://gyazo.com/c4faf391ac7f836ce4cf458a93048736">https://gyazo.com/c4faf391ac7f836ce4cf458a93048736</a><br><a href="https://gyazo.com/88093cff0a9bd73629d53ecc84c21726" title="Link: https://gyazo.com/88093cff0a9bd73629d53ecc84c21726">https://gyazo.com/88093cff0a9bd73629d53ecc84c21726</a><br><br></i>Now the main monument defense setup can be modified into your own style/liking/purpose, for any suggestions/comments pls tell me down below.<i><br><br><br><br><br></i>

Pretty much this is how the main monument defense looked like on its 1st Creation<br><img class="image" src="https://i.gyazo.com/88093cff0a9bd73629d53ecc84c21726.png" style="width:auto;height:auto;max-width:100%;max-height:100%;" title="Image: https://i.gyazo.com/88093cff0a9bd73629d53ecc84c21726.png">

I also use this defense on Rend 3.5 and this is pretty useful. The only disadvantage is it's easy to connect skybridge with the defense. So this thing requires good bow users tho.
