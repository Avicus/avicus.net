I wanted to share an observation: bridges, high quality bridges, are important. The best example i can come up with is a recent mach on Proelium. When i joined the game, my team was failing. We where being assailed from the left, right and from the top. The game was seemingly lost. However, with some luck, and some diamonds, we where able to drive off the enemy. Yet we where not able to &nbsp;*rush* the middle, and the situation still looked desperate. However when we (mostly I) started building bridges, the situation quickly changed. With good brides on the left of the map, we where able to capture the middle of the map, as many where rushing and nobody was being shot off (because of railings on the bridges). After we captured mid, we surrounded the opposite team and where able to destroy 2 monuments. Unfortunately we ended up losing (there defense was EXTREMELY good), but i relised the importance of bridges. So here is my point: when building a bridge from one island to another, don't just make it 1 block wide, but give it railings and make it at least 2 blocks wide. Spend some time and don't rush. There are few maps where the first attack can destroy all the monuments,

You're supposed to rush. The bridges should be built fast and aren't meant to be aesthetically pleasing.

No, just take some sand and place it above the void. There's an aesthetically good bridge.

Rushing may be all good, but what happens when all the people in the initial attack die? What if they get a strategic point and just <b>keep sniping us of our 1 block wide bridges?&nbsp;</b>That's my point, the bridges have to be "reusable".

Im not saying they should be built 1 block wide. I just said they should be done as quickly as possible.

Well, there's multiple tactics that, most of the time, will prevent you from getting shot off. It just takes practice and timing. For example, stopping randomly on the bridge is a simple tactic that works. If you've seen me do it, you would know how useful and efficient it is for dodging arrows. Another tactic is to jitter your right click, and place a block when you get shot off. This takes a lot of practice though.

Cmon guys, you should know how damaging bridges are to a team when they're thin. They're very vulnerable to blockspam and everything, especially when you're team is half rushers blockspaming and team griefing.

You need to make your bridges with fences! Fences are the best way!
