A lot of people used to play it... I remember people would always block the button that would allow you to enter. I guess its popularity just fell, even though it was such a great game... ;_;

Yeah, skywars has been removed. I really don't know why it was removed, it was a very popular game mode, which many people liked playing. R.I.P skywars (You will always have a place in my heart) &lt;3
