</h1>
This is just one of those random topics:<br>I was wondering, how much time people usually spend on Forums, MC, Avicus etc.<br><br>In my case i spend: 1-3 hours on Avicus/Forums, 2-5 hours on regular MC, and then some of the time i spend, going to the mall and such :P. So i would think it would be interesting to find out how much you guys play! :D<br><br><b>FOR MODERATORS:<br></b><i>A bonus question for staff members!</i>:<br>How many players do you get banned/Kicked/warned etc. During a 24 hours period?..<br><br>So again a random topic, and go!!!&nbsp;<i>If you can make it detailed :D</i>

Forums: 2-3 hours<br>Avicus: 5-6 hours xD<br>MC: 0.000000000000000001<br><br>For the bonus question, it varies a lot. It depends on how much time I spent on the server that day, how many reports I took that day, etc.<br><br>To average it out though, I'd say between 30 and 50.
