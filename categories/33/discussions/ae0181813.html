In the walls map the village a few minutes ago I was team killed by a nub. I just wanted to ask if there is anyway to make it so you can't place buckets of lava on you're teammates?&nbsp; <br>I don't know if this would have been enough evidence to report:<img src="http://i.imgur.com/hpkFgH6.png%5B/IMG%5D" alt="">

They should make it the same format so that you can't place lava on teammates like you can't spleef teammates in nebula

99250 is right I did team kill him. I only did this because he was slpeefing me and trying to spleef me in lava when trying to get a diamond. he is lucky I don't know how to record or he would have gotten banned as well.

I do not try to team kill my teammates because I know it is against the rules I would ask that you would stop telling lies. And while you're at it please read the server rules avicus.net/rules

Just don't do it again. Tou will most likely just get warned, kicked, and maybe banned. I honestly don't know how moderators roll. But they are all cool so maybe they will let it slide. #sexymods
