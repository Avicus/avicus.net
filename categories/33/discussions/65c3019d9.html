Clay wars is bad. I made a list of reasons why:<br><ol><li>The void between the to teams is to big. This makes the game play to slow,and because no one can built good bridges, there being sniped into the void. The game play always goes like this: a group of defenders wait until the other team rushes. then they start sniping. If the void could be narrowed, that would be a big step in solving the problem.</li></ol><ol><li>No iron/ "upgrades". This leads to pretty boring pvp with no one trying to rush. Pretty much the only way to get behind enemy lines is to Tunnel.</li></ol><ol><li>Similar consent to "Justice 2". The two Us connected with a U is exactly the same consent as Justice 2.</li><li>So yea if i find more reasons i will post them</li><li><br></li><li>PS this forum need an option to edit in mark-up. this would prevent such bad formatting as this.</li></ol>

I disagree.<br><br>The void doesn't slow gameplay, rather it forces teams to fight each other on a set path, which encourages good PVP.<br><br>The no iron is a nice addition IMO. Too many maps have iron and diamond. A map with just spawn armour puts everyone on the same playing field.<br><br>You say that the lack of iron armour makes it hard to rush but it also makes it very hard to spawn kill. <br><br>If Clay Wars had iron, spawn killing would be very easy considering where the monuments are and where the spawn is.<br><br>I think it's fine how it is.

Like Snow, I disagree. Clay Wars is one of my favourite matches and I find the small differences unique from other maps.&nbsp;<br><br>The lack of iron creates equal gameplay and prevents the spawnkilling issue that was mentioned above by Snow.

I agree, the void is very annoying for people who just want the game to actually start, and every time I try to bridge, there's always some guy trying to shoot me off. Just like the OP said, shorten the void gap between the two teams. <br><br>The monument placement is also a bit weird, and makes the monuments really hard to bridge to, leading to hour long games. Maybe move it behind the spawns or closer to the main island or something. Overall the shape of the map just doesn't lead to good gameplay.<br><br>Another thing is the blockspam on here. This map usually gets spammed by people who feel the need to place blocks under them while running out of spawn. Maybe limit the amount of blocks?<br><br>I disagree with the iron though; twenty people defending a monument is already annoying, we don't need twenty iron guys defending one monument, and another crowd of iron guys tanking through the enemy's base, and getting the monument that way. Imo iron would just ruin the gameplay, if it can still be ruined.

the void gap is fine, it really isn't too different to other maps.<br>A map doesn't need to have iron upgrades to be good, or no t boring.<br>I believe the fact that there is no Armour presents a sense of difficulty, which is exactly what Nebula maps should use.<br>It's shape may resemble Justice 2's, but at the end of the day, the gameplay is far different.

I agree with the blockspam; it often looks like someone threw up glass and clay blocks all over the match whenever I join...<br><br>The void separation isn't very annoying. I find that within 5 minutes, people easily make bridges over there.&nbsp;<br><br>The monument placement gives a challenge to rushers; which is what I love about the map. It also gives you a lot of time to kill farm ;)

PLEASE add a water source and wood! I know there's ice but its kinda annoying. I always leave because the gap is too big and with the given materials I can't build a big/good bridge, or craft ladders for a sky bridge... I would love for this map to be kept it just needs improvements. Doesn't need iron imo.

Another suggestion is to maybe add a chest with limited wood, so you could rush more efficiently with it, for example, surrounding yourself at the monument while breaking it, or landing a fall from a skybridge with a ladder.

Woah, you got Map Dev! Nice job! :D<br>Anyways, back to the topic. I agree with OP's opinion; the map is pretty frustrating, and the games go on for a long time. I do enjoy how there isn't any iron or better armor, however. I don't know about you, but for me, it's really dang hard to bridge over to the monuments without getting shot off. If I actually do happen to kill the defenders, they just respawn and come back to kill me. I would like it removed, as well :C

The only reason Clay Wars gets frustrating is because when the score is 1 monument to 1 on each team, it is a real challenge to bridge without being seen. Wood would make Clay Wars easier IMO. However, I think that the pickaxe could have efficiency on them, that would make it better. Or a limited number of arrows.

I agree with Marcuz maybe a slightly better eff pickaxe in the loadout might be helpful. Its very frustrating(at times) to bridge to the monument because the spawn is like right there. I usually only get it if A. Team body blocks for one guy to rush or B. Prebuilt Bridge to monument. Adding wood may fix the the problem, but will ruin the feel of claywars. My only problem is the placement for the monument, however getting it in the current state the map is does require a lot of teamwork(most of the time) and strategy. +.5 for the Op for changing it.

The stalemates is what makes Clay Wars a challenge. By giving players wood, or a more efficient pick ruins the gameplay.<br><br>When it's 1:1 and that last monument is broken, it makes it more special knowing that you just finished a great/ close game.<br><br>Not every map needs wood, water, iron and a fast pick.

I've played Clay wars once. I didn't go for the monuments once, I just made it my goal to get straight across to the other team. Now, I absolutely suck at nebula, I love it, but I suck so bad like you have no idea. But on this map I was actually able to get multiple kills which I've never done before. <br><br>I was skeptical at first because there was no wood and I thought everyone would just team grief, but I feel that everyone was in the same boat so no one destroyed anything unless they thought it would benefit the team. Maybe I just played with some really good people, but I really enjoyed the map and it always provided some sort of challenge with the two teams battling for dominance over the bridges. I say leave it for now.

That's true, I love long matches as well, especially with a good defense on the enemy team. But like anything else, there's a line that, once crossed, changes the mood completely. Once you rush a certain amount of times, the game isn't a fun, challenging defense, but instead turns into a frustrating, unbreakable barrier that makes you feel like you want to quit. This is one of the maps that have the ability to go from challenging to annoying and frustrating.

Clay Wars is beautiful the way it is. It's one of the only maps that's a challenge other than Prolieum. I'm not saying anything is "eZ" if you think I'm being "cocky" but I'm just saying that Clay Wars is one of my favourite maps because of the FPS it gives me and because of how fun it is to killfarm.

Not that hard as long as there is no experienced players in your game. Just set up traps like walls or trenches that go into the void.<br><br>Another way is to play on Kohi and then come back on to Nebula.

That's true, I love long matches as well, especially with a good defense on the enemy team. But like anything else, there's a line that, once crossed, changes the mood completely. Once you rush a certain amount of times, the game isn't a fun, challenging defense, but instead turns into a frustrating, unbreakable barrier that makes you feel like you want to quit. This is one of the maps that have the ability to go from challenging to annoying and frustrating.

Any map can have a ridiculously good defense.

I like Clay Wars, due to the fact that the gameplay is pretty equal since there is no armor advantages, however, the block spam is really annoying. Also, the color of the blocks that you spawn with should be changed, it's just asking for inappropriate builds, and I see them a lot while playing.

Yup, inappropriate builds, I was on TS with Pop and others and he was saying how this person was building dongs all over the map, so to troll I made one in the center of the map and bridged off that, which my team started using as an actual bridge xd.&nbsp;<br><br>Besides the stupid, immature moments on Clay Wars, the map is fine how it is. (I wasn't the one building dongs all over the map)

I really like the map alot. I see alot of team attacks whith more then ten people at once carring for each other and I think that the map brings the people together a bit more, and thats how you can easily get the monuments even if there are defenders.

Changed the blocks on Clay Wars from the white variants to the gray variants. As for the map itself, i'm satisfied on how it currently plays. I see no necessary revisions at this moment in time required, however if the author wants to release an update for it he can. I don't think this should be in our hands since it's fine.

I disagree with this.<br><br>First of all, Clay Wars gets the best game play and it is a very fun map.<br>I know that there is a lot of block-spam in this map but it doesn't really bother me that much.<br><br>There is no iron so everyone who don't want to get iron are fine because it is going to be fair with armor.&nbsp;<br><br>One thing I would like to change is the monuments. You can easily be seen from spawn because its pretty close but that is the only con. In my opinion Clay Wars is a great map.
