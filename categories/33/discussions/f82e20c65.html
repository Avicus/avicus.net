Tournament/Scrim Recording

</h1>
Hello everyone! I have another suggestion.<br><br>As you all know, the Winter Update is coming soon! Included are scrimmages and hopefully a few tournaments.&nbsp;<br><br>I was thinking that these matches should be live-streamed or at least recorded and put in a special section of the website. Similar to how sports work. It would be great to see some competitive action. Perhaps a Nebula Tournament streaming live would become the next "Minecraft Superbowl" Competition is important and, we must preserve these moments. We would need a few special someones who would be glad to do this. If Tynvale is interested, I vouch for him to commentate because, this guy has an awesome voice and commentating skills. The recorder could pretty much be anyone who doesn't lag but, we would need multiple people to catch the action from different perspectives. Then of course, we will need a video editor. From what I've seen, Tynvale can do this as well. I'm sure many other people can as well. Now you may be thinking "Wow, what a hassle" Do you think it would be hard to scrape up 10 of the 100's of people of this community? Now this may sound like Minecraft TV but, it can be easily achieved and I do believe that this will bring in more players.&nbsp;<br><br>Below I will list down some of the basic requirements in order for this to become possible.<br><br>Recording Staff:<br>-At least 8 recorders (Standing still?)(Moving around)<br>-1 logger to note when a special play happens (Have to be in sync with recorders)<br>-1 video editor (upload from Avicus youtube account)&nbsp;<br>-1 commentator<br>*Some people could take on multiple roles.<br><br>Q&amp;A:<br>Q:How will someone get the Avicus Youtube login information?&nbsp;<br>A: Given to a trusted person from IvyCode<br><br>Q: How do i apply for this?<br>A: Right now you can't because, the staff must allow this to happen.<br><br>Q: How will we communicate?<br>A: A skype group would be suggested.<br><br>Q: Will I get paid?<br>A: I suggest that those who participate should but, it may be of a smaller amount.<br><br>Q: What if the game that is going to be recorded is the team I'm in?<br>A: Actions will be taken to find someone to fill your role for that game.<br><br>Q: Do I need experience?<br>A: Preferrably but, if a few recording perspectives are going to be standing still, experience won't be necessary as anyone can stand still.&nbsp;<br><br>Q: What if I lag a lot?<br>A: Then I would suggest not taking part in this as it will provide an unenjoyable viewing experience.<br><br>Q: How will we communicate in-game?<br>A: A skype call would be preferred but, make sure that you don't accidentally record your voice when in the skype call. Also, you may have to record in full screen to block out unecessary tabs of skype or anything irrelevant.<br><br>Q: Do I have anymore questions?<br>A: I hope not.<br><br>Thank you all for reading this. The advancement of this community will allow the community to reach new places. If you have any questions, feel free to ask below. If this suggestion some how is taken into effect, interviews may be necessary as this is an important role which cannot be taken light-heartedly. Have a good one Avicus!<br><br>*Keep in mind this can easily be done for all game modes.<br><br>~PokerFace<br><i>The guy who typed this.</i>

I don't undestand. The teams skype calls won't be included in the stream. If you mean seeing strategy, there really isn't much to learn just by watching. You just get a better understanding of who you are up against.<br><br>*And, why would one of the members watch the stream. They would have to watch after.

Then, why not just post the recording after it's over instead of streaming it live?

If it's like a youtube video it would be nice. You can watch players compete to win and Id like it. But make sure the players have chat/name tags off(F1) so you don't see player names/kills

Um well.. I don't record but, certain guidelines will be set such as the type of recorder, quality etc... As Sethskye mentioned, F1 mode will be necessary to ensure all perspectives look the same and to block out unnecessary server chat, or chat can be disabled so you can see player names. Depending on the responses to this, I will go into further detail.

The players competing won't be the recorders... There are going to be actual recorders on the side. Preferabbly with /vanish.

OCN uses something called Miners Movies that records a server and you can spectate anywhere, fast forward it and whatnot. All you do is put in a weird ip with random characters/numbers and you can watch it like a movie.

Don't know about this, seems nice and all but I believe all tournaments are handled on the Avicus Network (server made for it) to make it official, /v and other commands would make it impossible unless Sr staff and higher record or you don't mind seeing players hand in the way. More in general seems like a pain to set up, make, and edit, especially if Tynvale would do it all as I see you have a major interest in him like everybody else and I :P

I did some reaearch on them just now. First off, you have to join a multiplayer server to see? Second off, are there multiple perspectives because watching at 1 angle the whole time is not exactly interesting.

Press F1 to hide player hands, inventory, chat, and player name.<br>It really shouldn't take too long as this is not a 1 man job. As long as everyone works together, it shouldn't take more than a day.<br><br>Also, if it is on a seperate server of avicus, then ranks could easily be given allowing /vanish.

Ok thanks for the clarification. But, I think it would be cheating because, if it's live, like Sethskye said, the other team can get an advantange.

No reasons to make such a big deal out of a minecraft tournament. Those who want to record should be&nbsp;allowed to do it.<br>Honestly I don't think streaming a tournament would be a great success, seeing that this community isn't as big as it used to be. And especially not if the streamers have to get paid to do it, thats just stupid.<br><br>Just keep it simple, this ain't Superbowl yo.

Well, I did get a new Computer (A decent AMD build), I get good fps, and can stream at 60 fps (Low quality because of my internet speed, lately not doing so good :/) I can definitely record at 60 fps, and just do cuts to the fun parts :D and post them :P
