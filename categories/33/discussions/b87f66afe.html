<b>So I just played avicus for detressing and I put a lot of&nbsp;work into getting all the monuments. And then... ...<br>[JKawesome] Gg?<br>[nerfgun2002] GG<br>[frostbite(idkback)] We told you not to break&nbsp;the monument!<br>[nerfgun2002] you did not tell me!<br>[acid(or something)] Nerf you are the only one doing the right thing on your team by not kill farming.<br><br>^From this, I think that we should make kill farming a rule. Cause if this goes on the losing team&nbsp;will never get out of their base and end the game. Anyways My OP exams are coming up so I may not be able to play. See you around on the forums, and mods please help in this.<br><br>Thank you!<br>~nerfgun2002<br><br></b>

Tbh, I enjoy killfarming, and I think it should still be allowed, It´s their problem if you break it.. Just ignore them and move on with the next game

It is a tactic. If you make that illegal then you may aswell make skybases illegal.

Killfarming is not cheap, and a way that someone plays. You wanna ban something that is completely somewhat legit and someone's way of playing/enjoying a game?

That's called spawn killing if you are directly outside their spawn.

Kill farming is usually defined when a 'choke point' on the map has been controlled by you, or your team.

+1 Frostbites choke point is the enemies iron. Quintus is that little box area.

Tbh why do people keep making posts like these. Kill farming is standing in the enemies side like Quintuses Box area or their iron killing them which is not against the rules and not the same as spawn killing.

If we make kill farming illegal, Nebula will die. It's like telling someone:<br><br>Yeah ok, you are controlling the map but you are not allowed to kill the enemy team.

Just because you and your friends were doing that kill farm stuff doesnt mean he isnt allowed to do what he wants too. You are not the leaders. You cant tell him what to do. He is free to rush, to kill, to build, etc. I mean, saying "dint break the monuments, were killfarming" sounds so selfish.

I was in that match. Sorry if we were being mean to you, but we specifically said, "nerf, please leave the last monument cuz we're killfarming"<br>So yes, we did tell you to leave the last monument. You could've still gotten it after we were done killfarming. If you had said, "JKawesome I'll leave it but let me break it at the end", I would've left it for you to break

Ok let me make it clear to you that I am not accusing anyone but making sure that the other team gets to go out of their base. there I like so many of you right outside their spawn. So please don't hate me for that. I know it can't be bannable but just let people do what they one. If they wanna rush and break the monument let them, this is wat the game is about. If you want to kill farm do it on nexus.

Honestly, it is your choice whether not to break the monument, or leave it for the kill farm.<br><br>They cannot just tell you to break the monument or not, it is all in your choice. So I don't really think you should get all heated up on these things. Just ignore them.
