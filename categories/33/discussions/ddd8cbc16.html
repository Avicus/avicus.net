As most of nebula is DTM. The goal is to break the monument. When defending. The most useless thing you can do is cover the monument with random blocks or forts. Forts I don't really care for but they are useless in my opinion. Covering the monument is not only useless but it hurts your own defense. If they can hide in your defense it is game over. If you can't see where they are coming, you don't know how to stop them and then...Gg. All I am saying is that covering the monuments happens way to often on this server and it is annoying and it does nothing.&nbsp;<br>

Mmm, yes. &nbsp;Everyone needs to understand that covering it up it the worst thing possible.....especially when you're defending and someone comes up and just puts wood everywhere....its like they want the opposing team to win.....

Forts aren't necessarily useless, so long as you build them in specific ways. &nbsp;In Nebula, i commonly prefer to take the offensive (my goal is always to capture at least one monument per map) and on several occasions that were few and far between, my enemies set up the fort in such a way that unless half of my team threw themselves at the monument the game would go on forever.<br><br>One particular occurrence comes to mind, when i was playing Quintus a few months back. &nbsp;This group had procured 2 sets of diamond equipment and 3 sets of iron equipment. &nbsp;They proceeded to create a fort, 2-4 layers of wood thick, with pathways for easy access. &nbsp;The fort had all the necessities: a door for easy defense against arrows as well as the ability to shift from defense to shooting, paths, a resupply route from spawn and several other small features. &nbsp;Our team got to that last monument and was stuck in stalemate, until we were defeated.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Seems easy to break through if you were an expert rusher.

When I'm defending (very,very, very rarely), I usually just break everything besides the actual obsidian, put slabs on the floor, buttons on the walls, and stand there. I usually have iron or diamond while defending. This way, if someone actually manages to make it to the monument, I can just kill them. The defense also makes it so that the only place they can go on the monument platform is where the slabs are. That means they can't stack up.&nbsp;

ohh, i never thought about using slabs! i have always used pressure plates in the past, but i bet the slabs are more efficient than pressure plates since you could make more :D

As a rusher, i love it when people cover the monument in wood! It's a great tactic and you should always do it!

Covering the monument should be punishable ;_;

Whenever I'm defending, i cover the monument in a box of glass so that whenever they break it, i'll know when someone is trying to mine it.&nbsp;<br><br>Afterwards, i make the monument defense into a grade A sniper fort. Fit for me :)<br><br>But I get cautious whenever teammates are building towards me. I yell to them to break their bridges.&nbsp;
