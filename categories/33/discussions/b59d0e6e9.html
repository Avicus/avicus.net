Just to note, this isn't an argument, its a discussion.<br><br>I think 2v1s, 3v1s, anyV1s are acceptable. I see loads of people complaining like 'omg legoche scrub 2v1 me nub' or 'stupid scrubby teamers' or something. One thing to make straight.<br><br><br><h2>ITS A TEAM GAME!</h2><br><br><span>What are your opinions on this? Discuss, Discuss, Discuss.<br></span>

+1 to this because it's "NEBULA" or "NEXUS"<br><br>But if they are going to bring back sg. And then someone is saying "Omg 3v1" is 100% fair.

what's the point of discussing this when there is no problem with it.<br>It's not a server bug, it's not against the rules, it's just a game.

People say 'Let me 1v1 you scrubs' when it is a team game after all<br>If you want to 1v1 Avicus isn't really the place<br>Check for some pvp servers instead, but the game modes here are a whole different experience<br>.

Honestly, I don't know why people make such a big deal out of this. If you get teamed, why does it matter? Maybe you were the only player in a certain area of the map where there just so happened to be multiple enemy players. Some people make way too big a deal out of this, and it's just pointless.

Look at it this way, they need more than 1 player to kill you, take it as a compliment<br>.

I don't really care about being 2 or 3 v1'ed normally. It's when someone is running away from me and they see their teammate coming and the runner turns around and 2v1's me. Really. You were just running away.
