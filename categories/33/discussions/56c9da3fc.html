OK, so I was digging through my screenshots and I found THIS:&nbsp;<a href="http://imgur.com/6WWUKvz" title="Link: http://imgur.com/6WWUKvz">http://imgur.com/6WWUKvz</a><br>I remember the shot, it was that map with the giant mushrooms, and I saw someone on the other side. He (t_money2003) was on the top of the giant mushroom, and I was at the bottom on the other side of the map. With my pro sniping skills, BING. 149.49. Maybe the highest on Avicus? please, post YOUR highest shots and I will make a top 10. By the way, you can only go in the list once. I've made countless 100, 110 block shots, but no screenshots because they are so common for me. Please post a screenshot of your longest bow shot!
