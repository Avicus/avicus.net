Hey, you know that I'm someone who enjoys defending. Today I have decided to make such a good defence and share it on forums.&nbsp;<br><br>So basically it's more useful for ground rushers but I thought that it's pretty useful. I'm also thinking on something like AntiSky version of this. Here is the photos!<br><br><a href="https://gyazo.com/a167289304b1d095654f0a49aee43542" title="Link: https://gyazo.com/a167289304b1d095654f0a49aee43542">https://gyazo.com/a167289304b1d095654f0a49aee43542</a><br><a href="https://gyazo.com/ac816b7b5c1691799f563921c43155cd" title="Link: https://gyazo.com/ac816b7b5c1691799f563921c43155cd">https://gyazo.com/ac816b7b5c1691799f563921c43155cd</a><br><a href="https://gyazo.com/c9f6f2e5786dec86d9b0f9e5019b4c47" title="Link: https://gyazo.com/c9f6f2e5786dec86d9b0f9e5019b4c47">https://gyazo.com/c9f6f2e5786dec86d9b0f9e5019b4c47</a><br><a href="https://gyazo.com/7468f75a9e5b7522d0f764728dda0033" title="Link: https://gyazo.com/7468f75a9e5b7522d0f764728dda0033">https://gyazo.com/7468f75a9e5b7522d0f764728dda0033</a><br><br>And feedback is really important for me. Honestly, bad comments are more important for me. Make sure that these bad comments will improve me more. Just tell me what to do =P

Quick small improvement. On the very last fences surrounding the monument. Try placing pressure plates or slabs so they can't place on it.

Don't use signs, they are really easy to break and slabs / pressure plates are much easier to craft and place in large quantities faster.

Remember you can place buttons on the ground - they are hard to break unless the enemies have water

The reason why I used signs and fences is, it makes it harder to break 4 signs and place woods there. While a rusher doing these, we can bow them easily. Can you please explain me why you didn't like it? And please remember that a good team push can get every single defense. That's why it's mostly about defenders pvp skills :) do not forget

This is way overdone and a lot of the stuff is pretty much useless.. Some stuff would simply be a waste of time to do.

They do xd when a defender falls down from sky, it will take ages to cover himself if he hasn't got an axe. Water does zero damage on this. Pleas tell me what to change and change to what.

To cover yourself, you need to break signs. Or you will be knocked out by a defenders arrow.

If you were considering this for a competitive match then I'm sorry, but it's way overdone. I for one enjoy creating 'dream defences' when bored. As a defender you must accept the fact that all defences are beatable; it's just how long you can hold them off for. Make a quick mon defence, fence perimeter, pressure floor at the back and then work on removing the walls and creating a water fall.&nbsp;<br>Nice ideas! :)<br><br>.

You gotta have a defence in mind you want to end up with, even if you probably won't finish it, a general direction.

On RendDTM I just usually put iron blocks on the monument, slab it, button it, put slabs over the floor upcto to the wall of the the tunnel, put fences around it, and try and break the wall but 2 layers with fences ontop. Not the best defence but it does the job and it's pretty quick to do

Yeah. I know that every defense can get beaten verse an OPRushTeam. But you know, there are always going to be someone defending and what defences do is, making rushers waste time. For that reason I have made that defence.

Well, I suggest you to use crafting tables instead. Cuz many people rush without axe. But we can say that ' Generally iron block is more useful if they don't have axes.
