Will anti-cheat be removed for the tournament?&nbsp;<br><br>Because if we have block lag and have to break monuments twice in the tournament it will be complete garbage. Not only this powerfull icarus' don't work because anti-cheat just pulls you back could this all be fixed on scrimmage servers and during the tourney?

Yes. Besides, I don't see a reason to keep it. There would be Referees and Officials staring people down the whole match!

They were my thoughts too, it's just with the scrim servers because it would be helpful if they were removed now so we could decide what icarus is best to use on what map and see if certain tactics work.

Scrim servers don't really affect public matches, and it shouldn't be attached to your profile statistics. If a player were to hack it would only cause issues within the team.

I think i may have worded what i said wrong. :D I meant to put that the Anti-Cheat should be removed on the scrim servers for those reasons that i have previously stated and the ones you just brought to light to.
