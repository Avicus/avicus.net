Why does there need to be this, scrimming isn't really a league and division 2 clans would feel sad, also, are there enough clans to even do this, it would pretty much become the same 2 clans scrimming each other over and over.

I rather scrim the best teams if I am the worst to learn a trick or 2 and use it to my own advantage towards weaker teams

i know what you mean but then it will be a fair scrimmage for division 2 players that they may thrive to become better,<br><br><br>look at it this way, you are in division 2 and seeing this you have to motivation to move up the ranks.
