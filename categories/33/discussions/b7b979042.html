Seeing that the Winter update is coming at some point soon, and from what I've heard, Eliminstion is not leaving. &nbsp;So, with that update coming soon, i thought a bump of this topic was in order. &nbsp;The goal of this thread is to revive elimination, here are some suggestions, It’s
a mouthful but please read it:).

<br><br><u>Disasters:</u>

<br><br>So Elimination is getting repetitive.&nbsp; One guy wins the early blood bath and then
dominates the game because he has a lot of cool stuff.&nbsp; Well, if we add natural disasters, it could
mix things up a little.&nbsp; I’m thinking every
time the total number of players are halved, a disaster occurs.&nbsp; Here are ten ideas for disasters:

<br><br>Tornado:

A tornado tears through the map and picks players off their
feet.&nbsp; “Sky bases beware”. Lasts one
minute.

<br><br>Sandstorm:

The map gets foggy and players take one damage every five
seconds regardless of armor, “find cover!!” Lasts four minutes.&nbsp; (This disaster only happens in dessert and
beach biomes.)

<br><br>Earthquake:

The ground shakes, the map is torn apart, and every grounded
player takes heavy damage, lasts five seconds.

<br><br>Flood:

Water covers the map to the top of pine trees, “miners
beware”, lasts four minutes.

<br><br>Forest fire:

Lava randomly spawns around trees and the forest catches a
flame. “Get water quick!!”&nbsp; lava spawns,
no time limit forest burns until its gone.

<br><br>Famine:

<span>All trees die, plants die, water dries out and the worst of
all, all animals die.&nbsp; It stays this way
the rest of the game.&nbsp; “Hopefully you
hunted for food beforehand”<br></span>

<br>Avalanche:

Snowballs with sharpness 2 are thrown down the mountain, and
if that’s bad, have fun getting buried in blocks of snow falling from the
mountain as well.&nbsp; Lasts three minutes.&nbsp; (only in tundra and ice mountain biomes.)

<br><br>Mob swarm:

One night, the mobs decide to take over, they are
everywhere, zombies, creepers, ender men, skeletons and spiders.&nbsp; Players have nowhere to hide, they will fall
if they dare face the mighty army of monsters.&nbsp;
Lasts one night.

<br><br>Nether mob:

The regular mobs hide in fear, for one night, the nether
visits the regular world, that’s right, blaze, magma cubes, pig men and wither
skeletons.&nbsp; And the worst of all, a ghast,
roams the map.&nbsp; Lasts one night.

<br><br>Rise of the Undead:

Every spectator comes back into the game, they spawn with
the kit they played with, they have one minute to kill a tribute, if they do,
they come back to life.&nbsp; If they don’t,
they go back to spectating.&nbsp; Lats one
minute (Undead can’t do damage to each other.)

&nbsp;

<br><br>Volcanic eruption:<br>lava oozes out of the mountain and burns the entire map, "better get above ground and quick." lava falls and stays for the rest of the game.*<br><br>Meteor strike:<br>a fireball hits the surface and creates a giant Crater the ground, pretty much kills any player that it hits (or heavily damages.) &nbsp;there is also diamond and iron ores inside. "no, pain no gain." &nbsp;meteor hits and then creates crater, no time limit.*<br><br>(New) Blackout: The sun died out!!!! Everyone is stuck with
blindness 3 (Or whatever works), and now seeing is a difficult task.&nbsp; (Lasts for 5min.)

<br><span><br>(New) Hardcore time: Everyone’s max health is one heart!!! You
better watch your step, one slip and you’re done, lasts for the rest of the
game.</span><br><br>Note: many of these could be like the extreme weather mod
(at least that’s what I think it’s called.) <br>

<span><br>Well thanks for reading:)&nbsp;please leave suggestions, let’s put elimination back on the map :D<br><br><br>*thanks to carrie-may for these suggestions<br></span>

Oh btw, you should also add volcano eruptions and also meteor strikes but when the meteor strikes down the ground, any nearby tributes will have a very big damage but inside the meteor, there's iron or diamonds in it

I wouldn't imagine it would lag unless we had like 5 disasters going on at once which could be avoided easily

Most of these are quite impossible through the use of plugins, and would require client side mods.&nbsp;

I think this is a brilliant idea. I played Elimination once, when I had a laptop getting 5 fps with crappy internet. It'd be awesome to see Elim in its full glory with these new features :D<br>
