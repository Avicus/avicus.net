Avicade has almost no one in it and it has only three games. I'm wondering if a game committee can be formed for avicade?

Well sur there used to be a game committee, until every member took an arrow to the knee. But I have an accomplishment, I was the first person to get kicked out of it. :D

Well for starters the committees more or less did not properly do their job. I know the game committee was intended to bring unique games to Avicus at a rapid pace, but what ended up was a lot of miscommunication (apparently?). &nbsp;Games were never meant to be accepted on the spot; any game with the possibility of being brought to Avicus would require the acceptance of a higher staff member, in addition to me with the OK to say it's possible to develop in Minecraft. <br><br>Regarding the OP, we are bringing new games to the Avicade and redesigning it a bit to incorporate a wider variety of possibilities for games. It's good to see some ideas being brought to the table and I'll be sure to keep them in mind and bring them up with the appropriate people.<br><br>@Tigor101, @kycrafft I don't see why I am&nbsp;<i>required&nbsp;</i>to respond to your kit ideas. I have very little say on what kits are on the servers because I don't think I would balance them properly. Popular kits will get the attention of the kit committee.<br><br>Edit: I've also never seen than document linked above... Again, goes to show the lack of communication I suppose.

You're previous posts were all an effort to get the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://i.imgur.com/Jxw52EN.png">attention</a> of <a rel="nofollow" href="http://i.imgur.com/dyesi6W.png">me</a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://i.imgur.com/ajtKt8t.png">specifically</a>, so I assumed otherwise.<br><br>"lack of feedback in general" -&nbsp;I beg to differ, your posts received lots of attention and feedback, just a few had less than 5 replies. Many had well above that.
