Hello , So ive been getting lots of lag on Avicus Nebula And everyone else is too i get 5654 fps on other server because i use alien ware or apple but on avicus i get 2112 fps because it lags so much and on FrostBite or Senex 2 where you get iron a block disappears then i fall into the void and i QQ ( if someone could fix this lag can you please do it or i might just leave avicus ) <br>it gets annoying sometimes when i mine the Monument then i start to lag and someone kills me its just so annoying !

Yeah, as long as it's over 120 FPS, it doesn't matter because your monitor can't display it.. ._.<br>Also, everyone is having the block-lag issue :c<br>I guess we'll just have to play it out and see what happens!

Anything above 120fps on a 120hz monitor cannot be seen by human eyes. So since you are supposedly getting "2112 fps" that should not be a problem :)

Well by default you cannot exceed 999 fps in Minecraft however if you get optifine and allow your fps to go higher, however only extremely fast computers can get 2500 - 3000 fps on Minecraft&nbsp;<u>with</u> optifine.
