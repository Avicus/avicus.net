Temp banned...

Today i was temp banned for 'being rude to staff', what caused this was me saying something stupid so the staff member jumped to instead of calming me donw and handling the situation well to temp ban me for a day!<br><br>What I said was 'no one cares about your warnings', yes it was rude but in my opinion not worthy of a temp ban! Just a small message to all the staff; splease handle the situation well without abusing your power, the chances are the player you just banned regrets what he did and is just as committed to helping the server as you are... ( just a message to all the staff who abuse there power)

Well perhaps you have been rude many other times. After all, you have many other infractions.

indeed I do, but other infractions shouldn't make you swade to temp ban someone... also have a look at the date on those infractions, most of them raging from around 10 were in October September time, a person can change if you let them...

Yes, a ban is too much for simple 4 DDoS'es.

Someones mistakes ( which were months ago) shouldn't make you think any less of them, especially as a staff member. You shoudlnt be biased about what you have seen of that person. I rage a lot in this game, but it takes only a friendly guiding person to calm me down, not someone who is willing to ban me if i don't do exactly what they tell me...

its not just them being to strict, its that if you gave the player some time to think they might calm down, I was temp banned with under 5 seconds!

You also got kicked 2 minutes before that for the same reason; that was your warning for you to calm down. Just because you regret it and are committed as anyone else isn't an excuse to not punish bad actions and behavior.

but.. it wasnt the fact i was arguing with another player. The other player was gone and i was fine. Then I was angry at the way I was kicked (usually your warned with the command or your warned in chat several times). I know the kick was a warning otherwise i wouldn't of said; 'no one cares about your warnings'. Im not saying I shouldn't be punished im just stating a temp ban for 1 day isnt a suitable punishment!

As you said, you were rude to a staff member. Now he tempbanned you for this. I don't see where the mistake is. And as bpirr said, you were kicked before for the same, as warning. Now it's fact that after you were kicked, you'll get tempbanned if you don't stop. You should know this, if you are playing on this server for more than 2-3 months. If you still think it was a mistake, appeal the infraction via an email to the support. support@avicus.net. You also would know that if you make a forums thread about your ban/tempban your chances will decreased.

&nbsp;'bad actions and behavior', a bad action would be... excessive rudeness... I wasn't excessivly being rude. I was rude 2 times; without using swear words or inappropriate langauge. If I was very rude and constantly yes... a temp ban would possibly be suitable. However I was rude 1 time to a player, without using bad language, and i was rude 1 time to a member of staff in which my opinion really wasn't bad at all...&nbsp;<br><br>So i'll say again, I dont think a temp ban was a suitable punishment

I already have sent an email. Im sorry if im coming across rude when i say this but i dont need any one telling me what a kick and ban mean.... if u have a look at my infractions i've had my fair share... Im not looking for an argument, or a lecture from players who think there perfect. Im just stating I thought a temp ban wasn't the right punishment for my actions..

Also just to add... Im not implying there was a mistake, I just want the person to know who temp banned me that, if you read the thread, i regret what i did but i believe a temp ban to be to harsh; if your going to lecture me please.. get it right
