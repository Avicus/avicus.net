I think the donater rooms should be gotten rid of because it creates cliques in the community making it worse and not better which TS is supposed to do.

There really isn't a whole lot of Team Speak players who frequently come on. The TS crew is already a clique. If a new player joins, we love to help him/her and make them feel welcome.<br>The Suite is a donor benefit. Most people that come on TS are donors anyway :P<br>

The reason we have a premium suite is so that donors get a benefit from donating. Donators are helping the server, and in return are getting back some extra options that normal players don't. That's why there are donators.... :P

<a rel="nofollow" href="http://bit.ly/1gPKtOM">http://bit.ly/1gPKtOM</a><br>A donation is a donation, you should expect nothing in return. However, we do get something in return. Isn't much of a donation knowing that you're going to get something in return. It's more like a purchase.<br><br>But I would like it if they added a "Registered" rank to TS. And replaced the Donor channel to "Registered Channel"<br>You would have to confirm with a moderator that you're this 'avicus player' in order to get the rank. To avoid a bunch of trolls coming into a "Confirmed Avicus Chat".

I am not a donor but use teamspeak. I only use cursing forbidden because my parents think that since I am twelve, I need to show them it is appropriate. Feel free to talk to me. I don't have skype and on teamspeak I mostly to nebula gameplay. I also use the chat.<br>TheoLucy
