New Gamemode idea<br>2 teams:Red and Blue<br>Medieval themed maps<br>You can attack or defend. First to take the most gold is victorious<br>This is like CTW And instead you need to obtain the most gold blocks And bring it back to your base. 30m limit. &nbsp;You can kill players or take whole blocks from enemies. &nbsp;You can only hold 1 gold block at a time. If an enemy destroys the defense you can repair it. If you get a gold block you need to throw it in a hopper. This GM can be won by people who want to get kills or people who like to get monuments on nebula<br><br>Scoreboard: On the scoreboard it goes<br>Red<br>GoldB:-#-<br>Blue<br>GoldB:-#-<br><br>Equipment: Leather dyed armor<br>StoneSword<br>Bow Infinity<br>DPick UB3Eff4&nbsp;<br><span>Stack of Stone, Glass, Wood<br>&nbsp;<br><br>If you kill someone you get 1 gold nugget<br>&nbsp;Max Build Height:4025 team limits<br>Can't place blocks on the side of the map<br></span><span><br><br><br><br><br><br></span>

Question: Should we have TNT or not?<br><br>Make it infinite gold and you need to bring back the most gold in 1 hour?<br>&nbsp;Every kill = 1 gold ingot?

I agree with infinite gold + time limit, but 1 hour is way too long. Make it 10 minutes for build time/grace period and have 15 or 20 minutes for the actual fighting. Alternatively you could have different servers host different time limits.<br><br>And yes, I think TNT would ruin it. Overall, +1 to the idea.

You could have TNT but with no block damage. I like the idea!

+1. The game idea is similar to other games but this one is more creative. 1 thing though, take away the TNT

Sounds great +1 Maybe for the /giveblock thing you can use /brick or /glass instead, plus a cooldown for getting the blocks.

I really like the idea. I love the idea of the prep time, but if you have a teamgriefer on your team you lost, well I might think about a worsecase xD The /giveblock command is also useful for rushers. But I have a little suggestion, change the name. I like the name, but there is already a game with the name on xisumavoids server. Just to stop any confusings. Overall nice idea +1
