</h1>
Howdy,<br><br>As of 12/15/2016 all staff and community members of avicus should be free of keyloggers. All operations by me and my friends against avicus staff have been ceased.This is my goodbye post to people who I currently or previously have called friends who are still on this network.<br><br>Eric- It felt appropriate to begin this list with you. You've probably had the biggest transformation of any player on the network and I haven't always loved these changes but I always felt that we both had each other's back despite many differences.<br><br>Steven- Another person who I felt was 100% true and loyal to me as I was to him. Pretty dank memes.<br><br>Kyoal- You kinda suck.<br><br>Seth- on and off friendship and idk how much of it was genuine but I had some fun times with you<br><br>Venny- Really fun to mess with you. I really did enjoy playing games with you outside of avi and even though you really and genuinely hated me I never really did have that towards you.<br><br>Resi- Really cool guy who I wish I had spent more time with.<br><br>Jahaj- Idk man, you and me grew really far apart really fast.<br><br>Distraction- Probably the most genuine person on the staff team right now. As someone who saw what people said to my face and behind my back at the same time I can honestly say what you see is what you get with this guy.<br><br>Prodigy- Literally my favorite beaner<br><br>Spookz- Very up and down however I always tried to have your back and I think you always tried to have mine despite our many problems.<br><br>Liz- Fun person. Pretty dumb though lol.<br><br>Admins and Senior Mods- lol m8s. I had a lot of fun messing with you but I got carried away with things and overreacted to you banning me even though I still believe the ban is unfair.<br><br>Community- Best part of avicus is all of you staff or not. Gameplay could be shit, Maps could be unplayable, forums could be down and you'd all still find some fun to have.<br><br>Kylo- Deepest apologies to you for things I've did, really did get carried away and let my shit hurt innocent people. I believe you are a tank of a developer despite your inactivity on the management side of the server.

I'll actually miss you. Despite everything you've done, you were right about a lot of things to do with the staff team and you had the stones to act on them while the rest of us just passively whined.<br><br>Best of luck if this is legitimate. I'll miss you.

The last thread I would expect to be made from Zac, lol.<br><br>Good to see you've changed your morals(?), can't say I'll miss you, but I probably will when you've been gone a while. I found everything you did really annoying, but when you spoke to me on teamspeak, I'd always be laughing on the other side even if you couldn't hear it. :}
