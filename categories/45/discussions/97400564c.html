</h1>
Hey,<br><br><br>Before I start I would like to point out that I am not shaming any staff, players or anything, this is just a suggestion/question. In fact I believe that the staff are doing amazing despite all the recent hate going there way.<br><br>The main reason I made this was because I was fed up of seeing players insult staff, saying that they are useless because they can't ban 10 hackers at once and what really persuaded me into making this was seeing a player come on about 2 hours ago saying he played on MCZONE, he said that Avicus was worse, that the maps were terrible and the player count was awful. Now i'm not saying that I agree with him on everything but I agree that Avicus's player count is decreasing, what worried me even more is the fact that this player got completely roasted, people said he was wrong and told him to "shut the fuck up" There is two things that concerned me about this, one being that this player isn't coming back anytime soon, they potentially got driven off by fellow players, this is especially bad as don't we want to be growing as a community not scaring people off? Secondly I think that most people don't see this declining in the popularity because otherwise wouldn't they be agreeing with him?<br><br>I've noticed that recently when I go on the player count has been around 30, and putting it bluntly that is crap. I know for a fact Avicus deserves more players than that. So i'm going to be addressing a few topics in this essay (i think its an essay):<br><br><ul><li><b>Player Count</b></li><li><b>Advertising (I realise there has been a post already)</b></li><li><b>Voting</b></li><li><b>Game Modes</b></li><li><b>Mods and Hacking</b></li><li><b>Popularity of Minecraft</b></li><li><b>Conclusion</b></li></ul>I know that sounds like a lot but they will be short (hopefully xD)<br><br><br><b><u>Player Count:<br></u></b><br>This topic I feel is one of the most important because the main target for the server is to have a high player count, mainly because the more players there are the more likely the votes will go up the more likely people will tell their friends about Avicus and eventually the server will become very popular (If done right)<br><br>You may ask "How can we improve the player count?"<br><br>This is what the next few topics will cover.<br><br><br><b><u>Advertising:<br></u></b><br>Advertising is simple, for people who don't understand it is a way of showing people your product or service, in this case a server, what it is or what it can do. I have a few suggestions one of which is YouTube; I think this is a great way of attracting potential players to the server especially as there were 44.3 million searches for <i>Minecraft </i>in 2014 on YouTube, surely one of those searches will scroll upon a game play video on Avicus and if not then we need to make sure they do. Personally I have never made a YouTube video in my life, but i plan to. I have been watching helpful videos ironically on YouTube of how to start up a YouTube gaming channel primarily to advertise Avicus.<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLM75SI6mT-Td31Qt6vSYMUBkAbtNpiXUh" title="Link: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLM75SI6mT-Td31Qt6vSYMUBkAbtNpiXUh">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLM75SI6mT-Td31Qt6vSYMUBkAbtNpiXUh</a><br>This is a playlist for a little tutorial series thing that I did on my channel last year talking about how to create and maintain a channel. I will probably create another sooner or later as an update because I have changed how I operate.<br>Hope this is sufficient enough<br><img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/0af038412894434ca4be965b317244e8?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/shadowolfyt.html" style="color: #5D5D5D">shadowolfyt</a><br><br>If i can't Insert the link just type in on YouTube "How to start a YouTube gaming channel"<br><br><br>Another way to advertise could be through Adverts on websites, but personally i think it would be more cost effective to advertise on YouTube through a video. I realise there have been posts about a "trailer" already, but I think this would be an amazing idea to boost publicity.<br><br>Another way of Advertising could be through voting which leads me on to my next topic<br><br><br><b><u>Voting:<br></u></b><br>Voting is a great way to attract players who are actively seeking a server, because when ever I am looking for a server the first thing i type in to Google is "Minecraft Server" and subsequently tons of Minecraft server sites pop up and the server which is at the top has the most votes and the only I go to first is the server at the top. So simply the more votes we get the higher on website's lists we get meaning, MORE PLAYERS!<br><br>But at the moment hardly anyone is Voting the ways to fix this are simple;<br><br>Firstly, Increase the reward system so you are able to get more prizes, this will make more players vote as they know they will be rewarded.<br><br>Secondly, promote voting more, have broadcasts shouting "Vote now and get 500 credits" because i have been on Avicus for 3 years and I just only found out you could vote about a month ago!<br><br><br><b><u>Game Modes:<br></u></b><br>This topic will be short,<br><br>I&nbsp;believe that Avicus host a variety of unique game modes and i think they should advertise these as they could be seen as a USP (Unique Selling Point)<br><br>Definition of USP: &nbsp;(From TechTarget.com)<br><br><br>&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; ">A&nbsp;</span><b>unique selling</b><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; "><b>&nbsp;</b>proposition (</span><b>USP</b><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; ">, also seen as&nbsp;</span><b>unique selling poin</b>t<span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; ">) is a factor that differentiates a product from its competitors, such as the lowest cost, the highest quality or the first-ever product of its kind. A&nbsp;</span><b>USP</b><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; ">&nbsp;could be thought of as “what you have that competitors don't.”</span><br><br><br><b><u>Mods and Hacking:</u></b><br><br>I am going to be short but sweet here to avoid controversy.<br><br>Hacking is a big turn off no one likes hackers they ruin the game. &nbsp;Players now need something or someone to blame for the increase of hackers, of course they turn to the people who's role it is to get rid of these hackers. Now i understand Mods have lives, i have one too! (Contrary to popular belief) So what I suggest is a simple shift system, the admins work out who can cover when, make a graph then expect the Mod to turn up then, so what if they don't it doesn't really matter. Mods of course can turn up when they want the suggestion doesn't stop mods going on it just sets a time of when they are highly recommended to be on.<br><br>If you don't want to make a graph, collect the data and I will do it.<br><br>Again, no hate towards Mods/Sr Mods/Admins or anyone who helps at all. Its just a suggestions.<br><br><b>PS:</b> if you read anything in this topic that offends you it wasn't intentional as i tried to keep this as Un-Biased as possible, so please don't roast me in the comments. Thanks :)<br><br><b><u>Popularity of Minecraft:</u></b><br><br>This topic is more facts than suggestions it is just here to debunk any rumors or ideas,<br><br>In the last 24 hours (since this was written) there has been 7,400 downloads of Minecraft on PC/Mac and 25,254,042 downloads all <br>together but this is just PC/Mac there is also Console and pocket edition. Which i cant be asked to find the exact total of.<br><br>Anyway for anyone who thinks the servers popularity is going down as a result of Minecraft's popularity decrease i can assure you this is false as Minecraft does not have a "Popularity Decrease"<br><br><br><b><u>Conclusion:<br></u></b><br>I believe that the following topics should allow the popularity of Avicus to increase of course i'm sure you all have ideas (So comment them!) but this is just what i could think of. (Or be bothered to type up)&nbsp;<br><br>Anyways thank you for reading CONGRATULATIONS if you actually read it all!<br><br><br>Just to avoid beef with people, im going to say it officially:<br><br>THIS DOCUMENT WAS MADE FOR LIGHT READING (xD) NOT TO START ARGUMENTS, ALSO I'M SHIT AT COMEBACKS SO PLEASE DON'T ROAST ME.&nbsp;<br><br>There. Also i would like to point out that i have the greatest of respect for all staff Members and fellow players, thanks for reading.<br><br><br><br>Rockyyyyy

so apparently for staff to accept your complaint as valid, you need to write step-by-step instructions of what you think should be done about it. shouldn't it be the staff's job to look at complaints and figure out how to fix them instead of being lazy and demanding a fix with every complaint?

Well no.

Yes I get that there is a problem is moderators and the forums. Yes I get that there is a problem with some moderators overstepping their bounds. I get that one of our senior moderators hasn't been active for the course of 2017 and somehow still has his rank. What this post does instead of the other ones is that it does not point the blame to people. Yes I believe the fact that people should be hold accountable for their actions, but it becomes distracting when we are going on step one to try to figure out if it is a problem or not. Also, those topics really bring out a flame war that the staff have moderate instead of being part of the solution. In this, the staff and the community can easily jump in and give their thoughts and solutions without problems arising so easily.

I agree with some of your points, but when it comes to a shift system for staff, remember that we still try to play Minecraft to relax. I think it's a little much to require us to be on at a certain time, that's just not fun. We want to have fun on the server too, and I don't think mods will be happy with being forced on to the server. We volunteer our time, this isn't a job. Now, I'm not trying to dis you, I like your thought behind this and you've got some good initiative.

hmm rn (8:00 pm german time on saturday the 28th) there are 60 players online and 5 staff members online. Sometimes lack of staff can be a problem but mostly, its ok.

That's not what I am saying. I am saying that if we want to get anywhere, we need to think forward about the ideas we are sharing. As long as you aren't breaking the rules I don't really care what is posted and if there is a suggestion/concern, I usually am the one trying to get the most information out of it. This post is just easier for me and a lot of people to get useful information from.

We already do this! There have been internal complaints for a separate channel just to serve the purpose of communicating those messages because it "clogs" up moderator channels.
