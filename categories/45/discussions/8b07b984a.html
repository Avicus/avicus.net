Hi people,<br><br>I was wondering how you become a moderator on this server because it would look interesting to be one. It might look cool too. If you have any answers to me, please reply because it would be cool to try to be one.

To become a Moderator you first need to wait for applications to come around again and apply when they are there.

The staff applications closed about a week ago. <br>So you're going to have to wait to either be hand picked by the senior staff, or wait a few months before the staff apps open again.

As my two lovely junior moderators stated above, you will have to be accepted through the application process as they have stated above.<br><br>But have no fear, you can still be staff here! There are 2 other ways of becoming a staff member, they may be very rare but if you wow us you may have a chance.<br><br><b><i>Referrals:<br></i></b><br>The referral process is where a staff member can nominate you to all other staff members. All staff members will then vote deciding your acceptance, if positive - you will be given the junior mod rank and granted a trial. If it is declined it will be a secret and only staff members at that time will know!<br><br><i><b>Hand Picked:<br></b></i><br>Even though this method is very rare, it is used sometimes. This process happens when&nbsp;<u>only</u> admins vote on a certain player. I personally have never seen this method used but legend has it, it has been done before :}.<br><br>Well I hope this helped you enough that you are pretty aware of how to achieve staff!<br><br>Adios me amigo, I'll go ahead and lock this.<br><br>Regards,<br>Josh<br><br><b>Locking...</b>
