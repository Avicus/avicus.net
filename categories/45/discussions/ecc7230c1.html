Honestly getting mod helps because a lot of people notice your prefix as well as team speak. General suggestions not saying I'm popular

Well, I don't know how popular I am because I'm don't know what the community thinks of me. However, being an old MC Zone player and forumer helped a lot. Then getting Jr. Mod back in November, and then getting promoted to Mod a few weeks later. I'm also pretty active.

I wouldn't say im popular, but im well known. Team speak helps a lot to meet new poeple, &nbsp;so does the forums. I met a lot of people (liek the teamspeak crew) on teamspeak. Again i wouldnt say im popular, &nbsp;I would just say i know a lot of people and they know me

So u want to be "popular"?<br>For me the popularist (if that word exist) doesn't exist. Is just an invention of the humanity to make people better than others. This can be seen, for example, on Ranks. If a player got a thing that says he did something more important (like donating) to the server he gets more attentions and then become "popular". For me, everyone is popular only because we are humans ='3<br><br><u>Now, going more on topic</u>:<br>You don't need to be "popular" if you are already =3<br>You are very "popular" on forums!

- I used to be staff<br>- I was one of the few female moderators, in my time (When I first became mod, there was only 3-4)<br>- My name causes confusion^<br>- For a short amount of time, I had dealt the most punishments (or maybe second most, not 100% sure), out of the entire staff team (that was still around). I slowly got burnt out, thus I slowed down, lost that position, and eventually left. (Some of you may remember back when I filled up 2-3 pages of kicks in my first few hours.. in it's time, it was legendary.. Kinda).<br>-Being a major Mod Tryhard, on several different networks.<br>- I helped create a couple threads (2-3), that caused a lot of controversy.&nbsp;<br><br>I can't say that I am the most popular, but I do get a hello on every Nebula match I go on. xD
