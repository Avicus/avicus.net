Maybe it's because the bow is Snow's primary weapon, since he bowspams all the time ;)

As et said, the bow is my go to weapon. That's why it gets primary placement.<br>And having a bow and pick 1 slot away when I equip my sword is very efficient. &nbsp;<br><br>The food is on the other end so I don't have to fumble about when scrolling to try and find it. It's just one small "scroll" from my bow, easy and quick.

Well I guess it just goes by the players preference. xD I loved using the bow but every time that I would try it in first I would get rekted. Plus I didn't use the scroll wheel to select items just hotkeys on my mouse.

Yea, when I started putting the bow in first slot, I got rekt more than often but as I got used to it it was fine. <br>I'm so used to it now that if I have it the normal way with the bow in the second slot, I get smashed xD
