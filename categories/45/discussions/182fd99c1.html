Hey Avicus! This has always been one of my favorite Minecraft Servers ever since MCZONE! Some of you might remember a while back when I actually did some drawings for people. They were alright but it wasn't really anything much.<br><br>I now am trying to become a Graphic Designer because I've realised that I really enjoy doing it. I'm offering free Minecraft Avatars/Graphics for everyone on Avicus who wants some. I won't actually be taking the requests on here because it's hard to keep checking up (Sorry) But if you are interested please add me on skype: TheDiamondGecko<br><br>Also if you want to look at some of my artwork check out my Graphics Channel ~ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiGZgsyBcAhaRGgESpF6Fsw" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiGZgsyBcAhaRGgESpF6Fsw</a><br><br>Thanks Avicus! This is my way of paying the server back for al the fun times I've had &lt;3

She probably used Cinema 4D (To Make the 3D Text) and then Adobe After Effects (To add effects to the animated 3D Text). She uses various plugins to get the effect of the bounce, shake and many other effects to the video. If you want to learn how to use these effects, contact me and I will tell you how.
