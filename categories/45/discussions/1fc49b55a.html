Just change your password. Same thing happened to me and it worked after I changed it.

If you reset your password successfully and you still can't log in, it's a minecraft glitch. Just wait a few hours to a day and it will be fixed.&nbsp;<br>There have been many times people posted help for this and have had the same problem which was what I stated above.

Did you buy your account in the official Minecraft website or you bought it in pages like "Minecraft Full Access for 1 dollar"<br><br>If you bought your account from the official website, you should have the "Transaction ID" in your email, if you have that code you must send a message to support with that code so you will get your account back.<br><br>If you bought your account via the second way so you lost your account.

You can still recover your account without it, send an email to Mojang Suport and follow their instructions.<br>Good luck.
