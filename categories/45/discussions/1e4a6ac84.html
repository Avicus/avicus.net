I'm not leaving so chill xD<br><br>As many of you have noticed, I got demoted.<br>So I thought I'd talk about that today.<br><br>I was demoted for a number of reasons.<br>Inaccurate hack detection;<br>Rudeness, disrespect and arguing on the forums <br>Unsatisfactory&nbsp;forum moderating.<br>And possibly other reasons that I've missed.<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93mkaGoyqhw" rel="nofollow" title="Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93mkaGoyqhw">I guess I'll put this here, it might be easier than explaining everything in a big e</a>ssay..<br><br><i>( By the way, I'm laughing not because I'm finding anything funny, it's just what I do during conversations. I guess it's something I've always done. <br>I'm weird like that.</i><br><i>If you've talked to me on TeamSpeak you'd have probably already noticed that I laugh a lot so there you go xD )</i><br><br>I was demoted after being in the staff team for around 9 and a half months.<br><br>Promoted to Junior Moderator on <i>26/1/2015</i><br>Promoted to Moderator on <i>14/2/2015<br></i>Retired from Moderator on <i>28/9/2015<br></i>Returned to Moderator on <i>15/11/2015<br></i>Demoted from Moderator on <i>25/12/2015<br><br></i><p class="MsoNormal">It sucks to leave the staff team on a bad note via a demotion but that's life.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><br>I guess my&nbsp;stupid mouth caught up with me in the end. I was never one to just sit by and watch when something stupid happens.<br>I always spoke my mind to anyone about anything, I wasn't intimidated by anyone and put my reputation on the line multiple times to stand up for what (I thought at least) was right. I guess I should have learnt when it was appropriate to talk and when to just stay out of it xD<br><br>I've had a ton of ups and downs&nbsp;during my time as staff but it truly has been a fun ride and I've appreciated every single moment I've shared with everyone during my time as staff. I've learnt quite a bit.<br><br><br>I have no intention of re-joining the staff team in the foreseeable future.<br><br>Thanks for listening.</p>

Dude, do you really honestly think that anyone cares that you got demoted. You got demoted, deal with. This post is really a cry for attention and will only cause more drama. Also, you recorded a conversation that obviously wan't meant to be recorded and posted it for public view.&nbsp;<br>You got demoted, move on with life and don't create drama.

I made this thread so I wouldn't have to keep explaining myself over and over.<br><br>I published the video because it would be easier for people to listen to a conversation as opposed to listening to me babbling on any more than I have too. <br>I assume Para is fine with it, I didn't get his consent because it's about <i>my</i> demotion and as far as I'm aware, I give myself consent to publicise my demotion xD<br><br>Demotion threads have been allowed on the forums in the past.

Bullshit...<br><br>Snow was one of the only moderators who doesn't give a fuck, he stood up. He wasn't a moderator who hid in their hidey hole, just so they don't get demoted. Some of the reasons may be true, but you need more moderators like snow.

A cry for attention or a simple and honest explanation? There's a difference. For a moderator who worked to his best extent (but consequently not up to standards) for over 9 months to suddenly have his rank revoked can't just be left with no regards. <br><br>There's been other people explaining their own demotions and retirements before, but I haven't seen you making a post like this there.<br><br>Plus, this post saves having to explain what happened over and over for the next month. :P

I definitely agree with this, too. Voicing opinions should be done regardless of if your rank is at risk or not.. As long as it's kept sensible, of course.<br><br>@OP: You already know how I feel about this demotion so I'm just going to step up and say well done and good luck for the future! (:

Dude, do you really honestly think that anyone cares that you got demoted. You got demoted, deal with. This post is really a cry for attention and will only cause more drama.

Sorry to burst your bubble, but it doesn't take someone with perfect hack detection abilities to point out that another person has been&nbsp;<i>statistically</i> — Snow's probably rolling his eyes right now — proven not to have an ideal success rate with valid bans... falling below a certain standard is simply a fact. That's how criticism often works; the critic doesn't necessarily have to be the best at something to tell others that they're not doing well. I personally have no knowledge of the false bans Snow might have actually made, but if the senior staff determined that he wasn't up to par, then, well, so be it.<br><br>Hate to see you go, Snow... in the past, though your performance on the forums may have been questionable at times, you always managed to pull through in the end, but unfortunately that didn't happen this time (and on Christmas, too, what luckless and poor spirit). At least you were more active on the website in a day than I've been throughout my entirety as staff... I'll see you around.

</blockquote>
</div>
I didn't intend to sound biased. In any case, a demotion is still a penalization. "The infliction or imposition of a penalty as a retribution for an offense". There's many interpretations of how a punishment can be, but a demotion falls under that. I meant punishment in that case (And for a normal player...) by giving a forum warn/ban. A demotion serves it's corrective behavior enough. I, nor did the senior staff team, find it necessary to deal a forum punishment.

I honestly don't mind if people express their opinion. It's when people decide to flip out and throw endless insults at users/mods under useless cause that posts get locked/archived. I am perfectly fine with hearing people give feedback, that's what the seniors have been stressing with all these feedback spreadsheets, forum threads, teamspeak talks and questions in the community slack.

All those things are there for feedback. Whenever it doesn't suit the Senior Staff Team, they act all mature, stop it and don't listen. I personally think using 'act' is the right word as I thought you were mature and nice when you were a Senior Mod and then I saw the real version and god was I shocked.

Well I would rather not turn this whole thread into a flame war so I am going to state my opinion, do not get all fussy over my reply. I personally think you were a great mod Snow, you would always help me throughout my trial and was always a blast to talk to. I'm going to miss you on the staff team but at least I can see you otherwise. I hope you will re apply and maybe see you on the staff team again. Just act they way you acted around me and I think everyone will enjoy your positive attitude! Good luck if you ever apply and I can't wait to talk to you again &lt;33. ~Acceqted.<br><br>P.S. Your laugh is amazing!
