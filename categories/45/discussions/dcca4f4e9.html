<b>Period 1&nbsp;— Precalculus.</b> The only reason I haven't finished, say, AP Calculus (or something more advanced) by now is because I chose to stay in the lower math classes with all my struggling friends (and because I have no work ethic or motivation).<br><br><b>Period 2&nbsp;— AP Chemistry</b><b>.</b> At least stoichiometry — all we've really been doing lately — is easier than connecting concepts with each other in AP Environmental Science, which I took last year. How funny, people are already getting confused in this class...<br><br><b>Period 3&nbsp;— AP U.S. History</b><b>.</b> My teacher practically redefines "insane" and "senile". "Don't bet on the Indians, because the Indians always lose." That's literally how he summarized the first few chapters of our textbook. Even so, that's the most sensible thing we've ever heard from him.<br><br><b>Period 4&nbsp;— Advanced Orchestra.</b> Really wishing I was concertmaster (the "best" violinist of the orchestra who gets to sit in the first, foremost chair), but my potentially biased teacher — as cool of a guy as he otherwise is — seated me behind all the callow Asian freshmen (no racism intended) just because they take private lessons...<br><br><b>Period 5&nbsp;— AP English.</b>&nbsp;Essentially nothing more than writing impromptu essays and memorizing vocabulary words for weekly quizzes. I would've transferred out by now if I hadn't been forced by my academy to take this class... and if there weren't a couple eye-catching girls here too...<br><br><b>Period 6&nbsp;— Ceramics.</b>&nbsp;My school closed all AP Computer Science classes for no apparent reason, and this is where most of the people I know flocked to. So far, it's been very liberating; you can take the period off and the teacher wouldn't mind.

Basically, a period is a class, each period usually lasts 45 mins to 2 hours. Each period has different subjects (like science, language arts, etc), different teachers, and classes and teachers. I have school from 8:50 to 3:20, but my bus comes around 8:17. A day lasts 6-8 hours, but occasionally you will have 2 hour early dismissals.

a period is a class, such as math or science, and at my school we have 9 periods (lunch being one of those periods), and they are 45 minutes each and we have 4 minute passing periods (time to get to each class) which sucks, I have to run from 4th to 5th period .-. I have school from 8:30 am-3:47 pm, no idea why they decided to end it at 3:47 xD.
