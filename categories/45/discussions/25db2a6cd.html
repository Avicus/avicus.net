Ok so maybe for the teams of the avicus community, there could be like a suffix tag for your team. Then, people could be recognized for their team and stuff.<br>Example: Murphh[Home]<br><br>ALSO<br><br>TO GET A TAG possibly every 5 coins(on regular avicus) could be equal to 1 "Team Coin" and you need 5,000 "Team Coins" to get a team name tag for your team.&nbsp;<br><br>Only the team leader(s) can change/edit the team tag<br>team tags can be up to 6 characters long<br>the tag would only show up on "tab".<br>anything else comment down below

I think it's a pretty cool idea. Glad you came up with it, but their is already to many prefixes adding another one would make it messier.

Like the idea, however it will most likely take the devs a good chunk of time to do this and there really isn't a need. Focus shouldn't be on things that aren't needed but that things that are needed like 1.7 CTF support. Plus the fact that I don't believe it will work in 1.7 does not help since a bit of the players still use 1.7.

+0.5<br><br>The team tag shouldn't be different from the team tag in the team page which you use to invite teams.<br>The developers could add a new a new option at /settings to enable/disable the feature. It should be disabled by default, because most (new) players which aren't competitive don't care about teams and stuff, and they won't be confused if it was disabled by default.

Nice idea but like everyone said, on tab it would be too messy. Maybe for tourneys?&nbsp;<br>+1 hasl
