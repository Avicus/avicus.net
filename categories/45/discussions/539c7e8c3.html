So, earlier on I was comparing 1.8 and 1.7 and here are the differences I found:<br>- Enchantment glint is more visible in 1.8.<br>- Potion bottle caps are enchanted on 1.8.<br>- One can get higher FPS on 1.8 if they are using Java 64 bit.<br>- On 1.8 the player's skin goes red when hit while on 1.7 the player's armour goes red when hit.<br>- Blockhitting is visually different.<br>I may have forgotten a few..<br>What differences have you noticed?

<p>1.8 stuff</p><ul><li>knockback</li><li>offset players</li><li>hit detection</li><li>enchanting in general </li><li>block hitting yes looks different, but seems to also not be as effective as before</li><li>servers have block lag</li></ul><p>Personally for me, 1 last thing is that the f3 screen says I have 10 fps more than in 1.7, yet the screen seems like its running with 30 less fps, maybe just me but yea, also more screen freezes and lag spikes</p>

The only thing that actually bothers me is how the inventory shifts when all your potion effects run out. I've lost so much wood like that because of the spawn protection effects.
