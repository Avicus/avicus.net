and people who team spleef in other games get kicked and transported to spleef &nbsp;right as they team spleef xD no jk that would be horrible especially if someone accidentally spleefed someone<br>plus avicus hates spleef but i like spleef xD i use to play it on servers all the time with a huge amount of people playing &nbsp;<br>this probably should be in game discussion but i will go off topic now<br><br>WHO LIKES CAKE ????? &nbsp;:D<br><br>no?<br><br>ok.......

When you say Avicus one would normally mean the whole community but when you say "Avicus doesn't like spleef" that becomes an incorrect statement because I like spleef, I actually love running around trying to break blocks under people, besides how pointless it seems.

The OP confused me, but I'll base my reply on the title.<br>Unless FunkyIvy can code a unique spleef minigame from normal spleef, I doubt that spleef will ever see its face as a minigame on Avicus. I wouldn't mind spleef being added in, however.

I think it should be added because it will attract more players and donates and it's just fun

i meant by the rules or who ever came up with the game ideas not the people cause if i meant people then it would be still incorrect cause i love spleef too i meant in games and ideas to add in avicus they suggest no grief or breaking blocks

It will be "fun", I mean the reaction of the spleefer, getting randomly teleported to another minigame, is autospleefing a part of that?

You could add it in avicade. Many games in avicade aren't unique so that wouldn't be the problem and you yould add something.
