ok I don't know why but I'm getting this random ideas for the server that are rlly cool.<br><br>Ok so I'm pretty sure that almost everyone knows wat /nick used to do on OCN, so I think that it would be pretty cool to have it on Avicus too for Medias and Staffs. Since I saw a post recently about staffs using Alts so they can play without anyone knowing that there is a staff playing, so this could make things easier so let's say there is a cheater that u are not sure about if he is hacking so u join the server and u can use /nick so now u have a random name or somehing so anyone can see the MOD prefix on ur name and shit like that it would be cool to have it.<br><br>BTW I know that my examples are rlly bad if u have another example for this suggestion put it in ^^

I'm pretty sure if they really wanted this it be a feature, it would already be a feature, condsidering how often it is discussed. That or the staff don't care enough to push for it.

shouldn't be abused, and if it gets abused the staff member should be demoted. if you can't implement features for your staff because you don't trust them, the problem is in the staff

I think it's a cool idea so the hackers won't toggle when they see a mod join.

I'm not saying the staff is the problem, by let me give you an example on staff abuse.<br><br>Scrim servers: If your team finished scrimming a team with mods in, and the other team which is holding the server, asks them to leave. I'm talking from experience now, they are not leaving for like 5 - 10 min later just because you can't kick them.
