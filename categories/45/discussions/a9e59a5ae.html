Is TCP No delay allowed, it improves ping and was made by Kohi. It's only required for 1.8 (which I use).<br><br>If it is allowed, am I also allowed to edit my injectable client (which Posighdun gave me permission to use on Avicus as it adds toggle sprint only) to add the same feature as TCP No delay using JVM Instrumentation (basically I would edit the network manager using Javassist and bytecode manipulation)?

Idk, but I don't think it should be allowed, not only does it improve ping but it modifies your knock back by reducing horizontal and adding on vertical(which means an extra crit) because of the messed up nature's of MC.... &nbsp;It's unfair

In 1.8.8, Mojang changed it so that TCP No delay is true (so it does the same as the mod), so in theory, people w/ 1.8.8 has a bigger advantage than those with 1.8

Yes, I am using agents. The reason why I don't want to use 1.8 BSM is a) it doesn't work b) i've been told it counts as a hack as it changes packets (where as my client uses reflection to set sprinting to true). I also don't want to use LabyMod because it collects your Minecraft session and username (so the LabyMod owners can log in to your account), uploads and downloads files without your permission.<br><br>And I'm too lazy to update my mappings to 1.8.8, and I've made injectable clients before, so I know how JVM instrumentation works. I'll probably update it later though.<br><br>P.S: Speaking about LabyMod, should this thread be bumped?&nbsp;<a href="https://avicus.net/forums/discussions/eb11b90b2" title="Link: https://avicus.net/forums/discussions/eb11b90b2">https://avicus.net/forums/discussions/eb11b90b2</a>

Here's what I recommend.<br><br>Either read the rules a lot, pm a staff member or just do it. I use 1.8.8 and no one has seen a difference.<br><br>EDIT: Didn't specify. Do this when you have a question similar to this one because you seem to have a lot xd.

Apparently some people's pings went from 150 - 180 to 110 - 140 on other servers by using this mod.

Yeah well in this case it's fine because 1.8 is 1.8.8 as well.

The word "client" in general is usually associated with "hacked clients" and the fact that it is "injectable" makes people suspicious because why would you make it injectable unless you wanted to hide something. (not calling you out or anything. Just saying)

It doesn't improve ping, it improves your latency. It's the same as regedit basically, so it should be allowed.&nbsp;<br><br>Explaination if you want to read it: <br><br>Basically ping is how long it takes packets of information to reach the server. It takes the same time, but with TCPNoDelay mod and regedit it sends the packet instantly instead of having a bit of a delay before it sends, improving your latency.

Yeah. But I've made previous injectable clients and sold them to people, so I just took one of my simplest ones, removed all the hacks, but one (Sprint) and then I just use that. I can give it to admins to show proof that there are no hacks.
