It isn't that hard combining them, you just need to open both texture pack files and replace folders or parts of the folders with the other texture pack

Well, if you look inside a texture pack's files, you'll see a multitude of folders that hold the textures. The "textures" folder will hold all the textures for mobs, items, GUI, etc.<br><br>If you take the tile 'diamond_sword.png' from one texture pack and put it in another texture pack, that diamond sword will appear in the texture pack you put it in.<br><br>It's really not that complicated once you play around with it. I'll give more info later since I gtg to school, if I can.
