Thank those "feminists" &nbsp;on websites like Tumblr that feel oppressed when a man spreads his leg while sitting and call rape when someone did a quick glance on them.It should be about equality but they are just making it unfair for man now

how sad.. boys are getting butthurt when they get shit for glancing at a women while there are women who are being raped, abused, and even killed by boys. how very sad. how could women be so ignorant? even after the many documented reports there are that share the horrifying details. women should stop being so afraid of boys.&nbsp;<br><br>you disgust me goodbye

I am not saying that that is a good thing. Rape is disgusting and very very bad. What I am talking about is woman just randomly saying that someone is raping them cause he did a glance. How bad must real rape victims feel? The horrible thing they experienced is getting made equal to someone starring at you?! I am against oppressing woman but what some of those feminists are doing is oppressing men. So can we please work on making everyone equal and not try oppressing anyone?

Ik but the ones that do are the ones that you hear the most about and they are the ones ruining it for everyone&nbsp;<br><br>@X0X0 the glance itself shouldn't be considered rape though . If someone got very bad experiences with it and has got some kind of trauma then ofc it's bad and that person should go to a therapist and help herself, cause that is something that happens everyday. let's get back on topic :x

When you take a word and do things in the word's name and do the complete opposite of what that word means, it loses or changes it's meaning.<br><br>And if you actually are for the equality of the people, not just based on gender, there's a term for &nbsp;it. It's called egalitarianism.

We celebrated it on Friday.<br><br>Our bell was changed to "Love is in the Air.", a basket of roses was attached to some of the major fans (the roses went EVERYWHERE). There were pickup lines with the Year 12 student's faces on the, e.g "I dont care about you, just give me the money." We had some of the prefects run around in pink and giving out roses, then playing some weird pop love songs on a Beats speaker.<br><br>.-.
