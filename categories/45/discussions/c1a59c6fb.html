If you can't be bothered reading all of this, I'm basically quitting so ya.&nbsp;<br><br>I found this server about 3 years ago after getting permanently banned on Project Ares (ocn) for combat logging. I searched for a Destroy The Monument server since that was basically the only gamemode I enjoyed playing at that time. Luckily I found this server called Avicus. I think I got into the community about 2 years ago, when I was using the account "adrianosborne". Back then, the server had hundreds of people online, and it was actually enjoyable. After quite a while, I got into the team "Storm Chasers II" (ily marius), and later on Bad Company. Bad Company was problably the best thing for me on this server. But later, BC disbanded, and some of my best friends left the server, and it became boring.<br><br>I was promoted to junior moderator after tryharding for like 5 months. Soon after that, I got promoted to Mod, Official, and also Map Developer. Having 3 ranks at the same time was stressing for me. I spent basically all my spare time on this server. I am actually happy that I joined the staff team, especially when Jozz and Mango were admins.&nbsp;<br><br>After about 6 months as a moderator, Sessp promoted me to Senior and then, everything got worse and worse. Avicus started to get boring, since I did not have alot of time actually playing.&nbsp;<br><br>After the Atlas Update, I barely even played public anymore. For me, the server was basically dead. The only thing that made me stay was the tournaments. But as I said, after Atlas, there was no point in playing anymore. It just felt like a waste of time.<br><br>I could write alot more, but I just want to thank a few people:<br><br><b>Eric</b>: We've had our up's and down's. You were one of the first people that I started to talk with. We had alot of fun together, talking in teamspeak and just hanging around. Thanks for always being there for me.<br><b>Barney &amp; Ciaran:</b> Thank you Barney for letting me into Bad Company. I remember I was kinda shy in the beginning, but I later got to know both you guys better. Being in Bad Company was amazing, and I'm just so happy that I got to know you both. Thank you.<br><b>Tazz</b>: We started to hang out alot when you joined Bad Company back in the good ol' days. We had some good times together in the staff team, but then, we started to talk less than we used to. I haven't talked to you in a while, but I still love ya. Thank you.<br><b>Budah</b>: You're problably one of my best friends ever on here. You were always online on teamspeak when I was, we had some good laughs together. I got to know you better when I joined the staff team and it actually was a pleasure talking with you. You later joined Grim on OCN and we started to talk less. Thank you for being a good friend Budah :)<br><b>Lego</b>: Basically same thing as what I said about Budah. And thanks for letting me join Apollo.&nbsp;<br><b>Apollo</b>: &nbsp;Even though I did not play a single tournament match, I still had some good times with you guys. Thanks to everyone that were part of the team.<br><b>Spooks</b>: I haven't known you for long, but I still had fun playing with you, both on OCN and Avicus.<br><b>Zac (wtf)</b>: I thought you were a retard when you got teamspeak developer. I fucking hated you lol. But after we sorted out a few things, I actually got to know you. We had some interesting conversations on teamspeak, and it was overall funny to talk with you. (btw, yokes)<br><br>I problably have missed someone but who cares.<br>Thanks Avicus.&nbsp;<br><br>(btw, nice tournament officials ;))))

It's supposedly fine because it's on topic, especially on leaving posts like these.<br>But I've see quite a bit of inconsistency with this rule, so it might end up being locked anyway
