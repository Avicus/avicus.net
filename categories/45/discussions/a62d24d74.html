Lawl, you gotta understand that K/D doesn't mean shit, the only people who care/judge people over K/D are inconsiderate and aren't smart enough to judge from skill level.<br><br>Abd to whoever said he had an OP ping it's about 180ms

So, if we think as you do, he is good because he can combo with soup? No offence, but lol! xD

So you judge players by how many times they can combo? It doesn't make any sense my friend. If you can't kill your opponent, you are not OP. He just runs around hitting his opponent with soup and everybody is "Wow, so OP".

Nah not really. Just trying to get it into your head that being a statwhore doesn't make you good since you always brag about your k/d which doesn't mean shit.

Lol! xD I never cared about my kd, I played to get prestige in shortest time possible, I never had to prove anything. It's fun braging about my stats and K/D when kids like you get offended and attack me like I would give a f. I think you are a nobody IRL, you don't really have any friends or a life outside of internet and when someone on Minecraft or even internet doesn't agree with you, you get offended and your whole life ends. You are a joke my friend, a real joke. :) (Idgaf about your minecraft friends either, which I know will attack me too.)
