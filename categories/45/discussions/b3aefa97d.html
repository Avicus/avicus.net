I think at this rate I've released the most maps on the network, and I've been staff about 2 years as well if that counts as anything. Also I win the record for only demoted admin and most bugged user (name used to change colors in-game, my punishments got wiped, I always have strange bugs happening to me and nobody else, my username ParaSpider used to go lowercase on the site.)
