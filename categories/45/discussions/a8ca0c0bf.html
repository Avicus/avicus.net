A long time ago when I created my old account, I wrote down my passwords. Then I seriously needed my account back after "hacker" had been giving out so much hate. As any normal person I contacted the Skype Team, I had my old accounts settings for visual proof and gave them to the Skype Team. 20 min. passed and I got a response saying that the Skype Team is going to reset my account back to Factory Settings, so I could sign in with my old information. They proceeded, and told me to reset my password. I did. After that conundrum, I finally got access to my account! As for the "hacker", I know you're on Avicus, and yes we've narrowed down a suspect that maybe responsible for this action of matter. It really got me disappointed that some player has so much hatred towards me, that they would have to hack my account to say this foul context to prove a point of hating me. I'd rather have you talk about it with me, rather than having the whole Avicus Community turn against me. If you have a problem with me, tell me. How would I ever know what to fix if you never tell me? Right? As for the Skype Team, they stated directly that they can't give an IP out to public, so they couldn't give it to me.. Anyway I'm just really disappointed that I would have to struggle just to get back in my own account, just because someone hates me. As far from that, I said what needed to be said. Thanks Everyone so much for helping, it really shows how generous this community it.
