Hello everyone! I apologize for not being active in the forums, and on the server. I am currently on a sick leave, because I caught a fever. Anyways, let's stay on topic, shall we? <br><br>I have browsed on the internet for MCPE Master for iOS, because I saw lots of my friends playing with it at school. Of course they were using either Samsung S5, Samsung J5, etc. Then I thought of this. Maybe I should ask you guys this question: Do you by any chance know where I can get that? I really want it, and I am trying to find it but I was wondering if you guys can give me any clues, or hints as to where it is to be found. If you can't, I won't blame you because it is not your fault. Your help will be GREATLY appreciated. Thank you very much, I hope you guys have a nice day, bye! (I might come back from being AFK and play with you guys! YAY!)

It's only availible through Google play for Samsung phones because ios doesn't allow as much modification of files as samsung.

That kinda sucks to be honest....thanks for the help though! I am pretty sure that they will make another MCPE launcher like MCPE Master for iOS very soon. It is possible that it will have better features than that! ;)
