It's alright. Don't take my opinion too seriously though, since I'm more of a fan of music like <a href="https://youtu.be/lru6-J7uQjo">https://youtu.be/lru6-J7uQjo</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/vx2u5uUu3DE">https://youtu.be/vx2u5uUu3DE</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/pzYfLBN0yxQ">https://youtu.be/pzYfLBN0yxQ</a>, so that kind of music doesn't really appeal to me.

I like the Beesting one better. However... get rid of the Sans part, it threw off the song a bit and took me by surprise.<br><br>All in all, good music you have here but it'll be better if it didn't have that part. Didn't fit in at all in my opinion.

I also have a music suggestion&nbsp;<b>(Not sure how these things work)<br><br></b>If you can make a dubstepish song that sounds like a roaming band of tanks going to a large battle then that'd be awesome.<br><b><br>Just... do it if you can... Got have those rolling tones... glides along your skin and you can&nbsp;<i>feel it&nbsp;</i>through out your body...<br><br>Imagine the gun shots and the tank's cannons going&nbsp;<i>*KERPOOO-WEEAHOWOOHHhhhhhh!*&nbsp;<br><br></i></b><i></i><b>*Cough*</b> Sorry... I play a lot of War Thunder...&nbsp;<br><b><i><br></i></b>If I'm asking for too much then that's fine XD<b><i><br></i></b>

Hi, thank you for the suggestion! I'll try to make things flow better as yeah... that part was a bit off.<br><br>@_Distraction_ I'm saving up to buy something good right now, as music interests me, but for now I'm using some free software on Linux: Linux Multimedia Studio and sometimes muse. They are really good in my opinion and honestly much better than some paid ones (I dual boot solely for these two applications).<br><br>@Zintenka I'll try to! Will post it (if) when done.

Feedback: Learn MIXING!!!!!!<br><br>The most important thing about music production (in my stand point) is mixing. There are a ton of tutorials that can help you. Speaking DAW's (Digital Audio Workstation), which one interests you the most? I know you're using a free one that comes with Linux, but there are way to many and some are more complicated than others. I suggest going with FL Studios 12. Others might disagree with me and say "FL Studios is not easier than Ableton". Trust me, that's a lie, especially since you're a beginner. The clipping in both of those songs are terrifying i guess. But you're a beginner, so it's okay. Message me if you need anything! My skype is: google_processing
