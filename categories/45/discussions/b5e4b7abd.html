So basically, I need a decent laptop for my school work, that I can actually take to school without having to have a pickup truck... I'll do normal/intense tasks such as working on<b> music producing, programming, editing, light gaming, actual school work, etc.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;I never really actually used a laptop for the past like 2 years, and <u>I cannot be bothered to go out and research all the laptops that are out there.</u><br><br>So if you have any suggestions please let me know, and if possible achieve these requirements:<br><br>- Budget: ~$600-800<br>- Windows 8.1 / 7 (Maybe 10)<br>- Either an i5 or i7 (6th gen preferably) would do.<br>- No graphics card really needed, but if there is one that's fine.<br>- 12-16GB of Memory<br>- Have a nice display (15 inch [38.1 cm] or more)<br>- At least 2 USB 3.0 and maybe 1 USB 2.0<br>- Decent keyboard, honestly It doesn't really matter.<br>- Should be able to run FL Studio 12, Eclipse, Adobe After Effects, and light games.<br><br>Thanks! :)

To get those specs you will probably have to go way over $800.

I recommend just saving up some more, and getting a laptop with a decent processor and inter grated graphics, and then buy an external GPU Dock. It will cost a lot but you can basically have a PC in a laptop for around 1300$

Don't need a GPU dock<br>I just need a PC that can run the applications decently.<br>And I kind of want it fast... I need to do a few projects in class, but I honestly can't stand the macs that we have...<br>(Also, I'm so restricted to those macs, it's impossible to do anything on them, with a laptop I can have everything and anything i need.)<br>Again, I don't want to haul around 3 tons worth of technology in my backpack.<br>An i5 will do the job and I don't need that good of a graphics card, Actually I don't need it, since I'll only be playing games like osu! or chess, idk.

If your purely for work and very, very light gaming this will do the trick:<br><br><a href="http://www.triobest.com/5-best-laptops-under-700-dollars/">http://www.triobest.com/5-best-laptops-under-700-dollars/</a><br><br>Any of these will work. Obviously get an external drive with some as you'll need more HDD space.
