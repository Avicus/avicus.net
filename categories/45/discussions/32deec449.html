Ok, so I have changed this post into a retirement post so I don't have to create a new one and create spam.<br>&nbsp;<br>So since I decided to quit I was thinking I could still help the Build Team out through other ways.<br><br>But I can't really help build or do anything really so I have decided to step down and have someone else take my place because Avicus has so many amazing people they could do anything.<br><br>I'd like to thank The entire build team for accepting me into the group. That was the first Avicus group I was ever really apart of because in my mind I thought that everyone from Avicus hated me....<br><br>I met some really cool people from that group, and I'm glad I applied or I wouldn't have ever met Dawning ,Kyler , Jahaj and many others.<br><br>So this is just me thanking you guys :D<br><br>Love ya Lots &lt;3

You could just change your forum password. You can still do that while being banned.
