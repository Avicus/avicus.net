I'm pretty sure the mod is allowed on Avicus.<br>It was created by the GommeHD (famous german server) devs.<br>The mod doesn't give any more information away than a vanilla client.<br>Although you have to disable the damage indicator option since that is not allowed.

If you can't break a block with a bow charged, if you can't punch the ground when drinking potions, can you hit while blocking? Is it really just the animation that changed?

Actually contrary to what Flo said earlier, the staff team has outlawed any mod packs that contained any illegal mod whatsoever, even if it can be turned on or off because we have no idea if you do have it turned off. So unfortunately, this is <b>not </b>a legal pack on Avicus. Maybe if you could find a version that didn't have the damage indicator mod, then it would be fine, but it is not as of now.

The actual mod it self is fine, but they added this damage indicator component to the mod, which would make it illegal, as the indicator gives unfair advantages to the players using this mod. Its encouraged not to use this mod period, even if you remove the indicator component, as staff really have no way of actually knowing that you have it off or not.<br><br>I'm not even sure if you actually can remove it from the mod itself.

What advantage does damage indicators give? And how does a staff member tell if you are using the mod which changes the animation?
