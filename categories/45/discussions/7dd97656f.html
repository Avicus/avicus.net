Why hello there, everyone.<br><br>Just figured after quite some time being away, I'd hop on in and see how everything's going around here. Seems to be in line, and I'm seeing very many new faces on the staff team. Changed a lot, hm?<br><br>Well anywho, whoever decides to respond to this; could you give me a brief description as to how Avicus is doing? Also, AMA if you so please. I'll be willing to answer some questions if you've got any up the wazoo.<br><br>-Jake

Oh, you know. I've been venturing off into the world of life. Now I'm trying to find a new job with a decent pay; while finding time to spend with my girlfriend. It's been average, lately.

Ahh Jake buddy!<br>What's up? It's Evocal :')<br>Glad to see you're doing great! Things have been quite enjoyable around here. As for what I've been doing, I have cleaned up the Map Repository quite a bit, as well as messed around with rotations haha.<br>There's Senior Moderator interviews happening now, and we're in middle of a Tournament as well! Recently we had a Staff Meeting and a lot of things were discussed, too.<br>As for me, I've been trying to keep my grades high at school (Since I don't live in the USA I get Winter Break that ranges from February to May (In my case I got out of school February 13 and got back in May 11, but it really depends haha).<br>How have you been buddy?
