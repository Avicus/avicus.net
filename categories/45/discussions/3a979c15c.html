Hey guys, if you've noticed i havent been around for afew days lately and i have a few reasons for it...<br><br>Im on my last year of highschool and ive been trying my classes to get my grades up, especially that my 1st qtr will be my basis for my college entrance exams, which im also studying for, together with filing my college applications.<br><br>But the other reason is out of stupidity... was about to get off after scrimming w/ Cronus last friday and then out of "cuz y dafuq not" i decided to go play on hypixel, knowing me and my laptop, the fps i get from the builds on the lobbies of their server kills my minecraft and strains my laptop, yet i still went on to try play some SpeedUHC, afew games later, well... you could guess what happened, and cuz of the extreme amount of lag and frustration from dying repeatedly after afew games due to fps lag/freezes, instead of me just walking away and going to sleep or watch anime, i smacked top of my laptop (especially at the part where i totally forgot at the time of my rage, the graphics card was at, gj toby, you played yourself)<br><br>*this also caused my laptop to begin experiencing slow startups and sometimes crashing some of my apps at random, especially minecraft since its launching time takes way longer than usual or it doesnt launch and just crashes<br><br>Right now im considering whether to try and fix it the problem on my own, or tell my parents to try get it fixed without making it a problem for them, because tbh my parents are really strict about taking care of the laptop since its the only one we can use in the family during the weekdays, knowing that im definitely sure they wont allow me to get it replaced sooner or later.<br><br>For now ill just be focusing on finishing my exams this week which were delayed since last week due to heavy rainfall in our country over the month, and as well as getting prep'd for college exams as well! Ill try my best to get on ts and skype or ask my dad to use his laptop which would probs run me on low fps but its atleast something.<br><br>Later for now i guess :^/
