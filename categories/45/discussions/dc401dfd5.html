Gold and Emerald used to be unlimited in terms of time periods but now gold has a 3 month limit and Emerald has a 6 month limit.

If your gonna buy a rank get diamond. Every rank is a waste but if you really want one diamond is the way to go, more perks &amp; you pay less money after a year.

The other ranks aren't a waste.<br>If you want to financially support the server, then buying a temporary rank is a good way of doing that.

If you bought Gold and Emerald before the Omega Update (I think), it's infinite. Anything bought after is 3months and 6months respectively.

If you're a regular and are planning to play for a long time, Diamond logically is the best. It has the best perks, and it lasts forever

Right ok, you got 100 donators at the time of your post, 200 on Monday and about 150 on the weekend? Playing server doesn't mean you support it lol, especially considering a bunch of those players probably just left and will never come back

...<br><br>I was last on the server a few days ago, that doesn't mean I support the server. Avicus is crap and so is MC. Some people may play on it because they're bored and they have nothing else to do, but I was in a scrimmage.
