I just finished watching the semi finals and WB just managed to win over GWS. That means the Western Bulldogs will verse Sydney Swans in the grand final. Who do you think will win? Swans? or Bulldogs?<br><br>I hope Bulldogs but Swans have been playing some good football so I wouldn't be surprised if they win.&nbsp;<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Football = Australian Football :&gt;

I reckon the Bulldogs will win just from their intensity, Swans have no chance.

I don't really watch the AFL that much, I like the NRL (another Aussie football sport) so please don't kill me. But from what I've heard, the Swans aren't doing terrible.

Western Bulldogs will fucking destroy them. They were "underdogs" (no pun intended) for the whole finals series. It's also interesting that they won 3 away games, and now they're playing the Grand at home.<br><br>Sydney's power comes from about 4 or 5 players such as Luke Parker, Dan Hannebery and Lance Franklin, and they have Aliir ruled out.<br><br>Western Bulldogs, however, are without a ruckman, as Jordan Roughead got ruled out with a fractured eye socket.<br><br>This is coming from a Hawthorn supporter, and I'm pleased we lost to them. Go Western Bulldogs!

I don't know,<br><br>Don't get me wrong they won Eagles by a good margin but like Hawk margin was decent but towards the end they started to get tired and what not and their performance decreased. As for the GWS vs Bulldogs, I'm going to be completely honest here, that could have gone either way. The first few minutes they played really really well but the rest of the time I was literally on the edge of my seat yelling at the tv. They missed so many opportunities and to be honest I thought GWS were going to take it, they were playing so shit compared to the previous weeks. And at the same time Swans hammered Cats so that's why I'm a bit uncertain and from the looks of things the Bulldogs only managed to just beat them in round 15 in the dying seconds&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnLwAJWvjWs" title="Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnLwAJWvjWs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnLwAJWvjWs</a><br><br>I mean I still think there is a good chance they could win, I hope they do, but that's just something to think about. I personally think it's pretty even steven, and either one of them&nbsp;can win it.
