Most players on Avicus use these two very good things for Pvp "upgrades" or non-hacking modifications used for pvp, These include, ArmorStatusHUD and ToggleSprint, and many more, But..Which is the better?<br><br><b>In this thread, I will be giving the Ups, and Downs and ultimately, which one you should use, No, i will not be bias against these two as I use both of them.<br></b><br><b>Lez start with what is Labymod and what is Forge,</b><br>Labymod is a all in one Mod pack that features very useful features into the game such as the pvp modifications i've listed above which are togglesprint and all that jazz, It also features 1.7 animations, which makes it a very top dog in pvp modpacks It also &nbsp;already has mods preinstalled like Optifine and Togglesneak, It's really good for noobies that don't know how to get pvp mods without doing some complicated stuff and all that, Labymod has about 13-14 mods, Labymod currently supports 1.8.8+&nbsp;<br><br>Forge is a modding api used to make modding quite easier, as all you do is install a mod and drag it into the .mods folder on your .minecraft after you install Forge, But, forge by itself doesn't do much, but if you add mods into it, It can be very powerful! You can even add the original labymod mods and ADD EVEN MORE! I dont think theres no limit to the amount of mods you can have, Plus it supports all versions of minecraft dating back to version 1.1.&nbsp;<br><b><br></b><br><b><u>Mods,</u></b><br>Labymod includes&nbsp;<br>Optifine+Shaders<br>ToggleSprint<br>ItemPhysics(Makes item dropping look 3d)<br>Resourcepack24(Makes getting resourcepacks ALOT EASIER)<br>Betterhat(A mod that allows you to add stuff like hats to ur avatar ingame and other peeps can see it)<br>BattyCoords(SUPER DUPER USEFUL)<br>DirectionHUD<br>WorldEdit CUI(Idk wut it does but its for worldedit)<br>AccountManager(I dont think you should trust but eh)<br>DamageIndicator<br>XaerosMinimap(good for HCF i guess?)<br>KeystrokesMod<br>SettingsProfile(??)<br>PixelCam(???)<br><br><b>Now this is very inportant if you want to have forge mods, I repeat, DONT download from untrusty sources, Download from things like MinecraftForum and others, I know you can find bkpkr's mods(Armor,Effect,DirectionHUD on minecraftforums and&nbsp;<br>Toggle sneak on the hcfactions subreddit, This is a weakness for forge as some mods could have backdoor trojans and malicious&nbsp;things, Please scan with your antivirus just in case, If you want, you can install my 1.8 Modpack which is here<br><a href="https://avicus.net/forums/discussions/a1e564431">https://avicus.net/forums/discussions/a1e564431</a><br>As far as I can tell, I've never had a problem with that modpack, please contact me if you find a issue,&nbsp;<br><br>Also with Forge, you can add LiteLoader to it, which means you can get waypoints and thats very good for HCF :D You can get more pvp mods with forge, plus you can get those cool rainbow mods lool :D<br><br>Ultimately, I would choose...Labymod as the winner, Labymod is much more safer then Forge and is much more simpler&nbsp;and has very cool mods,<br><br>Anyways,<br><br>CLICKN OUT<br><br><br></b>

So Forge basically is a minecraft mod that enables other mods to implement things without editing the vanilla code directly. Because all the Forge Mods then use the same Methods etc. from Forge, the Mods won't crash each other so easily. Buut if you have a Dedicated Server which hasnt installed certain Mods that for example add things to the game, that won't work and you probably wont be able to join. So I think you can't really compare those two, as LabyMod was especially created for Multiplayer Servers. Thats why Labymod probably is a better choice for pvp
