Helloo ^-^<br><br>My schedule has gotten extremely busy lately due to extracurricular activities and school has been stressful for me. So, unfortunately after a long period of contemplation (not a lot actually, since I don't have time for that apparently due to school), I have decided to step down from my moderator position... (Not referee however, so you'll still be seeing me around from time to time).&nbsp;<div><br>Thank you everyone on the staff team for helping me develop into a more confident, smarter (debatable, I know), and happier person. You guys are doing a great job and please continue to work your hardest.<br><br>Stay positive everyone c;&nbsp;<br><br></div>

Noooo Jess! :'(<br><br>Thanks for the time and effort you've put into Avicus and making the server even better. You were easily one of the personalities of the staff team, and the convos on TS were hilarious. Hop on from time to time.<br><br>Good luck with school. &lt;3

Thank you for being there (2x) during my Moderator trials. <br><br>I remember back in the early days of Avicus where almost all the moderators would act robotic and non-approachable, you were not one of those moderators and I commend you for that.

Jess, you were honestly one of the reasons I wanted to rejoin the staff team. You were a huge role model since day one and I've had so many memories with you, please stay in touch.&nbsp;<br><br>P.S. Barbie needs to be yelled at sometime

Thank you jess for everything you've done for the staff team and I. Thanks for being so nice, but yet sassy at times when I talked to you at times xD. Thank you for helping me out during my trial when I was Junior Moderator.

Awe dang Jess, hope you come back at some point when you find more spare time in your life. Good choice that you put real life tasks first for a while. But trust me though, you won't be able to stay away permanently. I tried leaving a few times and you see how well that worked lol.&nbsp;<br><br>Hope you stay on skype! Really fun to talk to you.
