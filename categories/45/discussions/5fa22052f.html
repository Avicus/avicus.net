If Avicus is still going in 5 years, which I really hope it does, what does everyone think it is going to be like? Take these into consideration:<br><br><br><b></b><b>The amount of players that will be on Avicus</b><br><b>Who will be the new Moderators and Directors, and Managers?</b><br><b>Will there be different gamemodes?</b><br><b>Will there be tons of new maps?</b><br><br>Try and think about these and other factors - what will Avicus be in 5 years!<br><b><br></b><b><i><u>iBiZa_MiNeCrAfT</u></i></b><i><u></u></i><u></u><b><br></b>

If Avicus does survive for another 5 years it will have completely changed. The current Staff Team will have most likely been completely updated because most people will have continued with their lives.&nbsp;<br><br>However, if Avicus did survive there would be more players because it wouldn't have survived otherwise. These new players will have probably been attracted to the server through different, new, exciting game modes. If there are different game modes, there will be different maps!<br><br>We have just got to hope that Avicus does survive! I don't really want to have to say goodbye to the lovely community that keep Avicus running!

The amount of players will probably decline by a bit, because not many players would play Minecraft for another five years on the exact same server. They'll be doing other things like preparing for college and such. I'm kind of nervous about Microsoft buying MC though, I wonder what changes they'll make...If the server is still up and running after 5 years, then I suppose all the staff team then would be completely different than what it is as of now. Servers fall unless it's very stable. Player count should increase if the avicus is still alive after five years; obviously there would be progression. I

Why do you think Microsoft would ruin minecraft? Mojamg knew what they were doing.&nbsp;<br><br>In 5 years time, there is obviously going to be changes, wether the are postive or negative we'll have too see. Existing staff members probably wont be staff anymore as live goes on.

Avicus will mostly die in a year or <b><i><u></u></i><u>half a year</u></b> if the player count continue to decline.<br>The player count is declining because of the block lag and lag. It's almost impossible to play on Avicus!

Honestly, do you expect an elego game to be still around even after 3 years? Even if it is, it won't be as popular as it is right now. Currently, minecraft has half the amount of people who have bought it still playing it, including alts. With a sudden decline of people leaving due to being bored, irl stuff, etc, minecraft will be much more different. The population of minecraft will probably go to 100k maybe 80k, and then suddenly decline. This includes xbox players and pocket edition users

If Minecraft dies (which it most likely will) or becomes extremely unpopular, then Avicus, and plenty of other servers will as well.<br><br>If Minecraft stays the same, there will definitely be a lot of new stuff on Avicus, Ivy may not even run the server anymore.

In 5 years I'll left all minecraft and work.... :P<br>All the people who likes Avicus, will quit and MC will be not more popular, or it will be popular but the people wants other things....<br>Avicus will have two options:<br>1st: Change (like MCZone-Avicus) and delete and add more gamemodes and things, and have another name, maybe.&nbsp;<br>2nd: Close.<br><br>All it depends of the dedicated staff that will be here and what Ivy will want to do. That is my point.

Why are you guys hating on microsoft? They're a (more) professional company instead of Mojang. They'll probably do it better. Hopefully.<br><br>In 5 years? Who knows.

I don't think Avicus will survive&nbsp;longer than six months to a year, so five years is way way way over our heads. If someone still enjoys to play Minecraft and/or Avicus after five years, I do think&nbsp;you're in&nbsp;need of help.

If IvyCode and AviGill don't pick up their act, we will be the veterans of Avicus. However, i do believe that minecraft will come up stronger now being owned by Microsoft.

To be honest, I don't know.<br>I have played here for a while, and watched people come and go, I was active in forums once, but now, not so much. &nbsp;With player count averaging near 100-150, Avicus seriously needs to get the 1.8 update out. &nbsp;If Avicus is still going in five years, congrats to them (notice 'them'). &nbsp;I personally like the community, even though few of you remember me (thanks to those who did). &nbsp;The [future] community will be very different than what it is now. &nbsp;Heck, as someone said earlier, we don't even know what is going to happen to Minecraft. &nbsp;<br><br>Probably not going to post anything for another two months...
