Honestly, I don't know why I haven't left the forums yet. I left the server about three months ago but I stuck around on the forums for some reason.&nbsp;Most of my old friends have left or became virtually inactive. I guess it was just this awesome community that kept me around for so long, but I knew I'd have to let go and move on at some point.&nbsp;Anyways, thanks everyone for giving me this amazing experience in my life,&nbsp;and always being very friendly to me.&nbsp;Goodbye everyone! o/

Turtle, you've always been a brother to me in my eyes. When I first met you, you were so calm, collected, chill, and funny. You've always been that way. And to be honest, you won that shirtless war, bro &lt;3 but on top of everything, you've truly been one of my best friends on this server for a long, long time. Take care.
