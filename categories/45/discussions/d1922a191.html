What the discussion topic says. I think it is a good idea, we could release many maps for the tournament at the same time.<br><br>Opinions?

I don't think skywars has been perfected enough in order to be a tournament gamemode.

A problem will competitive skywars, and UHC, is the amount of random elements there are too it. The winner isn't always the best player, but rather the luckiest.

This might be the only chance Avicus has of running a good tournament with a large player count.

I agree with <img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/54964b606ce749229a4c2b981d8c2ed7?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/Spoookeh.html" style="color: #009396">Spoookeh</a> here, it would give us some difference compared to other servers that only run DTM, CTF etc.&nbsp;<br><br>But we would definitley have to evolve skywars before even thinking of a tournament.

RNG based gameplay doesn't go too well with competitive gameplay.

<p>We need lots of <u>big</u> maps then bc it would be funnier with teams instead of solo I feel</p>

Umm a Skywars tournament would still be fun because it's "something other" than usual gameplay, but I understand what you're saying.
