Hey<br><br>I was wondering, does anyone know a good recorder that can edit well? I would like to start a YouTube channel, but I don't really know much about starting it off or the little things (putting music on the background, intros, etc.) can anyone recommend a screen recorder? Also, it should be compatible with OS X (Mac). Thanks, I appreciate the help.

I use fraps and it doesn't really take too much of your framerate away. It's super duper easy to use and from all the recording softwares I've ever tried, I think fraps is the best.<br><br>If ya don't like it, you can always try Camtasia's 30 day trial, although Camtasia isn't really as fast as fraps when it comes to saving the files and other small things.

You can keep renewing your trial, there are many ways to do this :)<br><br>I don't know if it's compatible with Mac since I don't have a one, but you could probably look it up.<br>And yeah it does cost money but you can find downloads on YouTube if you just look em up. It's not worth buying it if you can easily get it for free.<br>If you do want to buy it, I don't think it's that expensive either way.. not too sure tho

Use Screenflow to record, it makes you lose no fps. And edit with Final Cut Pro X. But to download these programs for free, you need to have uTorrent

I used fraps before to record, but it's not being updated anymore, so switched to OBS. I love obs and it's free! easy to use<br>l edit videos in Adobe premier elements and make thumbnails in Photoshop. I like both, but they weren't free.<br>also, once you upload a video to YouTube, you can edit the video to add a custom thumbnail then. &nbsp;<br>have fun!!!

Ahhhh yes, I did try that. The only thing is I finished the recording on screen flow and worked a lot on it, so I would like to continue on screen flow, since I also know how to use it. I have renewed it though, thanks a lot. The video that you showed me &nbsp;(to renew camtasia) would it affect anything else?

It will not. You just need to be sure that you turn off the "show all files" thing. It gets annoying when you see all the system stuff popping up.<br><br>Ive done this for a long time, no problems.

It's hard to get cracked versions of softwares on Mac. But ,as someone who used windows in the past, I think that Mac is better. It has its own programs (Made by Apple) and they are really good (Final Cut Pro X, QuickTime Player, Pixlr, iMovie etc.) And you can get every program with uTorrent. That's why, I personally prefer Mac!

Because you can't record with the best quality and frame rate just like you can on Windows. I am pretty sure that Sony Vegas isn't compatible with OS X therefore his wont be able to edit professionally but other than that the renders will probably be bad. There are editing programs on Mac too but not as good as Sony Vegas.

Final Cut Pro is better, I'm sure. And it depends on the version of your Mac. That's why, it's not hard to get high quality while having a lot FPS. I personally prefer Mac, but I should be respectful to you idea, too. But I don't say that Mac is better. I just think that OS X is really cool, it's own programs are really good. I can get what I want from them. Maybe if you use Mac for a week, you'll say that 'it's better than windows'. Maybe if I use Windows for a week I'll say 'Windows is better'. But I still couldn't understand why you think that Mac is bad.

Hey I use Quick Time Player for my recording. It's basic app for Mac. If You click it and go on the top tool bar, you should be able to click file, and then you can screen record. Hope this helped. You can record sound by setting up the sounds on the other tool bar. I might screen record about that so.

Thanks for the feedback guys, but I'm kind of giving up at the moment. 25% because I don't want to restart the recording and 75% because I don't have time.
