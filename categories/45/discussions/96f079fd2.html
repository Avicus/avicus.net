This might be a way. Many inactive players came on today. Also, I loved participating in tournament, even when we had a bad time! I didn't have as much fun as I had today in months!

Ye, it was something really different from regular scrims. I've never participated in a tournament before, and it was really fun! I think the most important thing in tournaments is to have a good time with your team! :D<br><br>The next tournament should be in January, to "celebrate" new-year! =3

Teams had the opportunity to pick what timezone they played in, It was only 5pm when the matches started for some of my chile players, and&nbsp;a little later for some of the other timezones. Remember, people in Australia have the worst luck, they have to be up at like 1am or something crazy. Can't please everyone's timezone.
