So, &nbsp;I have both (free trials right now) &nbsp;but I was wondering which one do you prefer? &nbsp;I personally like adobe after effects from the 4 days I've used them, &nbsp;but I can't figure out how to make the effect last only for a certain time... Could you guys give me a link to a video or tell me right in chat?&nbsp;<br>My inspiration is the YouTube Mr3fps,please check out his mc montages, &nbsp;there epic!&nbsp;<br><br>Thanks, &nbsp;ebirdy9

I use Sony Vegas for MC editing.. But I would recommend AE for good rendering! :)

<b>Full explanation:</b><br><br><u>Sony Vegas Pro 12:</u>&nbsp;<i>Sony vegas allows only so many features, Unlike AE it is hard (Harder) to make an intro template, as would be easily done in AE. My friends and I use Sony vegas mostly for Editing the basics, If needed We will render in 1080p without motion blur and then re-render it in AE for good motion blur, and exceptional rendering.<br></i><i>However Sony vegas does compete, with really simple editing tools, however you need the knowledge to overcome low memory, and how to fix it. AE Uses as much RAM as it needs without having to go into your files and changing anything<br></i><br><b>EDITING:<br></b><i>Sony vegas definitely beats AE, How easy it is to add such transitions/Text etc. However AE does not allow that to be that easy, From my experience it is a great program, but it takes will power to learn all the necessary components. Now again AE has a better rendering quality (For me). However requiring a good CPU and GPU (If GPU is listed in the rendering section). And adding motion blur is also going to be easier, due to Sony Vegas having this pink bar, which you dont know where to place, AE offers a better way, from 1-100 you can select how much motion blur you can have. For more detail skype me @<u>vsplesk.chat.mc</u></i> :)<i></i>

I use After Effects for adding lots of special effects (laser beams, explosions, goats running across the screen*), but I've heard Vegas Pro is good for Text and stuff...<br><br><br>*we were working on a class project where we were supposed to make a battle go on. My partner and I recorded one of us using bananas and apples as weapons, then each edited them independently. His was super badass... mine included a goat I had animated running across the screen in the beginning.
