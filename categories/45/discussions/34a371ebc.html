So, I got home today planing to go on my pc and look at the forums and play TF2,Minecraft, Etc...<br><br>As soon as I turned my pc on it started smoking and after I took it apart my mother board was fried my graphics card was split into 2 parts and a bunch of wires were broken.. Idk how this could have happened so this is probably the end of me for awhile now. I'm writing this on my brothers I pad cause my phone is being repaired and I won't receive my phone for a few months lately so I'm completely screwed as of now. So I'm currently looking for a new pc I might do custom so if you guys could shoot me some links please let me now it would be much appreciated!&nbsp;<br><br>Thanks :D

Also, do your research. It helps to do research on all the parts before building it. Especially on SSDs

No seriously. It comes to a point where we can barely understand what you are saying. We don't want to be mean, but there's a limit to how many grammatical errors you can make...<br><br>Also, to my knowledge, that build is over his budget.
