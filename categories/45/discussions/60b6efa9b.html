Well... Not to brag about anything, but this month I really pushed it to see how many monuments I can get. Right now I have 404 which is really good in my opinion. I just wanted to see who the top rushers are on avicus. Just say how many monuments in Nebula you have gotten.

Thats not how to measure it. Some rushers are pretty good but don't play as much as other people.

I have almost 2000 total, but I've kinda lost interest in rushing, and haven't gotten that many monuments in the past month or so.

There really isn't a point to say that in every single thread about rushing, since your stats say otherwise. So stop.

The record in Avicus is 508 monuments which is by me in Avicus. MCZone doesn't count. But now it's broken by luke836 with 564 monuments<br><br>But The # of monuments in a month don't really reflect that much. Usually the amount you have in total counts like me and I have 1749 monuments mined in total from May to Now as well as JkAwesome with 1589 monuments in total.

It still doesn't prove if he can pass defenses. He probably joined the easy teams with the opposite teams by having defenses. Some of us like challenges and we get better FROM getting pass defenses/midfields
