Ikr, heres my opinion on the DeathAdder. Personally, the rivalry between the Logitech G502 and the DeathAdder is easy to sum up. The DeathAdder has nothing wrong, yet the Logitech is a lot better in a lot of ways, but also has flaws. For instance, they made a system where you can add weights, but the mouse is already 30 g heavier. The scroll wheel is so stiff, that when you wanna click it you scroll. the extra buttons feel a but mushy, but that isnt that much of a big deal. The DeathAdder is perfect in being simple, which makes it perfect for FPS games. Its light, has 2 extra buttons, has an ok sensor, pretty high DPI, and a perfect scroll wheel. The thing is, you always want a little but more with the DeathAdder, which makes you have doubts. But I cant live without a light mouse, I need it to have a good scroll wheel too.

I need macro keys, and they help very much. Anyways, my rig is gonna be blue so why waste money on RGB (Insert question mark here, DAMN KEYBOARD GLITCH). The Ryos looks better IMO, and the lights arent as bright.
