Ok, So i've seen a lot of threads lately<br>"What screen recorder do I use?"<br>"What is a lagless or perfect recording software?"<br>"Whats a good editing software?"<br>etc.<br><br>And before you say "DoctaPop has this thread". He does, but he doesnt list what kinds of recording softwares are best for your PC. He might, but nobody asks.<br><br><b>Helping me with the thread:&nbsp;</b>If you are experienced and use programs that are good, please inform me in the reply's.<br><br>(<b>Again not an expert</b>, but I just want to make this thread to help people who might need it, and to save some forums space ;))<br><br>Lets get into it I guess!:<br><br><b><u>Screen recorders:<br></u></b><b> Fraps:<br></b><ul><li>Best used with GTX gpu's</li><li>Big file sizes</li><li>Eats your CPU quite a bit</li><li>Fraps Icon:&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://bit.ly/1txuOEv">http://bit.ly/1txuOEv</a></li><li>File Icon:&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://bit.ly/1ybmG3f">http://bit.ly/1ybmG3f</a></li></ul>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>Recommended Settings:</i><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Bitrate: 2500 - 4500<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;FPS: 30 (Bad PC) FPS: 60 (Decent PC)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Custom FPS: 60+ (Good PC)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Audio Encoder: Bitrate - 320<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 48Hz<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;CPU Usage / x264 - Low (Low quality and framrate) [For bad PC's]<br><br>&nbsp;<b>DxTory:<br></b><ul><li>Best used with GTX gpu's</li><li>Medium File Sizes (Average)</li><li>Not much CPU usage</li><li>DxTory Icon:&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://bit.ly/1vevSSj">http://bit.ly/1vevSSj</a></li><li>Dxtory File icon:&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://bit.ly/1vevSSj">http://bit.ly/1vevSSj</a></li><li>Doesn't record Skype audio.</li></ul>[No further Information] Settings at what ever pleases you.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<b>OBS (Open Broadcasting Software)<br></b><br>Not much CPU usage if encoded properly<br>Best used with AMD, NVIDIA gpu's<br>File Sizes: (Depends on the compression Buffer)<br>Not much Power usage (If on a laptop, recommended to be plugged in for maximum performance<br>OBS icon:&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://bit.ly/11LZMBv">http://bit.ly/11LZMBv</a><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Recommended Settings:<br>Bitrate: 5000 (Using GTX graphics) 3500 - 4500 (Using AMD or any other)<br>FPS: 60 (With a Bad PC it works<br>Audio: 320, 48Hz<br>Encoding: x264<br>CPU preset: Veryfast<br>Allow 61 - 120 fps entry: Yes<br>&nbsp;<br>(Recommend more stuff, and More stuff will be added as this thread goes.)<br>&nbsp;<br><b><i><u>Cinny's Suggestions:</u></i></b><span><span><br><br><b>QuickTime&nbsp;Player</b><br></span><ul><li>Comes with every new Mac (free)</li><li>Easy User Configuration</li><li>Very little user customization features</li><li>Lags a lot on most computers.</li></ul>This is generally not what you want to use.

For DxTory, I think it's useful to let others know that it doesn't record Skype audio :'c

Wow that's actually really helpful.<br>I personally use Pinnacle studio 17.<br>It also runs great on low end CPUs.<br>Sadly if you have a AMD GPU it won't render, so the CPU is only rendering.
