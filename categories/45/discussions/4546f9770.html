As you have heard MH17 from Amsterdam, bound for Kuala Lumpur was supposedly shot down above eastern Ukraine, how did you take this news? I was shocked, stunned not being able to put this act into words. Some friends of mine knew people on board MH17. My wishes are with the families who have lost loved ones. I will ask you again, how did you take this news? How did you find out. Did you know anyone who has relatives, class mates, friends, colleges on this plane?

It's just sad. First the other plane lost at sea, now this.

I found out about this on my vacation. It's really a shame.

On the plane was around 100 HIV/AIDS researchers heading to a convention. That loss is huge for the prevention effort of this disease.
