Ok my worst nightmare just came true and here's the story:<br>So i started a call with gonzo and the danger is, my cousin and my bro are sleeping in the same room as me. my bro started to tell some very funny jokes and talking about sweg stuff...which caused me to laugh out loud and good thing is my cousin warned me to lower my laugh because of people in the other rooms sleeping. My brother basically asked me to give the headphones and my ipad to him and he started to talk stupid stuff to gonzo which is i'm really blushing at that time and covering myself with my blanket (i'm nervous as hell...). after that, i suddenly grab the headphones and my ipad from him and he just eavesdrop on our conversation so i coudn't talk to gonzo that much. I'm even removing my headphones to hear what is he talking about to my cousin and they changed the topic to tree houses. I began tallking a little at that time and i didn't realized my brother is still eavesdropping me. I just ignore him but idk why do i still feel bothered. (This is really embarrassing but i really want to share it to you guys)
