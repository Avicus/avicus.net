Ahah! I know exactly what to do. <br><br>Of course everything depends on your budget, but seeing as you're a fellow New Zealander, user trade me! It's amazing.<br><br>I got my pc for $300 NZD, 4gb Ram, strong i5, and an average gpu. More importantly, I spent an extra $50 on 4 more gb of ram, and $100 on a good gpu, so at a total of $450 I've gotten a very nice PC.&nbsp;<br><br>So my advice, use trade me to but a cheap second hand pc, and upgrade it.

I dropped 1k on a cybertron and its customizations. I run just about everything on ultra high settings. To start; make a price range between 500-2000.

If you want to do minecraft &nbsp;and you want fps galore then you can get a i7 like 4770K and that will take up most of your money ,then a small graphics card such as a 750ti or 960 that would be a more minecraft focused rig. If you wanted both you would go for a 970 and a i5 4690K that would give you a really good Price To Performance ratio and it will work very well and would get 50-65FPS on GTA V all settings on maxed out (1080P) obvious you dont have to fully max out ,so you can alter to your needs!<br>BTW building your PC your self ,like buying all your parts and assembling them your self can be much much cheaper, talking about atleast £100+

Also 8GB of RAM and a motherboard does have to be expensive it just means if you get like a Z97 chipset you can overclock and can be faster ,but you can get a h81 and it wont really affect performance alot but it will abit but you cant overclock on a h81. 8GB is all you need for ram i can play project cars MAXED 1080P on my system (not these specs) im only using 5-6GB of ram

What budget? What games are you going to play? Are you going to record/stream? Would you like to run the games you play in Ultra Settings? Just give a bit of information it's really hard to try to recommend you a PC with no information given

Good point.<br>Without getting specific, budget's not too much of a problem.<br>Mostly will play Minecraft but not solely.<br>Occasionally will record.<br>Ultra settings would be nice but isn't a necessity.

If budget is not too much of a problem, what type is it (USD / AUD / Euros / Pounds/ etc.)<br>And I guess you listed all your requirements @OP.
