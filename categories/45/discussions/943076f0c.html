Howsie Did not archive it, I did.<br>As I explained in my last post, No one recieved their information, and neither will he.<br>There is nothing left to discuss on this topic, therefore I archived it.<br>If you feel I made a bad decision, please feel free to rant as much as you want.

Woo, *rant rant rant rant rant rant*.<br><br>Glad I got that out the way! xD You could have locked it tho.<br><br>There are things left to discuss; other people could have expressed their opinions.<br><br>We're not asking for specific people to know but we're asking for everyone to receive reasoning on why they were denied.<br><br>It is unfair that other people who were denied got their reasoning and some of the current staff might have never been staff if they did not know what to change on applications.

What other opinions exactly? there is nothing left to be expressed.<br>he asked a question. And an answer was given.<br>There is no point in arguing here, You can lock/archive the post when you have finished thinking :)<br>Or you could tell me to do it, anything is fine.

Yo-av archiving it is not the answer, why not let users resume talking or finding alternate solutions or convincing each other that it is fair.<br><br>Other user's may give important points that could impact the decision.<br><br>Archiving is for those discussions that get out of hand due to profanity and words/pictures of a inappropriate nature not for posts that <u>you</u> think are useless or do not need to carry on being discussed in your mind.

Instead of writing <b>"Yo, yoav"&nbsp;</b>he wrote&nbsp;<b></b><b>"Yo-av"</b>, as in&nbsp;<i>"Hi, av!"</i> or&nbsp;<i>"Hi, yoav!"<br><br></i>Or maybe, he just wants to say&nbsp;<b>"yo-av"&nbsp;</b>instead of&nbsp;<b>"yoav"</b>. In the end, does it really matter? As long as it's "readable" and "recognizable" it should be fine c:&nbsp;<i><br><br></i></span><i><br></i>
