Before anything I would like to say good job to the staff in my opinion you guys did a great job with the update. Now 1.8, many people are leaving because the server was updated to 1.8. It's understandable but at one point every server will be updated to 1.8. Big servers which are also mainly PvP like MCSG already have updated to 1.8. Badlion, Kohi, OCN still haven't but I'm sure the sr. staff are working on it, OCN they already announced it they were going to do it mid-way in the tournament but they decided to postpone it as it would be better. The people leaving avicus because 1.8 I would suggest you guys not too because I've been analysing 1.8 vs 1.7 and 1.8 pvp is obviously different from 1.7 so it would be a good idea to start practising there. Also, most mods have been updated to 1.8 as well so I don't see the problem. It's pretty straight forward, most servers will be updated so there is really no point of leaving. Please stop making leaving threads, you don't have to announce to everyone you're leaving.

Same, in 1.7 my fps never passed 50 and now that I just use 1.8.3 and with Optifine, I pvp better and my fps goes &nbsp;higher than 90. That's honestly the best Fps I have gotten in 11 months. I don't see why people hate 1.8, every server will soon have to just use that so get use to it. But yea good job to all the staff members who tested the update and thanks to the developers for making the update amazing :)
