Ok, so, every Overcast player who is coming to Avicus, this is not overcast and never will be. You guys are suggesting things that make Avicus identical to Overcast which it is not. I keep seeing "Overcast has this" and "On Overcast..." Stuff like that.&nbsp;<br><br>Yes, it is the same kind of games but it is a completely different server.

It's suggestions. You can't expect them not to try.&nbsp;<br><br>I had a suggestion that I still stand by. Make a rotation with all the Overcast maps for the Overcast players to play in.

I don't see harm in players suggesting things from OCN if its not a big thing. Like if you think about it all the suggestions have been pretty little things that we could just bring over here, I would understand if someone suggested like taking OCN's hub and calling it our own or something along those lines but I don't feel like adding a Trophy Case or anything small like that could really affect our server and turn us in Overcast.

but ocn was a better server and if its closing down maybe we will try to learn what they did in order to make our server better and welcoming for their community too?

Overcast&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Slate Pro';  ">is closing down anyways. The suggestions that have been made are small but nice and they could help avicus become a more enjoyable place. And for those of you who say that avicus will "become" ocn, here's my opinion: that will never happen. Avicus has some elements that are unique, such as their plugins, the community, the staff, the maps, the fact that ctw is never played (on ocn ctw always has players), etc. So as a conclusion some of the suggestions that have been made are pretty neat and should be taken seriously, instead of having people making threads about how avicus will turn into overcast. &nbsp;â€Ž</span>

Avicus can have DTC, DTM, CTW, CTF, KotH, FFA, Arcade, and the same maps as OCN and it will not be identical. Things are run differently here than there. We can have the same tools but everyone uses the tools differently.

If I'm being really honest, it sort of is unnecessary but it was the second part that made me realize that kycrafft was using it to be constructive.<br><br>Because if we're going to give credit where it's due, they did do a lot of things right&nbsp;<b>(Besides managing their budget correctly)</b>.<br><br>So, it's topics like these ones that would destroy the server if the developers and administration actually listened to them and implemented them.&nbsp;<br><br>It's just a senseless emotional topic of a disgruntled veteran that wants to "go back to the way things were" or "Not make it like that one".

I disagree. 90% of the OCN staff is watching down on the players, while on Avicus the staff is quite chill and open to the community.<br><br>About the topic, every company/organization should checkout companies/organizations similar to your own, and steal the good parts they have, and implement that in your own organization.

At least OCN got stuff done, they made amazing maps and could ban hackers. Its almost impossible for avicus to do those 2 things.

Everyone is entitled to their opinion you think that? that's ok! :D we think otherwise , that's ok! :D<br><br>At the end of the day in my personal opinion i see nothing wrong with using others ideas to move our own interests forwards, of course we want to be unique, in many aspects we are.We're not going to ignore something always because another server has it however. Sometimes, yes; That's necessary if we don't want a million posts like this, &nbsp;i agree coming up with new unique features is good and because of the similarities it allows us to come up with our own unique way's of dealing things specifically for our network community.<br><br>The statement we are 'trying' to be like ocn &nbsp;is a false one and a harsh one at that, similar servers? Yes!<br>But in many aspects as two communities along side each other it helps us strive, to be the best we can be. competition is good, it brings out the bad even in the good so we can all improve together.&nbsp;<br><br>I would love to have a proper discussion on what we could improve on as a server but the way you have proposed it isn't constructive nor helpful and this thread has gotten out of hand.&nbsp;<br><br>Please anyone, feel free at anytime &nbsp;at anytime to tell us how we can improve, but this is not how you do it.<br><br><b><i>Locking</i></b>
