Toby here, and im here to ask for some ideas on what can i do while im/you are temp-banned<br>on servers, yesterday i was temp-banned cuz of inappropriate language in chat, and the temp-ban's time<br>has been up, but i recently just found out i was temp-banned again for <i>scamming players w/ the</i><br><i>infamous&nbsp;<u></u><b>alt + f4</b> dirty trick</i>.<br><br>This post isn't an appeal nor meant to flame the server's staff or anyone, ill be honest and i did<br>do this and legendaryengram took it upon himself to temp-ban me for 2 weeks (something like that<br>upto june 3), and i do not blame him for this since i've publicly tried this b4 alrdy on some ppl so<br>yeah&nbsp;<br><br>(back to what i want to actually say for the title)<br><br>since im gonna be temp-banned for a week or so, i need your guys help in giving me ideas in<br>spending my time while im temporarily banned from Avicus, i already have pre-plans incase like<br>the usual<br><br>-Watch Youtube/Youtubers i like<br>-Watch TV/ Movies<br>-Go play outside or do some other activity<br>-Hangout on another server<br>- etc. etc.<br><br>ive got alot more but i/we need more ideas and maybe even more specific ideas like<br>"why not go watch this movie i think you'll like" or something along those lines<br>and just for safe measure, i will not be hopping on the server w/ an Alt just so i dont<br>want to have a higher risk of having both accounts perm-banned/ip-banned and im not sure if its actually<br>allowed but i wont try just incase that i wont walk into a minefield.<br><br>So this post is not just for me but for those other people who have limited ideas and thoughts on<br>what they can do besides appealing a ban or doing some house work/chores or attenting school/<br>homework, etc. etc.<br><br>Leave your suggestions, comments, and ideas down below, please no hate on me or to anyone in<br>the staff!<i></i>

It doesn't matter if an infraction is old or new, that won't affect your chances of getting the trial at all, however, if you have a lot of infractions related to immaturity, etc, then that might change the senior's point of view about you. But.. that's not the case here cause you have some good roots with the community :')

Then you question is answered :P :P :P<br><br><br><br><br>But seriously, you can't get mod if you are banned, so hacking in admin will probably screw up your chances at getting legitimenity promoted
