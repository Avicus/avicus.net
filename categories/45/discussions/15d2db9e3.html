I'm writing an essay on school about veganism. I want to see veganism from both perspective, for and against. Personally I am a former vegetarian because I am a former buddhist, but I stopped caring at one point. But can I get some ideas about wether vegan is beneficial or not.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Just to get the ball rolling and I need to start a fire,<br><br><b>-Animal eaters are cruel and sick bastards that will die of heart disease!</b><br><b>-Vegans are stupid idiots that shove their ideas down their throats!</b><br><br>*Grabs popcorn and sits back.

You need to chill out.<br>The "get the ball rolling part" was obviously a humorous joke.&nbsp;<br>In the previous vegan thread that was on the previous Avicus forums didn't start a flame war. Honestly whenever a controversial topic comes up on Avicus people have this irrational fear that a flame war will erupt. The last time I posted a gay marriage thread I got about 8 comments requesting mods to lock in fear that a flame war would erupt. And did it? NO. I clearly stated in my introduction that I wanted both perspectives of Veganism, not to explicitly start a flame war. Lighten up, will you?

I think it makes since that they don't eat meat, but milk... really? The cow needs to be milked, it would get more hurt if it wasn't... so that isn't really cruel to the cow. Other things, yeah, I get it, killing animals is bad. Yeah, but I still don't get milk, they need to be milked.

I eat a good amount of meat daily. It's human nature for us, because our minds are still wired to a "Eat or be eaten" theory, causing us to continue hunting animals for the rest of time.&nbsp;<br><br>Or the fact that BACON IS AWESOME.<br><br>Either way. :)

Spicy is it cruelty-free popcorn (^_^)?<br><br>I think there should be a balance when it comes to what we eat, meaning not a whole lot of meat products and little to no vegetables or too many vegetables and not enough meat protein or no meat period. &nbsp;And the vegan thing is split into different groups, you have those who will eat veggies but also eat dairy products and fish and honey. &nbsp;Then you have those vegans who eat veggies, but no dairy, no fish, no honey because they think it is cruel to take the honey from the bees, and only veggies that they grow, they do not want to hurt, certain plant life o_O? &nbsp;Where I live it is definitely the keeping it 'weird/interesting' part of the state when it comes to being a vegan.<br><br>Then you have the whole GMO genetically altered crops that Monsanto is controlling like an evil empire that is making organic vegetables/products bad for our health. &nbsp;The entire organic industry is at a risk of doing more harm than good, you have in some third world countries where Monsanto has forced farmers to use only Monsanto seeds and then it ends up killing the entire villages, having heirloom seeds is becoming rare now, and farmers here in the USA are having a hard time being able to grow products that have not been altered. &nbsp;It is the reason why cancers/tumors, etc are on the rise throughout the world. &nbsp;Plus the amount of crap they stuff in our meat products, force feeding the cows/sheep/pigs/chickens, with antibiotics they don't need or force feeding them crops that are not good for them just so that they can get fattier, which in turn does harm for us when we consume it.<br><br>So basically do not eat or drink anything o_o' &nbsp;or just grow your own stuff, support your local organic farmer that does not use genetically altered stuff (^_^)v

It's animal nature to eat other animals. Lions eat zebras, fish eat fish. I do not understand why it is so different when a human eats a cow. It's animal nature. Another thing is that vegans tend to be very skinny due to not getting all the required calories. I love animals but I still eat meat.

I am not against vegans or vegetarians because it can come out of religions so I am not going to make a long lecture about how it is a bad idea or how animals shouldn't have to suffer. My opinion is that I don't mind them not eating meat because you can get the nutrients out of other things suited for vegans and vegetarians but, not drinking milk is what I believe they should drink because it hurts cows not to be milked. I don't know much about veganism or being a vegetarian because I am an ordinary omnivore and I don't really spend much time researching the subject so I can't make a strong opinion.
