Recently, some staff have been using purely replay mod for hacking evidence, specifically safe aura.<br>It apparently has been tested several times and the code has been checked.<br>Some people say it's reliable, some say it shouldn't be used at all.<br>So Merp and I did a small test.<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKcuEzYGNJk&amp;feature=youtu.be" title="Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKcuEzYGNJk&amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKcuEzYGNJk&amp;feature=youtu.be</a><br><br>We realised most of the time, even though the player is not hacking, he still looks like he has safe aura. It's just the replay mod.<br>It should really only be used for videos and montages, not evidence for hacking. It isn't reliable.<br>Opinions?

In my opinion the Replay Mods is not something to use to assess and ban hackers. It's very inaccurate I suggest go back to the original process and use a screen recorder and recorded it yourself don't assess your hacking reports on a inaccurate mod.<br><br>Just my opinion :)

In my opinion, the replay mod is not reliable at all. I agree with what blaze said. Moderators should be well trained enough to detect such hacks.

You could just show safe aura normally instead of flicking your mouse every second

You can't detect smooth aim, trigger, safe aura etc from a third person point of view?

Its hard enough as it is to detect smooth aim, trigger and safeaura&nbsp;from plugins, and so you'd suggest using a mod intended for cinematics to try and catch them instead? If you see both clips you can see that from my pov it is very jolted whereas on the replay mod its completely smooth, even at 0.1x speed. At 0.1x speed the replay mod gives 60fps output. Hang on a moment, at 0.1x it gives 60fps recording? So either I had 600fps on the build server or somethings wrong. It's the latter. In addition, I do not appreciate your comment above that where you seem to be hackusating. Excuse my lack of understanding with the remark you made as you may not have intended to be hackusating.&nbsp;If you are, however, hackusating then I'm sure you'd agree with me that that's not a good example to be setting as a moderator as you punish people for doing so. Oh and to clarify, in case you really do think I hack, I wasn't using any hack of any type in that video. The mods I had installed were forgecore, bskrpcore (for shaders), better foliage, World edit, the replay mod and forge loader, minecraft coder pack, arrow camera and tabbychat 2. If you do think &nbsp;I was hacking in that video then it shows one of two things: The replay mod&nbsp;is inaccurate or You cannot accurately detect hacks. Either way a change needs to be implemented as I fear players will be falsely banned in the future.

Replay mod is completely unreliable and unstable. A friend of mine (4lextr) got banned of "hacks" when he was one of the best pvpers I've ever met. Staff stated they used the replay mod and it showed he was hacking "for sure" so thus, he would stay banned. I suggest recording instead of replay mods. I've never used the replay mod, so I don't know if there will be a difference, but all I know is the replay mod isn't accurate

OCN is a well-established server. Proof that a server as big as OCN is using it to aid with the banning of hackers and cheaters shows the mod is at least semi-reliable. Staff on well-established servers wouldn't use the mod if it wasn't reliable.

Replay mod is best for checking KB, others maybe but not as reliable. Also note I didn't say this mod cannot detect hacks, I'm saying it's not reliable. When it's not reliable, things happen.

Yes that's what I am not every sure about. That's why I said it isn't reliable, but can be used to a slight extent to backup other evidences. As long as this isn't the only evidence used for a ban I'm fine.

There is a glitch if you record yourself. The head is never exactly where the player is. Now this should not be a problem if you are not reporting yourself. We also are changing ways we catch cheaters so if this caused fear we apologize but do not worry because we have more. We only use replay if we are 100% sure someone is cheating.

a) You can literally just use a USB or Injection client and be immune from screenshares. You see leaderboard-level players on Kohi getting off from screenshares who cheat all the time.

It is not really simple<br>He would need to prove that the replay mod does not produce accurate KB to the extent of not taking any and proving how we was the only one to not take KB when everyone else did.

Replay mod is completely unreliable and unstable. A friend of mine (4lextr) got banned of "hacks" when he was one of the best pvpers I've ever met. Staff stated they used the replay mod and it showed he was hacking "for sure" so thus, he would stay banned. I suggest recording instead of replay mods. I've never used the replay mod, so I don't know if there will be a difference, but all I know is the replay mod isn't accurate
