There is no point, the sub would die and the forums are easier to use.

We had one. It was like the forums just less strict. Then a senior mod decided to grief it (ban all other moderators, delete all posts, create inappropriate posts everywhere, etc). The senior mod is not a dtaffmember anymore.<br><br>Well, I would love if it gets relieved. Maybe as an emergency forum, in case the forums server are down.<br><br>I think para (vice) is in charge of it, I'll ask him.
