I even said it myself. "Ever since 1.5 was added, Minecraft was ruined." This, however, isn't true. Minecraft is a game all about YOUR imagination and crazy things like a purple dragon who blows up and shoots glowing orbs at you. There are undead pigs with gold swords. There are Jell-O cubes that jump you. Heck, if you don't like green Jell-O cubes, we've got red ones! Minecraft is a very creative game. Veterans from Alpha and Beta look at it differently from people who bought the game 5 hours ago. Veterans see what they thought was incredible back in the day not so incredible anymore. New players like the new updates for they haven't felt the feeling of the old minecraft.<br><br><br>Minecraft may not be the same, but it is never going to be ruined.

What ruins it, is the users mostly. The gameplay itself can't exactly be ruined, just changed till we get really annoyed ;_;

I do, as well...<br><br>But, yeah, I hate it when people say that Minecraft has become ruined because "it's too complicated," or "the new ocean temples look like a bad mod." If you don't want to play the newest version, you can easily switch yourself back to Beta 1.7.3 and have fun with your nostalgic, "so-much-better-than-everyone-else's" adventures there...
