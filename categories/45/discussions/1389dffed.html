all of them dropped plus the water lighting glitch caused everyone to lag. Pretty much the whole match was bad company and pureblox freezing on pushes; 1 of our defenders froze when looking for the guy who broke it which might of been able to kill them if they didnt. They should atleast fix maps before playing a map like that; because a map being determined &nbsp;by when lag spikes happened is actually bullshit. Im not saying Bad Company didnt play well. Im just saying that lag spikes honestly made that match horrid and stuff so yea

Yea, it was very hard to play with. Maybe 1 water in your inventory.

Hello,<br><br>On behalf of the Event Administration Team I would like to apologise for any inconvenience. We are learning as Officials, and today we learned something. For the next map/round Water Buckets won't be in inventories, and they won't drop. Also, the map will be at y=0. For some reason it wasn't today. Once again, I apologise for any troubles. Thank you for your understanding.
