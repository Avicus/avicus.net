Hello guys, i guess this comes pretty much as a surprise.. But i have been thinking of this for a good while now, and i've come up with the best for me would be to leave minecraft and just move in life.<br>IF you want to come and talk to me or anything. Snapchat: pleasetheo | skype: theodore.idevall4<br><br>But i have some friends here to thank..<br><br>First of all,&nbsp;<br><b>Bad Company</b> and all those amazing members. You made me the player i am today.<br><b>Horizon/Cronus</b>, it's been amazing to have been able to be a part of this team, i will miss you all and i wish you good luck in the future!<br><b>Mep</b>, we didn't talk that much but we talked a lot in game. I'd call you a good friend, and i hope we'll meet up one day. Ha det så bra! &lt;3<br><b>Possydon/Posighdun</b>, thank you, for contacting me that day if i wanted to join Cronus. And thank you for being an awesome friend, leader. Take care!<br><b>Grape/Greg</b>, i'd call you one of my closest friends here on Avicus. Sadly we haven't been able to talk so much the later times, but i want to thank you for the time we had in TS and in-game. Take care! &lt;3<br><b>Kiarra</b>, we haven't known each others for so long, but you are a good person, really nice and fun to talk to. I wish you all the best in your future, Kiarra!<br>Too all my remaining friends i possibly forgot, i want to thank you for making my time on Avicus a great one. Wish you all the best, in-game, in real life and future. &lt;3
