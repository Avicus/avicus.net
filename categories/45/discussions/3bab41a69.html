So I watched this video --&gt;&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ykKghMu0k&amp;list=UUrRjAqC7ptvV6YadGQgfQ0Q">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4ykKghMu0k&amp;list=UUrRjAqC7ptvV6YadGQgfQ0Q</a>&nbsp;And I was like, I. Must. Do. This.<br>Only problem is I have no clue how to get knockback since usually I circle strafe and don't really want knockback. So could anyone give me some knockback tips ^.^

There are secrets on how me and Stan get insane knockback on people so much that people like gayzmcgee complain about it, obviously for that reason, I don't really want to share it but I've been giving out a few tips on knockback so I guess the main thing you want to do with dealing knockback is spamming w (something that pretty much all the soup pvpers use). With dealing knockback, spamming w isn't about speed alone but timing, which is why we're able to 10 block people (perfect mix of speed and timing). If you're talking about getting no knockback dealt to you, I have a trick I use but I've only shared it with one person and i'm not going to share it here.

When I spam 'W' they only go back about 2 blocks so it doesn't really make much of a difference..<br>Also, are you an alt? ;3

Honestly, there's no need to tryhard. Practice enough and you'll find what suits you best.

I jitter click and w-spam, seems to work. Also the sprint-block hit thing works nicely as well, though that's being removed in 1.8 (tested it in pre-release v2)<br><br>But gibbo is right, practice is key.
