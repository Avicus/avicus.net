Maybe we should add a blacklist for certain songs, I'll review it over with the seniors. I personally think the Cory theme should be allowed though, because there's plenty of themes that are awesome. I've got a few favorites myself, it's not worth a case-by-case basis when there's going to be different settlements of inappropriate tracks.

Now the real question is : You hear about a server who's staff break rules and say they will be "buzzkills" next time due to having to follow their own rule. What server is it?<br><br>Now, we have admins &amp; sr mods playing &nbsp;racist songs, what happens? Probably nothing, and continuosly as well, now what happens if a member does the exact same thing? BAN. We say there is no way to improve on being less bias. I see a problem with major bias and I'm sure it's fixable to be less bias. Funny thing is there were people in the plug dj at the time too xddd.

If you want to know why you were banned, first of all, you played multiple troll songs while we were trying to have an event. It got so bad, that Jozz said the next person to play a troll song will be banned. You did just that.
