I will just create Avicuscarce news then. &nbsp;Wanted to create something unique so I changed it from a keemstar like reporting to a Scarce like reporting. &nbsp;Avicus alert was already taken by shadowwolf. &nbsp;So I made mine Avicusscarce as I want my own unique creation here. &nbsp;I pray no one beat me to Avicusscarce if they did I will have to do Avicusdefranco.

I definitely don't mind it is very helpful.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; I have no idea why it was broken, I have posted images before on the forums (the old forums).&nbsp; Dont know the reason it was broken but thank you. I still like Keemstar more for his exciting presentation of the news, but it was already taken by you with your youtube video you uploaded.

Carrie_May was what I named my correspondent because she was once a very popular avicus player, a great friend, and an extremely kind person. &nbsp;I wanted for people to think while reading "this name sounds familiar." &nbsp;I wanted people to remember her impact on the community by using her name.
