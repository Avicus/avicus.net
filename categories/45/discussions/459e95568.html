Hello, Avicus.&nbsp;<br>16 months ago I stumbled across a server with the IP: skywars.co, Avicus. I let it stay in my server list for awhile until in June when I went on and played my first match of nebula on the map Senex II. I dedicated 18 days of my life to this server, made a map, and got to 4th prestige (;( that doesn't exist anymore). I've strengthened friendships and made new ones. As of march 8th, I discovered CS:GO, which has now taken over my life. I don't feel like I will be consistently playing on Avicus anymore, but I will be playing CS:GO. Avicus has brought me some of the best moments of my gaming experience. Defiantly job done damn well. But all good things come to an end, so I will be retiring from Avicus. I may visit sometimes. If you wanna play CS:GO with me just add me as a friend on steam, (my name is source_route). <br>PEACE
