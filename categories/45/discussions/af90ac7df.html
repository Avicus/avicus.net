I've neglected making one of these threads for as I knew that my one year as a staff member was coming soon, and I found that more important and made me more proud.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;Throughout my time on Avicus I have learned more about myself then ever. As some people may know, I do have social anxiety which is why I spend most of my time online.I've always had life problems, and Avicus is brought me through them. The following things I am about to say is only known by a few users, most of which are staff members.You see, when I first got Jr Mod I was a happy human being. I was nice to everyone and I loved to make people laugh and have a good time. But about 3 weeks in to being a staff member, I hit rock bottom.My depression started... My dad lost his job due to cancer. He was diagnosed with two types of cancer at once. We didn't have the money to pay it, and our insurance just wasn't enough.&nbsp;They say my dad didn't have that much of a chance of making it... I started to dwell on it, I couldn't forget it. My dad was my hero at that time, I did everything with him.About a month later, my best friend killed himself. After that happened, my other best friend killed himself. I lost two of my best friends in under 1 month. I became a wreck.I didn't tell much people about it, but my life changed a lot. I became somewhat rude at times and swore a lot. I didn't talk much either, I was a robot in-game.So that went on for about 4 months, then I learned some new things happened. One of my friends got shot, the other was arrested for selling drugs. I wasn't sure what to do after that.Once I heard about that, I became very angry easily. I would snap from the easiest things ever. It majorly affected how I did my job on Avicus.When I became a Sr Mod, I was recovering, but I was still an angry person and would snap easily. I wasn't sure what I should do with my life.While recovering, I became more depressed from my school life. I wasn't ever really bullied, I wasn't ever really accepted, I was just ignored always.I got so depressed that I tried to kill myself. Not once, but multiple times. Each time I backed out because on the inside I knew I didn't want to die or I failed at it.However, I hit another turning point later. I met some new great friends and my dad managed to make it through cancer. I instantly became a happier person as a whole.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; At this moment in time, I am recovering again from my depression, and I have become a better person as a whole.&nbsp;From Avicus I learned my morals that I would keep for my whole life. The main one is one that most people actually ignore and call dumb.It's one you are taught in preschool. "Treat people the way you want to be treated." I've learned to treat people the way I want to be treated, from accepting all to ingoring no one.I've learned more about how I need to stop thinking my life is terrible, because there is always someone in a worse stage of life.I have mainly been touched my younger kids with cancer. I've been growing out my hair for two months now, and in Mid Feb I will be shaving my head for kids with cancer to prove to others that it is just hair and that most of these kids may never get their hair back at all due to chemo.I'm currently donating some clothes to go to homeless people that are stuck in the cold during winter and don't have winter clothing. And regardless of what they have done to become homeless, you don't fully know what happened so I wouldn't judge, they are humans too and should be treated as if they are just like us.I've learned accepting is the key and it will always come back around to do you good.Now regarding all people that think I "hate" them, I'm sorry. I know I was rude in the past, and I am sorry for that. If you think I "hate" you, just know I don't. I don't hate anyone on Avicus.<br><br>&nbsp; At this point of it I would add a part of the thread where I thank certain users, but I am not going to do that.&nbsp;My thank you doesn't do to certain people, it goes to all of Avicus, regardless if you are a staff member or not.&nbsp;Just remember this, I like each user on Avicus and don't forget that. It's been one hell of a ride, and I am looking foward for my future on Avicus.

Doc, I really applaud you for standing up and sharing this thread with everyone here at Avicus, I can't imagine how hard it is for you, and some of that stuff is unimaginable, but the people who just say "Oh, gratz man" aren't giving you the respect you should get for making this thread.<br>Thank you Doc, and all the best for your future life ahead of you!

Keep on man, I've been through as hit before, not that bad, but I definately respect that. Depression is a steep hill, as I've learned from others. Keep your head up and know we're all there for you, through thick and thin, all the friends you made here will last a while. It takes a lot to come out and say that. Much respect.

Hey, its all right....<br>We're all glad you didn't commit suicide. You may have been in depression, but think of all the players who would have also fallen into depression because of it....<br><br>Honestly, you're a great Sr. Moderator and you should stick to whoever you are. It's common for someone to fall into depression for these reasons...and you shouldn't be ashamed. We all will have those moments where we just can't take things in our life. And that's where you have to smile. Be the person you want to be. And it was very brave of you to tell us all that.<br><br>Stay cool,<br>FrankenRavi

<span>Wow. You've gone through a lot. To have someone go through cancer, I sort of know what it feels like. However, I was young at the time and don't remember much of the family member that died from it. And to have two friends commit suicide...man that's tough. <i></i>Well I think 'congrats for 1 year a Staff Member' is a little bit of an understatement. I think 'congrats for being able to get through life so far, even at it's toughest moments'. Yeah that should do it.</span>-Raging

Tyler, there's no way I can describe you (without taking up 500 lines) besides being an amazing person. You've gone through so much and are still here to make us laugh, smile, and make the server better in general. Avicus wouldn't be the same without you, &lt;3.

There are not enough words in the english language to describe how sorry I am for your losses. But you are rebounding, and that is the important part. If that were me, I might still be in depression, or even dead. Keep up the good work as a mod, and hopefully there will be a 2 year celebration, too!
