^ Would it be worth me trying to Jitter Click because I dont really see a difference maybe because my aiming JC is 10-12 cps so should i try to make it faster or is there no point?

I get around 12 when I jitter, but I can't aim while doing it. If you have to sacrifice your aim to jitterclick, don't do it. You can have 50cps but if you can't aim for **** you can't even utilize that cps because you can't hit them to begin with. Jitterclicking and cps in general increases with practice. I used to have like a 10cps jitterclick and because I practiced it's around 12 now (more or less). I just need to learn how to aim and jitter L:&nbsp;<br><br>I only practiced because jittering was fun xP. If you have 12 already you can try and up it, but I'd suggest putting more time into aiming with it. You don't need high cps to be good. If you still need to improve on other things first (IF. Idk tbh), such as counter-strafing then work on that. I've seen people that don't get better because they never improve for the reason they become so cps-reliant (seen this on several servers).&nbsp;<br><br>Just general Ideas and thoughts by me...

I'm physically incapable of jitterclicking, and I'm a slow clicker. I still PvP just fine, although I mainly get by from archery. You don't NEED to jitterclick, it's personal preference. If you want to, feel free to, but you don't have to. Actually, if for you, jitterclicking = terrible aim, it's better to click normally. Need aim to hit people who are strafing, ye?<br><br>EDIT: Wow, I used a lot of commas. o.O

I honestly click a little slower than I used to, since I don't want to get/reduce the chance of getting carpal tunnel or arthritis in my hands/wrist.

Yes, yes it is. Before Jitter clicking I had a cps of 8 then after a ton of practice I go to 15 cps. Too bad my aim isn't too great. Its not half bad but could be better. But anyway, you need to practice aim first. Like what Shadow said, its useless to have horrid aim but god cps.

I just jitter clicked in some random matches, fully controlled it, now I don't jitter. I get 9 cps without jitter clicking but when I get my new mouse, I may jitter click. I personally get on fine without jitter clicking however I would say jitter clicking does give a good advantage, so it's your call ;3

9 cps without jittering? Teach me o_o<br><br>@OP I agree with Crusty. Jitter clicking can give you a good advantage. However, if your aim is off while you jitter, it really isn't worth it. Personally I only jitter in duels (I don't jitter on Avicus.)

If you're being serious.. Shaking my hand a little (not jittering) seems to help, apart from that, just move your hands faster! xD

I really don't see everyone's obsession with jitter clicking. Aim is significantly more important than CPS in Minecraft PVP. I also believe you shouldn't be risking physical harm because of a game. 6 CPS is enough, people.

Jitterclicking has potential. But it's very low risk. Unless you jitter constantly or have a family history of arthritis and such it should be fine

I get around 14 without jitter, its not normal clicking but its a bit of a hybrid that doesnt ruin your aim, its useful when ping denies most of your hits but when i play au servers i do just fine with 6-8 cps.

From what I understand, no study has ever linked vibrations in joints to arthritis.<br><br>All injury is permanent. Skin that is pierced grows over, but the scar remains a weak point. Bones that break grow over and fuse. Where this fusion occurs, there is a weak point that lasts a lifetime.<br>This bone is now much more prone to breakages.<br><br>Also, I am not comparing minecraft to a sport. I am saying that sport is just a game, in the same way that minecraft is.

Clicking isn't the whole 100% in pvp, you can use strategies like strafing, or using hinder items. clicking helps though.
