I was never an extremely popular member I the community, but I have not been on the forums or ingame much recently. I've come to realize something. We're wasting precious time, all of us. Watching a screen and doing the same things over and over. Over and over. All for some goals on that same screen that never truly fills us. It's us avoiding ourselves. Avoiding our futures. Never gaining anything, just repeating until we're known for repeating well. Some may argue that you gain skill in the game. On the screen. That screen means nothing.<br><br>I've come to see there is more. There is much more to experience, much more to be had from life. Instead of focusing on being better at being a mindless zombie, you could better yourself. Be a better friend, a better person. Make a craft your own. My goals are to focus on music and thearter while learning handiwork from my father. These will help me through life, as a more helpful, while deeper and more mistifying, as I gather lessons. I'm not being forced to do this by anyone, my grades are fine, above average even. I, on my own accord, are seeking out more. Everyone has a talent to hone, wether they know it or not. Find yours, become great, and never get sucked back into the ever repeating abyss that is a video game.<br><br>In addition, I do not wish to be interviewed for Jr. Mod any longer. I don't want to be floating through life anymore, and Jr. Mod would be counterproductive. While you will still see me around to take a load off sometimes, I'll just be another face. I thank you for your time..<br><br>dragons and shit

Glob, You know me IRL. You know me deeper then anyone else, including my parents. I agree with your reasons to leave completely and totally. I know you will receive some hate, especially from other irl friends, but this is your choice, and i support that.

:(<br><br>I play Avicus for one reason. To get away.<br>I'm having some stress right now with my family, and whenever I'm not with them or at school / doing homework, I am on Avicus. I am on here because even if everyone doesn't know me, I have friends both IRL and ingame that I know pretty well. I'm fine with not being popular - Used to it, in fact. It doesn't bother me. Whenever I'm on, there will be someone I know on, who says "hi!" and makes me feel better.<br><br>&nbsp;Not trying to be an attention hog, just explaining why I stay, and why he should too.

Inspiring, it was nice playing with you on Nebula and such. and I luv your skin too ;_;<br>Good luck in music and theater, I hope you do great in those. But remember, the world is becoming so involved and immersed in technology and video games to the point where I don't think you can do much to avoid it completely. Idk, maybe revisit every so often on the server or come take a look on the forums occasionally? We still think you're a great part of the community :)

You bring up a good point and I absolutely respect your point of view, you are in no way attention hogging.<br><br>And croc (I'm putting this in one reply cuz I don't know how to do this with the fancy new reply button) thank you and you'll still see me around every so often, just not for as long or as often.

Being your IRL friend (quite a close one at that), I completely respect your decision. Becoming a mod was indeed time consuming, but was definitely worth it :D. I'll obviously still be hanging out with you IRL, but I hope to see you on the server sometimes bro. Well stated :D

Totally agree and I don't really mind, your still a sweggety swan (being one of my friends iRL) I totally understand and sometimes I feel like I could do better at life (life: school) if I put school first. My older bro graduated from high school today and seeing the awards I feel like I could achieve those goals if I wasn't distracted as much. I do t know why I'm saying this... maybe because I'm probably not going to play as much cause I'm going hard core life style (even tho I don't have a life :P) when school starts again in September
