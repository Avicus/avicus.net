</h1>
So on Friday my internet decided to shit bricks and now it runs extremely slow. It started off just the programs like Teamspeak, CS:GO, Minecraft, e.t.c. were slow but now its moved over to my browser as well and I have no clue what is happening.<br><br>I restarted my router a good 3 times (unplugged, waited 30 seconds, replugged) which has worked before when my internet started going bad but not this bad. I have also restarted my computer multiple times.&nbsp;<br>Is there anything that you guys may know to diagnose the problem/fix this problem or do I have to contact my internet provider?<br><br>Thanks for the help in advance! ;]

What type of internet do you have? Is it DSL, Cable, or is it Satelite. I had those kinds of internet types, so I may be able to help you out.

I can't be 100% sure but I have to say its probably DSL for the reasoning that when my dad accidentally cut a wire outside that took out our phone connection it took out our internet as well.

Sounds like cable, because my Uncle has cable also and when he did that same mistake, the internet stopped working. You probably have to repair the wire yourself or call the Repair Man from your Internet Provider. Good Luck on fixing your internet.

Oh. Try turning on and off your electricity for the room your router is located in, with the breaker outside. When my internet goes poop, I do that and it works better than me unplugging the router, I don't know why xD.

I have no clue which one shuts down the room + its my dad's room so it shuts down his whole setup xd So to not screw anything up I'll probably pass on that.<br><br>Could the problem arise from my internet provider?<br>I've heard that packet loss usually comes from the internet providers fault...

Packet loss will be due to a poor connection. Do you use Ethernet? Is it all devices or just your PC?&nbsp;<br><br>If it's just your PC then it will be your adapter, if it's all devices then it will be a cabling or a box issue. EG does your whole street have the same problem? If they do then the issue will be at the box, if it's just your house then it could be your possition in the box, or the cabling from the box to your house. At least, in the Uk it works that way. IDK about Canada/USA.

Plug your laptop into the router and see if you still get the same slow connection. If it goes back to the way it was, then your laptop's wireless card is bad.

It's not just chrome that is being affected. It is also many more like Teamspeak, CS:GO, e.t.c. so even if it does fix with Chrome it will probably still be broken for the other stuff.
