Sorry, I have come here to just say I have left my skype username up on my profile, I have come to a problem where someone adds it and just wants to talk hate about the server. I will not name drop but please, if you want to add me on skype, cool, to vent, cool, but please do not trash talk this server or someone from the server or what ever it might be without a reason, if there is a reason you need to talk to the staff about it, not me because I wont be coming to help you or anyone so please, do not add my skype to trash talk with no reason if you do I'll make you list off 20 reasons. and also, if you really wanna crash the server or ddos it what ever the hell it is, you need to think before you wreck the hell out of yourself, goodbye and let me be in peace.

Wow, ok....<br>Not first time some one wants to DDoS the server but thanks for the info!<br><br>First of all, Java got packages. Those can be used to crash something.<br>DDoS means send to the server a lot of packages so the computer who manages all the information of the server crash and the server went to a "offline mode". The only way to avoid it when its already done is waiting for the computer to end the proccess.
