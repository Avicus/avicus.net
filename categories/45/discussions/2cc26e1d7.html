You're just mad because I can dodge and snipe you easily :3<br><br>But anyways, Minecraft School was invented a long time ago; I'm still not sure on how it works though xD<br><br>The classes I can imagine are creativity, circuitry, and math.

Remember that Minecraft was never even made for PVP, so if it was a subject it wouldn't teach it .u.<br>It would most likely be Building Related things..<br>And redstone ._.

Get<br>Ready<br>For<br>The<br>Awesomeness...<br><br><b>PvP class</b><br><br>Basically learn all the different types of PvP servers, tactics and you have to 1v1 the teacher and win for the final exam,<br><br><b>Building</b><br><br>Learning how to ninja bridge, normal bridge, super block spamming (a tactic created by me, or at least I think so, to block spam, but in a way that you are placing multiple blocks on top of each other to jump up walls and make it harder for you to get hit. This would work with many different mouse clicking ways, jitterclicking for instance), breezily bridging and just learning to build beautifully. This would kind of be art class in a way, if you ignore the first ones I said.<br><br><b>Redstone</b><br><br>I don't know much about Redstone, so this would be a hard, yet useful class for me. You would learn howto make machines with pistons, redstone and so on.<br><br><b>Wizardry</b><br><br>This is how to make potions and brew all sorts of potions and that sort of stuff. Enchanting would be something too, so yeah.<br><br><b>Survival</b><b>/PvE</b><br><br>You would learn how to kill mobs, how much health they have and so on... A good way to practice this is to go on a flat world with creative all the supplies you need (I recommend full diamond and a sword with secondaries), get OptiFine, set the time on night only and put the difficulty on Hard. I do this all the time and it's really fun!<br><br><b>Basics</b><br><br>Learn all the blocks, and the ways to destroy them, their stats &nbsp;and so on. Also items, what they do and how to craft them.<br><br><b>Controls</b><br><br>Probably the easiest class, but you can customize and stuff. No homework :P.<br><br><b>Resource packs, mods an</b><b>d skins<br></b><b><br></b>Learn how to make resource packs, mods and skins. Probably the class with not much homework, but the homework given is in big amounts. This class calls for the most creativity and originality.<br><b><br></b><u>If I come up with more ideas I'll post them. :)</u><b><br></b><b></b>
