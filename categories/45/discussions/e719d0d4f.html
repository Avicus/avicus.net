Welp, it's been a great 14 months here, I made so many friends and what-not, but i'll just cut to the chase.<br><br>I'm very bored of avicus. The competitive spark that was once here, seems absent. it just seems like an endless grind to infinity.<br><br>I'll still be playing minecraft, but you'll find me on badlion, OCN and Kohi (w0wOCNBetitwascauseugotdemoted)<br><br>Will I still be on TS? Of fucking course I will be.<br><br>Forums? Ye boy<br><br>Skype? Ye boyyy<br><br>In-game Somewhat. I wont be playing at all, but occaisonally I'll pop in every once in a while to play a match or 2, but I wont return fully til the winter update (Or spring cmon funky :c) comes out, considering I had access to docs about what IS coming in the next update, Im pretty damn excited to see how the next page of avicus will turn out.<br><br>Until then, I hope you all enjoy yourselves here, it truly is an amazing experience to be involved in this community, even if I may not be in-game much anymore.<br><br>Also, to the new and old staff members, Keep improving, because even if you think you're doing a good job, you should still have that feeling of "I need to improve" Even if you're doing excellent, theres always room for improvement.<br><br>Bye goys, til the next update is out, Ill see you in my future endeavors!<br><br>(rip 94 ingame days played)

Woah hold up. I didn't mean it's been delayed or anything. Contrary to popular belief, the update will be called the "Nise Update" as opposed to the "Winter Update".
