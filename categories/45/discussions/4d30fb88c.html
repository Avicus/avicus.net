So I want a new mouse, my current mouse (Mionix Naos 3200&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://mionix.net/mice/naos-3200/">http://mionix.net/mice/naos-3200/</a>) is a really hardcore palm grip mouse and this makes the mouse difficult to jitterclick on which I'll need for PvP and Shooter games (I'm probably going to get CS:GO). Basically I need a good mouse for&nbsp;<b>Claw Grip</b> &amp;&nbsp;<b>Palm Grip</b>. When I jitterclick I use Claw, but I also sometimes prefer the control you get with Palm. I've taken a look at the Razer Deathadder, but Razer's products are overpriced and I know there's options as good as a Razer mouse for cheaper. &nbsp;<b></b><u>I was looking at getting a mouse that's $100 and under.</u><br><br>Thanks,&nbsp;<br>-ShadowSlayerZ7

I use a <a rel="nofollow" href="http://gaming.coolermaster.com/en/products/mice/recon/">Cooler Master Storm Recon</a>&nbsp;and it's quite good in my opinion. It has on-the-fly DPI settings (4 of them,) macros (don't cheat with them :P,) LED lighting (customizable!) and a nice build overall with good rubber grip. I jitter click with it and it works fine (I have a palm grip, btw.)<br><br>I've used Logitech gaming mice in the past and they're pretty good, but I can't give any recommendations since I don't use their products that much anymore.

My only concern with mice like that is you have to press the end of left click to jitterclick the mouse, giving me less control over the mouse. :P

Razer Deathadder. Amazing mouse, a bit pricey, but it's very good. If you don't like it, I would recommend Croc's mouse.

I have the Logitec G502 and it works really well for my purposes. (Which aren't very demanding.) I just have the f5 button changed to a button on the side and use the quick DPI adjustment buttons alot. Also the feel is nice and its pretty easy to jitterclick with.
