Hello guys I'm Tully, but you probably know me as TheDiamondGecko (If you do know me)<br><br>Now, I'd like to firstly clear some things up, because some particular staff of Avicus have given me quite a bad reputation, I don't know if it was intentionally, but they have.<br><br>Okay so, you might know me as the "Skype Spammer" or the "Sub Whore" Or anything basically along those lines. Which I can see where people are coming from when they call me those things, or even just think those things.<br><br>HOWEVER!&nbsp;<br><br>1. I do not "Spam" My skype contacts, I have a public skype (For fans) And a private skype (For close friends) I broadcast the rare message showing off a video I created. This gets broadcasted maybe once a month on average. I understand that people do consider these type of messages spam, and I completely respect and understand their opinion on that, and that is why I include in all messages "If you would like to not be notified about these messages feel free to turn off notifications from me or delete me" Because I know for a fact 90% Of my fan skype wants those messages there, and I apoligise but I will not stop sending them if you individually do not like them, when you can easily remove me. <br><br>2. I am not a "Sub Whore" Incase you don't know what a sub whore is, my belief is basically that it is an individual that tells people do subscribe to them all the time and they don't care about making videos, their content or anything. They just care about getting subscribers. Now this is probably the thing I laugh at the most considering I do daily uploads, have spent well over $1,000 on YouTube and I get barely anything out of it. I only have 500 subscribers, I am still a relatively small channel. I make approximately $0.30 Per video. That's thirty cents. It's close to nothing. The fact of it is, I don't care about the money.. Of course eventually it would be nice to make a little pocket money out of youtube because its something I am very passionate about and I love doing but seriously? I'm just doing this for fun, and to entertain people. I love doing this, and that's why I do it. Not to gain subscribers, not for money... none of that. I love this, and it's as simple as that. <br><br>Obviously people are going to take offence to this because I am speaking the truth and sometimes the truth can be annoying to some people. But hear me out guys, every one of you reading this. Every single one of you... I have absolutely nothing against you, I just like making videos. And as for the topics on Avicus about my videos is well... I still have a lot of fans on Avicus, and if you look at my threads I get a lot of negative feedback, it seems the only people that don't like it are some individual staff members. <br><br>This is the IMPORTANT PART: I want to make Avicus videos, I really, really do. The Avicus community is by FAR the most amazing community I've met in my life. But I want to know what you guys think? ... Should I go for it and do an Avicus series?

Attention seeking posts and updates are not allowed, it's clearly stated in the rules. And before you say that you're not seeking attention, let's count how many times you have the words "me", "my", "I" in your post.

Who in the staff gave you a bad reputation? I only see you posting about your channel over and over again even though you have no Avicus related videos, nobody has done anything that would affect you as a player on Avicus? Is it because of the post Para posted? Why didn't you stay to your original post?<br><br>Where were you called a spammer, skype-spammer or even a sub-whore? I can't find it either, are you just making it up because your last post got negative answers?<br><br>Where did you spend those "1,000 dollars" on youtube? I see you only have 4 - 5 videos, in what way did it cost you 1,000 dollars to create them? <br><br>I don't know you but I feel you are only "doing youtube" because others are, you are not doing it because you enjoy it and really want it. If it is about getting fame and becoming "big on youtube", you got a long long long way to go, as you only have 5 videos. <br><br>Don't do Avicus videos&nbsp;because the community wants you to, do Avicus videos&nbsp;because YOU want to, if you don't want to, please don't do it.

I recently restarted my channel and that's why I only hate about 10 videos. Also the reason I've spent $1,000 on &nbsp;youtube is because I needed to buy a new computer so I could record. Then I needed to buy a mic, ect ect. I did it because I want to, and basically I was just making an example that I am dedicated to youtube.
