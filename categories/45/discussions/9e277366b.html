I just want to know which company you think is the better and why. I want to use this for a business project. I think that Samsung is better because they use Android software and have a lot more apps then Apple.

Samsung is better because, Apple uses the next closest thing to slaves. They hire workers from 3rd world countries who would work extreme hours for low pay. That way, Apple gets to keep more profit. Everything that's an Apple phone isn't very customizable. You can only change the phone case. Samsung has many different lines of phones. I could go on and on. If you need help just ask on skype!

I could write essays about why each company has its pros and cons. If I had to choose which was better it would be apple. Simply because I am in love with both the software they write and the products they design.<br><br>Samsung produce a lot more then just phones and tablets. So most of their products aren't even in the same market as apple. HOWEVER, I could very strongly argue why apple's iPhones and iPads are far superior to samsung's line of phones and tablets.

LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL.<br><br>Ok, I gotta say. I've owned a (Windows: Laptop, Phone (Samsung etc), Desktop etc.)&nbsp;<br>(Apple: Phone, Macbook)<br><br>Alright, to a certain degree you are right. Apple is in fact a little better, but it absolutely sucks for gaming, Im not talking gear, like a Geforce, or and Intel i7 4930k... But the layout of the whole OS is just crap for Apple's desktops... Their mice are just one button, Im not sure if they recreated the OS, but 1 button isnt going to cut it, especially when you need to hold "Ctrl" key or whatever, to actually Right click (Pretty sure those were old OS's)<br><br>Now Windows... I cant stand the Microsoft cant get their shit together for viruses... Sure, its you're fault that you get a virus and you dont have an anti-virus... Im not talking about those... Im talking about<br><br>Jerusalem, RedAlert, Storm, Nimda etc.<br>(<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIqA66eYpC0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIqA66eYpC0</a>)<br><br>Those were mostly Trojan Horses, that hid in Emails, or sometimes even having a direct connection to the internet, and you not doing anything, yet still get affected... As with apple, their OS is much more&nbsp;sophisticated, and needs a lot more knowledge to hack or create a virus for it... And before you say "Apple isnt popular around the world, thats why"... Buy a mac then see..<br><br>TBH Apple and Windows and Microsoft in general all have their pros, and cons... I dont see the point in them arguing about each other.. they are both great Companies, and I'm happy they exist, and if they merge together, they will probably become a WAY better OS than Microsoft or Apple is at this day. Feel free to Adjust any points I made, as I probably made quite a few mistakes...

Please, Motorola all the way. My Moto G &lt;33<br><br>I'm not the biggest fan of Samsung or Apple. They both have their flaws, as so all other devices. Although I have never owned either, I've used newer Samsung and Apple phones, and they are not as great at everyone says they are. If I had to choose, however, I would choose Samsung.

Not a big fan of both. Apple is extremely overpriced and you can get much more pwerful phones for less. Samsung is better in my opinion, because their phones are cheaper and a <u>lot</u> more powerful. However Samsung has also started charging to much, so basically I like any Android that isn't overpriced.

In terms of tech companies, Apple would be better imho because it was/is pretty innovative (arguably), but overall Samsung is a much better company.<br>See, you guys forget the ton of companies part of samsung, afaik they have life insurance, shipbuilding, resorts, construction, all kinds of companies like that. So, I'd argue samsung since it's more diversified and it's a leader in so many different fields and is just so large like, it's like an amazing corporation.
