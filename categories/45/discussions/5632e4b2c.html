One day, I wanted to play walls and the server that I used to go on had removed walls. I found wallsmc.com on the minecraft server list and started to play it. Mczone, at this time, was only a walls server and did not have nebula or nexus. I enjoyed it and when nebula, nexus and survival games came out I started to play walls less and less. When avicus replaced mczone, everything was Better apart from the fact that Survival games was removed.

I actually found this server when I was looking for servers and I just typed in random ip addresses, so I typed in wallsmc.com and I was hocked on the Sky Wars and Ghost Squadron.

For my birthday, I got Minecraft. The same day I got it, after all my other friends left, I played it for the first time. I started out on hardcore, then got bored, and said "here, try out this server." Ip? Play.mczone.co making this my first server. :D<br><br>I found the community after someone told me I should join the forums.

On April 14, 2013. Clock was bored. His friends server got boring. He went to the Minecraft server list and found MC Zone. It had Walls, Sky wars, Ghost squadron, etc. I joined the server and loved it. So I've been in McZone/Avicus for one year and that's how I found out about this awesome server.
