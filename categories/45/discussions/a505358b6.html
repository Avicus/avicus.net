<span><span>Here's the thing.  You said a "jackdaw is a crow."

Is it in the same family?  Yes.  No one's arguing that.  

As someone who is a scientist who studies crows, I am telling you, 
specifically, in science, no one calls jackdaws crows.  If you want to 
be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either.  They're not the
 same thing.

If you're saying "crow family" you're referring to the taxonomic 
grouping of Corvidae, which includes things from nutcrackers to blue 
jays to ravens.  

So your reasoning for calling a jackdaw a crow is because random 
people "call the black ones crows?"  Let's get grackles and blackbirds 
in there, then, too.

Also, calling someone a human or an ape?  It's not one or the other, 
that's not how taxonomy works.  They're both.  A jackdaw is a jackdaw and a member of the crow family.  But that's not what you said.  You said a jackdaw is a crow, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all
 members of the crow family crows, which means you'd call blue jays, 
ravens, and other birds crows, too.  Which you said you don't.

It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?

Haha, I'm in the room with the author of the Corvid Blog right now, actually! She initially corrected me, but the point I'm making is that referring to jackdaws as a literal species of crow is incorrect. That's mainly what I'm trying to say, but sure, I'll concede to colloquially calling the genus "crows", though ravens and crows are much more related than crows and jackdaws, so if a jackdaw gets to be called a crow, so do ravens, which never happens.

You don't seem to even faintly understand taxonomy. Taxonomy is nested groups. Kingdom --&gt; Phylum --&gt; Class --&gt; Order --&gt; Family --&gt; Genus --&gt; Species. Remember? Corvidae is a "family."&nbsp;Corvus&nbsp;in a genus. Jackdaws are two specific species&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Corvus&nbsp;genus. A genus is more specific than a family. Are jackdaws in the "crow family?" Yes. Is the name of the "crow family" the "crows?" No. It's Corvidae. Members of that family are called corvids. If you're using a different name, it is colloquial and biologically incorrect. We do this to organize knowledge an animals for ease of understanding. Your usage of words is&nbsp;not&nbsp;easing understanding, it is confusing and no one does it except when they're incorrect.

Yes, I get that, and that's the problem.  I am not okay with that, that is why we are having this argument, remember?  The point is that you shouldn't refer to them all as crows.

So if you see a video of a blue jay, and someone says "hey, look at 
this crow video!" you wouldn't expect someone to correct them?

Here's the thing that you simply cannot understand.  When you call something a "crow," literally no one but you is thinking, "oh, he means a member of the Corvidae family!"  They are thinking "oh, this is an American crow!"  

You're confusing families with species common names.

A crow is a fairly black creature while the jackdaw resembles a dark navy blue. You see crows are part of the crow family totally different from the jackdaws. Crows and jackdaws are also different scientifically. A crow is a "corvus" coming from the family of Genus while a jackdaw is a "corvus monedula" and they act completely different. The area around the beak of a jackdaw is a lighter navy blue then the rest of the torso while a crow's is pitch black. A jackdaw also has a more equally coned back other then a crow who resembles a large narrow beak good for picking berries and other small crops. Now they may be part of the same family but they are completely opposite.

Jackdaws are particular species of crow. Other species have "crow" in their name, which is why I think that some people get confused. I have no idea why some are called crows and some are called jackdaws, it may even have a purpose. I know that the western jackdaw, the one in England was probably arbitrarily named. Like, it was a regional name given to the bird centuries ago, before taxonomy and biology became as important as they are today. The other jackdaw is almost identical in every way, but the colors of it's feathers are a bit different. So when comparing the two (which are probably similar enough to be considered the same species), it didn't make sense to call one of them a jackdaw and the other one some kind of crow.

You don't know what a meme is. It isn't some random pictures of pokemon. Kingoros played OCN long before he ever logged on to Avicus with the only intent of breaking rules.

My thread, my rules. You're honestly looking in the face of a forum ban if you think it's a good idea to keep arguing and going off topic after being warned by both the thread creator and a senior mod. Your image wasn't funny, and it wasn't known, it isn't a meme. A meme is an image that slowly gains popularitly through websites like reddit and 4chan and it's when it's already well known that people start messing about with it, for example the Extremely Photogenic Guy.<br><br>Now that you understand, leave.

Both. You guys don't understand what a meme is, it isn't just some 'funny' picture with a caption, or just a 'funny' picture, it has be be well known. Memes do not have to be a picture either by the way.

I don't think I'm being funny, I'm just doing what the thread says, posting memes, if you got a problem with it, deal with it, kid.

I recommend you stop. You have already been warned for instigating flame wars and action will be taken if you continue.

Both. You guys don't understand what a meme is, it isn't just some 'funny' picture with a caption, or just a 'funny' picture, it has be be well known. Memes do not have to be a picture either by the way.

Why do you care so much if its a meme or not?? Its a funny picture who cares??<br><br>Also, there is no such thing as a funny meme. The Illuminati thing isnt considered a meme. If u can find a meme that can make me laugh, You wont get anything cos there is no such thing as a funny meme.

Honestly, I really think this thread should just be Posting pictures, and maybe some captions on it, thats what i consider meme's. But a Flame war is not necessary for this situation :)<br><br>This is in no way i want to start one, just stating my opinion :)

You can post meme's but you have to wait for the creator of this thread to agree on it. I get its kinda dumb but that's what u have to do.

I think gibbo's definiton of memes is like you have to make it your own and use one of the popular meme templetes like<br><br>High expectatians asian dad,<br>One Does not simply...<br>Philosoraptor.<br><br>etc..<br><br><br>Not sure what he means but look what i posted. He says those are memes

I'm totally fine with this. My thread was a comeplete mess, mainly because I didn't really know what a meme was. I guess making a meme thread wasn't a good idea. Haha! <br>I'll try to find some "real" memes and post them on your thread. Peace out! △ △ △
