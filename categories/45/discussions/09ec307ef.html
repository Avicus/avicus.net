So, I need a really good gaming PC, most of you already know that I have a pretty good PC; however, I'm moving to the UK soon and I want to have a PC there because I don't want to carry my current one there then come back.<br><br>Budget: 2,500/3,500 pounds.

At 1080p and 1440p, &nbsp;the difference is minimal, with the 970 costing a bit less, the difference is, as you say, noted at 4K, given that money isn't really an issue in this case, yeah, you're probably right. I'll change the GPU.
