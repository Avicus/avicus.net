Hey guys!<br><br>Well, today as I write this, the date is September 28th, 2015. I thought today would be a necessary day to check up on you guys, because this day last year I got interviewed for Junior Moderator and ultimately got accepted. Crazy how time flies and how much changes in that time, eh? Anyway, I was just wondering, what's up? If you guys are relatively new and unaware, I am an ex 7 month Moderator, devoted over 1,000 hours into this server in total, demoted around 6 months ago, left trying to get that position back. Anyway, I have never been better before. I started school about 3 weeks ago, volunteered for the teen council in my community, where we discuss ideas for the community to improve for teenagers to enjoy, started my first&nbsp;<i>ever</i> soccer season, and even scored my first&nbsp;<i>ever</i> GOAL on Saturday at my game! Without Minecraft, I am a lot more social, I am making&nbsp;<i>way&nbsp;</i>more friends, getting a lot more involved in my community, getting my grades up, as well as my fitness. Also, my birthday is just around the corner, October 13th! One burning question I wouldn't be surprised you are probably asking yourself, "are you coming back?" The answer is no. I would be more than happy to, but I know the consequences would be severe.&nbsp;Anyway, enough of me, how are you guys doing? Let me know! Overall, I am doing great! Thanks guys :) &lt;3<br><br><b>Mods:&nbsp;</b>Not trying to make this a self-centered topic, just letting you guys know what's up and genuinely asking how you guys are doing. ;)

Ay, Pete.<br><br>I am Cyneric_/Cynderblock/whatever the hell I was called when you left.<br><br>Honestly, I'm kinda happy I left MC, too, since my story is completely identical to yours, except with crew instead of soccer. Anyways, wish we could talk, though probs not :(
