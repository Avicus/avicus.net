So, this morning, Apple finally announced the long-awaited iPhone 6 and the Apple Watch. <br><br>Personally, I love how the iPhone 6 looks, but I feel like the Watch could be thinner. The iPhone 6 wasn't really a surprise, since most of it had been leaked.<br><br>What are your thoughts/opinions on them?

I need a new phone and was considering changing to android just for the customisation options, os and the bigger screens but then Apple had to give me a 5.5 screen &gt;.&lt;<br><br>Even still the specs on it are not really as amazing as I thought... I know it might be a bit early to judge but by the looks of it the LG G3 blows it out of the water. Ill probably be going with the G3.

I will be getting an iphone 6 as soon as they are released, because I'm a mind controlled sheep and my iphone 4 is basically useless at this point.

The iPhone 6 is basically an iPhone 5s in an iPod 5 shell. Apple never really does anything spectacular when upgrading their iPhones, or devices in general. I am obsessed over Apple, and what they've done with the new iPhone 6, just saddens me. I am happy I got the 5s when I did.

I got the iPhone 5s last year, the day it came out (I had to skip school lol). Even though I agree that Apple barely does anything new with their iPhones, besides processing speed and occasionally a better camera, this year is different. They have NFC, a&nbsp;<i>f</i>/2.2 aperture on the camera, and ApplePay.

I forgot to mention, they hardly ever make any changes in their upgrades, unless they switch to a whole new version. Like, 4s to 5, 5 to 6. Upgrades like that they do a good job, but from 4 to 4s, or 5s to 5s, hell, even 5 to 5c..

I completely agree with you on that. 4 to 4S, all they added was Siri, and I haven't used that feature in years. 5 to 5s, they added Touch ID, but I don't even have it enabled :P

I'm a little bit sad that apple kinda made their phones huge now like samsung phones (which I hate because of how big they are). But overall, they made it look nicer than samsung phones so I guess that's good. And since I don't want a huge phone, I'll be getting the 4.7 inch one when it comes out :D :D :D

The watch is a little different from the iPod Nano, even though it seems similar, but the watch actually had a lot of features that the Nano doesn't. <br><br>Btw you can get OS X Yosemite developer preview right now, and you don't even need to be a developer. I have it.

I'm also happy with the iPhone 5S. Maybe if Apple kept the glass on the back of the iPhone 6, I would've liked it more...

For what do you need a watch? You have to have a Iphone to use the watch and if you have a Iphone, then yoh can use it and watch is useless xD Well I don't want a Iphone, cuz it's tooo expensive for me. I also saw in the last time, the Iphone tells the User what he has to do and at the normal phones (samsung, HTC, ...) the User tells what the phone has to do. I want to tell the phone what it has to do... And I'm a proud WindowsPhone user, it has soo much space for customation, the home site and the size of the app pictures. Well an Iphone is nothing for me.
