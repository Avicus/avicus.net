</h1>
Bunch of terrorist attacks this morning in Belgium. Two bombs at the airport and one at the train station sending Europe into another state of shock. The Islamic terrorist group, Isis claimed responsibility. Why is this happening? I don't personally like to place all the blame on the religion that the group worships but so many targeted attacks involving extremist groups in the news. Another bunch of people killed for no reason.<br><br>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/mar/22/brussels-airport-explosions-live-updates">http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2016/mar/22/brussels-airport-explosions-live-updates</a><br><br>And I also just found out that the famous ex mayor of Toronto Rob Ford passed away from cancer at 46. :(<br><br><a href="http://m.huffpost.com/ca/entry/9522654">http://m.huffpost.com/ca/entry/9522654</a><br><br>Really sad day in the news. :(

Well, shit.<br><br>ISIS is a threat - yes, but what the world needs is a leader that will address the problems that the countries in those regions are causing.<br><br>US and Israel are a problem as well within those regions. There's no denying it.<br><br>I personally believe that everyone involved in this has a problem and ISIS rose because they were tired of all the nonsense happening around them.<br><br>But it's ironic since they are also causing problems. Unnecessary ones.<br>Just a senseless clusterfuck around that region with hideous and atrocious foreign policy and diplomacy.<br><br>Also, sorry about the mayor of Toronto, hope that he is in a better place now. <br><br>We need a vaccine or something that injects machines into the body that identifies and kills cancer cells or a liquid that allows the immune system to better identify cancer cells.

I don't think ISIS would be such a threat if they actually tried to stop it (obviously we can't just bomb the shit out of ISIS because of the consequences). I mean, what does ISIS even have? Sand.<br>And unfortunately oil.

Yeah one that's not accurate and two religious reasons is just a fore front for the war the underlying cause is almost always something like oil.

I don't want to live in a world where I am constantly in fear for my life; where I know that simply walking down the street&nbsp;could&nbsp;be the last thing I will ever do. Although there are forces to protect us from harm at all costs, there is almost always a way to get past that. Being born into the time that I was, I know not of true peace or unity; to be carefree, not worrying about the "sketchy-looking" stranger walking behind me. I am always on the lookout, always suspecting the worst of others. I am taught to avoid certain people and to carry a weapon on me at all times. We shouldn't be living like this. We should all be living together in harmony, saying, "Hello" to people passing by. In this world today, no true peace can ever be established. In fact, it's almost impossible to sustain that peace (if reached) because of human nature itself. Honestly, the state that the world is in today is quite horrible. <br><br>I have no clue if any of that made sense or is incomplete, but I really just needed to vent.<br><br>Please everyone, stay safe out there.

I don't want to live in a world where I am constantly in fear for my life; where I know that simply walking down the street&nbsp;could&nbsp;be the last thing I will ever do.

Being born into the time that I was, I know not of true peace or unity; to be carefree, not worrying about the "sketchy-looking" stranger walking behind me. I am always on the lookout, always suspecting the worst of others. I am taught to avoid certain people and to carry a weapon on me at all times. We shouldn't be living like this. We should all be living together in harmony, saying, "Hello" to people passing by. In this world today, no true peace can ever be established. In fact, it's almost impossible to sustain that peace (if reached) because of human nature itself. Honestly, the state that the world is in today is quite horrible. <br><br>I have no clue if any of that made sense or is incomplete, but I really just needed to vent.<br><br>Please everyone, stay safe out there.

The media is to blame. I believe they're the reason for all this assumption and misconception on the Muslim faith. They are greedy and only in it for the money, literally only broadcasting something <i>relatable </i>for/to them; hence why we rarely hear about 'things' occurring in more concerned places in the world.

Here's the reasons:<br>1. If newspapers all reported on everything bad that their home countries did morale and patriotism would be at an all time low.<br>2. News outlets in the history of countries such as the US have been censored and attacked when reporting such stories<br>3. While such news outlets do exist today they are attacked literally and verbally. Ex. Charlie Hebdo<br>4. As a people we are sheep, easily flocked to one mindset, therefore we choose to accept the news standards of CBS, NBC, CNN and FOX<br>5. This mass over exposure of American related issues can only be our own fault (as a people) as we continue to not only support organizations that promote censorships but the government officials having their war chests filled with the money of corporate America.

<p>(From a U.S. standpoint, I don't know enough to say about other countries) The problem with ISIS isn't their numbers or military strength. If anything they could be easily taken care of if the circumstances allowed for such. Unfortunately what makes this entire situation much more laborious to deal with is that the U.S. can deploy 100,000 soldiers and get rid of ISIS's control over their territory, but that is not a convenient method as it would be expensive and we don't want to sacrifice soldiers again (as we already did within the last decade or two, and this action was seriously rebuked by society). Another method that can be taken (Trump's method <b>**Vomits after hearing Trump's name**</b>) is to blow them to smithereens. This is also a horrible decision as what many people don't realize is that there are innocent civilians who still live in that territory. What&nbsp;one has to realize is that these&nbsp;people are also trying to survive the daily attacks and threats from ISIS. They are fighting starvation and&nbsp;even if they were to leave (which is already difficult because of ISIS&nbsp;holding&nbsp;them with a knife on their throats)&nbsp;Many countries&nbsp;do not want&nbsp;to take in these refugees and even if they did, these refugees are too poor to&nbsp;actually even get to the countries, nonetheless survive there. So bombing the area where ISIS has their control is out of the question, unless killing more innocent people in a hypocritical way seems like the proper course of action. Due to these two methods (which would usually work with every other military situation since there's a battlefield) being inefficient and morally wrong, it is&nbsp;difficult beyond measure&nbsp;to destroy the power base of ISIS which would probably lead to the abolition to ISIS as a whole. </p><p>&nbsp;About the irrational fear of all Muslims, what really needs to be done is people need to spread awareness about what ISIS is and how not every Muslim is not a terrorist.

No, I'm pretty sure the statement you said about most crimes in the U.S. and Canada being committed by a Muslim is very false. Also, Islam not once says to go out and commit crimes like this. It actually has very strict punishments against such things, so even if a person who is Muslim happens to commit a crime, it certainly has nothing to do with them being Muslim. If a Muslim truly followed the rules of the religion, they wouldn't do these crimes, and the fact that they do commit these crimes proves that they aren't true Muslims.

The murders (in Ottawa) and terrorist attacks in Canada are mostly Muslim. Its not 100% fact that I can blame all crimes on Islam but you can make the connection that most of the people are followers of Islam. Not trying to sound racist or anything but its stuff like that media won't cover because of islamaphobia.

Actually Donald Trump's idea to get rid of ISIS is to murder their families (Which is a WAR CRIME by the way.)<br><br>@OP Although I'm really saddened by this, they way Western Media works we never hear about attacks elsewhere in the world, and a post like this could be made basically every week if we lived in other places.

Technically the terrorists on the news now are in an extremist branch of Islam, but if you ask Muslims they probably won't consider them part of their religion.

Why does everyone think Muslims are terrorists? Why is the <i>general </i>public <i>generalizing </i>Muslims and ISIS are together? They aren't, infact, they are completely seperate to the extremest groups - it's just the terrorists believe that all other religions are their enemies. MANY Muslim leaders have spoken out in public in debates and have said it themselves:- they condemn the extremest group's actions greatly.<br><br>Felt like saying that, may have been out of no where but oh well :P

You have to understand where they're coming from. They don't do this for no reason, but I understand this is extreme and unnecessary.<br><br>Disrespect, racism, and violence happen against Muslims. If a white man bombs a place, it's an attack. If it's a Muslim bombing, it's a terrorist. Trump wants to put a "special band" on Muslims, while ISIS is putting a bad impression on Muslims.&nbsp;<br><br>Kim Jong Un, nothing is done about him. If you watch a few videos, he feeds this people rotten cucumbers, and if they don't eat them all, they are beaten until they vomit blood. Yet all everyone thinks is Muslims are the real threat. Some are, but most are trying to be safe from people trying to hurt them even though they're innocent.&nbsp;<br><br>In the quaran, (for those of you who don't know what that is,it is the Islamic version that is similar to the bible) it doesn't say anything about bombing innocent victims. Yet, I don't understand why they think it is under the "Will of God". But when you think of what has been discriminated against them for years, you see how they do this for a reason, even though it is extreme and should be nowhere near a reaction this harsh

I'm not saying that you are discriminating against Muslims. I'm just telling you that if he is Muslim, then your post is completely off topic because it doesn't relate to terrorism. If it does, in fact, relate to ISIS or Al Qaeda or any other organization, then saying he is Muslim is just objectively wrong. Because he probably isn't.<br><br>The news station is probably trying to appeal to the ignorant public, saying that the man was Muslim to give everyone without a clue what he believes and looks like. It's like saying that a Korean man killed 5 people and the news refers to him as "Asian". If the guy was an actual terrorist, once again, they would be completely wrong.&nbsp;<br><br>I mean really, do we really trust the news?<br><br><img src="http://assets0.ordienetworks.com/images/user_photos/1190916/cnn%20photo_width_640x.JPG" title="Image: http://assets0.ordienetworks.com/images/user_photos/1190916/cnn%20photo_width_640x.JPG">

I am aware of the politics of Crimea, as it used to be a piece of Russian land. However, it was gifted to the Ukrainians. Alas, that does not give Russia the right to annex the land through pressure.

Quite upsetting it is about the incident in Brussels. Hate extremists, they're just pathetic thinking that what they believe is right - "Oh yeah let's kill a bunch of innocent people because we will go to heaven". That completely contradicts what they are saying it's just sad.

Very, very sad, a couple of days before Easter too. :(<br>RIP to those who died. My condolences to their family.<br><br>This has just reminded us that an attack can happen anywhere at any time. Thinking about it now, I'm sure every single airport is going to consider upgrading their security as well as being on constantly alert for supisicous activity. As for the UK, I'm flying out soon so I seriously hope they take this into mind.
