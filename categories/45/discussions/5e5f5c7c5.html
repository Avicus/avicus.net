You set an autoclicker to the speed that you click at? Because I can control jitter clicking at 14 cps but I'm worried that I will get arthritis if I carry on, so I was wondering if I could set an autoclicker to 14 cps since the only advantage I'm getting is not harming my body over a game...

But I thought the reason autoclicker wasn't allowed is because some people set it to 30 cps and walk into people combo'ing them, however in this case I'm setting it to a click speed that is reasonable and I CAN achieve. I just don't want to risk getting an illness over a game.

If you were to constantly jitter click for several hours a day, for several years, you would most likely get injured somehow. I doubt they'd all of a sudden get "messed up", though.

He can click that fast and control it. I've seen him play and 1v1'd him several times. If you can provide proof of you jitterclicking at whatever speed, imo you should be able to a set macros/autoclicker at that speed.

The person who'd stopped jittering would have one hell of a time trying to hit the other tbh.

If it's a matter of personal health, but still wanting to be at that high level, it's a little more serious :P&nbsp;<br><br>Crusty's worries are definately warranted. But at the same time, to compete with people at his level he needs jitter.

Did I say you need jitter to be good? No I didn't and nowhere did I state that.

If you're at a really high level...something that you wouldn't understand. Does Jozz need jitter to compete? No. Does Boxings_ need jitter to compete? No. But if facing people who can jitter at their level, which would be a lot of people, it's next to nessicary, really.

You don't need to jitter click to compete with higher level PvPers. Yes, it has it's benefits, but you don't&nbsp;<b>need</b> it.<br><br>Honestly, this argument isn't even what the topic is about. Back to the main point, autoclicker will never be legal for PvP, period.

1. You're missing my point. I'm saying you're taking the game much too seriously. Looking up to good players as idols is just ridiculous.<br><br>2. Last time I checked it's D00ZiE finding holes in your excerpts. You're both discussing the validity and logic behind your arguments. Don't vilify him simply because he doesn't agree with you.

I'm not going to say anymore after this because I would rather not have this continue because it's not worth it. <br><br>But I just wanted to clear up that I do not look up to those players as "Idols". I just recognize their skill and aknowledge that as a fact. Anyone who knows me also knows that I'm not much of the fanboy type. They could rek me and I aknowledge that. Just because I aknowledge their skill doesn't mean I respect them or look up to them in any way as such (no hate).&nbsp;<br><br>I'm not as serious as you think, I'm just passionate in terms of my beliefs. xP&nbsp;<br>And I just have a lot of ideas to write xD

I jitterclick like crazy and don't have any health issues from it at all. If you're that worried about it, either stop jitterclicking or you may want to find a new game.<br><br>Anyways, sorry, but it's illegal.

You're more likely to get arthritis from masturbating than jitterclicking.
