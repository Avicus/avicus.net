Hello everyone!<br>I discovered a few days ago that I have reached (and surpassed :O) 100 subscribers!<br>It may not seem like a lot to those with 1000+ *coughpewdiepiecough* but I couldn't be happier! :D<br><br>Honestly, I wouldn't have done it without Avicus. Some of you have watched my videos and have even subscribed, and I can't thank you enough. Sometimes I'll be in a game and someone mentions how they've watched my videos and compliment on how they enjoyed them. It makes me feel proud of myself, where before I've had to encourage myself with nothing, just to pump out new content. You're the ones who have motivated me to keep making videos. Cheers!<br><br>Also, suggestions on a 100 sub special? I'm still thinking :P

Really, you deserve way more. You shouldn't be thanking us, you should be thanking yourself! If it wasn't for you amazing videos, I wouldn't have subscribed. I want to thank <i>you</i> for making them and entertaining me.<br>I can't wait to see your channel grow :D
