Well as lots of you may have noticed peachy is now at the top of the non donors board. I would ask for his removal since he earned his xp with diamond. Thank you.

He earned his exp through fighting. Does this mean we should also remove anyone who used the vote exp from the list to? No.

Wtf are you on about? Peachy earned his xp 2.5 times faster than everyone on that board therefore, not in a confrontational way, he needs to be removed from it.Thanks for clearing that up notal too with ibiza.

Jozz was diamond too then got his rank removed :/, maybe they should change the leaderboards to base xp as unupgraded and total xp as all players. If they want just add base xp section

Jozz has an alt i think it was Iprokiller or something. No archadonic, you have either not read this post properly or not kept yourself up to date on the server, peachy has not had his rank removed he moved&nbsp;it to his new account, civilcharmander. Therefore he needs to be removed from the non-donator leaderboards as he earned his xp using diamond and if jozz has had his diamond permanently removed then he also needs to be removed from the non donators leaderboard, it is unfair.

_IProKiller is zeus's alt that jozz used because his account got hacked. PeachyYas should be given a rank to get him off the un ranked and jozz is confusing...

Ah okay, thanks for clearing that up build high, so jozz i guess you are the best to ask here, is your loss of diamond permanent or not?&nbsp;<b></b>Because if it is then you also need to be removed from the non donators board. No offence but it is kinda&nbsp;<u></u>unfair.

I don't want to split because I paid for the full price of Diamond. If I were to do that^^, I would lose some privileges that I use a lot. (Such as the villiger pet).
