Soooo I was a week away from getting my braces off, and I was playing in a volleyball game. Of course I called for the ball at the same time my friend did and we ended up bumping into each other. As I tried to get up, I was knocked down again and my teeth went straight down onto the gym floor. Hard. So yay I get my braces delayed ;-; Now my front tooth is sensitive and I might have to go to the dentist, and if it gets worse I might get a root canal I CRI EVERYTIME

Hey Storm, I feel so bad for you :( I hear braces hurt. However,<br>&nbsp;"Discussions surrounding personal updates is frowned upon as they are meant to be inclusive rather than oriented around a single person. Punishments for this will only be distributed in the event that a user continually uses the discussions for this purpose alone."&nbsp;If you do want to talk about it, perhaps try Skype :)<br><br><b>Locking...</b>
