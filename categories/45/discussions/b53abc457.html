Same happend with me while I tried to log in from mobile. I fixed it with going on comp where the pass is already saved, but DONT press "cape". Go to "login" , and then go to "cape" (after you have logged in).<br>This worked for me, and I hope it works for you :)

If you're already logged in then why would you need to log it again?
