</h1>
Hello, all. I'm just trying to get to know you all better, so I thought I might ask: what are your biggest interests? They can be anything, as long as they aren't inappropriate and/or irrelevant.<br><br>My interests include:<br><ul><li>Geography and history, particularly wars and countries at risk of being invaded soon.</li><li>Electricity. Using a kit that I've had since I was 5 or 6 years old, I created (from scratch) an OR gate, an AND gate, a NOR gate, a NAND gate, an XOR gate, and an XNOR gate using only batteries, wires, two switches (of course), a resistor, and a diode.</li><li>Cartoons. I may not be a 90's kid, but boy, do I love 90's cartoons, and even up until about 2009, they were still pretty good. Then 2009 came and it just went downhill from there...</li><li>Super Smash Bros, especially the Wii U version. I don't play it competitively, but I consider myself to be OK at it. (Gamer ftw!)</li><li>Crew. I row, and I'm especially happy to be rowing because I have a race tomorrow and I just did a 2k in 7 minutes 30.4 seconds (And I just got promoted to 1st boat! :D).</li><li>The Avicus network. I got to admit, I wasn't sure about this when I first came to this server, but once I got settled in, I knew there was no turning back. Keep up the good work, guys!</li></ul>Even though I know I have more to talk about than this, do we happen to have any interests in common based on the above information?<br><br>Thanks for reading, hope to see you online! :)

Map Making, I have built around 40 maps that can be found in the Avicus Network.<br><br>Fairy Tail. I would say anime in general, but to be honest, this is the anime I've sticked to the longest and I'm not getting tired of it.<br><br>Homestuck, a rather&nbsp;<i>unique</i> webcomic made by Andrew Hussie. It's... strange yet it doesn't seem to let go of my attention.<br><br>Architecture. I love building on Minecraft, but I also have high hopes to be able to follow an architecture career in the future.<br><br>Swimming. I enjoy swimming a lot and it has been a sport that has helped me a ton.<br><br>Writing stories. I used to spend part of my time writing short, silly stories that most likely revolved around fantasy and combat between characters.

That's awesome!<br><br>I also like to write, but I also like to draw, so what I might do in the near future is make a comic to myself titled, "Cartoon Clash" where I take 10 cartoon characters from 10 different shows and make them live in a house together for 30 days.

Drawing: I like to sketch out things on paper, I may take video game characters and change them a bit. I'll then scan it onto my computer and do the lineart colouring and shading :)<br><br>Writing: I love to write. Mainly fictional things, I find it relaxing and great to stretch my imagination.<br><br>Photography: Sometimes, when the day is right, I'll go outside and sit with my camera at the ready. Whenever I see a good shot, I'll go ahead and take it.<br><br>Archery: This is great fun when I need to chill. I may shoot randomly (but carefully) around, or set up some targets.<br><br>Photoshopping: I love to photoshop! It's amazing when I want a challenge, or just something to do.<br><br>Gaming: Well, that's pretty self-explanatory.<br><br>Socialising: Hanging out with my friends, or chatting over Skype and TS, it's all good fun!<br><br>Computer things: Sometimes, with old laptops around the house, I'll take them apart and rebuild them. It's good fun.<br><br>Robotics: Designing robots, programming them, that kind of stuff!<br><br>(This list is really long xD)<br><br>Playing an instrument: Drums, voice, piano. That stuff :)<br><br>Reading: What can I say? It's great!<br><br>Imagining: Sometimes, I'll put on my headphones and just imagine things. Things that can happen in real life, or crazy random things. It's great to do, except when I drift off during schooltime :P<br><br>That's not even the start ;)

Ling-Ling. He was awesome. But, judging from my profile pic, you can probably tell that Spanky (the somewhat poorly drawn pig) is my favorite character. And Wooldoor (the poorly-conceived Spongebob spoof) is up for that position, too.

Her name was Clara. Imo, she was pretty funny at times, but also really racist, which kinda made me not like her as much. Sorry :/<br><br>Also, I have planned out the casts for the next 2 seasons of "Cartoon Clash" as well, and they are as follows:<br><br>Season 2:<br><ul><li>Rainbow Dash (MLP: FiM)</li><li>Cartman (South Park)</li><li>Bart (The Simpsons)</li><li>Ed (Ed Edd n Eddy)</li><li>Otto (Rocket Power)</li><li>Stimpy (Ren &amp; Stimpy)</li><li>Buttercup (The Powerpuff Girls)</li><li>Bender (Futurama)</li><li>Rocko (Rocko's Modern Life)</li><li>Peter (Family Guy)</li></ul>Season 3:<br><ul><li>Lisa (The Simpsons)</li><li>Edd (Ed Edd n Eddy)</li><li>Bloo (Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends)</li><li>Jenny (My Life as a Teenage Robot)</li><li>Pinkie Pie (MLP: FiM)</li><li>Katara (Avatar: The Last Airbender)</li><li>Leela (Futurama)</li><li>Stewie (Family Guy)</li><li>Stan (South Park)</li><li>Bubbles (The Powerpuff Girls)</li></ul><br>If you guys have any suggestions for characters I should use in the future, I will definitely consider using them for season 4 and on. Only thing: sorry anime fans, but no anime characters.
