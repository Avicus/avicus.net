Discriminatory Terms

Gotta love making a post about a controversial topic, but if I don't do it, I'm not sure anybody will. Previously, people were asked to take a vote on whether or not the term "beaner" should be considered racist or not, and the community voted that it is not.<br><br><ul><li>First of all, I would like to point out that the vote was open to everybody, which includes people that could either use beaner, or people that the term doesn't offend. (which I understand that its not exactly to make it only open to a certain group of people)</li><li>Secondly, a community shouldn't decide if a word is discriminatory or not, what a group of people says doesn't change what something means.</li></ul><br>It literally says word for word in the dictionary "informal, offensive"<br><a href="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/beaner" title="Link: https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/beaner">https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/beaner</a><br><br>A group of people shouldn't be able to change the definition of a word, no matter what it is.<br><ul><li>Also, why should beaner be treated any differently than somebody saying "nigger" or "nigga"? All of them are terms used to offend a certain group of people. If we punish for one, why do we not punish for another? It doesn't make sense.</li></ul><br>I would also like to point out that the Hispanic community is a huge one. The "beaners" are a large part of Avicus, and should be treated equally to the rest of the community.<br><br>Now, not only do I want to address using "beaner" but I also think that if we're fixing one problem, why not fix them all. I think that all discriminatory terms should be treated equally. These include things like: nigger, nigga, beaner, wetback, negro, cracker, slant, and the list goes on. Any and all discriminatory terms, including ones directed towards race, sex, and religion,&nbsp;should be punished, and punished equally.&nbsp;<br><br>And this is coming from me, a white male who has never had a single slur used against him. I have just seen them used in game before, and it bothers me that only some of them are being punished for, rather than all of them.<br><br>We'll see where this post goes, and hopefully some sort of change will come to how staff deal with racism and racist slurs.<br><br>Best Regards,<br>Isaac

People referring to others with a term is very much so different than people who know each other and are both of the race the term refers to. In our society, it is completely acceptable for people to do that. It is when that word is used to harm somebody that it becomes a problem, which is what people have been doing on Avicus.<br><br>An example of what I referred to in this post is how you see African Americans call each other the "n word" all around. When they do this, it is not meant to do any harm.

I care so much because I'm tired of seeing people fighting about it in chat, and I want to try to stop that from happening anymore, because well, it's really annoying. Plus, I really do think all of the things I've said should be put in place. I wouldn't like it if I were to have racial slurs used against me if I were put into their place. I would especially get tired of seeing it over and over and nobody doing anything about it. It's become excessive, and I've even seen some of the Hispanic community agree in game that it is meant to be racist when used in a harmful way.

Nowhere in my reply did I say anything about mods&nbsp;<i>not</i> punishing people. A mod can't tell if it is being used in a friendly manner or not, and should punish either way in a situation where a term is used in game.&nbsp;<i></i>If a racial slur is used and directed towards anybody, no matter its intent, it should be punished for. If people want to use it in a friendly manner, keep it to a private place, or a place where everybody is ok with it. Because even if the person who said it meant no harm, and the person they said it to is fine with it, somebody else may take offense to it.

If what you're referring to is the posts in which you've provided earlier, I simply look at those as if they are in the past. Although they did use the term, calling themselves it, it is in the past. In the future, hopefully there will be no tolerance for posts on forums, or actions in game using slurs, no matter what the intent. But those posts were made when using the term was allowed, and should not be punished, locked, or removed because of it.

I have seen mods ban people on the server for using the N word, no matter what they say their race is. I've seen friends trying to cover for their peers by saying "Oh they're black it is ok", but the punishment stands. I don't see how beaner is any different from other racial slurs. If the word is permitted on the server why wouldn't people refer to themselves as it, and why wouldn't other people call them that?? I don't see other races referring to themselves as racial terms that are not allowed. Hopefully the usage of beaner will be restricted, and when a mod attempts to punish you, it will work. jajaajajjaja ex de

When I was a mod, I would always punish for the use of discriminatory terms, even if the victim of the term was not of the ethnic origin that the term refers to.&nbsp;<b>All</b> mods should be doing this, and I recommend reporting if you see a mod who does not do this. Exceptions should not be made where racism/prejudice/homophobia/other is concerned.

That...doesn't make any sense whatsoever. It's like someone calling another player a discrimatory term for a homosexual and expecting other players not to be offended by it simply because it does not relate to them. It's called empathy, and even if the OP was not offended by it it is still against the rules and should be treated as such.

I called the threads "Meet the Beaner" to make it funny, because there were a lot of others interviews with a similiar name. Also, I and talked to Javipepe (Senior Moderator) to know if I can call the threads "Meet the Beaner" and he told me that i can.

The N word and beaner are not that much different apart from the fact that beaner is a term that comes from the word bean, which Latinos, mainly Mexicans eat "a lot". The N word is directly linked to when black people were discriminated (I don't know the history much so I'm just going to say discriminated).

The N word and beaner are not that much different apart from the fact that beaner is a term that comes from the word bean, which Latinos, mainly Mexicans eat "a lot". The N word is directly linked to when black people were discriminated (I don't know the history much so I'm just going to say discriminated).

I've talked to Fouled and we've decided we're going to start punishing people for using it. If it does offend people then it falls under,&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><i>Provoking or insulting people or a group&nbsp;</i>and therefore it should be and from now on will be punishable.&nbsp;</span>
