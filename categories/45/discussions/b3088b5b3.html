AU Server?

Maybe it's time for Avicus to start thinking about hosting an au or eu server?<br><br>I mean, surely they get enough money for it, and Avicus is growing. I have a gaming clan and we usually practice for an hour a day on nexus to get our pvp skills up, and we all have decent internet. We lag a bit and it's really bothering us. We've discussed it and we don't want to leave Avicus but we are going to have to train somewhere else unless an au server is implemented :/&nbsp;<br><br>It's not just about us obviously, avicus has a lot of australian users and I'm sure that they would benefit a lot out of it too.

Australian hosting is expensive, I host my own AU Server. But Avicus CLEARLY has enough money, I've seen So so so many donators out there and as a server owner, I can clearly tell that they are earning more money then they're spending on the server... A LOT more. And I don't mind if the server owner/managers or whoever is recieving the income spends it on, as long as they are spending &nbsp;a bit on the server but I think they should consider benefiting the server and trying out new things such as an au server. also I know you fishisea from KevinEssences kit pvp server.

"100% of profits made from donating are used to help the server"- from someone in a high position...<br>anyways there has been a big discussion on this and IvyCode said we are NOT likely to host a new server and if we did it would be hosted in EU.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;Probably not going to happen &nbsp;;(

There are more Europeans rather than Australians in Avicus, funky said it himself, if we will make a new server it will be EU.

I dont believe you know how much money funky is spending. No one really does but him and the admin team I believe.<br>So I would suggest not acting as if you know what is being done behind the scenes where the money is being transferred.<br>and It would simpy be more beneficial to have an EU rather than an AU server?

Well, I like the idea even though I don't live there, but eventually they are going to run out of money for the servers, (not many will want to donate with the EULA) and one thing leads to another...

There is literally no use. I live in Sydney and I get 280 ping average. If you are getting anywhere over 300 ms, there is something wrong that is not server side or latency side. <br><br>Ping does not play a big part in Avicus style pvp, sure it might in Battlefield, or Call of Duty, or even some Minecraft styles, such a pot and soup pvp, but in Avicus it has very little impact.

My ping is any server is around 600, I have a ban internet and I dan confirm that even with that ping it doesn't affect much unless I am doing some kind of 1v1

Although there's the money issue, I think an AU server is more needed than EU. Sure there are less AU players, but EU players get a good ping to the server anyway, so it's unnecessary.

Avicus already has one server to worry about. I don't think that it wants to host another one...<br><br>And with EULA...who knows what's gonna happen...

If I had to choose between AU and EU I would go AU cuz they get a much higher ping.&nbsp;<br><br>However...<br>At the times I go on (usually at like 4 PM EST), there are about 400-600 players online. Having a second server will reduce the amount by about half, so lets say 200 players on 1 server, which is pretty low. Avicus just isn't big enough to host a second server right now.

Imagine this. Having to pay for over 100+ that can hold 16+ players and be good quality then paying for others things on top of that. You think he has left over money to have another one? Double the price just to have like 200 people on it?

I would like to say that it would be more beneficial to host the other server in Europe, firstly there are more people in Europe and then we get bad ping anyway. Also, whoever says that they get bad ping, I get worse, everyone was telling me that I teleport a lot in Avicus and I lag a lot. But this isn't because of my Computer or Internet, it is because Avicus is hosted in Canada. Then my second point is, that we shouldn't make an extra server anyway if you think about it. Averagely, we get 600 players each day and our server capacity is 2500. We need more popularity to make another server for Avicus, otherwise it is no use, we would get 300 in each server which is useless. If we boost the popularity up, to 2000 players a day, then we could implement this new server. Sorry if this induces rage but to boost popularity, of which of mczone, I think that we need Survival Games back, it is the main thing that boosted up the popularity in Mczone, it was the reason that me and April joined this server in the first place, of Survival Games. Of course, we have elimination, but it is doing us nothing, we do not get any player from it, it is a great idea, but we have Nexus and Nebula. Also, PotPvP should be introduced, it will boom the popularity as will. If you say that these ideas are not original, well we need more players and we need to advertise and implement more games into Avicus. That is all I want to say.<br>-IngiOut-

1. You're computer does not influence your ping.<br>2. Having an Australian server would not fix your 500 ping. At that ms, it is your connection problem.

There really is no point too make one really. First you wouldn't get as many players as you would EU so why spend the money for just like 200 players to go on it&nbsp;when you can get like 400+. 2 It takes a lot of money to host 100+ good quality servers. Im sorry Im just saying making a EU server would be I think a better idea.
