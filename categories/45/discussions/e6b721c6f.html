I think 1.7.10 is getting ready for 1.8 and they removed the Old sponge mechanics :P<br><br>@Cobalt838.. They did server a purpose of removing water as well only without getting wet and not being able to keep that up :P

Yes you have to wait for V1.8 :(<br><br>Its a shame that the sponges have been changed because they led to awesome BUD mechanics giving an update to a 5x5 area around it. I'm not sure if the new sponges do that though.

I know you&nbsp;probably get the point by now but Mojang made it so sponges suck up water in snapshot 14w25a, and it turns into a wet sponge.
