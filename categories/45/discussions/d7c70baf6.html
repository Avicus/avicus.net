We'll first off I wanna say is that my computer broke down and That's why I was inactive, also I was banned from avicus for posting screamer links, I wanna say that that was a mistake Lethe explain why . &nbsp;My friend sent me that link through Skype and I wanted to copy and paste it on Facebook as a joke and I forgot that I still had that link copied and when I uploaded the photo of my setup I didn't copy the link and so instead of pasting the link of my setup instead I pasted the screamer link by mistake. &nbsp;ALso I'll be getting a new gaming PC soon so hopefully I get unbanned
