So yesterday, 1.9 was released and I'm just wondering what you guys think of it? Do you like what they have done or do you think its a horrible update. My opinion is that its meh; some updates I like about it and others I don't like about it.&nbsp;<br><br>What are you're opinions?

I like it a lot. It added a positive spin to the game, making it more challenging now. I've been playing a lot on SMPs, and I love it. In terms of PvE, I no longer feel invincible, and can't rush every mob I see. Now I have to plan which mob to attack first, and time my hits/shield blocks to take the least amount of damage. &nbsp;<br><br>This will defiantly add an interesting twist to PvP. Shields have the ability to block arrows, different weapons do different amounts of damage and extra perks (like the knockback effect with a sword) with different amounts of cooldown. On top of that, pots can be attached to arrows, which could be interesting to see (imagine what could happen if you could heal a team mate by shooting him with a health 2 pot arrow). There's also elytras, which will give the element of flight to PvP. There's also some nifty enchants, like the frost walk and mending.

The cooldowns are toggle able with item values. This means map makers should be able to decide on whether or not to allow cooldowns to be on weapons.

In general, the update itself is utter shit. Some parts I things are cool, some things are not. The one thing that someone else mentioned was they have turned vanilla minecraft into a mod which I completely agree with. It's pretty glitchy moving items around in your hotbar.

I love the elytra it makes u faster when running normal and u can fly.<br>However they shouldnt use the cooldown, maybe only with axes so that u can choose because i liked it better in 1.8 :c

<div>I watched a YouTuber say the EXACT same thing. Mod. Minecraft pvp feels like a mod now, with cooldown times and shields and potion tipped arrows. But other than that, what most people don't focus on are the other things added, but I understand because this is a pvp server. Other than the pvp tho, I like 1.9. I like the new command blocks, extension of the end, etc. IMO 1.9 is focused on survival more than servers, because the end stuff is pretty cool and the elytra is sick too. I just thing they ruined pvp, and what AskMeToRap said about it pretty much sums it up.<br><br>"More like Minecraft 1.9 Make-Game-Easier-For-Little-Kids Update."<br></div>

Fun for survival, but ruins PVP. I can literally take no damage from a creeper when using a shield + iron armour.

If servers don't go crazy with the shield and arrow types, then better hit detection than 1.8 and many things are disableable, which makes it not so bad. Basically an improvement over 1.8, though 1.8 was awful. Wish they'd just switch the pvp back to the way it was in 1.7.

I actually like some of the things added. I like the wings and I actually like the shields. But the fact that they apparently messed up the hit detection even more (which up until now I didn't think we possible), added the cooldown and waaaayyy too many off the new arrow types kinda ruined mc pvp.

I have to admit it isn't as bad as I thought, there is a way around everything that was changed.
