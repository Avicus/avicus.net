Hiya.<br><br>Okay so a lot of people on Avicus know who I am and I have a lot of friends here on Avicus. But lately I've seen a change in a lot of people on here. Okay, to clear this up I have dated people from Avicus before. But it's not like I just do it just to do it. I know several people (girls and guys) who date other Avicus players and i don't see a problem with it at ALL. And no i haven't been with 10 guys on Avcius and no im not, (as many people on ts refer to me as a word im not saying but you know what it is and you know who you are. EVERY time I come onto ts i get a poke saying certain people are talking crap on me. I have received five pokes about it and have walked into several conversations requarding me and calling me different things like ugly, stupid, boy hopper, etc. YOU CAN HAVE YOUR OPINIONS, BUT IF YOU WANT TO SAY SOMETHING NASTY ABOUT ME SAY IT TO MY FACE. I am to the point where I cannot go to staff for help anymore..therefore if this keeps happening I AM leaving Avicus. I care about all my friends here but this is just getting out of hand. I am never mean to anyone on here and if I ever was it wasn't intentional. Just hearing the rumors and things people are saying about me breaks my heart because I never have done anything to make someone say this about me (you know again, who you are)<br><br>My point of this post is just to express how upset this makes me. Stop trying to make me feel like crap to make yourself feel better! I just want to enjoy my time on Avicus...and not be known as the girl who gets and dates all the guys. I can be with who I want. I can love who I want and you aren't going to try and stop me. Thank you everyone on here and i hope I can stay longer :)

Avicus is one of the most immature servers I know, ignore these people and simply report them.

Can you not make attention seeking posts? Or just report them on the forums?
