Hello. I am a YouTuber. Well, kind of :3<br>I really enjoy making the content itself - after getting a comfortable recording program (does not lag the gameplay/produces great quality video files) I have found that making videos is a billion times easier. However, I think the most important and the most enjoyable part about being a YouTuber is reading all the comments and looking through the feedback that people give you. Sure, h8ers gonna h8, but it's the nice comments and the constructive criticism that really do bring you up and encourage you to make more content.<br>Post your thoughts and what you think is the most enjoyable part of being a YouTuber!<br><br>Also, I have two "friends" who constantly dislike my new videos. xD<br>And you don't have to comment if you're not a YouTuber :3

The best part is getting back feedback, and knowing that someone is enjoying what you're producing. It's great to see the support, and the things people would do for you in return!

I enjoy being able to record videos and actually seeing 40+ plus views on it! I just sit back and think  wow 40 people have watched my video. One thing is dislike it me not having all the time in the world to be able to record videos and edit and upload them.

I have 77 subscribers (that don't really watch), but it is very fun to freestyle video edit and do all kinds of motion graphic designing stuff. At 13 years old, it is fantastic! I get like 5 more years to f*ck around with the creation of videos.

I love recording the videos. It makes it even more fun when you are with friends, and just having a great time doing so!&nbsp;<br>Also, I love getting feedback and comments from the people who watch my videos.<br>That is what keeps me going in YouTube; the fact that people actually enjoy what I do!

I recently hit 100 subs.<br>joined a game of oc.tc and some people&nbsp;<b>freaked</b> over me.<br>it was the most humbling thing to ever happen to me, that I join and people are like "I love you" and "OMG it's you"
