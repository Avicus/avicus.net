Maps such as Quintus and Luar, where I can snipe bridgers. On those 2 particular maps, I always have one particular spot that I stay at. Usually in the middle areas ahead of spawn, where the main fighting occurs.

Justice 1. I make a little archer post in the middle island, and i get the knockback II bow and the flame I bow, and when people come across their bridges from the other team, I hit them off. My favorite thing to do, is hit the guys with diamond/iron armor off first, just to piss them off! trololololol

Not really a kill farm, but damn whenever I play there so many kills. Once my team had killed SO MANY enemies. I must have killed at least 20 in a life.&nbsp;<br><br>As for kill farming, I don't. I hate using good gear against people with weaker stuff repeatably.

sure. you should see me killfarm on Clay Wars, lol. I can almost single-handedly lock down the entire side of the map <u><i>because of it's style</i></u><i></i>.All you do is hybrid blockhit and send everyone flying. eZ 20 killstreaks. Not saying how i set up barriers doe, but it gets to a point where they cant even get to their own monument area if I want to do that.

That's not a kill farm. A 20 kill streak is pretty easy on anymap if you play it right. When I say "killfarm" I'm talking about 120+ kill streaks, I'm not saying it's not possible to do on claywars but it is highly unlikely. With a map like Infernus you can easily achieve 100+ kill streaks within 15 minutes, that's a killfarm.

If you set it up correctly with teammates, 120+ killstreaks on Clay Wars are definately attainable for a single player with other contributors. If you're setting up the barriers correct you can kill 3 people at once, maybe 5 if you play it right, even with leather. 20+ (solo) usually, when done correctly is definately attainable. I get really high streaks if teammates help me set up the kf, even if they're randoms on Clay Wars because when you're low you run back and they can cover for you easily.

When saying a map is a "killfarm map" you have to take into consideration other factors. The monuments are incredibly easy to get on Clay Wars, making it not a good kill farm map. Also, you cannot get any better armour than leather, so you have absolutely no safety net if somebody starts to get a good combo on you. Saying Clay Wars is killfarm map is like saying Rendezvous is, you can get pretty high killstreaks, but you're not really "killfarming".

This isn't a "Kill Farm Map", Kill Farming is farming kills which makes your KDR go up, and results in a big amount of XP in return and boosted KDR, on Clay Wars you can get around the same amount of kills, but you can't "Farm" like on other maps like Quintus, since you usually die more often or commonly rather than an actual Kill Farming map with Strength Potions, Diamond Armor, etc.

This isn't a "Kill Farm Map", Kill Farming is farming kills which makes your KDR go up, and results in a big amount of XP in return and boosted KDR, on Clay Wars you can get around the same amount of kills, but you can't "Farm" like on other maps like Quintus, since you usually die more often or commonly rather than an actual Kill Farming map with Strength Potions, Diamond Armor, etc.

I get huge XP and KDR boosts if I do so. Whatever you call it. If you set it up correctly you don't really die...&nbsp;<br><br>Whatever. Back to topic I guess :P

I do not like kill farming by having surperior gear. I can do this with almost any map with bridges needed.<br><br>I can snipe from a far side and kill playeers off a bridge (favorite tactic and helps me get kills)<br><br>or<br><br>Make a little shelter next to a 1 wide bridge and spleef people in hiding.

First time I properly kill farmed was today.... On Luar. Basically just dig a hole and let people fall in. ... And occasionally run into the enemies base. Eventually I got knocked into void from enemy behind our front line :(

To raise K/D and get&nbsp;<b>huge</b> xp amounts. Useful for leveling up.&nbsp;<br>It's also funny seeing like 6 randies running at you, knocking like 3 or 4 of them out of the world and ending up getting a free Hexakill xD. That doesn't usually happen, but killfarming is more fun than you might think. I prefer to rush or play offence. I'll be playing offence more to practice the position now :P&nbsp;<br><br>Also I'll be killfarming to level up, as I'm lvl 40+ on Nebula and Nexus (40 on Nebula, 41-42 on Nexus) and want prestige.

Because I want to be maxed out in nebula, and monuments don't give that much xp. I don't really care about my KDR, I just try to play, but not to an extent where I want an overall high KDR.
