What in you opinion was the biggest change Avicus has seen? <br>For example: the removal of the throwback rotation, as I believe this had the biggest change for me, how now I would need to deal with newer maps, which I did not know as well :D

The change from McZone to Avicus was probably the biggest one, but also the Avicore update was big, because a lot of players instantly stopped playing and since then the player count kept decreasing.

Not migrating server ips from MCZone to Avicus was literally THE reason why Avicus initially lost so many players.<br><br>Player loss just snowballed from there, but that was the beginning of it.
