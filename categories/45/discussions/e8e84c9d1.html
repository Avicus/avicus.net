Its somewhere you can access illegal products and the owners watch over there sites and know when you on there and can track you down xd PS: Some even have live chats that open if your a new user! You often need to use back door roots for some of bad websites lol

Yes I have. There's quite a bit of drug trade and freelance hackers along with 4chan clones, sketchy-ass Bitcoins for CP sites, and a million torrents.&nbsp;<br><br>10/10 = 1, so I would not recommend, the servers are never up and the browser I use is FBI-land

If it's on the Hidden Wiki, it's probably not worth it anyways. Plus most links in general work about 20% of the time

I don't know the details, but it's a dangerous part of the Internet you can access using special browser so like TOR. It's filled with videos, pictures, gifs, etc. of illegal activity such as rape, murder, animal cruelty, and overall just disturbing shit from all around the world. It's best not to visit it, because people can easily trace you to your actual location as far as I know.

Yeah, I figured someone would be smart enough to crack this. While Red Rooms are actually real the people getting "tortured" are apparently ISIS people that have been captured.<br><br>There are some red rooms supposedly involving like kids or something, but I've heard a story that the owner passed the IPs of the people watching to the FBI and they arrested them.

Wrong facts are strong with this one.&nbsp;<br>1 The deep web is completely normal and not really dangerous. Wanna go into the deep web? Go access your profile on avicus and click on edit. Boom. Wasn't hard right? Deep web are just sites that aren't listed on Google and that mostly aren't accessible as a guest (like if you're not logged into avicus you obviously can't edit your profile). The dark web is part of the deep web tho but obviously you won't come across it easily.&nbsp;<br><br>2. The deep web was made for the sole purpose that you can be anonymous. It uses multiple encryption proxys and layers called onion. The Tor browser also stands for The onion router for that reason. Obviously you're not untraceable but it's a huge effort to do so

I used Deep Web and Dark Web interchangeably, but I meant the Dark Web is where most of the hardcore illegal stuff happens. The Deep Web is mostly just people who want anonimity.
