Hey guys, Sham here,<br><br>I just thought of an awesome idea regarding a social aspect of the forums. What if the forums had a chat bar! So basically it could work in two different ways; 1. It could be a spam bar, where any player can right whatever they want, and they don't have to got through the hauling process of of posting things on the forums and waiting a long time for people to reply. Instead, this spam bar could just be a place to post the most random of stuff players could want. The second way that this could work is that each individual player could have a little chat bubble/bar sort of thing on the side of the chat page. The chat page is where the chat will be located. The chat bubble, will display the players name, and if they are online or not. Here's the one drag of this concept. We would have to add an "add friends" button to the forums, so that only people that are your friends could message you. I made this post because I feel that this would be a fun, new way to communicate with each other! I hope you guys understand my idea! If not its ok!<br><br>Peace and Luck,<br><br>Shamrock

This is actually a really good idea, as I have been in many communitys before, all not nearly as big, but it's really successful. Mod and jr mods ect. would have ro be given ban/kick permissions though.

I see where you're coming from and why you would like this, but it does give the staff more work to do. We would probably have to have a staff member moderating the chat room at all times, making sure that a forum troll isn't just copy + pasting inappropriate things repeatedly, so there are some issues with this.

@Porky,<br><br>I totally understand how this would make the staff work a little more hard. I just thought this would be a cool idea, which could also benefit the whole avicus experience for all players!

This is a wonderful idea :)<br>Another server I Moderate on has a chat bar,&nbsp;<i>although</i> it slows down forum connection, and can get quite spammy unless chat history is deleted. Just putting my two cents in :)

Good idea and thinking, but this is probably a very complex thing to install and might screw some things up, but then again, I'm just another person on the internet, so its really up to the staff :)<br>Nice thinking tho!

Here's the deal.<br><br>Putting a chat into the forums doesn't really make it a forums anymore. Teamspeak is there for everyone to use. It takes 10 seconds to download and connect to the server. Also, we did kind of have a forums chat before. It wasn't "on the forums", but ParaSpider (I think) formed a chat somewhere else that only a few Avicus players used. Quite honestly, PlugDJ is enough of a chat on its own. I think a forums chat is unnecessary unless we run out of things to do.&nbsp;<br><br>However I do realize many people can't use Teamspeak or Skype. I think if you're going to make a chat, put it somewhere else (make an extra tab?) so it doesn't lag the website.

No, this would just be rather spammy and whatnot. I think the forums are enough for communication like this.
