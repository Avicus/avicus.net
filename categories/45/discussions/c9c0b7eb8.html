They aren't credible scientists, they're just mentally crazy people living in their parent's basement trying to stir up drama for attention.&nbsp;<br><br>I don't touch doomsday stuff within a 10 foot pole.

Seriously? Another one of these?<br><br>It's as if you guys WANT the world to end. No one can predict when the next Nuclear war will begin, only politicians can because they're the ones that&nbsp;<b>control&nbsp;</b>the nukes.<br><br>Seriously, stop this. It's annoying and depressing.

If the meteorologists can't predict a storm in 2015 there's no way scientists can fucking figure out the exact time where "Doomsday" will come. End of discussion.
