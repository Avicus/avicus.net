Constructive Comedy and Censorship

Greetings fellow avicus player. I am YouCantCMe better known as Zac. I have created this post to express my concern over the two issues presented in the title of this thread. Constructive comedy is comedy that relates to a sensitive topic usually taking the less agreed upon or more radical side as to present that topic in a new light that not only allows recipients of these jokes to take these matters with more grace but also to shine a new light upon these issues. Constructive comedy is often confused with immaturity when in fact it is only by addressing and moving past these issues can we truly put them to rest. Censorship destroys the opportunity for constructive comedy in attempts to ignore these issues until we forget about them, a rather impractical notion. Censorship can also be used correctley to protect people who would feel emotional trauma from experiencing these more offensive types of comedy. However the way to go about this would be by designating a select area where these constructive comedy pieces can be shared without risk of running into more sensitive recipients rather than removing the right to discuss these topics as a whole. Irl these people go to designated shows, clubs or websites to distribute their content to consumers who readily accept it. This same idea should be used in avicus TS as well as the forums. There should be designated sections of TS where users can go to discuss these issues through comedy unhindered. The forums should also ask you permission to show more explicit content, if denied permission certain topics will not be viewable to that specific user but will remain available for others. Thanks for your time.

Examples of Constructive Comedy reach far and wide, wether it be bringing racial tensions into the spotlight, to the the modern day terror scare or even the capitalist over advertsing and excessive branding of John Cena.

they had a place for that called 18+ but some mod got butthurt from a 9/11 joke or something so they decided to get rid of it completely. however, they apparently allowed racism again but then this "rule update" makes it illegal again.&nbsp;<br><br>ok

As you said, there are places in real life for this. Avicus is a server for people of all ages, - with some exceptions in certain areas - for everyone. We have these rules in place so that most of the people served can have a good time. Not just so that a few can have a good time at the expense of others.

Exactly my point, some people (like yourself) hate constructive comedy and don't want to hear it and you ruin it for the rest of us. By letting 18+ be a sanctuary for people who appreciate constructive comedy you keep us out of your way while allowing us to enjoy ourselves. We are perfectley fine with compromise, its people that say 18+ should be appropriate that instigate these issues and are attacking people such as myself even though we specifically do these things in the appropriate areas.

Further would imply continued acknowledgement, I simply addressed it missing a word and moved on.<br><br>At no point did I contradict myself, you must be confused.<br><br>I send in multiple reports with evidence often times it is ignored or gets replied to saying that its not enough.<br><br>The community of avicus is geared towards many age groups. As clearly shown by there being sn 18+ chat. Although it is subjective and others are allowed to join the topics discussed there are meant to be discussed with people 18 years or older.<br><br>Some people are interested in talking about sensitive topics in a comedic fashion, you just like to project your own views upon the entire community. Please stop speaking for the community just speak for yourself.

I feel the rule shouldn't be no or yes, i think that it depends on the consent of the group.<br>If the entire group in the 18+ chat is okay with joking about serious topics, then go for it, who gives a crap?<br>Now if your in the group and you make a joke and a guy in the chat doesn't like it, i think that the group should be considerate about it.<br>Like joking around about 9/11 when a guy in the chat was a victim or was related to a victim of 9/11, then it may be insensitive to joke about it.<br>Now you may think, oh, the offended guy should just leave the chat, well maybe he is talking with friends and doesn't want to leave the chat? Then the guy can ask to stop the 9/11 jokes, simple, now its up to the group if they are mature enough to consent to that request, if they are not, then the offended guy can leave and talk to other people. &nbsp;I don't think this is a matter to be defined by one set of rules, i think the users of TS should decide if they are all okay with constructive comedy.<br>Now if they abuse someone because they know they don't like it, then that's a different story, but it seems the goal of the post is not to harass people with constructive comedy so i see no problem with it as long as the group consents to it.

Yes, avoiding the people who can get offended I agree with but the logical way of doing so would be by saying only 18+ chats can have these offensive topics discussed in them.

I think the best solution would just let 18+ have no restrictions. Pretty much what _noice said. If someone joins the chat knowing they could get offended its not the fault of the people who were already in the chat. So therefore, I don't see anything wrong with that :P

Um, I wouldn't laugh at people dying to make myself feel better. Not sure how that's pleasing in any way, or how it makes the mood better for the loved ones.&nbsp;<br><br>Anyways, I believe that it shouldn't really be allowed in any channel. It's just not mature and respectful to make racist/sexist/etc. remarks even if everybody is fine with it. I dunno, just me probably. :p

What I'm saying is that just because it is 18+, doesn't mean it's a free for all room. It gives you a freedom, but to some extent. Joking about serious topics is not something that people would want to hear or discuss about.

For the record, what I have seen in 18+ was not your so called "Constructive Comedy" it was just offensive, and hateful. Why should we have a channel, where the only point is to offend certain groups? If you guys want to do that, take it to skype, but this is not what Avicus is for.

Just because its 18+ doesn't make saying racist, sexist, etc. remarks any better, older people get in trouble for saying stuff like that all the time. &nbsp;I understand what he means and also like using laughs to touch on sensitive topics. &nbsp;It should be used in a way to cheer someone up or brighten a bad situation, not make fun of an issue because even if there is or isn't someone who might be hurt by it, its just wrong to do as a person.

Please read the entire post, the comedy brings the issues to light and then they are dealt with. That is how it is constructive. It is also a much better alternative than pretending the issues don't exist.

Eh. I disagree with this.<br><br>By labelling it "constructive comedy" doesn't really take away from the fact that youre being racist or sexist.

Trying to make light of a shitty issue and saying something offensive in hopes of some laughs are two different things. &nbsp;I hear black jokes all the time and some can be funny and some can't. &nbsp;Its all about crossing a line and if people are constantly saying you do, you may want to think about what you say, of course you may have someone that gets too sensitive but<b> usually&nbsp;</b>thats not the case

I'm really confused by this. Turning 18 does not give you some magic pass to start being racist and/or sexist. Also there's a really, really, really fine line between funny and offensive, and imo that would get crossed all the time. Making fun of serious issues just turns you into somebody who looks immature.

We arent talking about being 18. (Use TS too understand the issue). The point Zac is trying to make is that the TS community can generally make jokes etc about common events and issues in the world. Recently we have been getting punished for making jokes that have been tolerated for years. Like honestly, you cant say anything to a friend without getting punished. For example I was almost kicked from a channel just for saying the word 'nigger' not in a bad way, just to explain something.

Ah well in that case, avicus has allowed people to speak their minds freely in the past, I'm not asking for people who make these jokes to take over TS and say anything anywhere, but give them sanctuary to speak about this stuff away from most people while still retaining the sense of a community and making use of the avicus provided service.

I don't see why people who don't want to participate in these conversations can't restrain themselves from entering the 18+ channel. It goes both ways.

Not really. If people don't want to join 18+ channels in TS because you guys are there doing "constructive comedy", you're restricting other Avicus members from using the TS Channel. Skype is a place where you can freely chat about whatever without putting others at risk of hearing what you have to say.<br><br>I guess I'm confused at the effort you're going to so you can implement this rule when you can already have the time of your life on Skype.

Cursing is beside the point.<br><br>Im talking about more high impact subjects, such as rape, racism, homophobia and sexist comments.<br><br>Essentially, what you're doing is like this;<br><br>You're in a public place with many different people around you. You and your friends suddenly decide to talk about a sensitive subject. Someone tells you to stop, and you tell them to leave. People don't have to leave the area just because you want to talk about a certain subject. Imagine Skype as a private house. You could go there with your friends and chat about random shit instead of putting the public in a silly situation.<br><br>Get my point?
