What kind of game would you develop/code/make? (idk)<br><br>I'd develop a police game, sort of like the opposite of GTA. It would be much more detailed then the LCPDFR mod for GTA IV.&nbsp; You could choose out of 3 maps, each one has its own storyline and vechiles.<br><br>&nbsp;It also has a multiplayer feature. You can have your own custom police car/vechile, or you can go into a session were everyone has the same painted car/vechile.You can a choose to be a fireman, police officer or a yellow man who drives a ambulance (dont know the word for it xd). <br>Every person has its own caracter.&nbsp; It will only be available for PC.<br><br>sorry if this sounded really weird lol

Those sort of games are already made.<br>For example : APB Reloaded is a free to play GTA like game and has crazy customization and different worlds, there are 3 but 5 modes.<br>For example : G Mod (garry's mod) has a game mode called Dark RP and you can be a police officer, medic, fireman, the mafia and so on.<br>So if this game was free and lots of people played it i would'nt bother :P

Ultimate FPS sandbox game. Build your own tanks, mechs, aircraft, guns (cosmetics only) and make a great map to go with it with you're own custom gamemode.

A free-roam type game like GTA 5.<br>But.... You can travel to every single country in the world, and even go to outer space! :D Although, it's too bad this would crash every computer in the world. :(
