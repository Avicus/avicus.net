You shouldn't really hate people for bow spamming on Minecraft. It's a PvP tactic..

I don't find it a big deal. It's a legit tactic, however annoying and / or "OP" it is. (Quotations because it really isn't, in any form, OP.) Let people use whatever tactics they want, it's how they play their game.

This is not a PvP tactic in my eyes. I see it as... As a way for people who can't PvP to feel good about themselves by sitting on a budge or at the end of a bridge just shooting the hell out of you. I hate bow spamming SOO MUCH. Even Ronloyd does. You should hear him when he rages against a bow spammer. It's quite funny but I know how he feels.

Sword PvP isn't the ONLY type of PvP.<br>Bow spamming is harder, because you have to aim and draw to the perfect amount.<br><br>It's also quite easy to avoid arrows.

Yes, I agree with Maddy. I don't bow spam because I know a lot of people (like me) find it annoying as heck, but there are lots of ways to get around it. If I want to sword PvP, I just quickly spam my sprint button and spam my right-click to avoid taking much damage. Then, I get them into a combo and go to the right of them where they have to adjust their aim to get you, and I usually get them. You can also just shoot them with your bow if none of this works..

I think of bow spamming as a last resort(therefore I never use it) by last resort I'm saying when your low u just start bow spamming to make the enemy low to 1 hit. I think of it as a pvp tactic.

It's a tactic, you're not trying to get it removed(i can't blame you if you were), As long as their not using hacks, spamming is ok.

It is annoying, but I will say this: there will come a time when you need to survive a bow spammer, and the best way to do this is to know how to bow spam and freaking spam their little annoying face with arrows.

If you are good with a bow then it is very effective but hard to master. I usually keep shooting someone from a distance until they are low then come in and kill them with a sword.

Like it or not, it's still a legitimate tactic. I personally don't bowspam because i find it annoying, but instead of complaining about it just find a method to get around it.

In actuality, bow spamming is quite difficult to do against players who can dodge. You need good prediction and aim, as well as timing. And because your opponent is generally rushing towards you, you have to adjust all of these factors in a matter of seconds.<br><br>It is low risk/high reward and is exceedingly annoying but a good player knows how to fool a bow spammer with mind tricks, block placing, and just general strafing/dodging.

Are you talking about what happens at the start of a game when no one wants to bridge or they will get shot at or when some in close combat fires loads of arrows at you [close as in sword range]

I was just about to ask this too :P<br><br>If I find a bow spammer close range, I just mash my sprint and run towards them, then block hitting when I am in range with my sword.<br><br>Getting shot at while bridging in my opinion just doesn't count as bow spam, **unless it is also close range** &nbsp;so it should most likely be the other option. It's just called doing a 360noscope. Well, sniping.
