Hey everyone :D<br><br>Since summer's the best time to do some work, why don't you try answering some of my riddles that I found?<br><br>Maybe this could turn into a trend... :3<br><br>You're also free to put your own riddles. So here are some that I found.<br><br><i></i><br>A man was pushed out of an airplane without a parachute. How did he survive?<br><br>What do you throw out when you want to use it, but take in when you don't want to use it?<br><br>What is easy to get into, but hard to get out of?<br><br>I'll post the answers later&nbsp;<br><br>Much love,<br>Midnight
