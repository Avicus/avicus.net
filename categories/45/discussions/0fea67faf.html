Well, when we were (DAT ALLITERATION THOUGH) younger, we had this favourite TV show that we watched. I had a favourite TV Show when I was 4-6 Years old. <br><br>What was yours?<br><br><b><b>Name of show:<br>Ch</b></b><b><b>annel Name:<br>What was it about?<br>Episodes Ran:<br>Seasons Ran:<br><br></b>This was mine:<br></b><b></b><b><b>Name of show: </b>Sonic</b> Underground<b><b><br>Ch</b></b><b><b>annel Name:</b><b> </b>Tiny Pop<b> or</b> ITV1<b><br>What was it about?</b></b> Well, we all know Sonic. That blue hedgehog that goes super fast. Here is the story: Dr. Robotnik (Eggman) takes over Mobius (the place where it's set) and runs a tyranny across the land, robotisizing (turning people to robots) who don't obey him. Queen Aleena the ruler who was taken from the throne had 3 kids, Sonic, Sonia and Manic is told a prophecy by an Oracle, who says that one day the three will take down Robotnik and restore the land. But there was a price, to split up from their children and not return to them until they overthrow him. So she takes them to 3 different parents, then a few episodes later they get together on their quest. Robonik also hires 2 mercinares called Sleet and Dingo to help, but they failed. Miserably. WATCH THE SHOW IF YOU WANNA SEE THE STORY. IT'S ON NETFLIX.<br>I didn't remember it fully so, yeah. I watched the whole series again on Nextflix...<br><br><b>Episodes Ran</b>: 40<br><b>Seasons Ran: 1<br><br><b>Unfortunatley, there was going to be Episode 41, the ending when they get back to their parent and restores everything, but was canceled midway when the show was discontinued, but many fan-fictions were made of the ending... but their kinda bad...... Oh well, but today SEGA still claims they will release the final episode... Even though the show was 10 years ago. </b><br></b>

Blue's Clues, Lazy Town, The Wiggles, Code Name: Kids Next Door, SpongeBob (I hate to say it but it's true) That's just to name a few I can remember off the top of my head. (I know I didn't follow the format but that's a lot of typing for me since my format on here is broken for whatever reason)

Lol Mr. Bean is still my TV show. I used to watch SpongeBob, and I still do. I haven't really grown up at all. I used to watch kids shows and make fun of them with my brother.
