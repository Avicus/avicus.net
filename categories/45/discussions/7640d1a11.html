I don't jitter click and my best on a click test is about 7.5 clicks per second. I can sort of jitter click, and I can tell its a lot faster but I just can't control it. I don't know whether it's my mouse (I have a cheap Logitech M185). So would a gaming mouse help me jitter click or should I stick with this mouse and practice or get a gaming mouse?

Usually if you practice a lot or play games/programs where you have to click fast, it can help improve the speed. On a $10 mouse I get 10 CPS, but on a Razer I get around 11

Naw i can full on jitter at 17cps however i find that clicking at 8-11cps with better aim is far better for pvp. Also jitterclicking = Arthuritis. Yes you should get a gaming mouse what is your budget? I use a cheap £35 roccat kova and it really does the job! Love it! Getting a gaming mouse is  a high priority especially if you get low fps like me.

i think some gaming mouse have easier to press buttons, such as RAZER's death adder. but this could lead to a disadvantage towards gaming. a twitch could trigger the button. i would recommended a mouse from the g series released by logitech they are affordable!

When I jitter click, I keep a light grip on my mouse and keep my thumb off of it, but I put my palm on the heel of the mouse. The rubber grip on my mouse helps me keep it under control.&nbsp;It generally just&nbsp;helps me aim and jitter at the same time. However, practice is key to perfecting jitter clicking.<br><br>Gaming mice definitely helps for clicking imo, since their buttons have a better feel and are easier to click.&nbsp;<br>I use this mouse:&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/CM-Storm-Recon-Ambidextrous-Multicolor/dp/B009JZ04BC">http://www.amazon.com/CM-Storm-Recon-Ambidextrous-Multicolor/dp/B009JZ04BC</a><br><br>I got it for around $32, but I guess the price has been raised. I've heard Razer and Logitech&nbsp;were good for doing stuff like this.

I'm a really slow clicker (6 cps) and I can kill people so is not that important (at least on avicus, if you are talking about competitive pvp servers you need 8 cps minimun)
