Killaura? Ban? Why?

</h1>
Dear reader,<br><br>As you could see from my profile: i have been banned for killaura (i dont use that)<br>Sadly enough there are staff members who ban without spectating long enough to get to know a player (yes i mean you jake41901). Some staffmembers like jozzmcozz. Doctapop or izjust4fun have known me for longer and do know i dont hack. I would like to ask one of the (better?) mods to unban me since im a legit player and i would like to continue playing on this server.<br><br>kingt64

Well there's quite a lot of people who know i dont hack. Just to name a lot of the Bad Company clan. Also some of the better mods at pvping (jozzmcozz, Doctapop or izjust4fun) have seen me playing and &nbsp;know that im a legit player. So it's kinda unfair.<br>I mean i have never seen Jake41901, hes probably not that experienced with pvping. Doesnt mean that better players are hackers..

Don't call out mods as bad just because they banned you. Jake is an experienced mod and a fine pvp'er. If you truly believed you were falsely banned, email the staff. &nbsp;Also, the staff are human and can make mistakes. Respect that.&nbsp;<br><br><br><br>If it hasn't been said already, Jake is 15 or 16

Ik i made a typo because i thought it was unfair, i was maybe a bit too dast in naking a post. I dont know exactly the difference between killaura and klickaimbot. I mean its both illigal and i dont use either of them. And maybe yes they are human, but should i just be happy because i got banned while im legit? Hate or anger is missplaced when the judgement is correct and the player deserves to be banned. I am a fair player so i have the right to be pissed if i get banned. I mean its a nice community and a nice server. And i wont hate jake if he admits being wrong (nor will i when i keep being banned but i will continue thinking that its unfair). Some of you giys said hes a fine pvper. The more it amazes me i got bannes, the more experienced you are the better you should be able do distinguish between right and wrong. Nuf said.

I know i have never denied that making.mistakes is human. And kycrafft, you dont seem to see the difference between being pissed and hate. Whats written is writtin, i have the right to be pissed because i have been treated wrong. I just think its sad. I mean i have seen it happening so many times on the avicus network that players were banned (some werent even that good) while they were legit. And if you tell a story, tell the whole one. Im human too, maybe my reaction was a little but too harsh on him but i cant know ever stafember to know how they are. The only thing i noticed: i see a mod called jake for the first time in a neb game. Within 5 minutes im banned. Sure making mistakes is human but if you dont take your time to even think about it...

Even if you weren't hacking, saying "I don't hack" only decreases your chances to be appealed. The best thing you can do is to be patient and wait for staff members to read your appeal and decide.

with all the respect for jake, i know he is a good mod, but…<br>you say he is one of the best mods, right? shouldn't one of the best mods know if a guy is hacking or not? also when you say "one of the most experienced mods out there". just no. even an <b>unexperienced, new</b> mod should know the difference of being good or hacking.&nbsp;<br><br>@kings &nbsp;staff should know when someone hacks or not. this is just disappointing. i feel you, man! i know you are a legit player, and i know you're good as well! hope you get it appealed :D

And also, I don't think this should get a lock. Ok, maybe he should appeal it on that email thingy support, but who cares if he makes a thread about it? Imagine you were banned for hacking when you know you don't hack. Would be kinda annoying wouldn't it? People need to be able to see things from others perspective before the start judging and hating.<br><br>EDIT: See? People hate on him for saying "prob 12 yo". Well, you guys don't know how he feels about this, because you're not the ones that are falsely banned for hacking. Its frustrating to be banned for no reason, you guys should be able to see things from his side, not judge right of the start.&nbsp;<br><br>Also, I like these kind of discussions. People support kingt, others support Jake. Imo, mods should be able to know the difference between hacking and being good. They should also&nbsp;<b>know</b> about hacking. By that I mean they should know the most used hacked clients, how to bust them, and last but not least&nbsp;<b>don't falsely ban</b> people for hacking. .-.

Ok guys just to be clear: stating 12yo mod wad wrong, but the point i want to get out is that the older you get the more experienced you become. So when i got banned without proper spectation (and a lot of people i know have been banned for no reason) i just assume you arent that experienced or maybe too younf to make a prpoer descision.

As we all know, there are a lot of visual glitches in Minecraft at the moment...<br>Stop calling a staff member out for being bad; it only lessens the chance of your appeal to be accepted.<br><br>I can confirm kingt is an OP PvPer. Vouching for unban at this time.

Guys, listen. You too, king. I banned you for Kill Aura. Obviously, every single other Mod disagrees. I'm sorry. I made a mistake, apparently you're just an OP PVPer. Everyone makes mistakes. I do, Sr.Mods do, even&nbsp;<i>Managers</i> do. Yes, I properly spectated you, and yes, it looked like you were hacking. I'd never seen your username before or heard ANYTHING about you, so I didn't assume it was OP PVP. Apparently it was, and I made a mistake. But do NOT, call me inexperienced. I don't care who you are. Whether I made a mistake or not, you have no right to be calling me out on something I did incorrectly. Yes, it's my fault I banned you for an inaccurate reason. Yes, I made a mistake. But no, I am NOT inexperienced. I'm not cocky. I know I'm not the best Moderator out there, but I know damn straight and most Avicus users that actually KNOW me would agree with me, that I am NOT inexperienced. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Good luck in your appeal.
