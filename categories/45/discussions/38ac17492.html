Hi all...<br><br>This is the last time I've been here since December 2013. Last 3 years ago (from now), I been into Avicus for the first time for PVP and met some new friends. I've attacked some players, but spam kills are useless for me. Right now, I am fully unsupported in this server for now. There is no way you can find me back.<br><br>I can't join on tournaments, I can't be on for long, you guys will miss me.<br><br>Here's a list of my previous usernames:<br>- MadTG (since Jan 2017)<br>- MadTheGamer (since Mar 2016)<br>- MadPoseidon182 (since Dec 2013, but original name)<br><br><br>And the support status for this server for me:<br>MadPoseidon182 - iiDecade<br><br><b>Start Date:<br></b><b></b>December 2013<br><b>End of Support:</b><br>November 2017<br><br>Sometimes, I honestly made some mistakes, don't know what to do, I've been argued a few times. Web bans are the worst thing for me because I didn't follow any rules. I only go on Avicus for a bit.&nbsp; (e.g. less hours, etc.) If any of you are my friends, then you will miss me a lot. I'm sorry to say this, but I, iiDecade, has decided to leave this server for good due to inactivity of this server.<br><br>I am not quite active enough, but only in other areas. I just wanted to say thank you all for sticking with me and its memes. I know that 2017 has been quite an awesome year for me and everyone else, but I won't come back in <i>2018 or later</i>.&nbsp;<br><br>This server has been a good server, I enjoy making friends with everyone, and in the server (including Discord and TeamSpeak), but I will be on Discord only till Mid 2018.<br><br>I enjoyed Avicus a lot, I played it a lot, and this was enough for me.<br><br><br>If you want to see me, add me on discord:<br>Click my profile. You can see the discord link. I can be added as your friend if you wanted to.<br><br>This is the lost decade, but unsupported in the next decade (2027) and furthermore.<br><br><br>Thank you.<br><b>-iiDecade</b><br><br><br><b><br><br><br><br></b>
