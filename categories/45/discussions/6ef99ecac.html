Well I personally think that all Mods should be able to /end, /start and /cycle because sometimes maps go wrong like the instant I'm in and if they could just cycle it to the next map then it will be easier. However some might say why don't they just message Sr Mod or Map Dev well that is a technically <i>'unreliable'&nbsp;</i>because maybe a staff member might not see or get the message and its alot easier for them just to do /cycle or something. However there has to be rules where only these commands are used like in a case I'm in where there's a map YML error and its holding up the entire game and making people going offline . Obviously Mods have to be trusted with these commands not to abuse them and if they cant be trusted with these commands why are they a Mod ? (No offence).<br><br><b>Comment Below what you think.</b>&nbsp;<i>Sorry for any bad&nbsp;grammar or spelling&nbsp;on tablet :)</i>

Mmm, I suggest just picking more of the older moderators or ones chosen by the Senior Staff Team.<br>Instead of all of us holding that power.

/stop stops the entire server (the server where the maps is on, not the whole network). <br>And yes some selected mods should get these kind of commands, but they should get a training or some sort and if there are any mods that abuse these commands, then they should get demoted.<br>Btw what's the map name of the glitched map?

Generally, if something like this happens we (mods) contact the seniors and map-devs and they respond really fast! Overall, I just feel that most of the mod's haven't been moderator long enough too hold that responsibility.

Not /stop; That should be restricted to devs and admins, and maybe mapdevs. Mods should be able to use /end, /cycle, and /start though.

I don't see why they don't have it. If they are trusted enough as for them to have access to /ban, why not let them start, sn, cycle, and end maps?

Because the Map Repo/Map Dev commands are for those with that rank only. They don't do map work for the server, Moderators maintain and watch the server. I don't see why it's so necessary for this post to be asking this, as if basically you are complaining about player capacity minimals here. It's better to have a few trusted players with important commands rather than a lot of people who are&nbsp;<b>less trusted</b> than prior to what I stated.

I don't think they should have /sn, since they're not gonna be testing maps in the public rotations.

It's better if Map Devs and Sr. Mods only got the commands. They can be contacted by the mods if any problems arise.<br><br>(keep it the same)

I think they should have the end command (there's been broken maps slipping by us time and time again), but not the others. The rest are reserved for us to do map exclusive work and the mods aren't that role to do testings.

I think the problem would be some mods starting when there aren't enough players. I really wouldn't mind this command, especially for small maps of 10+ people who want their match to start.
