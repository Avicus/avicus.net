So, I wanted to know if this is punishable. As in punishable I mean a kick, maybe even a temp-ban (although I don't think it's possible)<br><br>Is saying things like "Omg, sky is in hub 1, go out there before he goes punishable? Because your spreading lies and it is sort of advertising and your trying to make players leave forcefully. Is it /report able?<br><br>&nbsp;Thanks

This is very well considered "scamming" by lying to players.<br>So yes, this may be punishable.

Misleading (or Scamming) others is against the rules and depending on the situation can lead to the offender being kicked or banned.

Ok thanks! Also, is it better to take a screenshot of when they are scamming because once they join (if they do eventually join) they won't do it again? Or is /report fine?

Always take screenshots.<br>You will definately have proof that way.<br><br>But if they're persistant, you can /report.

Yeah, feel free to then report them online. If the player is continuously doing it /Report should work just fine
