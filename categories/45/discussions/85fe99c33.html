That's Drumstep. Dubstep has a half-step beat and has a lower tempo than that of drumstep due to it being 130 to 150 BPM (beats per minute) other than it usually being around 140-145 BPM. It is of a different genre and origin and is a sub of EDM (Both drumstep and dubstep). Drumstep is different and is Breakdown VIP due to the fact it uses between 160 to 180 BPM with a half-step beat, so essentially dubstep but faster tempoed based off the elements of Dubstep and Drum 'n' Bass. Dubstep is notorious for *chh shh* and drumstep is *chh chh____chh shh*. If you meant the original breakdown, it is located here&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aov6gXO1Qs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aov6gXO1Qs</a>.<br><br>tl;dr VIP is drumstep, original is dubstep

Flight is not by Monstercat. Monstercat is a record label and didn't make the track; they did nothing other than upload it. Flight is by Tristam and Braken.

That's not Dubstep, that's House.<br>Even Melodic Dubstep isn't close to that.<br><br>I recommend you learn a bit about EDM genres before recommending songs ;)<br>I admit it's a good song for YouTube, and it's free with no copyright, but it's not Dubstep.

Actually it depends what kind of dubstep your looking at:<br><br><b>Clean:&nbsp;</b>I would recommend either Monstercat or NCS for "clean" dubstep.<br><b>Nasty:&nbsp;</b>UFK and all those have pretty decent "nasty" tracks...

There's Heavy Dubstep and "Brostep," which is what you refer to as "nasty."<br><br>Then there's chillstep and Melodic Dubstep, which is what you refer to as "clean."<br><br>UFK does have a lot of heavy dubstep tracks but I'm not sure if they can be used without a license and such. Same goes for Monstercat, but they have a bit more diversity in their song selection. I find their dubstep/drumstep selections to have a very catchy tune and good energy, which is great for a YouTube intro. Again, you'll have to check for copyright issues and licensing and all that good stuff.

Ye there is a lots of types of dubstep, i just categorize them by 2 words (Nasty and Clean).<br><br>I totally agree, But lets agree UFK has basically the drops of skrillex.. which sometimes are terrible, but in Ruffneck, its actually pretty good :P<br>As for melodic dubstep, it is basically as house except with minor touches.. Speaking of house, thank god tobu partnered with someone who knows how to change his style...<br>Btw good chillstep songs can be found here: <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Vexento">https://www.youtube.com/user/Vexento</a>&nbsp;:D

Okay, to clear this up... Dubstep is a genre of EDM. There are a plethora of of EDM genres and genres of EDM.&nbsp;<br><br><br>Dubstep has a larger BPM then most songs because of the tempo. It includes many sounds to make up of a song. Sfx, lead, bass, percussion, snares, kicks, main melody, counter melody etc. I could go on forever.&nbsp;<br><br><br>Dubstep includes a drop, which is the main objective of Dubstep. The drop can elevate or stay calm. The drop is what makes it the best part of the song. The SFX is the little sounds that gives Dubstep perfection. <br><br>There are many genres of Dubstep. Such as, liquid Dubstep, chill step, bro step, hard step, jazz step, funk step, dark step, tech step etc The list can go on forever.&nbsp;<br><br><br>Each genre has a different rhythm to how the song is played/ the whole genre itself.&nbsp;<br>If you're looking for something slow and blended with a steady drop, but not too heavy.&nbsp;You'd go with liquid Dubstep. It's more relaxed, and liquidity. It blends with the other tunes it's played with, and it's more purified. It doesn't have a larger BPM. Much more moderate than other tunes.&nbsp;<br><br><br>If you are looking for something upbeat( like for a video) you wouldn't pick Dubstep. Dubstep can be upbeat, but it's heavy and has drops involved within the song itself ( You can, but having the main melody play throughout the whole song, is much better (:) You'd more likely go with Electro, House, Garage house, Drum-Step, Electronic b, Progressive etc. There are many upbeat and uplifting songs to choose from (-:&nbsp;<br><br><br>Dubstep is modified for its originality of intense drops and its unique beats and sounds mixed into the song itself.

Try exiting mainstream (Tristam and Pegboard Nerds are already high in that sense of popularity.)

Okay, to clear this up... Dubstep is a genre of EDM. There are a plethora of of EDM genres and genres of EDM.&nbsp;<br><br><br>Dubstep has a larger BPM then most songs because of the tempo. It includes many sounds to make up of a song. Sfx, lead, bass, percussion, snares, kicks, main melody, counter melody etc. I could go on forever.&nbsp;<br><br><br>Dubstep includes a drop, which is the main objective of Dubstep. The drop can elevate or stay calm. The drop is what makes it the best part of the song. The SFX is the little sounds that gives Dubstep perfection. <br><br>There are many genres of Dubstep. Such as, liquid Dubstep, chill step, bro step, hard step, jazz step, funk step, dark step, tech step etc The list can go on forever.&nbsp;<br><br><br>Each genre has a different rhythm to how the song is played/ the whole genre itself.&nbsp;<br>If you're looking for something slow and blended with a steady drop, but not too heavy.&nbsp;You'd go with liquid Dubstep. It's more relaxed, and liquidity. It blends with the other tunes it's played with, and it's more purified. It doesn't have a larger BPM. Much more moderate than other tunes.&nbsp;<br><br><br>If you are looking for something upbeat( like for a video) you wouldn't pick Dubstep.
