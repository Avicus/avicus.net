First thing your thinking is probably "What a crappy title", Yep, It is, Thanks for noticing :-)<br><br>So...Let's get to it. Well, If you go outside and live in the country, just go outside for a minute or two, and close your eyes and just listen.<br><br>If you live in the city or close to a lot of noise, see if you can ask a parent to take you to the country, park, plantation, any calm place(Library only has people saying "shhhh").<br><br>So yea...After you are outside, just close your eyes and listen, what do you hear?&nbsp;<br><br>I hear blue birds and squirrels running up and down the trees(Even jumping tree to tree). You could hear dogs, cats, flapping wings, or a tail wag.<br><br>Now open your eyes and sit down in the grass(Not in a place with a ant hill,animal droppings.)<br><br>Now feel the grass with your hand(when your down please wash your hands).<br><br>It could be soft, hard, spiky, or just something weird.&nbsp;<br><br>Now if you sat down in a chair and just thought about all the sounds and feelings you heard and touched, You could think about anything, it could even change how you see things now.<br><br>Yea....I really just said all of this. hum...Wow...I'm a weirdo. Well, doesn't surprise me. This is just something I saw before that some one else did, and I gave it a go, I stayed outside a lot longer than two minutes after I did it a few times.<br><br>So this is pretty much just let go and relax, don't think about how you look or what other people think or say about you, just think about the animals and the sounds :-)

To be honest, I find ambient sounds like an air conditioner, fan, keyboard typing, and conversations to be very relaxing to me, and I tend to get drowsy when listening to them :P<br><br>Which explains why I sleep in school a lot ;)

Last time I went outside it was because&nbsp;I'd entered the army at an extremely young age. I fought in many wars. Some personal, mental, or perhaps brutally physical. I spent my ages trying to survive. We had limited food, water as only a bearing from local wells; as local pipelines are contaminated with harmful gases and radiation that can send even the most resilient souls into a coma of despair and fatigue. Our adventures carried insomnia and filth, with not even the slightest bit of bathing to be had. The conditions of the African plains had taken a beating on our men. My friends were killed by Nigerian tribal men, while I was left to suffer a knife wound through my left calf, having to be back on the sweet seas of the Atlantic, heading back to my home where I can gain my fruitful bounty and support as a war veteran to be known as eras continue.

I went outside today. Then I see lovely things I see everyday in my neighborhood. I see vultures eating dead carcass, dad shooting squirrels, smooshed dead squirrels on the road, and most important of them all......... a pile of dog shit. I heard a fire engine, my dad's gun, and a squirrel falling from a tree. My feet were wet from being outside in the puddles. I smelt water and shit.
