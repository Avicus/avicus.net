Well, I've had a good run on Avicus, but I am leaving now.<br>I've noticed that I spend WAY too much time on Minecraft, when I could be doing other things (more soccer, skiing in the winter, and so on...).<br>For that reason, I am leaving both Avicus and Minecraft, probably forever.<br><br>If you guys are wondering what I'm going to do with my YouTube channel, here's what's going to happen:<br>No, I'm&nbsp;<b>not</b> going to end my channel. A lot of people were asking me on YouTube and on Skype, but I've decided that I really don't want to end it.<br>I'm not going to be doing any more Minecraft videos (Except for 1 Nebula video which I haven't uploaded yet), so instead, I'm going to play some other games. Some of those games include:<br>-Mount &amp; Blade: Warband<br>-Fifa 14<br>I don't have many in mind right now, but if you have a request, feel free to tell me.<br><br>I will still be forum active (probably not as much), and might hop onto TS every once in a while. I would give my Emerald rank away, but it's not allowed.<br>Also, since I know I won't apply for moderator anymore, I might start doing prank calls again. The only reason why I haven't done any prank calls for a while is because they showed I was "immature", and for that reason my application was denied last time.<br><br>Last of all, I just want to thank a bunch of you guys for being terrific people to hang out with, and being my friends on Avicus :<br><br>CrafterPete1013<br>99250<br>jojobloblo<br>EricV4<br>TheRomanTrident<br>TheHoopsMan<br>WestbyBaller<br>MiguelPlayz<br>X_heat<br>cinammoncroc000<br>Jake41901<br>Merlinmaster<br>TarheelKiwi<br>UltraBubbles618<br>Zedther<br>Arachadonic<br>corkscrew102<br>yoshicole365<br>DaBaderMC<br>vsplesk101<br>OPTOBAT<br>iBiZa_MiNeCrAfT<br><br>There are many more of you guys, and I could add dozens to this list.<br>Well, I'll talk to you guys on the forums / TS / YouTube, bye! :c
