I was logging in to avicus, for another day of DTM and walls, when a dialog came up. Banned for ban evading(izjust4haxM81v1). Hax was my friend who had been living with our family for 2 months as his college was around here. I woke him up and he said that he trolled me and got us ip banned. I have not spoken to him since and he left. The end. :(

I once nearly got all 3 monuments on a map.<br>I got the first two relatively easy, only having to kill one defender. I then go to the third, where I go in and kill a defender.<br>Feeling really MLG, I go to destroy the monument, I have about a second left when a team mate comes and mon-blocks me, so I ask him what he was doing in chat, and he gets the monument.

Hm. In real life, when I'm having a big private discussion with my friend in the hall, then I realise my friend is behind me and I'm talking to some random ;-;<br><br>In MC, I don't really have them much, since its just a game I don't get into it as much as others.<br><br>EDIT: When I was one jump away from completing the parkour, then the hub restarted.
