Hey guys :) So I recently chose to retire from being a mod on avicus. I want to remember my summer as more then just video games. I hope that being retired will help cut down on my playtime so I can do better things. I just want to thank you guys so much because the last four months have been amazing! Meeting you guys has been e best thing ever and I love all of you so much &lt;3 So I won't quit all together but I will be much less active. Thanks for reading ^-^ *My retired rank should come in any minute
