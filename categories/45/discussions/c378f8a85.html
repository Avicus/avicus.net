It has recently come to my attention that shadowolfyt has been been (formerly know as shadowolf365) if you don't know me, I used to play a long time ago until I got falsely banned and moved on to Modern Warfare 2 where I have continued to play fps games like csgo, h1z1, pubg etc.<br><br>It is important for shadowolfyt to be pardoned because he used to spend a lot of time on Avicus and used to comply with moderation rules of switching accounts, he used to be active and involved into the community where every time I saw him he would have some interesting news about how Avicus was doing as a server, he is committed to making Avicus better, can you say the same?<br><br>Finally, comment your opinions boys ;)<br><br>PS: I made this post for a bit of memes so don't get too butthurt and network ban me, honestly I'm just testing if the staff team is retarded enough to be like. BANNED. hehe I'm 12 get rekt skrub I have mod I do what I want.<br><br>&lt;redacted&gt;

Unbanning users is not up to the community. He's induldged in activites such as leaking, so he will not be pardoned.
