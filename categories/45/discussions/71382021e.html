I know I've been telling people about my infractions publicly, and what i get is a temp ban from Nolan. I'm not complaining or anything, but I find it interesting that my friend (im not saying any names just in case) has like 10 infractions but he is okay.&nbsp;<br><br>Just want to bring it up about the efficiency of banning, temp banning, etc.<br><br><br><br>I won't appeal it, I got what I deserved, but other people you don't know should be temp banned like me.&nbsp;<br><br>What do you think? is it fair? I just want to know what the world thinks about it.<br><br><br>P.s. don't rant me for any mistakes.<br><br>Thanks, FirstSintax

That's a problem. One might generate 20 infractions and leave the server worry free.

There is no current system to detect when a player has too many infractions. The staff member has to find the player, or receive a report about him/her, then check his infraction page and then can deliver the proper punishment if he/she deems it necessary.

there was no infraction right before the temp ban (plus they were different mods)<br><br>the only reason possible is that because I publicly posted that my infractions are a plenty, and BTW, I wasn't online during that time so wtf?!<br><br>Still, I know another thread asking for it to be implemented so I am aware of that&nbsp;<br>P.s. the top part is explaining how i got temp banned.

You were caught with excessive infractions. However it happened is kept confidential between staff members.<br><br>You don't have to be online. It makes no difference whether you are or aren't.<br><br>I also wouldn't go around talking about your infractions :P
