So, many Tubers love doing giveaways for their "adoring" fans.... Well, giveaways aren't always good. I'll explain why.<br><br><br><br><b>Why It's Bad For The Subscribers.<br></b>There could always be a possibility that the guy who says he is doing a giveaway may just be saying that for subs. He'll continuously say "I'll do the giveaway next week but you have to subscribe to me!" He may just keep saying this for subs. Though, this one is easy to avoid. Just hit that unsub button!<br><br><b>Why It's Bad For The Tuber.<br></b>"FAN": *subs*<br>Tuber: "FAN" has won a minecraft account from my giveaway! Gratz dood!<br>"FAN": *unsubs*<br>Basically, the fan might just sub for the prize then unsub if he wins it.

Well, you should ask them what they want their account name to be, etc. Make up a password, and if they unsub, you can just change their password xP

They aren't very helpful for small channels that are looking to grow for these reasons. But they do give promotions to much larger channels. So I guess it's beneficial in certain situations :)

If you want to get subscribers you should never ask people to subscribe in order to win, if you have a giveaway it's shouldn't be focused on begging for subscriber. I see a lot of youtubers who have giveaways where you only have to comment a video or guess the answer to a question and that's one way you will earn a true staying subscriber. Not only someone who just subscribs beacause of the giveaway and leaves afterwards.

Professional channels won't do giveaways. That is unless it's not for a milestone. Some good YouTubers will do a random giveaway of a few games at christmas.

Giveaways are for channels who are just thirsty for subs imho.<br><br>Let the subs come to you, don't lure them with a rank or a cape or an account.

I wish that sometimes the youtuber who is hosting the giveaway would show the proof of that person winning that stuff. Although you never really do know for sure :P
