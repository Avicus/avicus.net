Even though I delete those files they come back. Anybody knows how to fix this? If you know how to fix labymod files I can send you the file I have as well</p>

Eh, what is the problem?<br><br>The mod checks if there are these files/folders each time it starts up, and if there aren't any, it's gonna create them with the default values. Why do you care about those two folders? The only way to disable this is by modifying the source code of LabyMod, I guess.

Yeah, you can't modify the source code when you don't have it.<br><br>You have two options I can think of:<br>1) You create or ask someone for a simple background software which keeps checking if there are any new LabyMod files in the .minecraft folder and then automatically deletes them.<br>2) Decompile LabyMod to get the source code and then modify it.<br><br>But why do you need those folders gone permanently anyway? Maybe if we knew why, we could help you?

He just wants the config and KeystrokeMod folders to be gone, permanently. I guess he can live with the default configuration.

I just don't want extra mods that I don't use. And they appear on my screen. This is not a really big problem but ye if it were gone, would be better for me.
