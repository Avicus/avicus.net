In my most unbiased approach I see it as quite simple:<br>The EU is made of nearly 30 countries - we all abide by the same laws and regulations. This includes free trade, free passing of information and Europian arrest warrants. Not to mention the free movements of people.<br>Each country has representatives but ultimately is ruled by five unelected beauracrats that we have no say over.&nbsp;<br>Ultimately the leave campaign want to leave this. They want an Australian styled immigration points policy. They want to take back the rough £350million per week we give into the EU (including the rebate which we have no control over) and create our own laws democratically.<br>The in side say that if we leave we will struggle to do trade with the rest of the world and that we are safer in Europe on an economical view.&nbsp;<br>It's very interesting indeed as it decides our future!&nbsp;<br><br>Tldr<br>Leave: control immigration, money and be more democratic&nbsp;<br>Stay: be safer economically and against threats such as terrorism.

I'm very much only tipping the iceberg of why we should leave<br>An economical supercollapse is a naive assumption as we are the 5th largest economy in the world. If the Europeans didn't want to trade with us as a fully independent country they would be silly, we export so much. 80% of the world's economies are outside of the EU, so our trade deals with the US, Asia (China and the UK have a strong bond) would still stand.

Not necessarily. European laws mean that the UK can't export terrorists to countries where they would be executed. Even if they are able to do so, it takes years to negotiate the extradition.<br><br>I dobt the consequences of leaving the EU will be as grave as we are being led to believe, unless Cameron doesn't have a back-up plan for a vote that he postponed for so long. If so, he's incompetent and unfit to be prime minister.<br><br>Moreover, A new deal would have to negotiated quickly lest Europe suffer an economic backlash. In that case, Britain would be free to make its own demands of Europe, returning power to the country.<br><br>Finally, NATO is actually quite dangerous. If Russia had attacked Turkey over the shooting down of one of their pilots, then every country in NATO would have had to get involved, leading to another world war.

People are naive to assume that Britain could function properly outside of the EU<br>This tiny Island would have to trade ties, the free market the EU offers to us is so incredibly important, America said we would be at the back of the queue to trade with them, China also.

Leaving the EU could leave us responsible for potential conflicts and many people would be made redundant.<br><br>The EU also regulates our environmental impacts, helps to protect our borders.

I'm not a supporter of UKIP but we need to take back control of our borders and keep these numbers down. <br><br>Re-negotiation have very little impacts on these problems so the only real solution I can see is to leave.&nbsp;And no, I'm not particularly naive

so how many immigrants do you know?

<p>We vote for MEPs, MEPs vote for the EU president. The council president was voted for by the head of states, in our case, David Cameron. And migrants don't put a strain on anything. Last year, migrants brought in a net gain of something like £8billion. The real problem with money is with the tories being violently corrupt.

More immigrants means more labour, correct, however this drops wages due to the economic power of the home nations of some migrants being smaller than ours, for instance they are willing to be paid less for more work to send back as much as they can as it's more than they would get back in their country.<br>&nbsp;I fully understand this. I would do the same, I do not blame them, they are trying to help themselves and make a better life for themselves and their families so fair fucking does!<br>But, to maintain our economic growth and power we cannot afford wages to be lowered on average.

I didn't specifically target him. I just find one of the main bases for the leave campaign is exploiting the fear of other cultures that many people have. Many leave campaigners may not believe that, but by voting leave with people like Farage, Johnson and Gove, you're voting for it. Farage and Trump have both been very clever in exploiting this.

@Oscar: As Zintenka and Apricot said, that's hardly fair. I despise racism and any other form of malicious discrimination, but claiming that because I want the UK to leave the EU is down to me being racist is narrow-minded and incorrect. Just so you know, Tony Blair, a known war criminal, is campaigning for Britain to remain. If I'm racist by wanting to vote for something that I believe is in Britain's best interests, then everyone who votes for remain is supporting a war criminal and therefore they're being hypocrites unto themselves, considering that most of them despise Blair.<br><br>@Zintenka: <b>"</b><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; "><b>I mean, if the terrorists struck within Britain, they should be imprisoned or executed within Britain."</b></span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; ">Britain isn't allowed to execute prisoners. The UN and EU forced its members to accept every human rights law, and as a result Britain was forced to abolish the death penalty. It doesn't matter whether a terrorist assassinates the Queen or a terrorist detonates bombs throughout London (7/7 being a good example of this), capital punishment is not an available punishment during a trial.<br><br><b>"</b><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; "><b>Plus, if a dire situation DOES come to pass... you'd have the rest of the EU countries backing and supporting you."&nbsp;<br></b></span><br>Frankly, at the moment the only countries in central Europe that are able to aid the UK in an economic crisis are France and Germany.

True. I've always liked him for the fact that he keeps his promises, though. I respect people who do that. He's definitely one of the better prime ministers we've had, even if the older generations are too thick and narrow-minded to see that.

Okay, I'm going to respond to this in stages going from A to D.<br><br>A:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/nigel-farage-admits-wont-extra-8271594" title="Link: http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/nigel-farage-admits-wont-extra-8271594">www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/nigel-farage-admits-wont-extra-8271594</a>. That's all I'm saying. The leave voters supported a conman and a liar, and screwed over Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland. Scotland voted to stay, and so did Northern Irelend. Considering that in a few hours we lost roughly £125 billion, I'm not optimistic.&nbsp;<br><br>"<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; ">approximately £250billion by the bank of england to bail out anything that goes to bad.." - Tell that to Germany when hyperinflation started.&nbsp;<b>Money that has no value is useless.</b></span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; "><br>B: So far, our currency has dropped dramatically. That's bad enough.<br><br>C: No offence, but that's preposterous. For one, we had working industries (steel, cars, etc.). In World War One and Two, we also had the BRITISH EMPIRE. We do NOT have a British Empire now. Besides, Britain was bordering on bankruptcy after both of those wars. This time, Britain is taking everyone else with it.<br><br>For another, we had the USSR, the USA, Canada, Australia, etc. Each of the Allies supported each other during the wars. They did NOT rely solely on themselves for the war effort. In fact, Britain was receiving supplies from the USA for most of the war, even before the Americans got involved.<br><br>D: I find that funny, considering that Cameron warned voters countless times of the dangers of leaving the EU. But no, it's all about "sovereignty" and "immigrants taking our jobs". He's a far better leader than Nigel "I didn't promise anything" Farage, Boris Johnson, or bloody Michael Gove!

Final two points.<br><br>One. Some people have hit what they perceive as rock bottom. They see no better. They have no future within the EU and want change to change this. For example our fishing industry has been royally fucked. What about steel? You'd vote to leave. Low paid labour etc. Many are fed up of being led by Brussels.<br><br>Two. What's done is done. As much as you will disagree with the decision the likelihood is that the Hungarians, Dutch, French, Italians and Polish will all have referendums too, and possibly leave. We won't be the only ones leaving. So back the country, get behind it and let us move forward.&nbsp;<br><br>Let's not all get depressed and fight each other.&nbsp;<br>Divide and conqure.

So we leave. They can't get money. They go into hyperinflation. People are then left starving and dying on the streets. Good independence, there. Kill innocents because of your needless pride.<br><br>If we don't have another referendum and stay, there won't be a UK! NI and Scotland will leave.

Fair and square? Your leaders deceived people into believing the money would go to the NHS! They wanted to stay, that was the majority there. The only difference is that the English are too idiotic to see that.<br><br>By the way, good luck getting cheap housing for university. That's gone out of the window, thanks to Farage and Johnson.

No, that's the thing. If we leave, Scotland and Northern Ireland will demand independence, dissolving the UK.

A Prime Minister resigned. The £ plummeted. The FTSE 100 lost significant ground. But then the £ rallied past February levels, and the FTSE closed on a weekly high: 2.4% up on last Friday, its best performance in 4 months. President Obama decided we wouldn't be at the 'back of the queue' after all and that our 'special relationship' was still strong. The French President confirmed the Le Touquet agreement would stay in place. The President of the European Commission stated Brexit negations would be 'orderly' and stressed the UK would continue to be a 'close partner' of the EU. A big bank denied reports it would shift 2,000 staff overseas. The CBI, vehemently anti-Brexit during the referendum campaign, stated British business was resilient and would adapt.

I know the benefits for leaving, and I know the benefits of staying. I've gone from one to the other, and staying is/was the best option.&nbsp;<br><br>By the way, I never insult people when I debate. The only reason I insulted you was because to begin with you claimed I was "deluded" (even though your every point has been rebuffed and disproven) and you then adopted a patronising manner, which indicated that you still do not understand why the young, who will have to clear up after the current generation, are voting to STAY.

The pound is at the same value as in February.

Alright, this is probably the last time I'm responding since I'm tired of arguing about this.<br><br>So we can all be poor together? Great plan! I wonder who will employ the workers, then.&nbsp;<br><br>Right, a failed experiment. By leaving, we wiped out 12 years of EU contributions. We lost even more money "that could go to the NHS" by leaving.&nbsp;<br><br>So your logic is to leave and cause it to crash? Leave Greece, Spain, Ireland, Poland, etc. poor and without aid? Good way to repay former allies for their help in those world wars you mentioned (Ireland and Poland both fought with the British - The BRITISH, not the ENGLISH, which the leave campaign is threatening to dissolve).&nbsp;<br><br>Right, so explain to me why the young want to stay? I'm not rich, nor am I poor. Yet I want to stay, just like 75% of the country's young people.<br><br>Our economy wasn't strong before we joined. We've been recovering IN the EU. In the last few years, we've recovered and are still taking loans from the EU. Why? <b>Because we're not strong enough.<br></b><br><b></b>No more dangerous than a government that can make their own laws and dismiss the "Human Rights" if they wish. You also forgot the fact that almost every country dismissed it.&nbsp;<b>It was never going to happen</b>.<br><br>One more thing: You mocked my belief that people could die. So you don't believe that the Troubles could start again? You don't believe that people in poor EU countries will be starving as they try to find a way to survive?
