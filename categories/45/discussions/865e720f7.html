I would've gotten around to doing this earlier but I was fairly busy this week with school etc.. so I was wondering what you guy's thoughts on Global Warming are, and lets be serious on this thread.

The ozone layer is breaking because of something in refrigerators which causes the sun's rays to have more of an impact here on Earth. There is no way to stop this, only to delay it, unless Earth moves farther away from the sun.

While these chemicals (coolant) are inside of fridges, nothing will happen with ozone. And if you break your fridge, it won't affect it, because ozone layer can repair.&nbsp;<br><br>The main reason of the global warming is CO2. People burn a lot of stuff (coal, oil, gas, trash, forests) and release it, so <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect" rel="nofollow" title="Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect">greenhouse effect</a> increases.

That's almost completely wrong.<br><br>Old refrigerators produced a manmade chemical called chlorofluorocarbons or CFC for short.<br><br>CFC's would degrade and ultimately Destory ozone molecules.<br><br>Considering Ozone occurs naturally in the Stratosphere, and it is responsible for shielding the Earth from the majority of the Sun's ultra violet rays.&nbsp;<br><br>When scientists discovered that CFC's were literally destroying the Ozone molecules in the Ozone layer (which created the ozone hole)&nbsp;<br>they created the CFC ban, and all refrigerators (amongst other things) were subsequently banned.<br><br>Refrigerators these days do not emit CFC's.<br><br>And saying that the only way to stop the sun's ultra violet rays from impacting earth is to move away is completely wrong.<br><br>By decreasing greenhouse gas emissions, and by eliminating CFC emissions, it has been observed that the Ozone molecules in the Ozone layer has started to recover.&nbsp;<br><br>It it can literally fix itself.<br>As long as we keep greenhouse gas emissions down.<br><br>Sorry about the long rant, but I know a shit ton about this stuff and thought it'll be interesting to share.

I have done a lot of research earlier this year on global warming. After conducting that research I found that temperature actually affects Co2. Not the other way around. Also there is such a low percentage of Co2 in the atmosphere about 0.04% (even less from emissions) while water vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas at 4%. This is my opinion on the topic from research I have done. I am not trying to &nbsp;make you agree with me I am just stating what I have learned.<br><br>Edit: Temperature naturally rises and falls due to things such as solar output.
