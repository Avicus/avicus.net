So I don't know if I'm happy or sad or interested the I have ADHD we just found out a few days ago that I have it and I'm curious to see how many people have it here (Only tell me/us if you are okay with it) and tell me your experiences and privileges you get because I know some people get extra things if they have the disorder. (Mine are getting discussed I believe). So yeah only tell us if you want to and yeah bye. This post is not meant to be a personal post or make others feel bad and start a flame war so please do NOT.

I have adhd, but i don't get extra because i am top of my year. If i wanted to get extra time i could but i just don't like the idea of that.<br><br>My subjects average range between 92-96%. However it use to be a lot worse until i started taking medication. Now if you talked to me you wouldn't be able to guess i have it.
