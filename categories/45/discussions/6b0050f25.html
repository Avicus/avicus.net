hey guyzz, sry i havnt bin on l8tly. I've bin bizy playin the smite and call of dooty. So i thot i'd make a storie.&nbsp;<br><br>Once upon a time there was a kid that was epic at minecraft named &nbsp;deadlyswordz14. He was very active on a minecraft server called avicus. He played on the server for a long time. Longer than glitchy1. He even joined on the 2nd day of avicus (the good ol' days). Then one day deadly was playing call of duty and hitting crazy no-scopes. His no-scopes were so good that he made people rage quit. But when deadly went to bed that night, aliens that looked like a cross between Morgan Freeman and Voldemort came and abducted him. They took him into their space ship that looked like a box with arms. Deadly was scared, he didn't know what they wanted. They said that he could keeps his no-scope skill if he did 1 thing. He couldn't play on avicus. But now deadly has quit call of duty and doesn't care about no-scopes anymore. So he is coming back.<br>THE END.

Ok. No. Call of duty was a good game. You can't go calling out the older versions like that.
