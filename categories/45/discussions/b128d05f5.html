Hacking just shows disrespect to the server no matter how much you hate the server.<br>If i was a server owner i would ban people from my server who intentionally hacked on a server just to show disrespect for no good valid reason. It just makes the hacker look like an asshole.<br>And by you i mean everyone.<br>For example: let's say i own Avicus. Someone from Avicus goes to OCN just to show disrespect by hacking. I would ban him from Avicus for that.

Wat no i never said anything about that, it is not my business what you are going to do with him. But to go hacking on a server and make a post about "hey i hack on this server now look at me" sounds just cocky and disrespectful, even though it was a "confession"
