Official Jukebox Rank

</h1>
&nbsp;On Avicus's teamspeak there is a player called "Dj Avicus" who had a rank on the teamspeak server. He had a rank with a jukebox next to his name. How he got that rank was he would play music on Avicus's teamspeak to bring joy to all avicus users and everyone on Avicus. He was demoted for false&nbsp;harassment. He should have his rank back. Everyone in teamspeak enjoys what he does for the server, and without him the world of Avicus teamspeak would be a sad terrible no music world. So I ask you to give him back his official jukebox rank for the music and joy of Avicus.&nbsp;<br><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thank you for your time.

I don't enjoy it at all. It got annoying fast. In fact, I stopped using teamspeak for a while until he stopped playing music constantly.

That is exactly why there should be a music channel, sir.

The rank does absolutely nothing. He can continue to play music as long as every user in the channel wants it.

the jukebox rank is pointless, the music was indeed annoying from the start, and he started calling my friends very rude things and even said to one of them "Fear me, I have more power and authority than you"

Sometimes the Jukebox plays without the consent of all in the channel, that being said, a music channel would probably be the best solution.

I think the music rank would be a great idea if the majority of Team speak users were fine with it.

I don't enjoy it for the most part. It's fun when the staff kinda hosts a party but is annoying at other times.<br><br>I would be fine with a music only channel. And DJ only get's to play music in there. He should not be allowed to go into every chat and play music even when we ask to stop. I'm fine with him playing "peaceful" or relaxing music, but every kinda follows him around everywhere, which makes the chat he's in crowded, then it gets annoying.<br><br>I don't care if he gets his "Jukebox" rank back because it does nothing, no new permissions besides join Donor chats.

You can change your name to "DJ Avicus." But that rank means something special to him, even thought he hasn't got Minecraft.

I agree with there being a music channel but I disagree with there being a special rank. A rank to play music would just be pointless.
