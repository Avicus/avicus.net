One year's worth of schooling in the Australian Education System is split up into four 'terms', which are basically half a semester each (2 terms per semester, 2 semesters per year). Terms generally last for about 10 weeks, give or take.<br><br>Instead of getting 3 months off half way through the year we only get 2 weeks :P

I'm passing 6th, will be in 7th. Kinda, I'm better in social studies and science rather than maths and language arts, while the reverse is more common here. I hate school.<br>I'm planning on starting a video game company or a graphic designer. Preferably both.<br>Hobbies: Drawing, writing stories, gaming, animals.

So we got a lot of ppl transfering to or nearing highschool and middle school.<br><br>Well here is some advice, focus on your studies. Don't let ppl at school disturb you.<br><br>I learned that i needed to get stronger in highschool, ppl who looked like they could lift 200+lbs (And they can too.), its pretty damn intimidating.&nbsp;<br><br>When you're in highschool in the Big Apple or New York City especially in Bronx, you need to especially get tough and hardened. Gangs run rampent and teachers curse... oh yes they do...&nbsp;<br><br>The gym teacher brought out this weird machine that i only see in TV, a barbell; bench pressing.&nbsp;<br><br>I needed to often be spotted with the 45lbs or the weight would cave in my ribcage.&nbsp;<br><br>But as time progressed, ppl noticed that i was getting "brolic".&nbsp;<br><br>Previous school enemies backed off more often and started to respect me; especially after i had a fight with a very arrogant and popular kid.&nbsp;<br><br>My advice is to: Stick to yourself, focus on your studies, be stronger, and due unto those of what they've done to you.&nbsp;<br><br>Highschool isn't about getting popular or hanging out with friends. If you go down that lane, you'll most likely end up a highschool or college drop out.&nbsp;<br><br>So please, stay in school and keep out of trouble.&nbsp;<br><br>And congratz to the ppl going to college, I hop you guys get the dream jobs that you guys want!

<b>What grade am I in?<br></b>Eleventh grade. Junior (third) year of high school, one week in. I feel old compared to most of you guys.<br><br><b>What grade did I most recently finish?<br></b>Tenth grade. Sophomore (second) year of high school. What did you expect?<br><br><b>Am I happy with my grades?<br></b>Yes, of course. I've actually had the highest grades out of everyone in each class of mine for the past two years, which others deem beyond impressive. The best part is I've been accomplishing this by playing Minecraft until midnight and doing homework until four in the morning...<br><br><b>What do I want to be in life?<br></b>Since I'm not a child prodigy or anything, I'd probably end up as the concertmaster of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra (the concertmaster is the best violinist and essentially head player of the whole group), instead of a world-class soloist or whatever else.<br><br><b>What are my pastimes?<br></b>I usually just play Minecraft or practice my violin or piano.
