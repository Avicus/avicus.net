Okay, as I was banned during the time Avicus were losing alot of players I'd just like to know the reason/reasons to why it dropped so much.

Pretty sure, i think, it was an ip migration issue when we switched over from Mczone to Avicus. We got like 900 people after that and between now and then people have left due to reasons.

Lack of effort from Admins. <br>Every set of Admins, they'd change the staff team, and retire within a month. That's it. We gained no players or anything.<br>The poor updates also, Avicore and Atlas weren't bug free when released.<br>Not a whole lot has changed since then, Admins now are trying but it is too big of a task to regain players.

Avicus isn't in a condition where it can continue to thrive with its current model- updates should be done not in increments or periodically, but rather as we go along. Overhauling Avicus has been done many times and each time, our player count dwindles lower and lower. Reconstructing each time makes it more difficult, and we don't have the infrastructure to continue rebuilding each time we lose players from bugs. We have inconvenienced our own community by removing useful features (like prestiges), keeping a poor map meta (constant void, we can't experiment with new concepts because maps with void are rated substantially higher), the fake hype, the constant admin changes, the server turbulence, the lack of advertising, the inefficiency and lack of organization in the staff team both previously and its recovery, the competitive edge losing its grip, the server downgrading all-around: it is building up to a disaster. Revival methods are obscure, but plausible. I would like to have the administrators take a more serious approach to create a plan for the near future, since our current plan is just "do as we go".<br><br>There isn't enough motivation, dedication, devotion, you name it- within the staff team. The only thing keeping Avicus together is the community being stuck like glue between the bad times to the good times- because, let's face it, other servers have the same gamemodes (and more) with better functionality and customization as well as features, versus us who have not developed at a steady pace wielding that functionality. We could better ourselves at any given moment, and I still don't see us really getting back on our feet any time soon.<br><br>With the disasters and distractions all around, with awful maintaining of things, it's like the server is set up to fail currently. We have translators doing nothing and the translation project dead, we just recently had the biggest surge of inactive moderators ever seen before, we have 4 senior mods (which is our lowest count in a long time), there is absolutely no maintaining of developers, there is a very rough outline of checks and balances within the staff team, the referees have their own set of inactivity and complaints for officials to shift through, the marketing team is inexperienced, and I'm sure there's more. There seems to be flaws in almost every sector of the staff team, and out of all of these flaws, they've been present for a while or could have had preventative measures that never happened.<br><br>I just feel upset that the server isn't growing, and that in fact out of all the work staff have put into it for 3 years, it is going straight down, apparent from player counts and cold hard statistics. We need to get our asses in gear and put our work where it matters- but yet, I haven't seen much of that. I want more involvement with the staff to do things together, and of course that's where assembly was supposed to come in- another failed project that had potential.<br><br>We can do trial and error, sure, but we'll never make it big if we continue what we do.

From experience, it's not too difficult to tell when people are being disingenuous with their interviews/applications because their current behaviour won't match their behaviour over the past few weeks/months.

The biggest thing from what I can recall that made Avicus lose players was the Omega Update.<br><br>It removed certain things (prestiges, for example) and this made a lot of people (maybe even hundreds, I am unsure) to leave.<br><br>Of course, there were many other issues that made people want to leave, however the return of prestiges in the last couple of weeks has brought some old people back.<br><br>I do actually like how Avicus is at the moment and prefer the smaller community, however I am in a minority viewfield here.

Id like to add to my comment, funky doesnt care nearly as much as he should if he wanted to revive it. &nbsp;He's already had a successful server and has definitely moved on with life. &nbsp;I wouldnt be suprised to see Avicus close by the end of summer.
