Hi guys i have not been on the forums lately.<br>because of some dramatic live issues.<br>with my own brother getting really angry at my gf.<br>by loosing hes Mind and just beating her up and seriously injureing her.<br><br>so on stopic<br>I have been planning to get 2 asus gtx 980 ti<br>poseidons because i Am a very big fan of the asus poseidon line up.<br>I Am upgrading because i think the 6gb of vram are making me future proof.because i Aint upgrading my cpu until they make an extreme version of the upcoming skylake cpu's whish means more power and cores<br>until that time i Am stuck with my i7 4790k<br>Thats why i wonder if the i7 4790k Will bottleneck 2 gtx 980 ti's

1) Why do you need 2 GTX 980 Ti's 1 is enough to go 4K<br>2) If you're going to get better GPU's upgrade your motherboard and CPU, its pointless. (5930K or 60X, MSI X99 Gaming, ASUS X99 Deluxe)<br>3) You logic on "Futureproofing" doesn't make sense. 1: Future proofing isn't a thing, it will eventually die. 2: You need to upgrade it evenly. Lets say you got an i7 6700K, and 3 GTX 1080Ti's or Titan (Idk what titans are going to be there), The 6700k Will keep up, but for a short time.<br><br>OP: No, it won't

yeah, both of those builds look great! I was suggesting things he could get for the $700 budget, and your $700 build is definitely worth extra $200!

I think it's mainly just the conversion :/<br>1 AUD = 0.77 USD<br>So the $700 build would come to $900 AUD...
