Hi everyone.<br><br>I have been playing with a pretty bad laptop for the past 2 years, and have saved up a bit of money to get a new one.<br>But I am still trying to decide which one. <br>If anyone could leave a link or a comment, it would be greatly appreciated.<br>Thanks :)

For a desktop, do you want it premade or would you want to build it? Building it would be much more cost effecient.

another option is to get a cheaper prebuilt one and then add better parts to it. that's what i'm doing. 450 pounds in us dollars is almost $700. you could definitely afford one prebuilt, but if you build one you'll save money. just make sure you know how to do it :)

I bought a decent second hand desktop for about&nbsp;£180. added another 4 gigs of&nbsp;ram and a new average gpu making a total of&nbsp;£30 on upgrades. I run minecraft anywhere between 80-150 fps. So imo, get a cheap, cheap desktop. then spend some money on upgrading it. (Make sure all the parts are compatible though)

Build your&nbsp;own APU computer, you don't really need a graphics card for Minecraft and you can run Minecraft Max settings with 60fps. It's really simple to build, check some tutorials online.

The AMD APU will last him a long time.... Tbh, Intel is just more expensive for barely better performance... + When the APU becomes old, It will be about time to get a new motherboard too...<br><br>I still think my Build is good, Intel, really don't like their prices. Unless you do some crazy 60fps1080p rendering, you dont need an i3,i5,i7 etc.<br><br>:P<br><br>+ your build, the case doesnt support, the GPU... &nbsp;Might as well go with NVIDIA the 750 ti...

You lack computer knowledge don't you? First off, that CPU isn't an APU. Second, my build is around the same price and performs way better.<br><br>i3 &gt; 860K<br>280X &gt; 750 ti (by a bunch)<br><br>Also, the case does support the video card. It's just that he can't put in a ton of hard drives. (He will still be able to fit 2-3, which is a whole lot)<br><br>Not to forget if he gets money later on, he can just buy an i5. With your option he has to buy a whole new motherboard

Are you just going to play minecraft or your planning to play other games as well?<br><br>Well, i would suggest building a desktop because its cheaper. Building is not that hard but you just gotta be really carful when building. Other than that, its like buuilding a lego set tbh :/ (i buillt an old computer before)

Buy a pre-built one or you cant design you own here :&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.pcspecialist.co.uk/">https://www.pcspecialist.co.uk/</a>&nbsp;also you can pay monthly payments instead of on the spot paying like&nbsp;<i>£700.00 or $</i><span><i>1078.77 .&nbsp;</i><br><br>Which I find amazing and you can get it with whatever&nbsp;graphics&nbsp;card or&nbsp;Processor you want and Design<b> laptops</b> or&nbsp;<b>desktop computers</b>&nbsp;and&nbsp;many more !&nbsp;<br></span>
