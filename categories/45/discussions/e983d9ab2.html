Well you decided to buy a gold rank and turns our one of your accounts was banned for a reason and you were using this account to bypass the ban.

Well, if you mean you bought a rank after being banned then there's not much to do about it.. I mean, why would you buy a rank if you're banned!?!?<br>If that's not the case and you got your rank before your ban, it was your choice, you broke the rules, now there's no turning back unless you get the infraction appealed.<br><br><br>Also, just a reminder,&nbsp;<b><i>you're&nbsp;</i></b><i><b>not allowed to chargeback</b></i>, if so, the chances of you being unbanned will be even less than before.<i></i>

Well in your cause it's very hard to get an appeal through.

its hard to appeal for a ban evasion appeal. You either need to appeal for your account who was banned which caused you the ban evasion infraction, or you need proof the person who was banned is not related to you/your ip in any way.<br><br>Edit: NINJABRIDGE'D q_q

Go to the "Policy" section (In the forums), then go to "Appeal an Infraction", follow the format mentioned in the main post of the section mentioned above and you're in your way to go.

To add on to what Juanoh said, make sure to be 100% honest in your appeal.<br><br>If you are caught lying, your chances of getting appealed will be extremely slim; even more than they are now.<br><br>Good luck with your appeal.
