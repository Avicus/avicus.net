Explanation (copied from Reddit)<br><br>---------------------------------------------------<br><div><br></div><div>Fnatic are now: Olof, dennis, wenton, Lekr0, twist &nbsp;</div><div>Godsent are now: Pronax, znajder, JW, flusha, krimz</div><div><br>This Swedish shuffle one of the biggest roster shuffles ever in CS:GO. It is significant in many ways. Fnatic have been a dominating team for quite a while now and they were unstoppable in the past.<br></div><div><br></div><div>This is the end of an incredible era as 3 of their players, JW, Flusha and krimz have left fnatic and joined Godsent, most likely making Godsent a legend team (which means they get an automatic entry to the next CS:GO Major tournament). Pronax of Godsent was also a part of a dominating Fnatic team in the past and now is rejoined by JW, flusha and krimz.</div><div><br></div><div>Another important thing to note is that Godsent are playing Virtus Pro right now to decide which team joins the ESL Pro League Season 4.</div>

fucking snakes fnatic. Dennis and flusha currently are performing the best in the team and now they've split apart. The swedish scene has become similar to the french in that the best talent is not in one roster and it's spread thin.

Think of all the future possibilities man.<br>Maikelele could come back into a decent swedish team.<br>There has been talk of FaZe Rain being a possibility.<br>Wenton will almost certainly not last in the current fnatic.

Ii personally am confused about the change. Why it was made, who knows.&nbsp;<br>I'd say fnatic has pretty much lost its "hype" now that 3 of them have gone. GODSENT will probably move up the ranks now.<br>And to those of you who don't know, GODSENT are another Swedish team that are probably tier 2/3 team compared to fnatic (tier 1)
