Mhm, As the title says, I've been really laggy the past couple of days... Maybe even weeks. <b><u>Not just on avicus</u></b>, but MCSG, Hive etc... And i check, I have decent internet speed... (Average).&nbsp;<b>My problem:&nbsp;</b>Higher ping than usual... So is this a 1.7 - 1.8 problem? I know some of the other players also have this problem.. So..<br>Any help? ._.<br><br>And again, this is not&nbsp;<b>JUST&nbsp;</b>For avicus... Its for other servers too ;-;

Have you checked the amount of space you have on your hard drive?<br>Low memory can contribute to your computer working slower than it normally does.

I am also experiencing some ping lag for every server I go to. I always think it's just my internet but vsplek is having the same lag.

If you are lagging on other servers, then the problem is most likely your internet. Everything using a specific internet connection affects it, in meaning most likely makes it slower as if to there was only one machine (lets say a computer) using it.<br><br>Downloads on your computer make your internet slower, as well as if you are downloading something off of your phone. Downloads could be running in your background processes as well, so be sure to close them. If you have Steam, that usually can greatly affect your internet speed and make it slower, because it can automatically start downloads.<br><br>So my advice would be to reset your router, check if you're using your own internet, move closer to your router for a better internet connection, or disconnect certain devices from the internet that you are currently not using.<br><br>Many programs, including your own internet browser, could be automatically downloading things onto your computer. So I also suggest checking for any major viruses.
