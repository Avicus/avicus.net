Hobos search through dumpsters. Dumsters have 4 sides to them. Illuminati has one eye so 4-1=3. Triangle has 3 sides, but thats not all. Hobo Maddy. Hobo has four letters and Maddy has 5. 5-4=1. One for the eye. HoboMaddy is indeed part of the Illuminati.

Penguins.<br>Penguins are black and white.<br>"black and white" is a compound.<br>A compound has two parts.<br>The part we've been missing: Sonic has two legs.<br>Sonic X, his real name, consists of 5 letters and the X, which as Shiro pointed out, is the Illuminati (3 sides+1 eye=4).<br>5+4=9<br>There are 3 people in the trio of Sonic's adventures: Sonic, Knuckles, and Tails.<br>Therefore, if each member creates Sonic X's group, each one has a third of 9.<br>What's a third of 9? 3.

MinecraftMinecraft contains 9 lettersIf we put all of those nine letters into&nbsp;Ascii Code we get 01001101 01101001 01101110 01100101 01100011 01110010 01100001 01100110 01111010<span>Lets say if we use some kind of operation we get X. The only operation in an Alu starting with X is Xor. So If we Xor the first with the second, the third with the fourth and so on we get&nbsp;<span>01000011.&nbsp;<br>That number in decimal is 67. 6 + 7 = 13. 13 x 13 = 169. Hexadecimal 169 = A9. The A probably means Avicus. So if we mmultiply the number of people online on the forums while writing this with 9 we get 135. 1 + 3 + 5 = 9. The square root of nine is 3.<br>ILUMINATTI CONFIRMED</span></span>

Yes the X has something to do with it, the X is actually a +. The addition sign is in Math. Who was good at math Albert Einstein, who was also good at science. Math has four Letters and Science has 6. 6+4= 10. In Spanish 10 is diez. Why is it a Z at the end instead of a S. Think th alphabet X,Y,Z . x,Y, and Z are 3 letters the sides of a triangle.
