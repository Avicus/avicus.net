Hi guys,<br>So I've been looking at PCs and thought maybe I should try getting one with used parts.<br>My budget is 200$ which seems like enough for used parts that might be good.<br>Thanks!

For $200, you'll get a semi-powerful PC.

Otherwise go on Ebay and buy some parts of off there... But if this is your first time. Just build it brand new :P

You're definitely going to get a much better system if you buy used, $200 much won't get you a whole lot of performance buying new.

Alien's build is just about as good as it gets.

It's also a possibility you will find a working CPU, fans, and ram.<br><br>When I built my 1st computer (with help from Alien) I used a case I found from the street saving me $30. I also reused some ram sticks and a optical drive around the house which saved me another $30. I was able to invest into better parts for the other components. It's all really up to you.&nbsp;<br><br>Good luck!<br><br>@Alien, I have to thank you again for helping me out.

You will almost 100% be able to salvage the CD drive (optical drive) which could&nbsp;save you $10 and the case. It's also a possibility you will find a working CPU, fans, and ram.<br><br>When I built my 1st computer (with help from Alien) I used a case I found from the street saving me $30. I also reused some ram sticks and a optical drive around the house which saved me another $30. I was able to invest into better parts for the other components. It's all really up to you.&nbsp;<br><br>Good luck!<br><br>@Alien, I have to thank you again for helping me out. I learned so much that I wanted to return the favor by sharing my knowledge I learned from you to others.<br><br><br><div><br></div>

Your suggestion makes sense, however, the PSU in that case is pretty sketchy. Usually PSUs that come included with the case aren't very good, you may save money in the beginning but then you'll end up having to buy a new one. &nbsp;A dedicated PSU will be better than an included one 99% of the time.<br><br>Also, the CPU really can't be upgraded to where it's worth the extra cost. If he really wanted to be cheaper, he could get the same CPU we got (E8400) and still get good performance, it's just that in this case I think it's worth the extra money for the extra 2 cores. I think his $200 are being very well spent, the performance to cost ratio is crazy.<br><br>Also, I'm glad you have learned, especially the way you did (by troubleshooting countless times).

Small correction :p when a psu is labeled 500 watts it will be able to supply 500watts to all parts. The conversation process is not 100% efficient so when it got a 80+ rating and is 500watt it means it will draw 600 watts from the wall and supply 500 watts to the parts.

Hey there ebirdy,<br><br>i dont one know much about PCs but I recently got my friend to build me one and now I can play mc with smooth frame rate! It makes an INSANE amount of difference having a good computer so I hope you experience an amazing improvement like I am :D good luck!

After doing some research, you're right. I guess several stories of how PCs shut down because the PSU isn't enough or stories of PSUs literally going up in flames led me to believe otherwise. Regardless, there are many PSUs that should be avoided due to bad capacitors and bad rail amperage.
