Hi guys! ^-^<br>I've been thinking of making a post like this for a while now, so I thought I'd start it.<br><b><b>Every few days I am going to update this post with free music downloads for you guys to enjoy.</b> </b>This is just a way of promoting all the amazing artists out there that don't get enough love. All the music I will post here is free; I will also try and provide downloads that don't involve giving likes on Facebook.<br><br>Enjoy!<br>NOTE: All the music I'm posting here is EDM. If you're not an EDM person, sowwy :c<br><br>- <b>Razihel - Falcon Punch</b> <a href="https://soundcloud.com/razihel/razihel-falcon-punch-original" rel="nofollow">https://soundcloud.com/razihel/razihel-falcon-punch-original</a><br>Razihel is an eclectic young Italian producer. Although he has produced music for only two years, he's already worked with artists like Benny Benassi, Krewella, Savant, and Varien. His experience in punk hardcore and a massive love for video games gives him an edge as a producer that has enabled him to fast track his career in EDM.<br><br><i>Falcon Punch</i> is an upbeat Electro House track, under the genre "Electro Violence." Using a combination of meaty, punchy drums and a variety of bass growls and wubs, Razihel creates a legendary tune that is sure to get your head bobbing and foot tapping. The second drop even transitions into a groovy 6/8 time signature.<br><br>- <b><b>nanobii - pineapple spaceship</b> </b><a href="https://soundcloud.com/nanobii/pineapple" rel="nofollow">https://soundcloud.com/nanobii/pineapple</a><b><br></b>Ever since his Monstercat release <i>Rainbow Road</i>,
 nanobii has gained quite a bit of popularity because of his unique 
sound and genre: "kawaiicore," his term used to describe happy-hardcore.
 But "kawaiicore" seems to fit better, since nanobii's music makes you 
want to dance up and shake your hips like an anime girl ^-^<br><br><i>pineapple spaceship</i>
 is another one of nanobii's bread-and-butter songs; the happy hardcore 
rave tracks we all know and love. Some of his other songs are also free 
downloads, including <i>sugar rush</i>.<br><br>-&nbsp;<b>Scatman (Au5, Savant, Fractal, Prismati<b>c Remix) </b></b>[Dubstep/Trap]<b><b><br></b></b>It's
 a rare sight to see four people collaborate on a track; it's even more 
rare to see four people collaborate on a remix. However, these producers
 have managed to create a mind-blowing remix of <i>Scatman</i>, in honor
 of Scatman John. This epic song features 4 full drops, each showcasing 
all the producers' unique yet complimentary styles.<br><a href="https://soundcloud.com/aleksander-vinter/scatman-au5-savant-fractal-and?in=cinnamoncroc/sets/dubstep-tracks" rel="nofollow">https://soundcloud.com/aleksander-vinter/scatman-au5-savant-fractal-and?in=cinnamoncroc/sets/dubstep...</a><br><b><b></b></b>
