There's a glitch with relatively new players that doesn't allow them to see their stats, and it takes a while for it to actually get fixed. I know that my stats weren't loading up until very recently. The only thing to do is wait ;/<br><br>As for editing your profile, if the "edit profile" button doesn't work, try inserting this link in your browser.<br><br>avicus.net/[YOURNAME]/edit<br><br>Hope this helps.
