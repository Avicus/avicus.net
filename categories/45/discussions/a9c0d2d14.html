Diamonds are bad for 99% of maps. It just imbalances the game so much regardless if it's there for equal opportunity or not. Tanking is a problem especially where there's someone chugging golden apples.<br><br>Most maps with diamond can be killfarm maps.

Refer to Para. If it's a small map, with a small amount of diamonds it's not too bad. A big map, Quintus for example is terrible for diamonds. It's&nbsp;<b>way</b> too easy to kill farm.

Making kill farming forbidden needs more staff moderation, which is already a problem<br>There is no way to make it only available for defenders only

<p>I would say that u can have armour (/or 4 blocks each) for two persons per side if it's a bigger map<br>It would be even better if everyone had full leather armour when they spawn so it's just a bit harder for kill farming</p>

I dislike diamond blocks unless they are very balanced, and I also hate enchants because it literally rewards people for Kill farming

I guess hacking is a much bigger problem than killfarming, if there would be more diamonds. The diamond for defenders only idea, was just an example.

And what happens when the good people get full diamond? They don't die. They sit at middle or a monument and kill everyone.

Well who cares then, if they camp at their own monument it's considered defending which I have personally nothing against, but if it's camping at an enemys monument, then it's just kill farming again.

Diamonds cause matches that last hours and are not even fun. If a match lasts 2 or 3 hours I would want it to at least be enjoyable.

I reckon maximum 1 diamond block on the whole map, in the middle where people will either rush for it or just leave it. 9 diamonds overall won't make a massive difference tbh

Depending on the map can be very unbalanced, but in my opinion most of the time people use it to farm kills, because a lot of people don't craft full iron and they are easy to kill.
