I saw the post Tino made and the archive that was done.<br>I don't get why you say the post was useless (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://gyazo.com/764b269db2ea73408dbdc893002c6514">http://gyazo.com/764b269db2ea73408dbdc893002c6514</a>) when we were saying something that's right, maybe, I deserve the 1 hour ban but no people like Tino, Pyro, Avicus_Owner and so on. We were just giving our honest opinion about how unfair the ban was even thought it was a 1 hour one. Unban them at least and not me :P<br><b><i><u>P,S:</u></i></b><i><u></u></i><u></u> No forum ban please and if you're making a response, make one that's good.<br><b><i><u>Edit:</u></i></b><i><u></u></i><u></u> Poking the mods or not does matter as they didn't do anything and they were just using the TS normally, he were using their name + the riot thingy but I don't see the point.

Sorry, but I feel I didn't deserve it... I was trying to have fun, and FIT IN with a group of people FOR ONCE in my life. As soon as you guys joined, I figured I would stop, and that's when I changed my name. I mean, yeah, it's only a 1 hour ban, but it still hurt me inside. Call me weak, but it does.

A) Solution is to get a Sr Mod and enable the "Don't poke" mechanic.<br>B) That's not the case for those who didn't do anything.<br>C) If you can't ignore people doing nothing but sitting there with their names changed then your staff team has a problem. And I'm not talking directly to you. I mean this server as "your".

All of the Teamspeak people were given several warnings, and you failed to comply to a Staff Member's instructions. We understand that you all wanted be in on the fun, but we have good reasoning behind why it was made exclusively for staff members. Spam Poking the mods with "Pub or Riot!" was not needed, and also, you're allowed to have an opinion on the situation, but we were given instructions to temp-ban the people who were being disrespectful/ breaking the rules.

I just wanted to enjoy some beta testing, it isn't necessary to create posts just because you were tempbanned for an hour, and next time read the rules and don't spam poke me. Especially when some players where threatening to DDoS me for something like this. The testing is for staff only, you don't need to create a flame or riot about this at all. I have the be the one who gets all the hate since no other mods wants to punish players on TS and deal with the crap of aftermath. Spamming me with pokes wasn't going to change anything anyways.

Then please explain to me why I was banned. Give me a good reason, and I'll be happy. Refuse joined, said stop, and I changed my name. I stopped after that. Then when glitchy started spamming showing that i had my name with "Pub or Riot" EARLIER, that's when I was banned. I changed it. That's all there is to it IMO.

So no community input? We're the ones who play on this server. If there's something we may not enjoy is in this whole testing/update, nobody will know about it until the actual update. You have a team of less than 10 people to determine how an entire update will come out. Let us tell you what&nbsp;<i>we&nbsp;</i>want and maybe there won't be people disappointed every update.

It didn't matter if you're joking or not, it's a rule nonetheless, and you have to abide by it regardless if you're joking or not. The reason to why it was not publicly released was because it still has a lot of bugs, and it's not ready for public access whatsoever.

People in the chat were saying "Pub or Ddos" to everyone xD, you really think Greg would do such a thing xd<br>Anyways, I don't care about my ban, but I feel like the staff banned everyone in that particular chat.

Even if you don't have a booter or iON cannon to DDoS, it's still a threat, which is against the rules.

This is the first time of us being told. Would you agree that telling us about this, you know, before you guys dive head first into testing be a good idea? Because this is the first time me, personally, has been told about any user interactive testing whatsoever.

Woah Woah Woah, When did I ever say I was gonna DDoS you? More than one player said that yet i'm the only one who gets pointed out? And also you know for a fact that I'm not that kind of person. But appearently others can do it and get away with it, even staff....

Idk, Maybe because it's not confirmed or not if a public test will happen in the first place.<br><br>There are things that the general public shouldnt know at this point about the update, so if a public test happened now, then it wouldnt end well.

Honestly, who cares. You guys were only banned for 1 hour why complain? 
I would understand if it was like a 24 hour+ ban but seriously you guys can't go 1 hour without TeamSpeak?
Before I get any replies saying "the infraction shouldn't have happened in the first place" WHO CARES. IT'S ONE HOUR DEAL WITH IT.
Sure this shows how unfair the staff are at times but there's a difference between complaining about perm bans then going ahead and complaining about fucking 1 hour bans...

Also, in my opinion you guys did deserve these infractions. You guys are used to being specially treated regulars it's ridiculous. I'm sure if it was someone from OCN they'd be PERM BANNED not ONE HOUR BANNED.

Although I wasn't present, I heard the story from both sides. Each and every one of you are just ranting on about how your "side" of the story is valid, and the other is invalid. Well, let's all look at it this way.<br><br>Yes, the staff member who leaked the information should not have even said a word. I will have a conversation with him/her later on, thoroughly explaining why you shouldn't leak important information. This being, a perfectly good example.<br><br>On the other hand, the staff member(s) who dealt the 1 hour infractions had every right to do so. It doesn't matter if only a few people were constantly poking and annoying the staff, pleading to take part in beta testing. I was informed that almost everyone in that call had changed their name to "beta test or we riot" or something along those lines. Those of you who were punished had been punished by association. If you've ever heard the term "guilt by association" this is basically a perfect example of that. Not all of you committed the crime, but those of you who were punished took part in one way or another.<br><br>Now that you all have the answers you were probably looking for, I'm going to lock this thread. It's only causing tension throughout the Community, and flame wars are getting pretty out of hand. <br><br>If you have any more issues, you can contact me privately.
