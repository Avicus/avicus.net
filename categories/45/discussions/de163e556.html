My Minecraft fps went from 50-60 to 10-30, it started last night. Any reason it could have happened? I can't play with this fps.

Do CCleaner, go to your desktop. Right click, and go to Nvidia control panel (if you have one). Go to Adjust image settings with preview, and go to Use my preference emphasizing. and instead of Quality, do performance. If that doesent work, go just restart your PC. Literally, just put all the important things on a external HDD and just restart your whole PC. Idk how to do it tho.

I have no idea why it would do that but for the moment try using different versions of Minecraft and install Optifine on the version that works best for you.

Update your drivers, with driver booster, but you have to crack it. Sometimes that is the problem, also that will help you to get more fps.

Easiest way<br>~ Install Optifine, that hugely increases fps<br>~ Allocate half of your RAM to minecraft, this will give it more beef to run on<br>~ Turn all your settings down to minimum (render distance and that shit)

BTW this is for everyone too but if you are on a PC lots of people tell me that VBO's sometimes cause an fps drop but everyone with a laptop notices a huge difference with it on, inputting more power to your PC will always improve performance, it's just much easier to do on a laptop.

</div>
You see in video settings you can lock your fps so that it can't go higher than a certain point, which often helps stability. On 1.8 if you scroll it all the way to the bottom it activates vSync.
