Hello, so recently my experience has been disrupted quite an absurd amount of times on Nebula. Many players have accused me of hacking. O<a rel="nofollow">n</a>e player recently accused me of "knockback hacks"; something in which I don't have, and something that I assume doesn't exist anyway, as a moderator on OCN (it'd probably categorized as forcefield or something similar). Since I moderate so often, I get the tendency to tell that player off by saying "no, I don't have hacks" or "I strafed and block-hit you, thus I didn't get much knockback and because I strafed you, you backed up and I knocked you into the void" or something like that.<br><br>But then it'd probably stray into a bigger argument where players complain. So my question is; how do you ignore the tendency to reply to players accusing you of hacking?

I have actually seen what appear to be some form of knock back hacks. Once only, however. He knocked me back about 30 or so block in the space of about half a second, then anti heat pulled me back. But I am certain they exist to some, albeit limited degree.<br>As for hackusations, a /warn generally keeps them quiet.

I believe you are mistaking me with someone else. I don't remember calling anyone a hacker on this server. I said you looked like you were using aimbot on your&nbsp;<b></b><u>thread</u> because of the way your head moved.

No, I am not referring to the thread; it was in-game.<br>Maybe I am mistaking you with someone that has a similar name; my apologies if I am.

Everyone gets hacksuated, it's not really a big deal, however, if it's becoming spam or harrasment, feel free to submit a screenshot of it in Player Reports or use /report.
