Well I've been watching whats happened over the few days and there has been promotions to Sr Moderator , however there has also,been demotions it seems lots of people and staff I knew back ages ago since I joined are leaving , which I find hard to see but one thing I have noticed is ,  I said there needs to be staff all the time  then over staff applications they success for filled that , then there didn't go another game without a Mod in. But now the staff team is at about 25 and that's my question are people getting demoted for unactive ness or something else but there used to be a good amount of staff but lots of them have gone .Or have they chosen to leave thanks Element.

They mostly choose to leave.<br><br>Besides, change needs to happen sooner or later. We can't expect something to stay the same...

Some have requested Temp-leave and some have decided to leave altogether as they need to for-fill other priorities.

As many have said, most of them have stepped down and they will be missed:( however we cannot give up to making this become the best server ever so the staff team will strive even harder to be the most ideal staff team. Thank you for the concern, but we will make sure that we will keep calm and moderate on to the best of our abilities. :]<br><br>Regards,<br>Riley

I already am aware of why some of them stepped down.<br>It all comes down to the fact that Avi is going downhill.

To clear things up, Avicus is, yes, losing players. Which is unfortunate.<br><br>But, it doesn't mean the server is going "downhill" or is "ending." It's merely going through the ups and downs that every server goes through :3

Staff teams tend to fluctuate regularly, hardly anything to worry about though. What should really be focused on is the executives who are managing the staff and how they execute plans to better the staff.

Zedther. My words probably don't mean much as head mapdev anymore, but I'm disappointed entirely in your behavior as of recently, and instead of replying with a remark that may cause even more trouble or anything... I just look down at you and think that this is not the Zedther that was so promising and that I loved when I first wanted him promoted to mapdev. This is not the Zedther that was my friend on the build server that made so many friends and awesome maps. I used to like you a lot and pushed for you to become a staff member. You're now making me close to somewhat regretting that decision.<br><br>You've changed, please become more civil and not betray your own kind. I want my nubby, luvvy, friendly Zedther back.
