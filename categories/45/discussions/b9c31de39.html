Hello, I've started experimenting with World Painter. It's great to make terrain with and all, but whenever I load up the map in Minecraft, it either crashes or just says the building terrain stuff forever. Has anyone else had this problem and if yes please help. If no please help also :p

nvm it worked :D avicus is my lucky charm i guess.<br><br>@vsplesk: MCEdit doesn't have what I need. World Painter generates a world where you can raise/lower terrain with right/left click, create mountains, generate biomes, make beautiful mountains, glorious oceans, and amazing maps if you use it right. It's great for mapmaking. I use MCEdit too but only for copy/pasting huge sections and changing large biomes.

custom brushes? will have to look into that :&gt;<br><br>anyways, my first map came out looking awful, but I'm very new to the program so I expect to get better at it. Then maybe even use it for actual stuff :D

If you want an example of one of my maps that i used world painter check out War Everlasting.&nbsp;<br><br>It uses different biomes and large mountains. I made the caverns by TNT.<br><br>Anyway, you can also use World Painter to make a void world. The minecraft generated void worlds have higher MB's but WP generated void worlds use less memory so i definitely recommend this program to you.&nbsp;<br><br>Before using this program, i recommend making custom worlds first, see how they turn out and practice till you feel it will go well with your map.

^tru&nbsp;<br>also its good to have a lot of knowledge under ur belt. learn mcedit, install worldedit mod, use world painter for stuff, etc. it'd be cool if there was one program that everyone could learn to do all this but it's also better to keep them separate for other reasons<br><br>and yeah i've had trouble with mc void worlds, but downloading other people's reliable voids is quicker than making ur own.
