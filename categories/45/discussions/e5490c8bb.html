Your latest video was made 3 months ago. If you actually want more subscribers you should probably consider making some more videos.

I'm sorry to say this but nobody from Avicus will become successful on youtube ... The most "successful" from Avicus has 2 000? subscribers, if you call that successful, I will laugh out loud irl.

I disagree.<br>Sure, if you ONLY do Avicus videos,you won't hit gold, only 15-ish subs. Maybe more if you play/record different servers and games.

It's the issue with most of you players on Avicus, you can't become successful on Youtube by posting a video once in a week where you pvp someone and think "Oh let's celebrate my 25 subscribers!". In order to at least become something on Youtube, you must be different, that's your flaw, I understand if 10 - 15 people will watch you pvp other "well-known" Avicus players, but you will not be near success if you honestly think you will become something when there's thousands and thousands of others posting the same video as you. If you still think you will become something by doing this, you clearly need to open your eyes for once.

1st. I confirmed your my hater on my videos.<br><br>2nd. I do not do youtube to get "famous". Youtube is a hobby, not a job. And it shouldnt be a job. And I love posting avicus videos, you cant force anyone to post other videos<br><br>3rd. Who cares? ASAP Science and others post like 1 per month, same thing with MC or something, just takes time. If you really think its that easy, try it for yourself. I work my a$$ of to create even one video, I try about 5 times and it takes me about 3-6 hours to do it.&nbsp;<br><br>Overall everyone should choose what to do on youtube, Ik a guy (My friend) who has a youtube channel, he has 4k subs and it took him about 3 years to get there. S3M3L Why dont you rethink that.

1. Why do you think I am a "hater" when I've never even seen you on youtube or a single one of your videos? <br>2. I'm just being honest about the real issue with minecraft, youtube and avicus. I'm not forcing anyone to upload anything but avicus, minecraft, pranks or anything else. I'm saying you need to be different in order to become something. You can't spam the forums with every new video you make and think you will become pewdiepie. It's just stupid. <br>3. I "did" youtube myself a while ago, I quit when I was over the 10 million views-mark so I know it's rough and I know it takes time, yet again I'm telling you the real issue, if you don't accept it, I can't change your mind.

That's true, but we all have to remember that Minecraft has videos on pretty much anything. I agree that everyone MUST be creative. I'd say more than 1 million subscribers is success, 1k is good, 2k is better, but definitely not success.<br>Since there's not much to be produced that's "creative" YouTubers must be comedic, or even make their videos different with challenges and stuff.

I enjoy the fact that some people think I lie or make it up when there's proof I actually had a channel doing really well, if you would read a couple of pages back I left my channel behind me and quit youtube, it means the channel is removed as well. I also said this topic is about ed879, still you guys keep talking about me. If you don't believe me then you don't, I can't change your mind, as well as I can't change the fact that I can't give out my name, as easy as that.

I think we should leave semel alone as he is clearly looking for attention. Yes its obvious he doesn't have the channel so why keep pushing. Also semel you think that everyone here is 3 years old with special needs? You can't make such huge bullsh!t up and seriously think you can convince us. Either give proper proof of the channel by giving us the name, admit you are lying or f*ck off. I think everything that needs to be said has been now have a great day.

I don't look for attention and I never did, I wrote about how you need to be different in order to become something in the youtube-world, then I was attacked by stupidity and people going full-retard. I said a couple of times, it's behind me and this topic is about ed, still you guys write to me and expect me not to answer? Lol xD I also said you don't have to believe me, I do think my paypal and gmail connected to the channel is proof enough, if you don't believe me it's your decision, I don't really mind. I just keep laughing about how this escalated over nothing, just because I did good on youtube and gave some suggestions on how to become something.

Mark Zuckerberg is also my brother, we created Facebook together but I let him get all the fame as I have enough fame being Bill Gates.<br><br>No, I had a chat with youtube/google as they didn't like some of the videos I posted. We talked a both on mail and phone and it escalated from thereon, so I choose to remove my channel. It has nothing to do with hate, bill gates, ivycode, zuckerberg or even facebook.

What the f**k did you just f**king say about me, you little b***h?

I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target.
