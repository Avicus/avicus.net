There are a few big updates where things just started to get "crappy" &amp; where Avicus went into the wrong direction.<br><br>The biggest one probably was the change from McZone &gt; Avicus and with Avicus just not being advertised enough. Then a lot of smaller mistakes were made (still no advertising, block lag for a long time, no anti cheat, nexus &amp; walls gone, nebula shop gone, prestige gone etc.) which all are reasons why people left the server. Then, Throwback was removed which was another stupid decision to make with a low player count resulting in another portion of people leaving the server.<br><br>I'm sure that the "remastering" of a lot of good old maps also made the players who aren't as good in Minecraft as others a bit more angry. They liked to just play on simple maps with simple layouts, but also better players who just enjoyed playing old maps more, compared to newer maps (where aesthetics &amp; """"<b><i><u>gameplay</u></i></b>"""" play the biggest role) too (including me).<br><br>Basically if you want to fix Avicus, just reverse all the updates which came out until prestiges were added back and add Throwback back (and not just a Sunday Throwback version. At this point it's important to keep the players who play on the server, and not to try and get more players before you fix the problem of players who leave.)<br><br>tl;dr add Throwback as a whole server &amp;&nbsp;get rid of most "remastered" maps (especially very old maps who were remastered)<br><br>thx

The worst mistake was believing that Avicus would die, many players left because they didn't believe in this server anymore, what I understand due to the many mistakes with updates etc. Somehow people are still managing to keep this server alive, so why isnt it possible to make this server better

A lot of the Regulars who stayed despite everything started to leave.<br>Big reason why I left tbh. <br>So many friends had moved on, so I did too.

Ive always been a nexus and cth player, a lot of the old regulars played them and kept them alive for years even with stupid shit like fast hit not being fixed. When the old players started leaving and the gamemodes pretty much died it was pretty boring on here because the games i liked didnt get played<br><br>When prestiges were removed it pissed me off, i mean im shit and it took a long time to get the 2 or 3 that i managed to get and it was all just deleted without a care because it was too hard to add more or some shit when it could have just had a set amount and been fine<br><br>Throwback being removed was a big thing too, i hated throwback because it was the only thing that ever got played, but it had better maps than the other dtm rots have had for ages<br><br>I was never a competitive player but i know that scrims were pretty broke and shit for a long time and that wasnt the greatest thing to neglect on a server thats trying to be competitive
