Hi, I used to play avicus over a year ago and I played on a terrible laptop at like 20 fps :/. I got a gaming pc about 4 months ago that runs at 500 fps average but as you can imagine my K/D was still trash. Is there any way to reset my K/D like asking a manager or something? I'm actually good at pvp now...

You can't reset your K/D, like literally you physically cannot because it's not a thing here.<br><br>I don't know why you would be so asshurt about your K/D though, because you're banned at the moment so..

Unfortunately there is no way to reset your KD, as a solution just deal with it like everyone else.

Sorry to say, there's no way to reset your K/D to 0.0<br>You're best bet is to work your way up and working hard for a good K/D<br>will feel better when you really work for it, after all, the trip is better&nbsp;<br>than the destination x)<br><br>As snow stated above, you are currently banned, so I recommend appealing first before you<br>start worrying about your KD :/
