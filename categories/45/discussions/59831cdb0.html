Wholey moley... One time I had one of those OP fights when you have like Protection IV diamond armour and OP swords and what not. We also had 3 stacks of Super Golden Apples so the fight took ages. It literally almost came down to the last apple, well not quite. I had 6 more Gapples then him at the start and at the end I won with 4 extra gapples. The battle took 2 Hours 37 Minutes.<br><br>Also Killed Huahwi &lt;3

If you killed huahwi.. I want proof<br><br>First he is actually better than pretty much all of us on avicus (Probably not better than Dagoldbrick), He plays MCSG (I doubt you found him, such large servers and he is disguised)<br><br>I found him playing on RoxBot, one time (Maybe at like 10K subs) and he completely destroyed me...<br><br>But my kill is probably have to be EmeraldSword xD<br>Even tho for him it was like pretty much night, we were 1v1ing on kohi and... ye i beat him ^~^

Well at the time, they both said gf. They're nice if you aren't rude to them and besides when did anyone say anything about "gf"? The title is "best fights". That doesn't mean you can't include lucky ones.<br><i></i>I can edit/ delete the comment if you are upset about it...
