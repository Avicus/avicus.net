What are you guys looking forward to? Nothing.<br>What do you guys hate most about school? &nbsp;People and the education system.<br><span>What are your favorite or least favorite subjects? Social studies is cool.<br><br>By the way, almost everything I do is self-taught. Grammar, computer stuffs, and everything in between. The way I'm taught is really flawed and the teachers are confusing to lots of students, which also might be a flaw in how TEACHERS are taught/instructed. The only things I've picked up from school is reading, addition, counting, and the alphabet. I taught myself everything else including division/subtraction/multiplication.<br></span>
