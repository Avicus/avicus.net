Be fluent in Java. Start simple and make your way up.<br><br>Watch you tubers. I learnt from a youtuber called PogoStick29Dev<br><br>Ask Javi (or me). Javi taught me about Redis, he's a great teacher and he'll give you examples as well!<br><br>Anyway, good luck with programming. Maybe you'll become the next Avicus developer.

Well, for coding a plugin, you need to have much experience with Java. If you're not a programmer, then you'd have to learn it.&nbsp;<br><br><br>Learning a programming language will take much time. Here's a video for the beginning:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u1fu6f8Hto" title="Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u1fu6f8Hto">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3u1fu6f8Hto</a>
