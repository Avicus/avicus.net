yoyoyo&nbsp;<br>Imma just be real with you getting straight to the point.<br><br>So I use Sony Vegas Pro (Cracked) to edit and Fraps (shhh) to record. So maybe I wanna do some camera stuff with my mouse or keyboard. So I record the video on my phone and upload it to my PC. So is it any way possible to use both my video on the phone and my fraps file together, sort of like a face cam type of deal? I suck at editing so you guys need to help me with this. This is my current situation.&nbsp;<br><br>Now for Sony Vegas there is a QuickTime plugin but I've never attempted to install it nor bothered trying it. Also, if anyone has a crack for Action that actually works please add me on skype and we can walk through it together &lt;3<br>Skype --&gt; mlgtino<br><br><br>sorry for the crap grammar. don't feel like properly typing.

What I used to do when recording facecam as well as Minecraft gameplay, is record the facecam on Windows Movie Maker Live (I believe it comes with any computer nowadays) and record Minecraft with Fraps. After, just make sure to match up the video / audio from fraps with your facecam (so face reactions are in sync with your gameplay and commentary) and simply shrink the size of the webcam when editing it in Sony Vegas Pro. I use the same softwares for recording and editing as you do, so you could ask me if you need any further help. Good luck tino!
