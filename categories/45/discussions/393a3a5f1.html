Can't say it's ever actually happened to me, but if it did, I would be happy. The thought of knowing that you give someone positive feelings whenever they speak to you, and knowing that you can continue to make them happy through other (appropriate.. we won't talk about the inappropriate stuff) actions seems like a great thing.

Your behaviour has been extremely negative lately, and I'm not exactly a big fan.<br><br>I don't mean to stray off topic of this, I'll go on topic in a moment, but if you feel like you're going to receive hate, then it's better to not post than to go slightly off-topic and make a post like this. This does not contribute to the main topic, so it can be considered spam.<br><br>Nobody is going to say "OMG YOUR OPINION IS BAD AND YOUR BAD GO DIE".. Avicus actually has a decent community. We don't tolerate behaviour like that.<br><br>It's your choice as to whether or not you want to give your answer, but if you don't, then there's no need to make posts like this.<br><br>Back on topic now, you're right &nbsp;there, @Qunox :P Most of us are still teenagers, or possibly in our pre-teen years. We still have plenty of time to find people. I'm in no rush, and neither should any of us. :P

Assuming they weren't joking (like has happened to me 5 times because of games &gt;.&gt;) I'd probably get their number and catch up with them. I wouldn't say for certain as a serious relationship considering my behavior (controlling, arrogant, sad) but for someone to talk to and maybe to spend time with, of course. Any company is pretty much good company with me unless I was in a room with bees.

not exactly the answer im looking for kind of but at the same time thanks for the help, its just that ive been having a bad day and to make it worse when i go on avicus to just get away from the bad stuff, i get cursed on w/ lag lag and lag (connection lag) and i dont blame the server for it, its my own fault and i should be blamed, ppl call me a lagger, and i die alot back cuz of it as well, and it hit me so hard dat i just couldnt take it, the one place where i wanna be to escape the bad stuff i was experiencing IRL is also giving me a bad experience... idk, u guys probably think im just another one of those ppl who complain and complain about lag and any sort of help doesnt work cuz its not as easy to get better internet to play on your server, and to top it off im from the philippines, and yes they might be 2, 3 or even 5 filipino players from here playing on your server but thats cuz they probably have better internet and i dont, yes tell me to get better internet but my parents wont let me, i got no money and then when you all sum it up, i start loosing it and just letting out my anger and irritation in chat, and i cant cant cant control it, i just want to enjoy as much as i can but its impossible w/ my terrible connection, and i cant just move to the US just to play on your server cuz dats a reason for me which i cant take, and i dont wanna leave home at the same time, and to make things even worse, i get banned, and i see why and i dont blame them, but its just something in my nature at this state which i just cant handle, ill be honest, playing minecraft on this server has been my mindset and life for these past couple months now and its something i dont want to let go i just wanna enjoy like other people do, they dont get as much lag or no lag at all, they dont say ez, and if they loose its ok cuz they know did their best and did a good job in the game but nope, that isnt how things worked out positively for me, idk wat to do anymore, ill probably just quit and you guys wont have to blame me or not care anymore
