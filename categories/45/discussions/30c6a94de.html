So now I hear everywhere: "EULA'S GONNA MAKE MINECRAFT BAD!1!!!"<br>No. Come on.<br>All it'll change is the amount of donators. Sure, some servers might crash and burn, but not us. Not most servers. How's it gonna change Avicus? Maybe I can finally use Freezer? Maybe I can finally get some VIP kits?&nbsp;<br>Look at it from the bright side! Imagine finally getting on Hypixel; and actually winning a HG because some donator idiot doesn't get a horse no more. Imagine getting on Badlion! You can have unlimited ranked matches! Imagine getting on mchg- where you can finally use Kangaroo! Imagine the possibilities. EULA,from my opinion's just gonna make servers more fun- less pay to play and more competitive! It's not like EULA just completely ruined PvP- They didn't ruin any aspect of PvP at all! It's just a change to the rules- nothing else!&nbsp;<br><br>EDIT: It also means some spoilt 8 year old can't rek you anymore;)<br>C'mon guys- cheer up! Be optimists!&nbsp;<br><br>Side note: If this is advertising; I will take it down.

Your reply doesn't make sense.<br>If you liked the server; you wouldn't mind EULA.&nbsp;<br>If you donated for the perks; you would hate EULA.<br>You said you liked the server, but now you apparently 'wasted money'.&nbsp;<br>Therefore; one part of your statement suggests you like the server; and the other completely disagrees.&nbsp;<br>Make up your mind.

How have you wasted your money if you love the server&nbsp;<br>and you are helping it to run better it is not a waste of money at all. Unless you don't like the server and your just doing it for the advantages. So your money is not wasted."I paid cause I like the server". Donating to avicus helps them out a ton. Without donations avicus wouldn't be true. It is not a waste at all. You will also have some cool perks,just it will take away the ones that give a disadvantage to normal users.

Donations are what keep servers running, without donations a server will die. Its not like IvyCode has unlimited money. Most donations he gets are put back into the server. Fhe EULA is making it so most servers that rely on donatins will stop.

They had the option of a surgical approach that would ultimately keep servers up with reasonable donation prices and ideas and shut down servers that could end up "scamming" you of your money.<br>But no, you have to just shut down all of the servers.<br>"WHAT ABOUT ME?!

Well, there are good sides and bad sides to the EULA. First of all what Faze mentioned was correct, but then how do the servers earn money? They'll have to close down eventually. But, on the other side, it makes the server more fun. From "Pay to win" to "Play to win"! ;)

Servers would be dead because Server Owners would need donations so they can keep the server running. After EULA Changes, people get nothing for donating which then nobody would even donate at all because they don't get anything back. After that the servers will be dead. So I really don't like what the Eula is going to do. :(

This does mean LOTS of big servers will go down. People buy ranks for in game perks, not much cosmetically. Now people will not be donating as much, meaning servers will lose money and close. I own a network, and we are dealing with the EULA now, and it's really a pain.

I see your point, but I'm sure if this becomes a problem when the new EULA comes out, Mojang will fix it..&nbsp;<br>Like, if tons of big servers go down because they can't get enough money, then Mojang will address and fix the issue or just make the EULA tell people that donations with perks are allowed.&nbsp;<br>Personally, I don't think it's that big of a deal because if Mojang realizes that Minecraft is starting so suck, they'll fix it.

Haha. This post is funny in my opinion. The fact that you think the EULA change is a good thing because no one will have perks is an interesting idea. It is good for players who are not allowed to donate or are not willing to donate in the short term, but in the long term when servers start closing, you will be screwed. Let me bring these arguments up to prove to you how flawed your concept is.<br>A) Would you ever donate to a game server for absurdly nothing?<br>B) How do you expect any server to run with 0 income to actually maintain the server? Servers can cost up to thousands of dollars a month.&nbsp;<br>C) Would you prefer to have servers like Avicus where donators have a small xp boost, or would you rather pay to get into the server?&nbsp;<br>These are just a few thoughts i had, i literally came up with this topic in less than 2 minutes.&nbsp;<br><br>Now, in my opinion and from what I've heard and seen about the EULA enforcement is that you will not be able to donate for any advantages in-game. You can only get purely cosmetic items (besides capes). I can guarantee no large server network can support their own servers (thousands of dollars) with extremely few donations. This will lead to more servers closing down, and the quality of minecraft in general decreasing.&nbsp;<br><br>These are just my views on this topic.

Im tired of this.<br>To people complaining about the EULA. Grow up.<br>Im tired of people just going ape shit because the EULA is going to "ruin" minecraft. 1st the game can't die due to the fact of how much sales it gets a day. 1 Sale = 27 bucks. Over 15 million sales = $4042500.00. Do you think a game can die off due to one god damn update? No. I understand a lot of servers are going to shut down but, take a chill pill. It's not the end of the world, if you hate the new mc, just buy or find another game on Steam or the internet to play. There probably will be some servers to play also, like it was a long time ago in minecraft. Just grow up and take it.

I know i'm replying to the second reply on this post but, 90% of servers (espically big ones) will crash and burn BECAUSE You cant run a server without funding.

The server ain't gonna die. There could still be perks but Avicus must remove the perks that give an advantage in gameplay. Xp boosts for example and grenades. Hats and pets are fine. I don't see any problem with the EULA. It is actually benefitng minecraft for a change because there are so many pay to win servers. Yes, people can still donate. Just cause some perks are removed, doesn't mean people won't donate anymore. People DONATE because they DONATED their money to help the server, not to get silly perks. So calm down

Haha. This post is funny in my opinion. The fact that you think the EULA change is a good thing because no one will have perks is an interesting idea. It is good for players who are not allowed to donate or are not willing to donate in the short term, but in the long term when servers start closing, you will be screwed. Let me bring these arguments up to prove to you how flawed your concept is.<br>A) Would you ever donate to a game server for absurdly nothing?<br>B) How do you expect any server to run with 0 income to actually maintain the server? Servers can cost up to thousands of dollars a month.&nbsp;<br>C) Would you prefer to have servers like Avicus where donators have a small xp boost, or would you rather pay to get into the server?&nbsp;<br>These are just a few thoughts i had, i literally came up with this topic in less than 2 minutes.&nbsp;<br><br>Now, in my opinion and from what I've heard and seen about the EULA enforcement is that you will not be able to donate for any advantages in-game. You can only get purely cosmetic items (besides capes). I can guarantee no large server network can support their own servers (thousands of dollars) with extremely few donations. This will lead to more servers closing down, and the quality of minecraft in general decreasing.&nbsp;<br><br>These are just my views on this topic.

The server is not going to die, all that happens is that some of the "donators" start whining like the jerks they are, and then leave.<br><br>Almost every server with "donator" gives them an advantage over other players, usually a huge one. That's unfair to the people who don't want to or can't donate AND to Mojang. Whether you like it or not, people are making money off of someone else's game.<br><br>Stop complaining about losing money. For every person who lost cash on this server, there will be at least one more somewhere that got scammed. Be thankful you weren't one of those people.<br><br>And I can see some people saying Mojang are doing this for the cash. justification/10<br>You can't justify hating the EULA by making out Mojang to be money thieves because:<br>1.&nbsp;<b>Mojang wouldn't even make a cent</b>&nbsp;from implementing this, they'd just stop others from making cash.&nbsp;<br>2. If they wanted to be jerks/make cash, they'd file a lawsuit for people making money AT ALL from servers, but they aren't.<br>3. Regardless, it still doesn't justify your&nbsp;hating the EULA.<br><br>As a side note, if you'd even thought about what you were doing when you donated, you'd probably figure out that the server is making money off of Mojang's game and you could use some of the common sense you were given and figure out that that's illegal.

that's why we hate the EULA cause the owners who bought the realms will pay for like every month or sometimes after 6 months annnnd they can't just pay it all by themselves cause it's gonna be just a waste of money for them. donations are for to keep the server running and also paying for the realms. if EULA affected some big or popular servers, there's a big chance they'll shut down because the owner doesn't have a benefit from it and he/she can't pay all be him/herself. there's more cons than pros in EULA.

There are pros and cons to the EULA:<br><br>Pros:<br>- Stops younger children from stealing credit cards from their own parents and using to buy ranks costing $200 (Example)<br>- Enforces the "everyone gets shit" rules to alot of servers&nbsp;<br>- Stops hate emails from parents complaining about losing money worth for a block game<br>- Every player will be balanced in any aspect of minecraft<br>- Little things that don't add to gameplay such as pets will still be around for donating<br><br>Cons:&nbsp;<br>- People who own large pay to win servers will lose the chance to gain the money for the server<br><br>There are not many cons to this that i could think of (even though my con statement is a broad topic), there sin't much to hate about this EULA. Yes, it's frustrating for people who donated for countless servers to a block game, but there's still tweaking to go around. Besides, the EULA has been around for many years, they just haven't enforced the EULA we're all complaining about. They've been talking about this subject anyway, so don't be bitching about this.

Most servers that have over 50,000 registered users (considered popular servers,) have around $5,000 of monthly charge. $5,000 is a lot of money and if the amount of donations drop because the perks aren't as good then that server is bound to be shut down pretty quickly.

I realized something. It seems that most donors that replied said they hated the EULA, and most non-donors said they thought it was a good thing. Guys, its not a bad thing. Taking away perks, who cares? All perks do is give you an unfair advantage in a game, and if you do win I honestly wouldn't call it legit. I paid for Gold on Avicus. But I didn't pay for perks. I paid because I wanted the server to grow and improve, and knowing that I made an impact towards the server growing and improving and watching it become amazing, I'd get the feeling that I helped.

Well, I hafta disagree with you. :P Players may go like "Huh, it's fine. Not like it's going to effect me that much" but server owners use the donations for their server prices. That is their main way in paying for the servers. Huge servers like this will hardly get any donations from cosmetic items. I have a server (Don't reply asking for ip) and so far, the donations have been used on the server prices, but never on anything else. If I stop getting donations, I will not get enough for the server, and it can shutdown. This is how server owners see of it, but this can be different. Some players donate for the love of it, and some donate just because they want to look better in the cosmetic items. Also, this has happened with the youtube recording minecraft footage stuff things if you didn't know.

But Amba, I feel my point still stands as a fairly legit argument, as well as yours. But all they would do is force unfair advantages out of ranks, not take them away completely. They would allow servers for example to have ranks that give you an advantage, but give you a fair disadvantage as well, such as a strength buff but weaker armor in a kit, to keep it fair while still allowing servers to recieve money to stay up and running.

I'm not sure if someone has said this but FazeofKnight your not looking at it from a servers perspective, if you have no donor ranks how are you going to keep the server or expand your server. You can't, because it all costs money, like the DDoS protection and actually buying the servers.

Well it sounds like you guys aren't really trying to help Avicus by donating. I donated to help Avicus and get the perks. If the EULA takes away my rank sure I will be pissed, but at least Avicus will still be up and running &nbsp;thanks to the money that we, donors, paid. That's why we are called "Donators", we donate to the server so it can run properly. :P

Oh my some people aren't getting the point of the EULA. Again 2 links to explain it -.-<br><br>Okay first off, here are 2 links to clear things up about the EULA. Read it carfully.<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="https://mojang.com/2014/06/lets-talk-server-monetisation/">https://mojang.com/2014/06/lets-talk-server-monetisation/</a><br><a rel="nofollow" href="https://mojang.com/2014/06/lets-talk-server-monetisation-the-follow-up-qa/">https://mojang.com/2014/06/lets-talk-server-monetisation-the-follow-up-qa/</a><br><br><br>Read them. Mojang DID NOT SAY there would be no more donator ranks. YOU CAN STILL DONATE!!!!!!! It's just that donator ranks cannot have perks that give them an advantage in gameplay. xp boosts for example and kit's that you get from donator ranks give an advantage. Read the 2 links for more clarification.&nbsp;<br><br>The server can still runn by donating. If you say "Oh, people ain't going to donate cuz we will have no perks', your just plain dumb. Donating is something you give in order to beenefit the community. you don't expect something in return. Those people who say they need perks to donate, you are being selfish and not thinking about others. That's the whole point of donating, it &nbsp;is so to help the server, not to get sillly perks. So stop complaining people. So what if there is no perks? If i was allowed to donate, i would donate for avicus and ocn. i don't care if there is perks or not because&nbsp;i get because the one perk that matters most: is keeping the server alive up and running and help the server devolp to become more fun

why would the EULA stop donations? It clearly said it would not stop donations. It just doesn't want servers scamming other people. &nbsp;You are allowed to donate still.

If people only got certain perks, people will still purchase perks for the server. Minecraft is not only about competitive aspect (it was never supposed to be really competitve anyway), but it's about having fun, and I don't believe you understand. People buy minecraft to have fun, not to be actively competitive. It's not like you're getting one million dollars for winning a 1v1 tournament.

Real benefits for donating eyy?<br><br><br>Isn't the biggest benefit is the server being alive and able to be devolped more due to donations? Like i said, you donate only because you want to support the server, not to get some perks. That's called purchasing if they want to get perks. In donating, you don't expect something in return. Actually, you do. What you get in return is the server still up and running and able to make more improvements thanks to these donations. Some people on this thread still do not get this concept of "donating". You think that, you donate, you get some perks. YOU DONT. If you donate to a charity, what do you get in return? Nothing but you are helping to support the charity by donating. Stop whining people. You are making a big fuss about the EULA when its actually trying to help avoid pay2win servers and stop minecraft networks from scamming other people. the EULA has always been there and now people are whining cuz its being enforced? That's ridiclous.&nbsp;<br><br><br>I hope you read the 2 links that give clarification about the EULA and i hope people understand the concept of "donating"

I'm gonna be straight about this. I think Donor ranks are fine. I fucking hate pay to win but on this server it's okay.

It's not scamming. That would imply that they are not upfront about what they are selling, and possibly misleading. I've never seen a server that does this. Selling a diamond sword for $500 is not scamming. Very few people donate to "keep the server alive", most do it for the perks. And no-one forces anyone to buy $500 ranks, so can you PLEASE stop trying to push the point that there are people scamming kids.

A lot of you guys don't seem to understand... The EULA is 100% negative for minecraft networks. Big networks cost LOTS of money to maintain every month. I have a small network and we pay about 100$ a month, now imagine Avicus, actually imagine the Hive :O 99% of players do NOT donate to help the server, they donate for perks, it may not sound nice, but its a fact. When the server doesn't have much to offer for donors, the server doesn't receive as many funds, and has to go down. EULA is not a friendly move from Mojang, to stop pay to win servers, honestly they are being plain greedy. They may have some point to the new EULA, but 90% of it is negative on Minecraft.

It's not donating to get ranks/perks, it's purchasing ranks/perks. To get your mind clear, let's use a random fast food restaurant named burger land. I go and buy a triple decker cheeseburger with rye bread. The burger costs about $10.50. I pay them the money. That's<b> purchasing</b>. Now, let's say i was going to give some money to give some money to the Lebron family foundation. That's&nbsp;<b>donating.</b><br><br>Ok, so I made a strawpoll with about 75% of the donators on hive. Most say that they don't care about perks, they want to have fun on the server. Also, the hive is safe from the EULA because if I recall, there are no perks that will give them an advantage ingame. People will still purchase ranks/perks. Same as OCN. People will still purchase their ranks because the EULA doesn't affect them.

It's not negative when most people who have purchased ranks completely dominate most other people who haven't purchased any rank. Besides, it's to remove the pay-to-win aspect. You're still able to join full servers, have priority over non premium members, and pets. You're just mad because you can't have your "full enchanted diamond armor kit" on other servers.

I don't give a sheet about perks. I don't have any payed ranks other than avicus Diamond which I bought when it was 20$... I don't care about losing perks. My point is, people like having advantages or perks, thats just how it is. How many people are going to donate for cosmetic things and joining full servers etc? Not nearly as many, people still will, but not as much as before. Servers cost LOADS of money to maintain, and they can't stay up without receiving LOADS or purchases/donations! I personally don't like pay to win, but things like kits, on Akane (my server) each kit would have different items, not more overpowered ones, but different types. These kits were just different style, not better than each other, and donators were able to purchase these kits! Now this isn't really a game changer THAT MUCH, it is but not pay to win, but that isn't allowed in the EULA.

And just to add, would you like servers where some people have a slight advantage over others, or no servers at all?

If anyone has done their research for once you would know that hypixel has confirmed that they have a plan, So has a lot of other servers. This is business, companies have to change big things sometimes because of the government, this is the same thing. Avicus will have to comply to change and this is a test if they can do it. If they can't well...you know what will happen.

Imagine a small, popular business.<br>Now imagine that business is broke, and it has to get the money it needs to stay open by selling certain things on the black market.<br>Now the government cracks down on selling that certain thing and starts arresting people.<br><br>And that is what you have happening here, except Mojang is nicer than the government.

I don't give a sheet about perks. I don't have any payed ranks other than avicus Diamond which I bought when it was 20$... I don't care about losing perks. My point is, people like having advantages or perks, thats just how it is. How many people are going to donate for cosmetic things and joining full servers etc? Not nearly as many, people still will, but not as much as before. Servers cost LOADS of money to maintain, and they can't stay up without receiving LOADS or purchases/donations! I personally don't like pay to win, but things like kits, on Akane (my server) each kit would have different items, not more overpowered ones, but different types. These kits were just different style, not better than each other, and donators were able to purchase these kits! Now this isn't really a game changer THAT MUCH, it is but not pay to win, but that isn't allowed in the EULA.

Cels, do you run a network? Do you know how much it costs to maintain? If there are servers that get no donations, and remain online, then the owners have another income supporting it. The majority, LARGE majority of server stay alive from donations. And its not only pay to win that it stops. If the default kit has a stone sword, and lets say the premium kit has a stone sword and a random wood sword added to their inventory, that is against the EULA. Most of YOUR points are invalid.

Cels, Teckky and I were confronted by a Mojang member, and we asked questions, to figure what was acceptable and not, and by the way the EXP boost will not be allowed.

Im tired of this.<br>To people complaining about the EULA. Grow up.<br>Im tired of people just going ape shit because the EULA is going to "ruin" minecraft. 1st the game can't die due to the fact of how much sales it gets a day. 1 Sale = 27 bucks. Over 15 million sales = $4042500.00. Do you think a game can die off due to one god damn update? No. I understand a lot of servers are going to shut down but, take a chill pill. It's not the end of the world, if you hate the new mc, just buy or find another game on Steam or the internet to play. There probably will be some servers to play also, like it was a long time ago in minecraft. Just grow up and take it.

If donors have an XP boost that later on unlocks a thing in-game like a kit, yes.<br><br>Lets say you get a kit with an iron sword instead a stone one at 500 XP.<br>Donor multiplier is x2 meaning the donor only needs to do half what a regular user needs to do which means he gets it faster.<br>So yes I think XP boosts like that ^ break the EULA as the donor has a slight advantage over a non-donor

1. DA stands for dumbass<br>1b. Monitor your money better if your child can get a hold of $200<br>2.

With BeastNode a simple 1000 slots would be 300. 200 for advertisement values. &nbsp;That is 2 Diamond or 4 Golds. They only problem is is that this server does have a few pay to win aspects that they sadly had to rely on looking at this chat. If Funky or Ivy was smart he would of been preparing what needed to be change and get ideas for donators the first day.
