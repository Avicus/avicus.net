Hey guys,<br><br>So let me tell you a story... Today my friend was in Geography with a teacher called let's say Mr Scott. Mr Scott saw my friend reading a book while he was teaching, so he said: "Have you ever seen a book fly?" as he picked the book up and threw it from the second story of the building into the pouring rain. It is now unreadable and VERY damaged.<br><br>What is wrong with people? That is abuse and a very rude thing to do. -_- Some people; wow! I honestly find that so inappropriate and rude of a teacher. How disrespectful..<br><br>Talking of some people I made a post yesterday, claiming that it was my only copy of a test I wrote for myself and that it was editable. I then told everyone how great our community was because no one ruined it. Some immature idiot then came onto it and put up a lot of bad things -_-&nbsp;<br><br>A staff member then decided it would be a great idea to super archive it? Instead of just removing the link to my document. I asked Shiro if he could view it, nope.<br><br>If you see a topic that is inappropriate, remove anything inappropriate please. Don't archive it and oppress freedom of information.<br><br>Anyway that's my rant! xD&nbsp;<br><br>Regards,<br><br><br>The Tortoise :o

LOL. What an interesting story. I get where your going some people can just blown your mind with the retarded things they do. <br><br>I was go-carting in NZ a long time ago when I was young, when this guy behind was accelerating so fast. He purposely pushed me into the bushes. My back was sorta damaged and I had scars/scratches over my face from the branches in the bushes. <br><br>Needless to say I had to go back into the go-cart and go all the way down the mountain. To make it back to where my family was. We immediately went back to the hotel and I had to get a check up.<br><br>Trust me I was like "WOW! Why The Fack would you do that to me". I was like only <b>7 Years old</b>. Now I'm 16. That stuff is ingrained into my mind.<br>
