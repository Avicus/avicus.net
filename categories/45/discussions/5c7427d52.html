It is a mod that gives a player an advantage over another player so it is not allowed.

I'm pretty sure you can you a toggle-shift as long as you don't stay shifted while your inventory is open or anything, since you can basically do the same with vanilla settings. Toggle-sprint isn't allowed though.

How about a minimal with players turned off. I just want to look at the map and examine it thats how I play most of the time. (Don't know how to download mods anyways)

Referring to what JK said, it's not allowed if you can open inventories of containers or your normal inventory. I remember it used to be allowed a while back, but as of now it isn't particulary if you are using it to "cheat".

I don't know that much about macros and toggle sprint but as 99250 said it can give advantage in gameplay so maybe not.

The rule varies on different servers. For example, this server allows gamma change in your Minecraft settings (since it is Vanilla Minecraft with no mods), while a server that vladthegreat100 plays on does not allow it.<br>Certain things are not allowed on certain servers. They each have their own unique set of rules.

I'm sure most mods aren't allowed, since it's similar to "hacks". Well they are pretty much the same.&nbsp;<br><br>I'm not sure why you would want a crouch mod anyhow, shifting normally isn't that hard :/<br><br>Anyhow just see what the staffs say

So would setting a sprint key (like 'r') in the minecraft controls setting be a macro? (sorry, I don't know much about these kinds of things.)

That's called a keybind not a macro. Keybinds are allowed because all you're doing is modifying your controls.

I believe that in the new update mojang added a key (normally disabled) that auto sprints for you if you hold it down. But sense i done "hack" i don't know exactly what "mods that enhance sprinting capabilities" means.

if you set a toggle macro, I belive when you enter your inventory/esc menu the shift would be used on those menus, meaning you couldn't shift while in your inventories. I'm almost 100% sure, but I haven't tried

This is fine as it is in within the boundaries of the game that rules is taking a it mods which do it for you like better sprint mod. Since that is part of the vanilla game it's fine and feel free to use it as it is a key binding

It's like hotkeys with actions such as left click, some people get this confused with AutoClicker whenever macros are used for PvP (Attack Action).

Yeah you're right but when you take chat macros to a whole new level and make them spam macros, then that's not allowed.
