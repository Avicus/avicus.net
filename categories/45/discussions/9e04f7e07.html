Hay ho<br><br>So I recently bought myself a badge for 12,500 credits, I was happy as fuck and then I saw my storage was full.<br>Then I went on and deleted all the useless crates that are given to us and nobody ever will consider buying.&nbsp;<br><br>Think about it..<br><br>Spending money to open a small crate on a server, is it seriously worth it..? It's like saying you're paying for a VPN and in that you have to pay to use it for different countries or smth. But really? Why did you even add this?<br><br>My suggestion is<br><br>1) Either remove the crates<br>2) Make them for free, but takes 10k credits to open one.

I've suggested buyable keys or sellable crates several times, but the staff keeps ignoring the suggestion threads, no matter how many times I bring it up ingame to staff or bump the threads.<br><br>I say +1, but knowing how reliable the staff is when it comes to this, it ain't happening.

People who decide to open cases, on a Minecraft server, with like 60 players, for 2$, with a chance off getting nothing, need to consider what they are doing with their life.

dude why do you think avicus created "crates"<br><br>for money so that the server can do better things it's common sense. though i do agree they are pointless and hardly anyone i know buys them.

I agree, plus I know why they added it.<br>They did the same with donor ranks.. made them temporary.<br><br>more perks (temporary perks) + donors = profit

How much are the keys? I think one of em is 4.25 for a type of crate. Personally, I have better ideas of spending 4.25 on a block game.

<div>I agree, 10k credits is a good amount too. Maybe vary the credit prices for different crates, more for the best one (gamma I think) maybe 25k or something.</div>

I don't see why the keys and crates should be removed.<br>Currently keys are the best selling item in the shop.<br>Also if you don't have so much credits or you aren't as dedicated to get credits,&nbsp;you still can get trails and perks in the hub.<br>Of course it would be nize if you could open them with credits, but then we would loose a steady flow of income through the shop. And in the end it comes back around to keep the server running.<br><br>PS. We are not ignoring threads like this, but sometimes we can't do anything. It's up to the developers to change it. And just because no developer or staff member posts on the thread means that it gets ignored.

Imo the crates are pretty useless, but considering they probably wont be removed, they need to be moved to somewhere besides the ender chest or maybe a setting that lets you choose whether to get crates or not, some people know they are not going to use them, I had to buy the 10k trail twice because of the crates taking up space +1
