So i'm really surprised that none of you made this post So I decided I would.&nbsp;<br><br>Recently David Bowie and Alan Rickman both passed away from cancer at the age of 69.<br>David Bowie was a very famous English singer known for some amazing songs, they were quite eery at times but still amazing. Here is one of my favourite songs "Starman" which he was planned to perform this today as his last ever song performance. Alas he passed away. Here's the song and I hope we can all play our due respects.<br><span style="color: rgb(0, 102, 33); font-family: arial, sans-serif;  "><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRcPA7Fzebw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRcPA7Fzebw</a><br></span><br>Moving onto Alan Rickman.<br>Alan Rickman played the role Severus Snape in the film series of harry potter. His acting was so good that he was hated in real life by Harry Potter fans, until the last one of course. Where we find everything out. The fact that two legends like this passed away around the same time makes me realise that my idols that I have been growing up with will eventually pass away. I hope you guys can pay your respects, I know this isn't the greatest place. But I really felt the need for this.<br><br>Thanks.

Quite terrible indeed. If you don't know who David Bowie is, he sung Space oddity and helped with under Pressure.

Alan was a legend. Some of his older movies like Die Hard are really good as well.<br>:'(

2 talented men have passed away this year. I've always loved how rickman could be so scary in Harry Potter, so good at being the villain but also funny kind and caring in real life. They will be missed R.I.P

R.I.P &lt;3<br><br>My mum was obsessed with David Bowie so I always had his music playing around my house and Alan Rickman was a legend for me in the Harru Potter films, they will be missed.

R.I.P Alan. I am a HUGE Harry Potter fan. The book series got me into reading and the movies got me into sci-fi and fantasy.&nbsp;<br><br><br>Snape was my absolute favorite character. I can't lie though, I hated him right to the point he was about to die. I guess that's with most people, but he was amazing.<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsYWT5Q_R_w&amp;ab_channel=HowItShouldHaveEnded">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsYWT5Q_R_w&amp;ab_channel=HowItShouldHaveEnded</a><br><br>Skip to 2:00 for bad ass alan

RIP.&nbsp;<br>Two great men both died way too young and of a terrible and disgusting disease/condition.<br>I also hate cancer, and I hope they keep being brilliant wherever they are now.
