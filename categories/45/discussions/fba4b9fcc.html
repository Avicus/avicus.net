So as most of you know, I've been banned for Aimbot and Safe Aura.&nbsp;<br><br>You might feel let down, betrayed, but&nbsp;I can assure all of you - friends, teammates and players - I DO NOT hack, I never have and I never will.<br><br>I'd like to say what an amazing 2 years it's been, through good and bad. I finally made it into the staff team and now I feel like I've been stabbed in the back. The staff are good, they do their job and strive for bigger things.&nbsp;<br><br>Apollo have been amazing; they're a true family and I will never forget them, thanks for everything guys and good luck in scrims/tourneys until the staff see sense and I get unbanned.<br><br>All of those public players I've had a laugh with, it's been great. I always logged on whenever I felt like I needed a break from the outside world so thanks for almost being a stress relief for me.<br><br>Safe Aura:&nbsp;<a href="http://youtu.be/fd_zbNpB578">http://youtu.be/fd_zbNpB578</a><br>Aimbot:&nbsp;<a href="http://youtu.be/5-LfO2c0Ys0">http://youtu.be/5-LfO2c0Ys0</a>&nbsp;(1:47 &amp; 2:47)<br><br>I'll stay in teamspeak but obviously you won't see me in game, thanks for everything.<br><br>If you have any questions feel free to ask.<br><br><img src="http://images.memes.com/meme/514877" title="Image: http://images.memes.com/meme/514877"><br><br>Peace.

Just fucking 6 hrs ago we were playing a scrim wtf. I'm probably gonna get banned for saying my opinion but the staff is just banning whoever is good now. First there's Alex then you. You think you're cracking down on hackers but it's really just affecting the community. Like how many people do you have to ban unjustly. Spookez you will be greatly missed and I will always remember you as the sub :'c&nbsp;<br><br>Maybe one day the staff will come to their senses and see the damage they are causing to the community. No offense but I thought the staff were supposed to bring justice. Instead we get a corrupt system (just speaking my opinion and ot pointing out anyone in particular ). You will be missed Spookez &nbsp;&lt;\3<br><br>Don't get me wrong, I greatly appreciate their efforts to keep everything fair but this is way too far.

Hilarious. Ive been told by an admin and a manager yesterday that before banning a staff member a screenshare needs to be done. If it hasnt been one, its pure bias and sorry, but stupid decision. You have to be 100% sure before banning somebody for hacking, especially if he is a competitive player, and especially if he is a staff member.<br><br>Spooks, you have been one of my best buds in Apollo, i literally could talk to you about everything. Im 100% sure that you dont hack, and also you did great as a mod. I hope that once you get unbanned you will become staff again.

I'm still very surprised how there was no screenshare done to at least see if he has any GC's or Hack clients on his computer.<br><br>Spookz, you were a great guy. Hate to see you go like this from a ban that shouldn't have happened.

Aimbot doesn't do that, it doesn't do a 360, that is pointless. It head snaps the player, then you obviously switched back to your main position.

Anyone who says that he should be unbanned immediately should understand that there is no way for you to tell if UK_P1NG was hacking or not.

But that's not the point.<br>And yes i know that the staff &nbsp;might not be the best hack detector people out there, what i'm saying is that you should stay neutral on these kind of situations, and not go out of your way to say things you have no idea about.<br><br>And Ryilo, i really think you have no idea what you're talking about.

One more hackusation or flame wars starter and the thread will be locked. Stop insulting each other and stay on topic, please show maturity and respect.<br><br>Calm down or thread will be locked, as simple as that, and I believe spooks doesn't want it to be locked. So just refrain from posting immature things, even if just for him.

Anyone who says that he should be unbanned immediately should understand that there is no way for you to tell if UK_P1NG was hacking or not. You do not know what kind of evidence he has against him.<br><br>Before you say that "You clearly haven't been falsely banned by staff!!11!1"<br>Well actually i have like, what 8 times now? But that's not the point.<br>And yes i know that the staff &nbsp;might not be the best hack detector people out there, what i'm saying is that you should stay neutral on these kind of situations, and not go out of your way to say things you have no idea about.<br><br>And Ryilo, i really think you have no idea what you're talking about.

This community is so shit lmfao.<br><br>He's either playing like Flusha or he's hacking in that video. I do disagree on the ban tho seeing as they would need more evidence in my opinion. But he's still hacking in that video.<br><br>But you members who starts talking shit over a Minecraft ban which can easly get removed, what are you, think lmao.
