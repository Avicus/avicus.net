From my opinion, old lobby(hub) was better. Now hub is smaller and not good for me. If you think that old one was better, we can create comminacaiton with a MapDev... (please write if you th!nk like me)

I disagree with you and I hope/bet they will change the hub with the update.

The hub is only&nbsp;<b>temporary.</b> It will be replaced in the <b>upcoming update.</b> The reason to why the old hub was taken out was because it was very, very laggy. It will be replaced soon however! :)

The new hub is smaller to reduce the annoying amount of time it takes to Download Terrain while connecting to Avicus.<br>Let me also reinforce the fact that it is only temporary, and a new hub was already finished a long time ago, just waiting for the Winter Update to come out.

I don't use hub very much. I just click to compass and shoose the game that I'll play. But in old lobby, I was waiting when I click to compass. Now hub is not laggy, but I don't like to walk in hub by the way!

If you really like the old hub then type /server mapdev in chat once u get to the hub to see the old one.
