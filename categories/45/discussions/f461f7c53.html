Here is a small idea as to what the community believes about re implementing the prestige feature. <br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/WJnyySy.png" title="Image: http://i.imgur.com/WJnyySy.png"><br>So overall from this i believe the community would want this system re-adding as it gives a purpose for players to stay online, therefore raising the player count. It is something to work for in my opinion it would defiantly make me want to play more in order to rank up!<br>---<br>Here are the specific&nbsp;<b><u>updated results&nbsp;</u></b>with everyone's opinions aswell:<br><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mT5IPY8lnqZ8yIdMteyJN2RXslrqJaOY4IArvDnJ770/edit?usp=sharing" title="Link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mT5IPY8lnqZ8yIdMteyJN2RXslrqJaOY4IArvDnJ770/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mT5IPY8lnqZ8yIdMteyJN2RXslrqJaOY4IArvDnJ770/edit?usp=sharing</a>&nbsp;(live results)<br>Screenshot:&nbsp;<img src="blob:http://imgur.com/fc935037-977e-49ba-bb40-9bd2450c8d5a"><img src="blob:http://imgur.com/fc935037-977e-49ba-bb40-9bd2450c8d5a"><img src="http://blob:http//imgur.com/fc935037-977e-49ba-bb40-9bd2450c8d5a"><img src="blob:http://imgur.com/fc935037-977e-49ba-bb40-9bd2450c8d5a"><img src="blob:http://imgur.com/fc935037-977e-49ba-bb40-9bd2450c8d5a"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/SKvxvqh.png" title="Image: http://i.imgur.com/SKvxvqh.png">

Before credits, kills, wins, and objectives gave XP. Once level 50 was reached, you could do /prestige to get a badge

Yes, the same 1.5x, 2x, and 2.5x bonus applied to XP. Though it is a nice perk for premium users, I hated getting passed in the XP leaderboards by every diamond and emerald user (this was before I had temp gold).

I never understood what was so hard about having prestiges and credits at once, if making new prestiges was so hard (I dont remember it taking too long for 10 more to be added) just make it infinite or cap it off, easy as that

I think the official statement is that Keenan does not, is unwilling to and thus will not bring back prestiges, due to the fact that adding new badges and prestiges would take a considerable amount of time to implement.&nbsp;<br><br>Don't shoot me, I'm just the messenger!

just make a set amount of prestiges, use like a quartic or quintic curve to decide amount of experience so that they get expensive fast, and if anyone gets to last prestige, tell them to go outside for the love of god

This is a fantastic idea and would give Avicus players something to look forwards too seeing as some people who aren't usually the best players (or don't sweat) could potentially have a chance to be on the leaderboards. Not to mention the player count would probably explode.

In my opinion, I really hope they get added back. When I first got on Avicus I remember the leveling/prestige system and I didn't play Avicus with it for long (about a week or 2, then I left for like a year) it was good and really does bring in some competition and something 'to work towards to'.

An i idea for if the devs dont want to keep adding them is for it work like points? Like you need to be consistently good to enter a specific league / badge and if you die you lose points and if you get mon or kills u gain points, and when you enter the next league you get a better badge?

I loved the prestige feature. I feel like when it was still used that their were more people on. I know it definitely made me play a lot more because I wanted to level up so I could prestige. I personally think it was a great feature and it should be added back.

I'm not so sure about the seasons. At least not every 3 months. It can take a while to get even just one Prestige. I feel like it would push people away if they almost got to one then it reset. Sure, for the people that play a lot, and are really good, they could Prestige fairly quick, but 3 months is&nbsp;<b>maybe</b> enough to Prestige twice. I wouldn't mind it like every year(?) Or just add more as time goes on. It can't be that hard to find a little symbol and put it in a line of code. Or even just make the Prestige a number, keep badges, Credits, the shop, and everything else. If it's a number then it could be infinite (I assume) and there's no reason to reset it.
