This is it. After almost a year and 4 months of being Staff here on Avicus, my time is coming to an end.<br><br>My life in the past few months has gone too far downhill. My grades are currently ineligible for sports, I was diagnosed with depression, and I'm losing far too many friends and family.. To death; to even consider moving forward.&nbsp;<br><br>I just want to inform you all that I will be leaving the Avicus Staff team as a whole, not doing what Jozz did (demoting down to a lower rank). I'll be leaving the Event Committee, and I may not be active at all. I'll rarely hop in on the server and I may check in on how things are going on the forums, so keep in mind I'll still be with you all, but over time I can't guarantee I'll still be here. Also, all of the plans that were supposed to be upcoming (UHC, Tourney, etc) are still taking place. However, they will be led by the Event Committee and Peachy, the Senior Moderator I'm choosing as my successor.&nbsp;<br><br>I know this is unexpected, and I really didn't want to do this. Avicus, is my home. Each and every one of you in this Community and on the Staff team are like family to me. Like my older, younger, brothers and sisters. Avicus has given me to much, and has honestly provided me with some of the greatest moments in my life that I truly will never forget. There are a few people I'd like to thank down below.<br><br>Peachy-You've been with me since day 1. Ever since I met you in McZone, it's been you and I, the unstoppable duo. We applied together, got Junior Mod together (in the same TeamSpeak call) Got Moderator together, were later promoted to Senior Moderator together, and here we are today. I want to thank you, for being my best friend. Through thick and thin, it's been you, and..<br><br>Jozz-You, I can consider my best friend alongside Peachy. I haven't known you as long, but from everything we've been through together, I can't thank you enough for being here with me. I'll never forget the talks we used to have, and I hope we continue to have in the future. Keep in touch! &lt;3<br><br>Gill-Thank you for choosing me to be your successor. I realize this is sudden, but I guess it's my time to go as well. You did a great job, and I thank you for your contributions.<br><br>FightToWin7431-Just as your time came, it's my time now. You were there for me like my older brother, and I can't thank you enough for being the one supporting me since McZone. I'll never forget you, you're a legend.<br><br>Tel-I realize you just got promoted, and there was so much I was planning on doing with you in the future. However, you're yet another one of the people I've always respected as a person, and a Staff Member. Thank you for being here for me, and thanks for everything you've done. Good luck!<br><br>And thank you to&nbsp;<i><b>everyone</b></i>. The entire staff team, Community, and anyone I missed. I love you all, and I'm going to miss you. Through thick and thin, Avicus has been my home. Its taught me more than I every thought possible, and I'll never forget it.<br><br>I guess this is my formal, most informative way of saying;<br><br>Goodbye.<br><br>Regards, -Jake.

Jake, I regret that I never really ever got to know you well :'( Even still I'd like to thank you on behalf of wveryone, for what you've done for Avicus. It's heartbreaking to see someone else leave but especially when it's someone who has such big shoes to fill. I remember when I first became a jr. You really did help me become a little more comfortable in my position. And for that I'd also like to thank you. I guess all I can say now is good bye. Things can only get better. Work hard, and keep on going, you'll find your purpose soon. Don't let depression get in the way of your life. Good bye :, (
