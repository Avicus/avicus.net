I think it is a great defence but may just be overdone in some areas. This also takes quite a bit of time especially if you were in survival.

Well, on Deepwind Jungle other team usually captures a wool in 30 seconds or something. So this wool room will be defended by 2 or 3 defenders. You don't have to place crafting tables on the ground, it's not necessary, so doesn't take so much time.

Pressure plates on crafting tables isn't a good idea. Enemies can easily block-spam on them.

Umm, I though you mean that I should place buttons xd sorry. Placing signs takes so much time. I was between pleasure plate and button but pleasure plate is better tho. Although he block spams he can't get over the wall with block spamming.

It's too hard to get in to the wool room on ground. Double redstone wall, water trap, crafting table wall, that big hole with signs and fences, ladder and fences on the crafting table wall... 2hard4rushers

If you're going to cover the crafting tables with ladders you might as well use wood planks instead to conserve supplies.<br><br>Also if you put pressure plates on crafting tables it renders the crafting tables useless to you should leave the area of ground that you put pressure plates on as grass.

ugh.<br><br>-Double Redstone Wall (You don't even have enough for that)<br>-I don't think you'd even have enough resources to make this whole defence anyways.<br>-Putting slabs on the top of the wall is a bad idea because people waterdrop from skybridges.<br>-The weird floating slab / fence thingy is just useless because it blocks most of your view in the sky meaning that its harder to shoot skybridgers.<br>-Overdone so much (This would literally take the whole game to make)<br>-Most of the stuff there isn't even effective (e.g the trapdoors on the bedrock wall) just aesthetic

dear ryan<br><br>I think your ideas are good for new defenders starting out in pvp<br>But half of your walls are shit, shit, shit and shit.<br>Like seriously is that pit turd<br>Even if the defense looks nice it's still shit to pvp on<br>So please make more flat pits and less shit pits<br>For the sake of apollo defense, dont make shit&nbsp;<br>(Its an inside meme dont worry folks)<br><br><br>Op: the defense is extremely overdone and uses a lot of resources, takes shitton of time to build, niether even effective<br><br>Try doong defenses in less time that use less resources

Umm, there we go:<br>-We have enough redstone for that, please double check it.<br>-As the skybridge will be high just like the wall, they don't really need to water drop there. Or he can just jump into the wool room's roof.<br>-As I said before,&nbsp;<b>all of this defence isn't necessary, only building the wall and that hole is enough</b>.<br>-It doesn't block me, designed it exactly to get protected by enemy arrows. And you can easily shoot everywhere.<br>-As I said before,&nbsp;<b>all of this defence isn't necessary, only building the wall and that hole is enough</b>.<br>-Well they are affective. Some stuff is just aesthetic yeah but&nbsp;<b>MOST</b> of the defence is to slower rusher.<br>-I was on gm1, its overdone you are right about it. But building the wall and even making half of the hole is enough.<br><br><br>These are not helpful ideas to improve my defence.
