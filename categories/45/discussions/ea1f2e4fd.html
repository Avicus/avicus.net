Which mod do you think is the best? I personally think refusetostink is a very good moderator first of all she is very good at stoping when people are being annoying in chat, she is very active to and nice. But other than that I am not familiar with many other mods so I am leaving this debate mostly to you guys.<br><br>remember backup your opinions with facts and be respectful of others opinions!

Why would this be a debatable topic. All mods are chosen for a reason due to the qualities and work ethic they have. There is no one objectively superior mod this is all subjective opinion and I feel this topic will just erupt into a flame war.

Not trying to be rude, but I think posts like these are made for popularity reasons. On topic, I like all staff equally and don't have a favourite. All the staff are great to me.

There have been many threads like these in the past, I don't see the point in having another one.

This thread is pointless considering that there are multiple of them. Search for the others before creating a new thread.

As aforementioned by many others, there are other threads for this. Also, this may cause flame wars.&nbsp;<br><br>Locking thread.
