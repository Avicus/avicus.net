It's ok. Yeah but the truth is I only used Anti-Knockback. I wasn't a person who'd like to destroy people's KDR. I wasn't really involved in server discussions. Also a warning would have been nice.&nbsp;<br><br><br>

Actually, that sounds like a really bad idea. All appeals should be directed through the support email system. I don't know if that's been permitted in the past, but I can't imagine that the Managers/Directors are interested in getting appeal messages over Skype. That seems like a way "around the system," if you will. If some people have to wait for a reply from the support team, then everyone should. It's not fair for some people to get an instantaneous reply over Skype whilst others have to wait a day or two, maybe more, maybe less, to receive an email back.&nbsp;

Dear Nolan.<br><br>I'm not sure if you've read this whole thread but throughout this thread I've already previously stated that I've sent another appeal how my old email address had been hacked into, hence that is why I made a new Email and sent yet another appeal to inform them about my Email being changed.

3 things xD
<br>&nbsp;<br>1. Anti-Knockback will destroy someones KDR, if someone is on a high place and gets shot with an arrow you will not fall therefore making someone lose a kill<br>&nbsp;<br>2.

It's just Anti-Knock my clicking speed is terrible. So there wouldn't be much in me using it in the first place.<br><br>Edit: And because of that I've been gone a very long 6 months.
