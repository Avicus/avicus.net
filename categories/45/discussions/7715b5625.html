If the letter formating for this post looks "chopped". Then please blame mobile version.<br><br>Now, things have been pretty fun (mostly) and i will be back by today. But i just want to tell you guys what happened...<br><br>#1:I almost drowned. Yes, i almost drowned because I wasnt careful to know the markings of the depth of water. I ddnt pay attention and i went too far. I almost drowned and if it werent for me using a nearby person as a hhandlebar i wouldve surely suffocated.<br><br>My lungs burned and i cursed the person out for trying to leave me to die. They were VERY good swimmers and were selfish.&nbsp;<br><br>#2: I hate planes and rollercoasters. Used to like rollercoasters and ive always feared planes. But now? The whiplash from both vehicles really scare me and traumatized me.<br><br>Plus, the day before the drowning incident really humbled me and warned me to not have too much fun. Ugh, this is gonna make me fear crossing a bridge over water for the rest of my life...<br><br>So, besides all this i grew excited to speak to all of you. Its 2:51AM here and i cannot sleep. The events from previous days way heavy on my mind and i wish for some good ol' company of my fellow Avicadians. You guys willing to do an AMA with me to keep me from pummeling any Floridans who walk TOO slow. (Just joking... well the pummeling part. XD)<br><br>Seriously, Im a New Yorker and people here walk as if they got nowhere to be... -__-''

</div>
Once upon a time, in November 2013... I asked Funky (Kylo's IGN at the time) if i could make maps for the server...<br><br>He said "Of course :)" and so i got to it. My first map was utter crap XD "Dreadnought Wars" is what it was called. Emphasized heavy TNT gameplay and firecharge machinegun cannon warfare.<br><br>I will remake the map soon with the same concepts and see how it plays.
