I get it, your curious, you just want to know more so you don't get into trouble in the future. But don't ask this the moment you hear my voice...<b><u></u></b><br><b><b>"Are you a girl"?</b></b><br><br>No, I am not a girl. From my head to my toes I am completely&nbsp;<u>Male</u>. Now sure, it's the first time you've ever talked to me and it was just a misunderstanding. But that does not mean you have to be so ignorant about entitling me as a "she" every time you try to get my attention or mention me in a sentence. "<u>SHE</u> was doing this", "Me and <u>HER</u>", <u></u>"<u>SHE</u> beat me in a fight". <b><b>SHE, SHE, SHE, SHE, </b></b>that's all I ever hear these days.You need to show the same respect you do towards someone who is clearly a guy. Yes, my mic is not top quality, yes I haven't hit puberty. But all these things need to be taken into hand before you title me as a girl.<br><b></b><br>I am not gay. I saying that right now, ok. I try to be all nice and friendly but it's hard when someone is talking and questioning almost every time I log onto to team speak if I am gay or transgender... just because of what.. My voice? The fact that I dance? Yes, I do dance. And I'm proud of it OK. I've been dancing for years and it's enough that I have to go through school without getting a question every day about my gender, or sex. I've had kids that will get all pissy at me because they think I only dance for the girls. Even though women are the most popular sex in dance, doesn't mean I'm only doing for them. <br><br>So I'm ending it here, if you ever talk to me on team speak, think of this whenever you talk to me. And think to yourself, how would I be feeling if someone treated me like this.<br><br>Thank you, rant finished.

1000 credits says it won't.<br><br>Well, personally I feel it shouldn't as this is high key important to him, and shouldn't just be locked away. Telling everyone that he's a guy should probably stay on the fourms. It's not a "Personal Update", it's adressing a problem happening in the community.

<div>Josh,I have personally suffered this. I know its hard, but it'll eventually change. Earlier this year, my voice was completely like yours, And I got called a girl too. You'll just wake up a morning and feel your voice has changed.</div><div><br></div><div>Now, this 'little' message is for everyone who says these things. If you are not aware, Acceqted is the kindest person you'll ever find on this block game. Now, he is also one of my best friends inside Avicus, and I feel he's like a little brother to me, and I can asure you you will never find him disrespectful to anyone. Hence, please treat him with respect, and therefore, don't mock him about what he does and his voice. I would like everyone who disrespects him to be in his position, So that way you could learn how hard it actually is and grow some respect.</div><div><br></div><div>@Josh: Dont let this get to you too much, it'll be fine, dont worry.</div><div><br></div><div>ily &lt;3</div><div><br></div><div><br></div>

<i>It's okay acceqted, I had a high pitched voice too, but once you get older, you can have a sect deep voice like mine xD</i><br>Yes, so sexy ;)<br><br><b>OP-&nbsp;</b>Don't let that bring you down, we all had high voices at one point, and older people thought it was weird, but you are who you are. I tell this to people a lot, I saw this Google once when I was looking for something to send to a friend.<br>"<i>If you were never weird, smart, a nerd, a bully, crazy, loud, quiet, outgoing, introverted, or yourself, then you would be a very boring person</i>."<br>I personally don't struggle with caring what others think of me, sometimes I wish I did, for the sake of being able to help people that do. But one thing I can promise you, is that everything you do make you who you are, and no matter what other people say, you're awesome in your own way. Everyone is, that's why I changed my name to Acceptancq. I may dislike some people, not really care what happens with them sometimes, but everyone has good in them, even when they seem mean, rude, like a terrible person. Just take that into consideration before you get mad at someone.&nbsp;<br><br>~Acceptancq

I can understand why you felt you had to post this. Be patient. Just as Sayah said, one day you'll wake up and your voice will be completely different. All you have to do is wait. If you need someone to talk to, you can always talk to me about it. I try not to judge. =)

Oh, I don't remember that I told you 'she' but anyways, If I did Sorry. &nbsp;But that doesn't change the respect and love. Ily &lt;3 They might call you 'girl', but that means nothing if there were people who like and respect you! Never give up dancing. When I was 1st grade, I was dancing too (ballet). Boys also can dance!
