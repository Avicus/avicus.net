<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Howdy,</span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">The top three records out of group B were</span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Labradoodles 4-0-1 (4th win assumed because Labradoodles wasn't allowed to play HOME but HOME went win-less otherwise)</span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Cennet 4-1-0</span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Team Allah 3-1-1</span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">After the match a member of Labradoodles was told in chat not to log off by Tazz. The player was not frozen. Tazz then moved our player into the screensharing room and was having him download join.me. Tazz at this point said "Ok thanks bye" and our player logged off minecraft. Here's the issue. Our player was being screenshared for an autoclicker and was told he was. Tazz also said "Ok thanks bye" to make it seem like the screensharing was over. Autoclickers can be deleted without closing minecraft so the fact that he closed minecraft is inconsequential to our DQ.&nbsp;</span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">However Tazz justified it anyways claiming that the autoclicker detector had registered him at 31 cps (surprisingly not regularly considering it was an "autoclicker"). Tazz then demanded that our player prove that he could click at 31 cps. When our player only managed 15 cps Tazz took this as him autoclicking. However, as confirmed by ALM former developer the clicks a player has can be packeted due to lag and therefore register as much higher than they actually are and without other proof or a ridiculously high cps on a lagless suspect it does not qualify as evidence.&nbsp;</span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">When this was brought to their attention, conveniently the officials many of whom are on Team Allah (including Tazz) decided that it was illegal for us to have players who were sharing accounts. We however had asked the refs and officials earlier if we were allowed to do this and were given this response.&nbsp;</span><a href="https://cdn.pbrd.co/images/5tBab5ZhA.png" title="Link: https://cdn.pbrd.co/images/5tBab5ZhA.png" style="color: rgb(3, 141, 210); text-decoration: none; font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">https://cdn.pbrd.co/images/5tBab5ZhA.png</a><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;The Officials are just allowing Team Allah through due to bias. If you want to win the tourney try winning group stages Allah.</span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Note: Some officials, refs and other various staff members have been useful and fair in this process I appreciate these ones and would like to commend them on their efforts to maintain a sense of fairness in these tournaments.</span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><a href="https://gyazo.com/dcc2a4bc97513e2488bee6a0da6ee6b4" title="Link: https://gyazo.com/dcc2a4bc97513e2488bee6a0da6ee6b4" style="color: rgb(3, 141, 210); text-decoration: none; font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">https://gyazo.com/dcc2a4bc97513e2488bee6a0da6ee6b4</a><br><i><b><u>Note: this explains why labradoodles isn't in the tourney anymore not why Allah is making it different from my last post.</u></b></i>

All I'm saying is that all these "rules" seem to be nothing but excuses to crack down on the free exchange of ideas and knowledge in the information marketplace of the forums. What possible reason could this be for than to suppress or even conceal knowledge and discussion?

TS rules are cracked down too, to prevent people from actually talking freely. Luckily noone on TS actually cares or enforces those rules though.
