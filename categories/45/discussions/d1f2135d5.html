ok, well you see there a bunch of other people did find it funny and you know technically this was a video you kinda need to see because it show how fun a game like "minecraft" could be. my screaming, horse sounds, pvp fights they were all funny but clearly you can't see that. <br><br>maybe the title is "clickbait" but it was funny and there was nothing wrong with the video you see me doing an epic mlg water bucket m8. if you cringed that's your problem bro
