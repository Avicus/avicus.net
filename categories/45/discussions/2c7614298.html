I see you as a friend, although competitiveness kind of separates us from being close.

You're good at melee and wank at bow hahhahahhaa.<br><br>Throughout Tourney 1 you were probably the best player. When you were banned though it was controversial, and with sketchy clips of you in T1 I kinda lost some respect for you.

In the league the best player was maybe Eric, I didn't care too much about other teams and Eric seemed to do a great job for Apollo. T3's best player has to be Budah or Seuth or Zeus, at least from my eyes being in Apollo, they were very consistent and carried in kills.<br><br>Right now the best 5 players are probably Budah, You, Raging, Eric and Seuth (Bias to Apollo I know)

I didn't know you before Apollo but I had a hard time killing you in 1v1s. You were good at PvP before joining Apollo and during your time you have drastically improved. I can definitely call you one of our best at melee. We haven't spoken much personally though since you mute alot, but you are really chill.<br><br>DTM - Rendezvous 3.5<br>CTW - Rendezvous New CTW<br>TDM - Supply

Good admin who listens. I think you could improve Cronus if you started to work on chemistry and not just getting any OCN player that comes along. If you learn how to properly lead it could be a better team.<br><br>you suck xd

You are one of my best friends here and have been for a while, although we didn't speak while you was on BC. You've started to move away from this game more and our chats have been more personal. You are a great leader and player and a proper friend, not just a gamer one.

You are really good at melee and the reason I picked you up is because I feel that what happened to Seuth will happen to you, that you will go from being good at melee to a god and then turn you into a good player in the team. Your music is good and you are really chill and a nice guy to talk to.<br><br>I used to like Lego and my irl name is Ché

Good player at all round, you just need to improve communication and stop trying to take leadership in scrims. I am so happy I decided to trial you. You are a nice guy to talk to but can be toxic, we haven't spoken in a while really aswell ;c<br><br>We could do, but it would mean kicking my friends from the team, fuck that.<br><br>I am really unsure.
