So, unfortunately my nan aged 78 died of lung cancer yesterday. She was the most sweetest person I've ever met, I wish I got to say a few last words to her, but I couldn't. If you have any relatives who have died recently, you must know how I feel. Bye everyone, and have a safe day.<br><br><span>-<b>Harry.</b></span>
