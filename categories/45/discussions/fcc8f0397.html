An experience I had that dates back a few years where I was scuba diving and at the beginning of the dive we had beginner training and I had a mask obviously I had to wear. After using it I realized it kept leaking with water but I told the instructors it was doing as described and they said it'll be okay. So, we headed out for the sea to do the actual scuba diving and after we made it to our destination at sea we put our gear on and jumped out. After about 10 minutes I was about 50 feet underwater with the rest of the group exploring the coral reef and hidden sea life. Well, to make it all turn upside down my mask started filling with water under the sea and I unknowningly was shocked and I couldn't see and my first instinct was to swim right up to the air but that was pretty difficult with the amount of weight on my back but it was completed and I had to sit the rest of the scuba dive out. So now this is definitely my ultimate fear and that is drowning!<br><br>Thanks for reading,<br>John

To be hones, just talking wih someone I met or being alone, I just don't have that social skill of being able to interact with someone if I do't have something in common.

I am a basically grown man at 16 (almost 17) and I cannot stand shots, haha. Flu-mist is definitely the more preferable way to go! Also, be sure to receive a single-dose vial and not a multi-dose vial due to the single dose contains no mercury. Be sure to call your doctor or where you are getting your flu shots first if you do go to the shot route.

Ok, So I was walking to the woods with only my dog. It was very late to be out (11 PM) and just wanted to check it out. I walked in kinda scared but remained walking, but it felt like something was watching me. I looked around, nothing... I walked a little deeper, and got over being scared (a little :P) Then, VERY quickly, My dog yanks the leash and begins barking at something in the trees, I just thought It was a animal so thought nothing of it and quieted my dog. Thats when I began to want to leave, but for some strange reason,maybe I was to scared or something, I couldnt figure the way out(I know the woods by heart) I started to run to what seemed to be the right path,It was, but then my dog really wanted to get over next to a tree and bark at something, But I tugged her away. I was close to the entrance when I looked back... I dont know what it was, maybe a alien or a ghost, But I seen something to appear as a short human just standing there. I forgot to tell you guys this but my woods is right next to a cementary..&nbsp; :'( I ran the heck out of the woods to find my self right in the Cementary, It appeared to be another figure, but i ignored it .-. I still dont know what that was that day, and heres a tip kids... Never go into the woods next to a cementary at 11 pm.<br><br>Sorry if its a bit long, Im trying to get my storys better written.<br>-Ebirdy

I'm afraid of two things. <br><br>First, I'm absolutely terrified of getting hit by a car. I have no idea why, but just the idea of it... hurts.<br><br>Second, I'm afraid of not being socially accepted, particularly over online services.. This is probably the main reason why I don't do TeamSpeak that often, because I'm really awkward, and I don't thrive in large groups <i>at all.</i>

Drowning is very calming and peaceful, if I was to die anyway, I'd choose drowning. c:

Having water dramatically pour into your lungs and suffocate you painfully isn't a calming death.

People who have drowned and then have been brought back to life say that it was a very relaxing experience. The first few seconds are obviously not going to be the best though.

I would say the best way to die is due to the gas 'carbon monoxide'. You die without knowing it, you start like going into sleep because you haven't oxygen, and then die because of lack of oxygen. :) <br>Or maybe the lethal vaccine. :/
