For some reason they haven't changed it back yet the fuckin credits are useless, I mean like keep the credits and badges if you want, but make prestiges appear where the tournament badge would be and instead of a badge the tourney winners could get a tag, hope this happens but probably won't :(

They're this really old system where you would get xp from kills and then when you had enough xp you leveled up. Once you hit enough levels you prestiged and got a badge. The cycle continued until you hit the max amount of prestiges. It gave people a reason to play.

To be honest I'm not entirely sure. There has never been a proper reason for the removal other than the owner not liking it because it required more and more prestiges to be added and added.

All I know I say that it was a pain for devs to constantly make new prestiges for people. But no way that we have 2 new devs, things could be easier...?

The reason I've heard for it being removed was that they couldn't keep updating it. I suggested instead of getting a badge for Presiges, you just get a number. ex: "MOD LiloOe [1] (badge): hi". I presonally love the idea of bringing Prestiges back, because as of right now I feel no real reason to play. It's fun to play, but there is no goal what-so-ever. I also think that this would open the door for many new games, and bringing back old games, such as Walls, Skywars, and adding this to Nexus.

If it's so difficult to add new prestiges, it doesn't take a genius to work out that the best thing needed is to just reset them?
