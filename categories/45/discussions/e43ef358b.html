I was wondering what staff is planning to stop the decreasing player rate.&nbsp;<br><br><br>Tbh I don't think skywars was a good idea because a lot of servers already have it like hypixel, mineplex and many other small servers. All skywars is doing is maybe keeping the people that were going to quit avicus for a little longer. I'm assuming there's more to this plan so my question is&nbsp;<br><br>What is staff doing /going to do?<br><br><br><br>Ok since we proved the community doesn't like/agree with some things that staff is doing, let's turn this into a suggestion thread &nbsp;:)

Looking at the sneak peaks from the Twitter page you can expect an update November 6th, this Saturday; it looks to be the implantation of CaptureTheFlag and KingOfTheKill. <br>After that I suppose the Devs will work on the tourney plugin or ranked, preferably the plugin first. <br>That'll be the biggest attraction.<br>The last chance.

Walls is coming back. That should bring at least a few players back.

Walls was starting to become popular again on Avicus before Atlas. And if you're so intent on getting new games on Avicus then give some ideas instead of complaining that we have none. Walls started Avicus, and Keenan isn't about to let it go away. I get it if you don't like the gamemode, but adding gamemodes that some people left because they were removed, is a good way to not only get players back, but get new players that like those gamemodes as well. Knockback and hit detection was a big reason a lot of people left, and both of those have gotten much, much better in Atlas. People aren't going to realize that unless they have a reason to come back and try. Instead of complaining, help out. Since your ban you've been very toxic, and I understand why, you're mad about your ban, it makes sense, but please, if you're going to stick around, at least try to be non-toxic before you get yourself forum banned as well. (None of this was personal, but you have been pretty toxic lately.)<br><br><b>Edit:</b> To add what to Snow said, Walls was released on Avicus publicly before it was on Hypixel, so your point is invalid. Along with the fact that the way Hypixel Walls is set-up, is stupid. If you're new to Hypixel you have no chance what so ever of winning a game. It's set-up so that the longer you've played the better stuff you start out with. The only people that play Walls on Hypixel is the people that have been playing for years and years, the people that have all the OP kits, and upgrades. Because without them, you can't win. You walk into a game and get 3-5 shot by nearly everyone when you have full iron.&nbsp;<br><br>On Avicus, Walls needs a new kit system, something new and improved, similer to prestiges, but using Credits. Along side that it needs more maps, better/improved kits, and the MapDevs need to listen to the people that play Walls, and not just what they see. I know the MapDevs think about every aspect of gameplay, and ascetics, but sometimes the way a map is played might look good from a spectator's perspective but not at all from a player's perspective. A good example of this is the map Swampland Terrors. Nothing against the map, it looks and plays well, but the map is made for shorter, more action packed gameplay, and the way it plays is the opposite. It can easily be a long, drawn out map, that can take an hour plus to play, just because of a couple problems with it. <br><br>Note the MapDevs: I'm not a great builder but I'm willing to help with Walls maps, and kits if it's needed, nearly 4 years of learning &amp; playing Walls would be helpful. ;p

That's a bit inaccurate. Walls, back in 2012/13, was one of the reason we were so big. I don't know when you joined this server but it was one or the biggest servers out there in 2013. Updating Walls was never an issue.

That's a bit inaccurate. Walls, back in 2012/13, was one of the reason we were so big. I don't know when you joined this server but it was one or the biggest servers out there in 2013. Updating Walls was never an issue.

Things change. People move on, new gamemodes &nbsp;produced by other servers attracted people, and to be frank Minecraft isn't what it use to be. A lot of people don't play it anymore. You can't expect people to stay in one place without checking everything else out.

What's the point of adding skywars? Why would anybody choose to play a subpar server for skywars such as avicus when they can just go to hypixel and overall experience a better time playing the gamemode? Avicus had 1 successful and good quality gamemode in DTM, idk why you're trying to add new gamemodes to the server at all. If I was a new player I would choose to play hypixel or mineplex over avicus because they have a better quality standard (coming from a larger playerbase) and the social aspect of the gamemode is a lot better on those 2 larger servers too. As I see it, you have 0 reasons to add any new updates, it just harms the 1 successful gamemode you have if anything. Make something more unique if anything as opposed to randomly adding shit like skywars into the server.

&nbsp;Avi's casual gamemodes/gameplay/maps will never be as good as ocn's therefore they won't get any new players from adding stuff that ocn already has. And seeing that they have no active devs they won't get any unique gamemodes. So IMO Avicus should just focus on competitive and try to "steal" the competitive players from ocn/badlion. Its already got the gamemodes plus its on 1.8. All they really need to do to have a decent tournament is get a decent prizepool like $250-500, good tournament format, and great ocn level competitive maps.

Well that was helpful, even to me. As far as I knew advertisement was coming soon, like everyone has said. I also agree with everything you said in there, the only thing I would add is the gap between Seniors and Mods. I don't know how much the Senior Mods know, and it should be more than the Mods know, but I know at least for the short time being Mod, I know the same amount I would know if I only looked at the forums. It's hard to answer questions when I know as much as everyone else. It would be good to know at least something about updates and things coming, other than that they are coming sometime soon.<br><br><b>Edit:&nbsp;<i><u>#Seth4Admin</u></i></b>

i'll be honest here, avicus has a lot of potential, but if the admins want avicus to remain alive, they may as well admit that they have no money and sell it to someone that can bring it back up.<br><br>a 20-30+ playerbase server itself is worth well over $2k in todays market. however, since avicus has a lot of custom things (forums, plugins, maps, etc.), I would estimate avicus to be worth around $5k-$7k

"What improvements would you guys like to see?"<br><br>Think back. Think back to 2013-2014.<br><br>What kept players hooked, what kept them playing and wanting more? Honestly, my memory is really bad so while I can't really remember much of old Avicus, surely SOMEONE will, and those that do, what was different about Avicus back then compared to now that made it actually huge?

<br>Yes, people would want to buy avicus, mainly for the playerbase. even a small playerbase like this is worth quite a lot.<br><br>Unlike Avicus, OCN had a consistent playerbase of 150+ players everyday, avicus on the other hand loses players monthly....<br><br>How do you know Overcast could barely sell?

I think the "overpowered" maps and prestiges (go away ill shill prestige/xp system as much as I want) made Avicus feel like a more "Arcade-Like" experience, and not a super serious server.<br><br>I honestly think the arcade like feel better suited Avicus, rather than this weird kinda mainstream server it is now, as players wouldnt have to really care about putting a lot of time into it to become really good and rather could play a little and have a good time because of the OP maps that used to exist (Rapture v2 anyone?)

Alrighty, <i>cracks knuckles&nbsp;<br><br></i>Firstly I don't know if people actually realise this but stuff is being done. Stuff gets done everyday, we're admins for a reason and we have a role for a reason.... Although some of you might not see some of what happens around here a lot gets done on a day to day basis. This goes for staff members as well. Please do not presume that nothing is being done, the senior staff are useless and the owner doesn't care because remember you don't see what we do. There is always, and I mean always, stuff happening.<br><i><br></i>In regards with skywars. We know full well that right now our skywars won't attract players. The point of releasing this was to show people a little glimps of what is to come. This isn't the entire gamemode, there will be heaps more variations of it to come. And you can check twitter for those sneak peaks :P<br><br>In regards with Advertising. I don't know how many times I have to say this. There are still things we need to fix and as a result we can't go out advertising or people won't stay. We're working on fixing these issues. And like I already said in the last community update we did do some advertising but we aren't going to do anymore until we have fixed some of these problems.<br><br>You might not think anyone is interested in this network but you'd be suprised. Servers a lot bigger than we are, some of them most of you might have even played on, have been interested in us in the past and we can easily use this to our advantage if things didn't work out.<br><br>If people want to help out rather than just rant about stuff they don't know much about or just pressume stuff and make asumptions then we might actually be getting somewhere. Also, remember that at the end of the day the survival of this server comes down to the owner and the developers. There are stuff Senior Staff can do but unfortunately it's not as though we can click our fingers and get things fixed in a second. There is still time to fix this place but we all have to work together. In the next community update I'll be addressing this a bit better.<br><br>My points:<br>- Please don't make assumptions about whose doing and who isn't doing stuff. You guys don't see what we do.&nbsp;<br>- We stopped advertising because of a few big issues. Until we can fix them there is no point advertising as we can't keep players and they'll just leave.<br>- Have faith please. We've been in this cycle for like almost 2 years now and it has been a lot worse than what it currently is. There is still time

What's the point of adding skywars? Why would anybody choose to play a subpar server for skywars such as avicus when they can just go to hypixel and overall experience a better time playing the gamemode? Avicus had 1 successful and good quality gamemode in DTM, idk why you're trying to add new gamemodes to the server at all. If I was a new player I would choose to play hypixel or mineplex over avicus because they have a better quality standard (coming from a larger playerbase) and the social aspect of the gamemode is a lot better on those 2 larger servers too. As I see it, you have 0 reasons to add any new updates, it just harms the 1 successful gamemode you have if anything. Make something more unique if anything as opposed to randomly adding shit like skywars into the server.
</blockquote>
</div>
As I said above. The point of adding this version is to show our current members what's going to be happening. We know full well there is no point to having just one version of skywars that other servers can do better. We have other stuff planned ,which will come out very soon. that will make the sS,ywars more unique and give it an Avicus touch/feeling.

Walls was starting to become popular again on Avicus before Atlas. And if you're so intent on getting new games on Avicus then give some ideas instead of complaining that we have none. Walls started Avicus, and Keenan isn't about to let it go away. I get it if you don't like the gamemode, but adding gamemodes that some people left because they were removed, is a good way to not only get players back, but get new players that like those gamemodes as well. Knockback and hit detection was a big reason a lot of people left, and both of those have gotten much, much better in Atlas. People aren't going to realize that unless they have a reason to come back and try. Instead of complaining, help out. Since your ban you've been very toxic, and I understand why, you're mad about your ban, it makes sense, but please, if you're going to stick around, at least try to be non-toxic before you get yourself forum banned as well. (None of this was personal, but you have been pretty toxic lately.)<br><br><b>Edit:</b> To add what to Snow said, Walls was released on Avicus publicly before it was on Hypixel, so your point is invalid. Along with the fact that the way Hypixel Walls is set-up, is stupid. If you're new to Hypixel you have no chance what so ever of winning a game. It's set-up so that the longer you've played the better stuff you start out with. The only people that play Walls on Hypixel is the people that have been playing for years and years, the people that have all the OP kits, and upgrades. Because without them, you can't win. You walk into a game and get 3-5 shot by nearly everyone when you have full iron.&nbsp;<br><br>On Avicus, Walls needs a new kit system, something new and improved, similer to prestiges, but using Credits. Along side that it needs more maps, better/improved kits, and the MapDevs need to listen to the people that play Walls, and not just what they see. I know the MapDevs think about every aspect of gameplay, and ascetics, but sometimes the way a map is played might look good from a spectator's perspective but not at all from a player's perspective. A good example of this is the map Swampland Terrors. Nothing against the map, it looks and plays well, but the map is made for shorter, more action packed gameplay, and the way it plays is the opposite. It can easily be a long, drawn out map, that can take an hour plus to play, just because of a couple problems with it. <br><br>Note the MapDevs: I'm not a great builder but I'm willing to help with Walls maps, and kits if it's needed, nearly 4 years of learning &amp; playing Walls would be helpful. ;p
</blockquote>
</div>
Preach! Walls was the gamemode that made Avicus popular. Adding back it and Nexus will definitely bring back some players and encourage inactive players to start playing again.<br><br>Adding more gamemodes whilst these are missing when they are already vastly more popular on bigger servers is pointless.

It is very sad, when something is falling apart.<br>I think, the last Avicus main mistake was an unfinished update.

Again.<br>You had to postpone the update for another 3 months, when most of promissed stuff would be finished, and implement it all together.

I think it's about time for Avicus to look into selling/merging with another network, Avicus is worth at least a bit considering the complexity of the plugins/website and the small community still here. I think a merge with another network could bring new players in and would provide some fresh leadership, nothing against the admins, as I'm unfamiliar with the present state of the staff team. 

Overall though I think Minecraft just isn't as popular anymore, MC Zone used to have 1500+ plus while OCN had more than that, now Avicus has 20 and OCN has 150.

I never said it was their fault, however a clear example is Quintus.<br><br>The Map Dev team all hate it. They tried to remake it numerous times but it still was a Kill Farm with horrific gameplay.

I'm not against the idea of Avicus merging or selling to another server, but I would like whoever buys it to know the past of the server. To know the community at least a little bit, and learn about the server before anything happens.

It is not the flaw, when we don't accept something.<br>If Avicus replaced old by new immediately, not after months, community would accept that.<br>And if not, why devs, knowing that, still push those "very unpopular innovations"?

Alrighty, <i>cracks knuckles&nbsp;<br><br></i>Firstly I don't know if people actually realise this but stuff is being done. Stuff gets done everyday, we're admins for a reason and we have a role for a reason.... Although some of you might not see some of what happens around here a lot gets done on a day to day basis. This goes for staff members as well. Please do not presume that nothing is being done, the senior staff are useless and the owner doesn't care because remember you don't see what we do. There is always, and I mean always, stuff happening.<br><i><br></i>In regards with skywars. We know full well that right now our skywars won't attract players. The point of releasing this was to show people a little glimps of what is to come. This isn't the entire gamemode, there will be heaps more variations of it to come. And you can check twitter for those sneak peaks :P<br><br>In regards with Advertising. I don't know how many times I have to say this. There are still things we need to fix and as a result we can't go out advertising or people won't stay. We're working on fixing these issues. And like I already said in the last community update we did do some advertising but we aren't going to do anymore until we have fixed some of these problems.<br><br>You might not think anyone is interested in this network but you'd be suprised. Servers a lot bigger than we are, some of them most of you might have even played on, have been interested in us in the past and we can easily use this to our advantage if things didn't work out.<br><br>If people want to help out rather than just rant about stuff they don't know much about or just pressume stuff and make asumptions then we might actually be getting somewhere. Also, remember that at the end of the day the survival of this server comes down to the owner and the developers. There are stuff Senior Staff can do but unfortunately it's not as though we can click our fingers and get things fixed in a second. There is still time to fix this place but we all have to work together. In the next community update I'll be addressing this a bit better.<br><br>My points:<br>- Please don't make assumptions about whose doing and who isn't doing stuff. You guys don't see what we do.&nbsp;<br>- We stopped advertising because of a few big issues. Until we can fix them there is no point advertising as we can't keep players and they'll just leave.<br>- Have faith please. We've been in this cycle for like almost 2 years now and it has been a lot worse than what it currently is. There is still time

True. Well my other suggestion was to add a mini-server that had maps for 8-16 players. When one match is full on Avicus (mostly Destroy1 or Competitive) the remaining observers/spectators could join this server. I see players everyday trying to move these "overflowing" players from a full match to a another server, but the maps are too big to make the matches funny to play on or even start.
