<u></u>Ok, I want to know what is going on. So a bunch of people and I have made maps and they have gotten no notice as far as I can tell. Furthermore, there was even a thread similar to this in Ask the Seniors and that hasn't gotten a response. I get that the Map Devs are busy with Atlas stuff but can you not take 5 minutes to give us your input on our maps?<br><br>-Thank You for your time&nbsp;<br>DipperPines_12

Back when i was mapdev if people said shit like this we would delay reviewing the map even more. I get that you're frustrated but insulting them won't help.

Hi DipperPines_12! <br>I really enjoy taking a look at your maps! <br>They are really astounding! <br>It must have taken quite some time to get those out of your head and putting them in minecraft. <br>I couldn't do that! <br>You are really great! <br>I actually think you should be a MapDev (I think I already told you this) <br>But anyways, stay strong, and hang in there! <br>Someone will take notice of you soon! (I REALLY hope!) <br>Keep up the good work! <br>Oh, and see you in game!
