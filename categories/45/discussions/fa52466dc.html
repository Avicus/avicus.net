Before I even say anything, if you want to stay in touch you can add my snapchat or skype, which are both smitdalt.<br><br>The last Minecraft Video (Go to 7:00 if you wanna cry):&nbsp;<a href="http://youtu.be/e7ga3_4lXho" title="Link: http://youtu.be/e7ga3_4lXho">http://youtu.be/e7ga3_4lXho</a><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; As you guys know, I am leaving Minecraft completely, but I never gave a real reason for it. I obviously knew that once school started I would be less active, but school isn't really the main reason I left. I was starting to get bored of the game, and a friend of mine became really toxic for basically no reason. Also, the PvP community and the minecraft community in general is disgusting to me. Just look in some of the YouTube comments for big HCF youtubers over a block game?? These are still people you're talking to, even if they are just represented by little block figures in a video game. People need to learn to respect each other on the internet.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I also wanted to start focusing more on producing trap music and programming my own video games as opposed to just sitting around and left clicking all day. And of course, there's obviously school. I am taking 3 AP classes this year, I have no lunch, and I am taking an online course. This probably won't even be too hard to handle, but since I've quit Minecraft, I have already found it easier to just focus on my schoolwork, then I have time go out and have a good time with friends and my girlfriend instead of wanting to play this game.&nbsp;<br><br>Although playing this game quite obsessively over the last 2 years was a pretty big waste of time, I have made some really great friends that I would like to talk about and thank.<br><br>Case/Ques/quesadillas: I don't even think I have to say anything about you bud, you know I love you ;) we will still snapchat obviously.<br><br>Refuse/Annamarie: My first avicus snapchat buddy (I think) She's a really cool girl and I hope #RASE works out :))<br><br>Phyre/Max: We are obviously still really good friends, as we are producing music together now!! But really, max is a super cool dude, especially when not raging at kids on minecraft LOL &lt;33<br><br>Hete/Heat: Really cool and nice dude, fun to play with. Keep talking to me on skype &lt;3<br><br>Dynamo: Although we are not friends anymore, you really got me into HCF and you were really fun to play with and talk to when we were close :/ How you're acting right now towards your friends is pretty disappointing.<br><br>DoctaDANK: Super funny dude, probably the first person that made me feel at home two years ago when I joined the avicus teamspeak.<br><br>Venemous/VennyMouse: Venemous is a really good team leader. He's also super nice and fun to talk to.<br><br>ducksfanwaterloo: CoC god best war attacker 2k15 Also a funny guy who likes nans.<br><br>Jiphylube/spizy: We talked for a while but havent really talked in a while. You're a chill dude :^)
