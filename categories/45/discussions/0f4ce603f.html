Hey guys,<br><br>I am a 13 year old kid and am asking you to say whether I can learn the Periodic table of elements before next year. This is 2 years ahead of our scholastic schedule and I would be ahead of the class in this area. So I am asking now: Is it beneficial to learn the Periodic Table or just a waste of my time? and If so, do you believe I can do it?

Or just have a copy of the table.

When I was 13, I learnt the first 20.<br>It's definitely beneficial. I say go for it but don't overwhelm yourself, learn the first 5 then 10 and so on, making sure you know them well.

The fact you made this post makes me already question your intelligence, also if you are in Britain it is pointless as in the GCSE chemistry or core/additional science exams you are given the periodic table anyway. Put your efforts to something else.

Combining what Snow and BmB said, it is pointless learning the whole table as you are given one most of the time (if not all the time), however I believe it is still beneficial to learn the first 20/25 as in lower levels of chemistry and science you are generally only asked about these elements and being able to recall the can be handy.

I don't know what you mean. Only the names or other characteristics of the elements too? If you mean all within 4 months,&nbsp;then good luck. LOL<br><br><br>If you mean less things :) then it's possible as long as you have a good time table and <b>very</b> much motivation.

Maybe he's doing it for fun. I planned to learn the whole system in the next schoolyear, and I would do it only because it's interesting and makes life 0.0000000000000000000001% easier (if you're a normal person without a chemistry job)<br><br>#lyf3h4ck3d

It's possible, but I wouldn't say it's needed. It's good to memorise the first 20 elements, as people have said. But memorising all of them, their names, the elemental symbols, their properties, what group and period they're in, atomic and mass numbers takes time. My Mum did it, but she had a career in chemistry.<br><br>In the end it's your choice.

Unnecessary in my opinion. You should recieve a copy of the table and I don't believe it's required to memorize it. Up to you.

I learnt the periodic table when I was 8 -_-.... I guess that was us being shown the table and what some of the elements do. You don't have to memorize it because there are millions of sheets out there with the elements on it but as snow said maybe memorize 5-10 and get better. Maybe memorize your favourite ones :D
