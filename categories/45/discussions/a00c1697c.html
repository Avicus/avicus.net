Its not like those countries didn't have players, what'd you mean they're joining soon?&nbsp;<br><br>And as per usual mojang show they are the most game company on the planet. Charging more for a game that hasn't had any major innovation for four years.

China has strict laws and they block lots of things there such as Youtube, Twitter, Facebook, and etc. I remember hearing on the news one day that China is not allowing their citizens to play Minecraft, but I guess Mojang convinced them to sell it now.

Also, maybe I didn't look at it right? It was very late at night for me. Maybe I should of gone to bed and waited to do it the morning. Thanks for pointing out the mistakes.&nbsp;<br><br>(Sorry for the triple post)

I bought it for 800 Rubles, and now it costs 1900 rub. Converting to dollars: was 26$, now - 29$. It became more expensive ;)
