Ok, before I start this a bunch of you are probably thinking, <i>another useless rank</i>? Well, how did servers like Mineplex, Hypixel, and other big name servers get popular. They advertised. It might be just me but I feel like the Avicus Server Population is gradually decreasing. I feel a main part of this is that we aren't advertising enough. So this is where the Advertiser Rank comes into play.&nbsp;<br><br>A person with the Advertiser Rank is responsible for "advertising" the avicus network. This can be through social media, Youtube, through forum pages and sidebar ads.&nbsp;<br><br>I think this idea is good and it will benefit Avicus now and in the long run. Avicus's population will increase if we advertise more.<br><br>Yay or Nay?<br><br><i>-EDJM9</i>

I believe social media is just run by certain staff members in the staff team, it's just an extra role<br>There's no point in having a rank because there is no reason to tell the public that you are an advertiser of Avicus

The Admins currently have advertising plans that'll become public knowledge in the near future (I assume). We don't need a rank for this.

No need for a rank for it. It's simply just for promotional purposes.

We don't need this rank, as SnowSX3 said, the admins have advertising plans. Also, we already have the <b>Famous</b> rank for the Youtubers .

I barely see someone on the Forums without a rank now-a-days, and I don't see a reason for this. Advertising is the administration team's job, not individuals.
