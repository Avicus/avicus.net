Aye fellas,<br>im looking for a good pc build all under 600$ or less. &nbsp;I've been playing on an old Apple desktop and it can barely run small online games. For this build, a ll I want to do is minecraft and use it for day to day life. I don't know much about any computor stuff so I was hoping some of you lads could help me out in the making.<br><br>thanks

/summon Loo<br><br>/summon Sevo<br><br>These 2 folks will probably help the most. All I can say is buy the parts from Ebay. It is super cheap and shipping is often free. I got a 180GB hard drive for 10 bucks from there and a Corsair Bronze 430W for 35 bucks.

Some questions:<br><br>-Budget?<br><br>-Country?<br><br>-What exactly are you going to be doing?<br><br>-How long will you be using this PC?<br><br>-Any specific colors you like?<br><br>-Do you record videos or edit videos?&nbsp;<br><br>-Anything you need? (mouse, keyboard, etc)<br><br>-Anything else you need?<br><br>My Skype is SevoMC. I'll get to you next morning the latest. Answer these and I'll get you a build tomorrow ;).

<a href="https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/user/SevoPC/saved/NYRfrH">https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/user/SevoPC/saved/NYRfrH</a><br><br>This will easily get over 60 FPS in Minecraft. It actually has the same CPU and GPU I have. I would recommend bumping your budget up to 700-750$ if you want a better build overall but if all you want is good performance this will do fine. Also, you are going to have to get a Windows CD key, unless you want to buy the legit version of windows. Other than that, the keyboard is a very reliable one. I used to use it and I liked it a lot for the money.<br><br>Have fun with your build!

It has an SSD so it will boot up in about 15 seconds and the HDD will have plenty of space for a lot of games and programs. I added a wireless adapter and an optical drive but it's up to you if you need them, you can take them off to make the build even cheaper.<br><br>Like Sevo said, you're going to need to get a Windows key somehow other than buying it because it's very expensive. I have a Windows 10 key but I don't know if it still works so don't count on that too much.
