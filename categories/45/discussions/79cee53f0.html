Sadly for some, summer has come to an end. People may have started school last week, may be starting school sometime this week, or next week. I just wanted to know what grade you guys are going into and if you're excited!&nbsp;<br><br>Im going into 9th grade and I'm &nbsp;most likely going to take the honorary award for shortest freshman LOL. RIP summer
