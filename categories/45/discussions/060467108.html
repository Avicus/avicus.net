I'm in the want for speakers and I'm thinking of getting getting 2 ue megabooms but I don't have much knowledge on what's the best speakers or best bang for buck speakers are out there. Budget is not a problem but if it's gonna be $400 at least be worth the $400 someone pays for them :-)

Well I intend on using them for parties, to bring at school (just to chill with friends or play music at the basket ball courts) use them at home since I don't really like headphones. I'll probably use them for more reasons but that's what I'll know I'll do with them for sure right now

I won a&nbsp;<b>UE Miniboom</b> from a competition and I must say, it is extremely powerful for such a small device - the sound quality is sublime, the portability is great and overall the usability makes it worth the money if you want to buy it. I actively use it for a variety of different reasons and the exterior is pretty durable. So I expect a set of <b>UE</b>&nbsp;<b>Megabooms&nbsp;</b>should float your boat for above average sound quality and portability.&nbsp;<img src="http://cdn.toptenreviews.com/rev/prod/large/60469-ue-mini-boom-box.jpg" title="Image: http://cdn.toptenreviews.com/rev/prod/large/60469-ue-mini-boom-box.jpg">

SVEN - 11 years of good sound, but they aren't mobile

What are the best speakers in the world*** <br><br>And if you're asking on here you'll get a lot of different opinions. I've got about 6 speakers in my office that work really well for parties etc.. I'll have to get you the links later.

UE Boom 2 is really great. Personally I don't have it but last semester at school I had a kid in a few of my classes who had one and it worked great. Sound went in 360 directions giving everyone the great sound, it was powerful, bluetooth, meaning no wires and its small so its portable!<br><a href="http://www.ultimateears.com/en-ca/ueboom2#intro-slide" title="Link: http://www.ultimateears.com/en-ca/ueboom2#intro-slide">http://www.ultimateears.com/en-ca/ueboom2#intro-slide</a><br><img src="https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4061358/uewm4_2040.0.jpg" title="Image: https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4061358/uewm4_2040.0.jpg">

I don't know much about speakers but the best speakers I have seen are these:<br><br><a href="http://www.jbl.com/bluetooth-speakers/JBL+PULSE.html" title="Link: http://www.jbl.com/bluetooth-speakers/JBL+PULSE.html">http://www.jbl.com/bluetooth-speakers/JBL+PULSE.html</a><br><br>The RGB lights are pretty cool, they are wireless and they have pretty damn good sound quality (I've never seen them but I have listened to the little brothers of these babies and I instantly fell in love. The only reason I didn't want them is because I barely even use my speakers, and mainly use headphones.)
