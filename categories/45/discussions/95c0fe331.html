"Zintenka, provide suppressive fire. I'm flanking them," A rough voice ordered.<br><br>There was a grunt of confirmation followed by a heaving grunt as someone vaulted over their cover and strafed the positon ahead with gunfire.<br><br>"Quesa, that doesn't seem like a wise move," A baritone voice explained, assuming it belongs to Zintenka. "Ah hell."&nbsp;<br><br>Quesadillas sprinted around the distracted hostiles behind their cover as Zintenka was providing covering fire.<br><br>"Eat this you P2W bastards," Quesa shouted out.<br><br>The hostiles screamed as they were torn and ripped apart by bullets.<br><br>"Hostile units neutralized."&nbsp;<br><br>Quesadillas kicked over their corpses and examined their weapons and gear.<br><br>"Hm, these guns are pretty high spec. And by the way their armor looks and their name tags, these guys were donors..."&nbsp;<br><br>"As expected from P2W servers. Too bad they don't know how to use their weapons well." Zintenka responded.&nbsp;<br><br>Suddenly, there was a rumbling noise that was shaking the ground.&nbsp;<br><br>"What, is that?"&nbsp;<br><br>"I don't know, but stay alert. Could be something bad..." Quesadillas said wearily.<br><br>"Gee, thanks for stating the obvious," Zintenka mocked.&nbsp;<br><br>Quesadillas playfully punched his shoulder.&nbsp;<br><br>"We better keep moving to the rally point, night fall is coming soon and I don't wanna be here when the Zombies come. Damn things grew smarter and faster..."&nbsp;<br><br>They hiked for several miles. Occasionally encountering enemy forces.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx<br><br>"Hey Quesa, I've been hearing that rumbling noise for a while now. Any guesses what it could be?" Zintenka asked.<br><br>"Hmm. I don't know. Anything can happen now that update 2.0 came out. Guns, giant withers, a gunship, a-"<br><br><b>BOOM<br></b><br>Both were knocked several meters away by the explosion that occured.&nbsp;<br><br>They looked up and stared in abstract horror.<br><br>"A-a T-t-tank! RUN!"<br><br>They got up and started running away from the menacing monstrosity.<br><br>"Since when did the update mention tanks!?" Zintenka yelled angrily all the while spraying bullets at the tank.&nbsp;<br><br>To his chagrin, the bullets only pinged off the armor.<br><br>"Since Mojang decided to turn Minecraft into something else! An open world, military, faction FPS and TPS!" Quesadillas yelled back.<br><br>The tank continued to pursue.&nbsp;<br><br>Zombies joined the chase and were sprinting and shooting at both parties all the while frothing from their rotten mouths.&nbsp;<br><br>The tank took its attention away from them and was tearing apart the Zombies.&nbsp;<br><br>"Quickly! Run while its distracted!" Zintenka yelled.&nbsp;<br><br>"Way ahead of ya!"<br><br>They ran and hid. Hearing the tank's treads a very close distance away.<br><br>They waited and stared at the tank with bated breaths.<br><br>The tank slowly turned its main cannon at their cover. <b>"X-ray mode activated."&nbsp;</b>A monotonous mechanical voice rang out.<br><br>"Oh you son of a bi-"<br><br>Quesadillas' voice was cut off as an explosion rocked the whole tank.&nbsp;<br><br>When the smoke cleared, the tank was still standing but it was motionless.<br><br>Slowly, they crawled out of their cover.<br><br>A silhouette walked out from the tree line.<br><br>It revealed to be Evocal carrying a weird looking gun.<br><br>"Airburst. Air pressure kills the crew inside." He explained, looking at our gawking expressions.<br><br>After a moment of them exchanging pleasantries, they crawled into the tank.<br><br>"Now come on, the rally point awaits us."<br><br><b>A/N: Hope y'all like it!</b>
