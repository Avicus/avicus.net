so recently I've heard you can't spectate a scrim with two teams versing. I think the problem is they might think they are helping the other team bc someone might be tunneling underground. I think people without a team should be able to spectate scrimmages, to give a scrimmmage kind of a crowd. I don't know if staff can see msgs or what.<br><br>thanks,<br><br><br>-I've never been on a comp team

I think it's mainly the fear of giving tactical info. Personally I don't mind.

It's pretty much an honor system. There is no rule for or against it.

I think peeople just like the idea of being allowed somewhene other can't be. Also to have the power to say no you can't join. As at the end of the day, they make no difference to gameplay unless they spam or give tact info.
