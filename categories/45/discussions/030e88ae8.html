Hello.<br>I got promoted to Jr.Moderator today and I feel like a thank you is in order.<br><br>The amount of support I have received in the weeks leading up to the staff applications was insane. <br>I never knew how many people thought that I was good enough to become a moderator. <br>It just blew me away.<br><br>Everyone from both the community and the staff believed in me and backed me even before these staff apps were announced, it was astonishing.<br><br>So now that I'm a Jr.Moderator, I wanted to say thank you. Thank you for the support and the positive encouragement you all have given me and thank you all for believing in me.<br><br>Now, it's my turn to give back.<br>I am going to be as active as I possibly can be, helping people and answering reports.<br><br>So thank you Avicus.&nbsp;<br>I will not let you down.
