<i>(Sorry if it is taken as advertising or spam ;l)</i><br>I am making a website free-for-all, about programming. I am doing this website but I need help, because the website design is poorly madden by me... I am good at HTML but I'm really bad at CSS... well, I was just sharing the website (it is being made, it is little) where I teach how to program in HTML in a guide divided in 'chapters', but I've only made one chapter as for now. I was asking if someone could help me with the website HTML and someone who could help me out with the design. I'd really be glad if some people here could help me...&nbsp;<br>The goal of the website is help to new people in the programming world to learn easily and having fun.<br>Later, when I have time and some help I will try follow with the HTML guide and add an other Markup language like CSS, and then programming languages like Java and C++.<br>&nbsp;<br>Thanks for reading, and by the way, if you want to visit the website,&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://fedorus.com/">check it out!</a>&nbsp;<br>/<i>Remember, the website is still in beta! I need help for follow with it and some sugs</i>/<br>Well, and about the design... blame me :P<br>In the future it will be a website which teachs Markup and Programming languages.

'This HTML 'guide' is divided in very short but good chapters which will make you learn in less than a week!' Text extracted from the website. Any way I have only made one chapter, and now that I see they are really short x) the second one is not finished... I think I will be finishing it in one or two weeks. I think I need more help in CSS than HTML, but if we change the Style I will have to re-code the website.

Okay, thank you very much. It has not to be very 'woah' but atleast we have to give the example, we are like the 'professionals professors'.<br>Well, and also, I am going to need someone who could make the website a logo with it's name ('Fedorus'). &nbsp;Thanks.
