Wow my other thread got locked cause I said I was going on vacation and it's not &lt;&gt; personal that I'm going on vacation, I call &lt;&gt;, plus it was in &lt;&gt; OFF TOPIC FOR A &lt;&gt; REASON &lt;&gt;. Only seniors should be able to lock topics too.

It is Off-Topic, yes, but that doesn't allow you to write about where you are going or what you're doing as it is listed in the ruleset to follow those instructions I had posted. Please be casual when writing discussions and if you have staff complaints, email support@avicus.net.

Calm down..<br>I think she made the thread because she was confused about alternate IP's and getting banned, not to tell everyone she was going on vacation..<br>Maybe that's just me, though ._.

You declaring that you're going on a vacation is about you, not a general discussion that isn't pertaining to your life. Also, you now have another locked thread. Please calm down and handle things professionally... and as always, post a suggestion in Server Feedback if you believe only seniors should be able to lock topics and email support@avicus.net with staff complaints. I do not want to dig this ditch further than what it already is, let it be.
