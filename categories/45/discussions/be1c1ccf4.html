F*** no, I just wasted my new after-ban life on Avicus for getting 100k credits and I don't want to loose my 75k now. It was the same when Kylo updated Avicus and removed prestiges... If we loose our earned credits now again, then it's time to leave

Prestige should be the name for a rank-up system Avicus could have. After a certain amount of credits earned or the certain level's 'challenges' are completed you rank up or prestige and unlock new stuff.<br><br>How does that sound to y'all?

Like once you get to 50 levels you confirm your prestige, and you get a different coloured * each time.

How about we talk about moving forward, not backward! People have suggested some pretty awesome <i>new </i>ideas like challenges and dynamic ranking unlike prestiges which were subject to complaints because they were "repetitive", limited and "unrewarding."<br><br>Edit: linked wrong thread, summarized it
