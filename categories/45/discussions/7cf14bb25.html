My Opinion - 2015 For Avicus.

As we know, the new year is imminently among us, which marks an end to an interesting year for Avicus - the first true year for Avicus. 2014 has seen a lot of changes, in terms of everything. I have only been here for half of this year, but a lot has still happened in this time.<br><br>There has been the retirement and farewells of legends, all the way from Howsie, to the very recent EricV4. The general ethos of players has changed throughout this year, becoming more competitive, tougher, more hard working - this year as a team we have put in a huge effort to keep this server running, and it wouldn't be the same without a single one of us (except me hue no.)<br><br>There have also been many new promotions, with the recent new Moderators and the promotion of people to Sr Moderators and Managers, the now inclusive Admins. These staff have become more professional this year, and are working harder than ever to maintain the behaviour of us all and make Avicus a friendly environment.<br><br>Maps have changed, with the additions and removals of several new ones, but the biggest shoutout of all has to go MonsieurGray (A.K.A Evocal) who has done a superb job of giving up his time of developing all the wonderful maps that we have the privilege of playing now, working fantastically throughout this year.<br><br>This has all happened in 2014, a truly memorable year for the community that makes up this wonderful server.<br><br><u>So, this is what I think will happen for 2015.<br><br></u>Firstly, I believe that if the server still manages to run strong by the end of this year, the people that play it will be friendlier than ever, and more competitive (watch it Sunny lel). Also, with the way we are going, the population of our server could also increase, and it would be great if we could regularly get over 500 players online on Avicus at any one time, like it was with McZone.&nbsp;<br><u><br><br><br></u>Maps will also be more creative and thoughtful as ever, with great new designs that will help encourage players to play these artistic masterpieces. The Dev Team are currently doing a great job at making maps, keep this up, please, you are all amazing at what you do.<br><u><br></u>Finally, I believe that we will have many interesting and helpful new Staff members that will be eager to help us when we are in trouble or need to ask any questions.<br><u><br></u><u></u>Thank you very much for reading this, and to finish off, this is who I think will make a big impact in 2015.<br><br>MonsieurGray<br>ScriptingCookies<br>pizza334<br>killerbye22<br>Merlinmaster<br><span><br><br>Here's to 2015 for Avicus!</span>

It certainly was an awesome year, but I'll be ready to rumble in 2015! Thanks everyone that has made my 8 months, an incredible, never ending ride!

Truly deep. Hopefully the next year, (Or actual for Australia and some of Asia!) will be better and the best! ^~^

I remember playing on the server back in 2013, and you are right it has changed alot! The server has become much more fun imo and my favorite minigame, nebula has uncountable maps ;D. I'd like to thank all the devs for making this possible

It's certainly changed a lot. I mean I played skywars in the old silent lobby and have seen many libby changes. I feel like it's going in the right direction but we have lost a lot of good members along the way.

Well, first off, I'd like to express my gratitude for your kind words and this post as a whole. I'm very very very thankful for everything you've said and it's an honor to be part of this community I joined about a year and a half ago. It's always been a pleasure to help members of this community and the staff itself too, because you don't need a reason to help people. I'm always gonna be thankful with the staff, the community, everyone, thank you for changing my life. I've learned a lot of things ever since I joined Avicus, I've met so much people and if it wasn't for Avicus I'd probably be a sad kitten in a box right now, ready to be kicked to a dump. Thank you, seriously, I mean it with all my heart. You guys are the best and it's always a pleasure to help with what I can. I've had a lot of fun making maps for this server and I won't stop anytime soon, the day I stop making maps will be the day I retire, but that ain't happening soon. I got a reason to stay and I seriously don't want to leave such an amazing community.<br>Have a nice new year, 2015 will be a fresh start for the whole majority, if not for everyone. I wish the best of luck to every single one of you. Thanks for being part of my 2014.<br><br>...and Happy Birthday, Justice I !

&lt;3<br><br>I think that Avicus has changed a lot since I first joined 3/4 of a year ago, some bad but mostly good. And the community here is so good, except for those trolls and hackers, but otherwise great. 2014 was such a great year, but I have a feeling Avicus is going to get even bigger in 2015.
