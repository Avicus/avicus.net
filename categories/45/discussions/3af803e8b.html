Hi, I created a topic similar to this a while ago but I can't find it. So I thought I would re make it, sort of like this post on the <a href="https://oc.tc/forums/topics/52125dd2af7fb042b2001fd0" rel="nofollow">OCN forums.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Post any books you recently read (or reading right now) and would recommend to others. Don't spoil the ending to the books or I'll kill you like Han Solo.<br><br>My list:<br>Da Vinci Code - Dan Brown&nbsp;<br>1984 - George Orwell<br>Art of War - Sun Tzu<br>Politics - Aristotle<br>The Prince - Niccolo Machiavelli<br><br>I'll add more to this as I remember them. xD

Isn't <i>War and Peace</i> by Leo Tolstoy? Dostoevsky wrote <i>Crime and Punishment</i> from what I know, both very long books. Have them but never read them. xD

Hmm, well the series Legend by Marie Lu is really good. So is the Mortal Instruments by Cassandra Clare (including the other spin-off series by her). Rule of Three by Eric Walters is another great series. Actually, most Eric Walters books are pretty good.

Maybe, but I enjoy history so it's essentially a gold mine. Plus, the characters are quite interesting and I enjoy books written in the 30's.<br><br>Agree to disagree, I suppose. =)
