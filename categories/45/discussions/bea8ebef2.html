Yes, as you can see his stats, he was not in Avicus<br>for entire 4 months. And i also know one reason<br>that he left was because of school, as you said.<br>But I am not still sure about it.<br>What happened?

Ftw was the best mod this server has ever had and ever will have. Anyone who says otherwise either doesn't know who he is or didn't see how dedicated he was. He's the most inspirational guy I've ever met.

I guess I should own up and come clean.<br><br>For the past... god knows how many months, I've been a bit... let's just say down in the dumps. Over a number of things. Normal things which most 16-19 year olds will go through, at some point in their lives. College, friendship, love, ambitions etc... There have been a few positives, but I've been more upset and just kind of sad more over these months than I have for my whole life, and I just need some time to pick myself up, sort things out, and work on making myself happy again.<br><br>I haven't come back to anyone on Skype, not because I don't feel like I can talk to any of you (you know who you are) but just because I don't want to bring anyone else down. You guys don't need my crap. No one can help me right now anyways. You all know me as being happy, kind and positive, which is what I want to be to all of you and if I'm not that, I don't want to be here crying on anyone's shoulder. I hope you will all understand that.<br><br>I'll return to Skype and will happily talk about everything that's been going on once everything is OK again, but right now it's still happening, and I just need time to stop it all and sort myself out. Word of advice: The time you are living in right now, no matter how bad you think it is, when you're my age you will look back on these years as the time you want to go back to. I'm not saying your future is going to be all doom and gloom, but nothing ever stays the same and in 5 years time you might be living in something the exact opposite of what you dreamt of every night. Be prepared.<br><br>I'll see you whenever. Bye bye :(

Wow Fight, long time no see. Whatever happens in your life, just remember that being in teenage years are easily some of the hardest times in your life. So just take your time, sort things out, and hopefully you'll be back on Skype ready to share how you've been in the past god knows how long it's been. It's great to hear from you again, bro. &lt;3 You're a real inspiration.

No. I only check to see if everything is ok, not because I want to come back. It only takes like 30 seconds so I'm not wasting my time by doing so.
