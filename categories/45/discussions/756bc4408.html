For about a year I've had an awful laptop. I've somehow managed to use it for playing MC and other games, watching youtube, browsing the web, etc. It's been pretty cool but I've been thinking of saving up for a desktop. I'd be using it for a small percentage gaming, and a very large percentage web browsing.<br>I'm not an expert, could I get some suggestions? Thanks :)

maybe a few hundred dollars, tops?&nbsp; like $300-$500, 500 may be a bit above my price range, depends on if i'll still want it this bad when i have the money.<br><br>i could potentially sell my current computer for about $300, maybe more.

I think you need to save a bit more. $500 isn't enough for a decent computer. Double or Triple that amount, then look around :)

If you can double that amount, I recommend an iMac. A lot of people say that Macs suck for gaming, but I'm averaging around 200-300fps. Oh and it has a 1080p screen which is great for browsing.

Around $1100, give or take a few bucks. I don't use it mainly for gaming though; I needed a powerful enough computer to run Photoshop, Illustrator, and Maya simultaneously.

Honestly, you're not going to get a quality desktop for $300-$500, you're better off getting a console for that kind of money.

If you want a quality gaming rig, the cheapest I would say you could go is $800.

What fps would you want on your desktop?<br>I think you could get some decently built Ivy Bridge desktops or build one yourself, as I think the current generation is Haswell. If you'd like to wait, I think the new processor iterations come out by the end of this year, which might make the ivy bridge processors cheaper.

alright, sounds like i'm gonna save up more than i thought. that's totally fine, it'll just take me a lot longer. i don't have much money, so that's why i can't afford the greatest computers. i was thinking of building one too. i don't really want/need an imac, either.<br><br>now that i think about it, i'll probably not be gaming by the time i get the money, so i'll just look for parts for anything decent enough for time to time games and lots of web browsing, and probably some art programs such as paint.net, photoshop, illustrator.<br><br>thanks for all the replies, didn't think this would get as much response as it did.

Right, but I meant the actual pre built rigs, not the processors alone, though I do believe that some discounts come around once a while
