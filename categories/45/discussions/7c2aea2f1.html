Hey guys! JJ here, and I am here with a new... Discussion. In english, we are currently writing about debatable topics, so i decided to come here, and talk about some with you guys! Every Wednesday, I'll post a new Topic, and you can all put your opinion in.<br><br>First Off:<br>Do violent video games contribute to violent kids?

No. I don't see a rise in crime after every GTA game.

Well, little kids are commonly influenced by video games, and I am sure that gun games are absolutley not healthy for them. However, Older and more mature players do not necessarily have to be 18 to understand that the games should not be replicated in real life. I think that violent video games will affect kids only if they are mentally ill and/or they too small and easy to pick up bad habits.

No, this is different. That's a rant page about things TnT finds wring, or bad. This is a page about topics that are contraversial, and two sided. Everyone gets to put their input here, and we all talk, bounce ideas, ect. Kind of like a Socratic Seminar.

After my first match on Call of Duty: Black Ops II I wanted to kill someone so I fought with a friend's mom.... So... I think the answer is No! :)

That's still kinda serious if you want to kill small animals after playing a video game...

I really doubt someone very young seeing someone play CoD and getting a couple kills makes them violent. It's usually lazy ass parenting that makes kids violent because the parents probably do meth.

I think you need to find some more original topics. Or something more avicus related that's controversial.

Sorry? I have no idea who you are. And there's an "Off Topic" section for a reason dude.<br><br>And what is Avicus?<br>A minecraft pvp server.<br><br>What is minecraft pvp?<br>A game where you fight and kill other players.&nbsp;<br><br>So it's actually quite related to Avicus.

Sorry that's not what I meant. Why talk about something that has been talked about since the dawn fps games? Also I meant something directly connected to the server.

<i></i><i></i> Like the guy said, this is in Off Topic because it is not related to Avicus in any form, as what many posts on here are for. But yes, I feel another topic should be debated instead of this redundant one.

No in my opinion, if you have a kid that wants to shoot Russians from playing CoD, they are probably mental.
