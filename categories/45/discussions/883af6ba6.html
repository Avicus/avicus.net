*WARNING: LOTS OF DRAMA AND WORDS.*<br><br>Hey everyone.<br>I made this as a bit of an apology towards a friend of Steven's. It all happened really quickly and embarrassed myself. But I'm gonna be a man and step up to the plate instead of hiding my mistakes for somebody to find it.<br><br>I'm typing this on my iPod so I can't link the video, but I was saying some really mean things to Steven's friend which were caught on video. Rewatching it, I felt really bad. If you happen to come across it, just know what I said wasn't even close to true. Any of it. That day I had a lot of crap to deal with. I ran out of patience and was just completely tired.&nbsp;<br><br>I would never bully someone like that (yes, it was obvious bullying) unless I had some huge motive. That isn't like me. He even titled the video "MLGtino insulting me". I seriously cannot stress how bad I feel about this.<br><br>You can demote me (I'm an interviewee) or ban me I really don't care. I just want to apologize for this. Especially to Steven and his friend.<br><br>Sorry if this seems like an attention drawing post, but I really just wanted to get this off my chest before somebody got the wrong idea.<br><br>Really sorry,&nbsp;<br>~MLGtino

Everyone makes mistakes. I've had my fair share of days where I just want to strangle anyone that says anything even the slightest bit annoying.<br><br>Very nice of you to apologize like this :D

You have no clue how many days like this I have had, I just strangled jozz, then he helped me &lt;3<br>But in all honesty, you are a great person tino, and I believe even if this person doesnt want to forgive you, deep down in their heart they already have.

It's great that you're apologizing.. Most people don't, and they like to hide the fact that they're wrong, but you did in fact explained your side. Everyone has those bad days where they're just upset, if anyone gets on there last nerve. As long as you truly mean it, and you're not just saying this to make you reputation look "good", it's okay. Glad you apologized. ;)

I'm glad you swallowed your pride and made someone feel better; something I can't do. We all know you're a good person and if you do ever act like that, we'll understand (:
