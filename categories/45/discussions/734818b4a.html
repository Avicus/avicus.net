Well, it definitely doesn't lead to a meeting of two people who will never meet leading to the question "What's your name?"</span><p style="margin: 0.5em 0px;  color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif;">The story is set 30 days after a shooting star has fallen for the very first time in a thousand years in Japan. Mitsuha, a high school girl living in the country side, wants to live in Tokyo City because she's tired of the repetitive life she's living and needs more spice. And then there is Taki, a high school boy living the city life with his friends and is a part- time worker at an Italian restaurant, with a strong interest in fine arts involving architecture, who also needs a break of his familiar life. One night, Mitsuha, Taki, and all of Japan witnessed the legendary comet with of only a few accounts known for. And that very night, Mitsuha dreamt of herself as a young boy in Tokyo and Taki dreamt of himself as a young girl attending high school in the country side. Is there a secret behind their dreams? And does the comet that passes by only once every thousand years have anything to do with it?</p><p style="margin: 0.5em 0px;  color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif;">This is a love story between two teenagers as they frantically search for each other whom they have never met and as they are dwindled by the cruel reality of fate and circumstances. But the real question here is, "Was there really even a love story?"</p><p style="margin: 0.5em 0px;"><b>MAL:</b>&nbsp;<a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/32281/Kimi_no_Na_wa" title="Link: https://myanimelist.net/anime/32281/Kimi_no_Na_wa">https://myanimelist.net/anime/32281/Kimi_no_Na_wa</a></p><b>Movie:</b>&nbsp;<a href="http://kissanime.to/Anime/Kimi-no-Na-wa/Movie?id=129840" title="Link: http://kissanime.to/Anime/Kimi-no-Na-wa/Movie?id=129840">http://kissanime.to/Anime/Kimi-no-Na-wa/Movie?id=129840</a><br><br>Makoto Shinkai you have done it again :') &lt;3 AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING #YourName

Apparently this movie was premiered at Anime Expo, but I didn't learn about that until about a month after the convention so obviously I completely missed a big opportunity back then. I instead watched it last night immediately after seeing it was uploaded to KissAnime yesterday, though I recommend that anyone interested in the film wait for an HD upload without anti-piracy watermarks everywhere (it's still very new — it started airing in theaters only two weeks ago). The movie's visuals are absolutely astonishing, but the mediocre quality of the existing upload tarnishes the pure magic of the artwork.<br><br><i></i>Before I even discovered that Shinkai directed both movies, I kept thinking while watching, "<i>Kimi no Na wa&nbsp;</i>is basically what you'd get if you took&nbsp;<i>Five Centimeters Per Second</i>&nbsp;and made it not suck."&nbsp;<i></i>While I do think&nbsp;<i>Kimi no Na wa</i>&nbsp;is exceptional and possibly the most brilliant anime movie I've seen so far, it falls <i>just short</i> of being a "masterpiece" like — some personal all-time favorites —&nbsp;<i>Psycho-Pass</i> or&nbsp;<i>Steins;Gate</i>... but that's not a bad thing.
