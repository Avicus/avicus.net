Sup, I thought it would be cool to create a gym thread for the community. Here you can share your story, tips and your split.<br><br>I'll start with my story. In August 2015, I decide to sign up to the Gym, I'm an ectomorph who weighed 45kgs. I was literally a stick. I stayed consisted and had good nutrition, I was eating almost 5000 calories per day, that's quite impressive, that's like bodybuilding material. (For those who don't know, I was bulking, also know as eating more then your calorie maintenance). Anyways, a month passed and I was gaining, during the 2 and a half month period, I weighed 57, that's 12 kilos in 2 months and a half, I was over the moon! I kept on going until today where I weigh 74 kilos with 10% body fat. I actually have arms now, a chest, a back, abs, shoulders, legs, you name it.<br><br>Hers my current split:&nbsp;<br>Sunday: Biceps and Chest<div>Monday: Triceps and Back</div><div>Tuesday: Shoulders and Legs&nbsp;</div><div>Wednesday: Calfs, forearms.</div><div>Thursday: Chest (I mainly try to isolate my upper chest, like focus my upper chest) Usually a 30-40 minute workout.</div><div><br></div><div>I do chest twice a week because I feel it's probably my weakest muscle; therefore, I'm prioritising it. &nbsp;I also do Abs every other day.</div><div><br></div><div>My workouts last around an hour to an hour and a half sometimes two. Depends whether I'm in my cutting phase or bulking phase.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Now it's your turn :)</div><div><br></div>

Yes, but if ate 1500 kcal and then started to eat 5k kcal, it would be shock for his organism. Now he have super body and weight, which he likes. But what will happen, if he stop training? He will deflate like a balloon (best case scenario)

I do upper body and lower body separately. I transition every day between upper and lower body. Upper body for me consists of Biceps, Triceps, back, pectorals, abs, forearm, and traps. For lower body I'm struggling a bit with hamstrings. I usually do RDL's, but don't always feel it, no matter how much weight I put. Anyone have other workouts for hamstrings?

5,000 calories isn't a lot of you work out intensely. To maintain mass, you have to have a high calorie intake. If he's doing it right, he should be getting bigger and stronger, not fatter.

Try hamstring extensions, you'll feel the contraction. Do like 4 sets of 8-12 reps while pyramiding up.

I didn't say he becomes fatter. He won't.<br>But you should know, what is happening, when you eat a lot of food/kcal. Your stomach now need to digest more food, it and leaver become bigger to deal with big amount of substances. Your hearter starts to work harder to supply increased organs. Your intestines is overloaded too. And it continues day by day, with hard training to burn all this calories.&nbsp;<br>Your body don't say "thank you" for this. My deal is to warn you.

I really don't know. My obvious answer is yes, but in my opinion, if you aren't committed you won't be getting results to achieve your goals. I wasn't that excited to go to the gym at the start, but I fell in love with it ever since, it becomes a healthy addiction. I would suggest you try it out, and make sure you know what you're doing. For example, search up what body type you are, make sure you have good nutrition, look at workout plans, all that shot will help you out.

I don't think you understand, you're assuming that everyone has the same body. My calorie maintainance was 1500 I think? Some thing around that line; however, during that period, I had a meal plan and carefully counted my macros, I knew what I was eating and it was healthy.

No, don't assume that. It all depends on your weight, height and age.&nbsp;<br>I just hope, you've talked with nutritionist or therapist, and didn't read about such diet in the internet.

You need to work out then to experience it. If you work out intensely and are taking the workout seriously, is better for you. Also, his calories don't need to be junk food. Personally, I don't take that much calories because I replace some of them with protein shakes and supplements, so I can't tell you what it feels like. For him, it's working very well. You need to work out and have a high calorie intake, then see it for yourself

Wish a minute, 12kg=26 pounds? That's not possible in two months. That is, unless you do cardio, workout, and take fat burner supplements with it. Every day.

First off, I was BULKING not cutting, I'm not trying to loose weight, I wouldn't step near a treadmill. Second of, it's possible for a natural to loose 49 pounds in 90 days, let alone 26 pounds.

You need to work out then to experience it. If you work out intensely and are taking the workout seriously, is better for you. Also, his calories don't need to be junk food. Personally, I don't take that much calories because I replace some of them with protein shakes and supplements, so I can't tell you what it feels like. For him, it's working very well. You need to work out and have a high calorie intake, then see it for yourself

I tried to say, that suddenly starting eat a lot is a huge pressure on the organism. He won't see the effect of it right now or tommorow, but, trust me, in 20 years he will come to a doctor with heart problems (if his story is true). For teenager 12 kilos in 2 month is pretty much. Also it may affect his bones, which wasn't ready for such upgrade.<br>You don't need this extreme way to become sexy bodybuilder. Just wait, your organism will collect this mass with help of hormones and your moderate training.<br><i>Don't jump into the fire</i>

There are so many people who do this type of training and more, do you see them all dropping dead from heart issues? No.<br><br>Trust me, the human body is more robust than that. If he feels like he's straining too much, it's up to him to go to a doctor.
