This is interesting. I have to tell you, it shows the depth in life and just gives you a little sneak peak of what true love is. This video brought me to tears, so emotional and full of motivational stuff. I will remember you forever.

The combination of this music and gameplay truly inspired me to make videos about the same content as in this video. Not only that is a point that hit me in my soul, the part when the rapper said ''When I grow up I wanna be a rapper'' was the part that my tears slowly came down to my lips. I quit watching the video or I would've had an ocean of tears because of that emotional song. Thanks for putting this together. You'll always be my favorite bomb maker.

<div class="row-fluid" style="padding-top: 15px">The skill in this video is truly inspirational. The skill of this player is so spontaneous and passionate - It made me want to kill myself, I wish I was good like you. I have decided to make a client so I could be as good as you before I kill myself, this client will be named Apollo.jar v420. If you want a download message me, but it won't beat the skill of yours in this video. You represented Mineman PeeVeePee with true passion and I can see you going far. <br><br><br>please check out my channel and sub to me thankyou<br>

I am actually crying about how this made me think about life. It is truly amazing how the music gets deep into your very own sole. This video has taught me love is something we should not take for granted.<br>Thank you Zeus, for inspiring me to become a better person, and a better Lego pvper.
