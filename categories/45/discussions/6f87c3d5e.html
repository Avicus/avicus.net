Is he real? Is all of humanity made by him?<br><b>Does he exist?</b><br><br>hey guys and for a VERY controversial post (most likely) i would like to hear what you have to say on God.<br>Do you believe in him? why? etc.<br>I believe this may have a pretty decent road of arguments laid out, but still i like a bit of controversy here and there..<br>Anyways, in my opinion, God does not exist, and never did, but this doesnt mean i am a huge atheist, big bang sort of person i just don't believe it any god (s).<br><br>Your opinion?

Okay, I will tell you my opinion.<br>I am a christian so I know a little about <b><i>'God</i></b>'<br>So you believe that there is no God? I am not saying that it is a really bad thing, but if there is no God, who created the universe?<br>And also, scientists says that this world is created in Big Bang but all they are saying is this small rock and rock come and (boom) and made the universe..<br>This doesn't make any sense at all. (Totally) Then where did the rock come from? (Huh?) And there should be something that created the whole thing, and even though they says that small micro-bacteria created the earth, they are not making it quite right because they don't know where the bacteria is from then, and that's ridiculous.. (Ikr)<br>So in my opinion, there is God, and the only God who created the universe, not small rocks.

It's not about arguing, it's about letting others know what do you think, just if you want to, then you can argue with someone about this but I wouldn't suggest that.

I dunno, I was brought up a Catholic so I guess I have a big view on God and such however I don't believe in a lot of stories in the bible, I tend to only believe in the ones that sound logical. I also believe in the big bang and how everything evolved from tiny single celled creatures. I actually don't know, I seem to live my life believing both.

Just to start off here, you know absolutely nothing about the Big Bang or the creation of Earth and Evolution.

well in my total, evaluated opinion, i never said i believed in the big bang :)<br>I can understand what you mean by that,and my entire reasoning behind this post is that i do not have a religion.. not even atheism, i just simply believe you begin your life on earth and eventually it ends.<br>I don't care how we came to be or what happens after, because i just live by what is literally happening before my eyes.<br>However i respect your belief and totally understand where you're coming from :)

Do YOU know something about it?<br>Anyway if that isn't related to the big-bang, it has a bit of logic because everything has an origin, then how do you explain the origin of the big-bang? I mean, there is something that created those particles.

I'm sorry, but I don't think the server forums are the place for religious debates. Not even the most amount of bounty extra-strength and mops could clean up ones from other server forums.<br><br>It always results in someone getting punished or cycling back and forth.
