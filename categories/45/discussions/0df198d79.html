What are your thoughts on the whole situation?<br>I personally learnt about it from Scarce's video, but watches a couple other vids and looks like people got some serious evidence.<br><br>For those who don't know the situation, there are claims that Marina Joyce (Youtuber with 600k + subs) is being kidnapped, abused or drugged by her current boyfriend because she has changed a lot from her vids. And the evidence that has been provided has been pretty strong. There is also some part where fans asked if she was ok, answered yes then later said no and deleted the comments as well as was told by fans to put a heart on her body in her next vid and then came a pic of her with a face painting with cat whiskers and a heary on her nose.<br><br>Most info got here on Scarce's video<br><a href="https://youtu.be/dyyQsEHenSQ">https://youtu.be/dyyQsEHenSQ</a><br>Discuss! :]

Could be drugs, I don't want to assume anything just yet on another person.<br><br>She's telling people to do a meet-up at Bethnal or whatever that place is called, seems sketchy as I've heard people say that the place that they're going to doesn't open until 9AM and she's saying to go at 6:30AM.<br><br>I've also heard that it's one of the more dangerous areas in London.<br><br>Anyway, she needs to fix her shit - or if something IS happening, police needs to be involved.

Recently people have called the police and the police were saying she was fine, but evidence with bruises, her looking frightened in her videos, telling in comments that she isn't fine, posting a pic with a hear on her nose in disguise as a cat when ppl are asking for signs with a heart on her body, her putting a cat in her insta bio after people were asking for signs, and many more pieces of evidence that show hard proof otherwise. I do agree with you tho, best not to jump to conclusions yet.

Look at it this way, nothing like this has EVER happened in the history of youtube. There's never been this much evidence of anything like this, and now suddenly there is? If I had my way, I'd have a full scale police investigaton.<br><br>Personally, I think the people holding her hostage have something over her... Family member? The boyfriend who is good, but bad guys got to him?

I guess more secure ways yes, but money-efficient, maybe not?<br>In the past 3 weeks she made approximately 7K dollars assuming this months youtube cpm is at $1 per 1000 views, but since it's the summer it's usually higher, so around 2 or higher probably. Meaning she probably could have made around 7K to 11K in less of a month from only 3 videos, + the advertisement that she made probably brings that number up as well.<br><br><img src="https://i.gyazo.com/c50400ab2344f2b55f97ba335a303b19.png" title="Image: https://i.gyazo.com/c50400ab2344f2b55f97ba335a303b19.png">

Well there are hell many, just google up "biggest internet hoaxes" or "biggest youtube hoaxes" but I'd say a classic of all time would be the Blair Witch Project. For example in a more recent scenario, there was this guy on both OCN and Avicus forums which faked cancer seeking for attention; perhaps there's not that much drama and certainly he's not as famous, but still as bad or worse.<br><br>Apart from specific examples, the point I was trying to make is that attention (let alone if there is money involved) can make people do things they themselves wouldn't even think they could do.

Update: Scarce did an interview on her. There's something definately wrong, even if she is denying it. She's either on drugs, or indeed held hostage. She claimed the gun in one of her videos is a beebee gun, but as you can clearly see in the video, there's no orange tip marking it as a beebee gun. Also, she kept repeating herself and sounded nervous the whole interview, and couldn't keep her eyes on the camera at all the whole interview, constantly looking behind it.<br><br>Seems pretty suspicious to me...
