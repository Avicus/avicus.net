No lock for now, Jozz made the appeal so he should handle this.<br>Well, if there is a flamewar it'll get locked. For the time being it will remain unlocked.<br>I hope you understand this ;)

It's a personal update buddy. Doesn't matter who appealed it. If someone complained about their ban you don't leave the mod who banned the guy to lock. Any mod locks.<br>Lock it.<br>Not allowed.

The main message is not that he has been unbanned. The main message is that he is thankful for what Fluenza has done for him.

The main message of the thread is saying thanks. There have been numerous posts in the past about people saying thanks to their teams, staff team, etc. so I don't see why this should be locked.

Could you please tell me what damage i could do to the server as a whole by seeing this one appeal thread? I've dealt with countless appeals as a Senior Mod. So i don't see the harm in seeing the reply on a appeal thread.. I'm just curious to see what Jozz said.

I don't see harm in it but if you were supposed to be able to see it it would be visible to you. I could have told people loads of things when I was staff that wouldn't hurt the server but being a staff member means you have to keep stuff to yourself sometimes.

I agree with what you're saying, I just wanted to know the reason for being accepted. Because it's obvious that it should of been denied.
