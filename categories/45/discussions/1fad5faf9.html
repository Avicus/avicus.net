I tend to ask this a lot in AMAs and stuff because I like hearing stories :)<br><br>Anyways :3<br>One day, young cinammoncroc000 found a website called CLUB PENGUIN and it was literally THE COOLEST THING back then so I decided to make an account. Now me, being the young, un-creative kid that I was, found two things around me (the Crocs that I was wearing and the Cinnamon Rolls in my mouth) and combined them to make MY USERNAME. The unfortunate part was that I spent at least 4 minutes trying to figure out how to spell "Cinnamon" so I ended up spelling it wrong.<br><br>Oh, and the 000 has no meaning, the login thingy said "you should use numbers!" and I was like "k."<br><br>After that I proceeded to carry this username through every single game and login thing I used, including Minecraft.<br>That's basically my story 0_o<br><br>Tell yours? :3

That's a cool way to make up a username xD<br>Mine came from me making a username in honor or my best friend. Before I moved decently far away, he showed me minecraft and I really like it. I then decided to make an account and was wondering what name I should give it. I remember that his favorite animal is a walrus, so I definitely wanted to add that in there because I also like animals and it's a good noun for a username. Then, to give my username some personality, I put "golden" before it because I really loved my friend. I hate gold, though xD. Anyways, then I put 909 after all of that because my sister always used that number combination in her usernames and I would like my username to have a wrap-up to it.&nbsp;<br>There ya go, I'd really like to hear more stories! :D

I was in the car with my mum driving back from the store (when I purchased Minecraft :P), and as usual I was listening to Dubstep while thinking what my Minecraft Name should be... I set up my account, and It was time for my name.. I originally was going to do "xXEnderGirlXx", but so many names are common like that. I always listen to Dubstep when I play on my Xbox, so I wanted to do something with "Dubstep" in it, because I love Dubstep ^-^ One problem... I sounded like a guy.. I needed to add something to make it "girly", and unique. So I thought of Princezz, and that's how I got my IGN.&nbsp;<br><br>Long story short, my mum thought of the name, as I came up with the idea. ;P

Yass :D Frosted's LONG Story Time! Alrighty, Here Goes:<br><br>Soo... It all started with a Youtube channel name. Me and two of my friends who are siblings became obsessed with Kawaii, Polymer clay, crafting and stuff like that. My two friends started a Youtube channel and me being me.. Hates being left out so I decided to make one. During that time I remember getting a cupcake maker thing.. So I would bake all day long.. Cupcakes preferably (sometimes muffins). I got stuck when it came to the channel name.. Since this stuff was like kawaii, I needed the name to be "cute" and yeahh.. I remember my first idea being Sweet... something. But that didn't work out very well. So I kept thinking and thinking, I had finally come up with a name: this happened because I made a batch of cupcakes and was too lazy to frost them.. So I was eating cupcakes and realized "OMG!" FrostedCupcakes! Yeah.. I didn't like the S.. So I changed it to a Z because I thought it would fit better.. Turns out the name was taken (grr).. I came up TheCupcakeHugger (odd right?) Aweh how I remember those times! Don't try to find me I've deleted the channel. But yeah.. I had just gotten my MacBook Pro, I used to play Minecraft Pocket Edition and soon realized that I loved Minecraft! I finally persuaded my dad to get me Minecraft. I had the name reserved because I set an account up with that name.. It was like the best idea ever.. Yeah! Thats my long story. Yay!

Kammy878.... people say its a girl name, but this will proove them wrong. I am a boy by the way. kammy is a childhood nickname which originated from kamran (this is pronounced differently in my language and is a boy only name in the pakistani culture and urdu language.) Then my mom came up with kammy aka kami, but i spell it kammy which is also pronounced differently. I wanted my username to be unique so instead of making som unoriginal name like minemaster or some other sort of name like that, i chose kammy for my runescape account and at that time my older brother still played runescape and his name was Dawood (his name) 878 and it became like a brotherly tradition that all 3 of us brothers now use. i dont know why my older brother chose 878... maybe there is a secret reason......

I originally had my login as spideematt. When I began to outgrow that I thought of a new name for the now closed, Lego Universe, that I was getting. T hat name was Stealthbomber1452. (I also published quite a few Bubble Tanks in bubble tanks 3 under that name in armor games. Most of them were private.) The username was too long and my mom changed the number to Stealthbomber16, which I thought was better.<br><br>No idea how I came up with Stealthbomber1452.
