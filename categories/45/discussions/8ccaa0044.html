What previously settings did you have on your old Minecraft settings? Optifine could be a factor. Check your Task Manager for any programs running. I had trouble like this it was MSI after burner and RivaTuna,

Install optifine, it should tell you what options make it go faster. Lower your render, set FPS to unlimited, etc. If you download Optifine, press the mirror instead, works better that way for me.

The same has happened to me, we sent it to get fixed, they restored it, but now I'm getting much less fps then I did before. I downloaded optifine already, but it is still less. Does anyone know how to fix this?

If you did a system restore all your mc settings might have been restored aswell.

Play on low resolution full screen by going into video settings once you've downloaded optifine, play with razer game booster, set your java priority to high on task manager, play with a render distance of two, no sky or clouds, and only have mc running

Alot of people are talking about OptiFine, but I'll only recommend it if;<br>- Your computer can handle it.<br>- You're prepared to do some fiddling.<br>And you're prepared to troubleshoot.<br><br>OptiFine makes me lag more often, and is generally annoying. I wouldn't recommend it unless your situation is dire :P

Frozen you are strange.&nbsp;<br>Babe get OF i can send you my settings if you want.&nbsp;<br><br>Now this is how i boost my FPS (swag trick inbound).&nbsp;<br>Step 1. make sure your laptop is charging.&nbsp;<br>Step 2. Click the charging icon in the bottom right.&nbsp;<br>Step 3. You will see something that says "Select Power Plan"&nbsp;<br>Step 4. Select "High Performance" Not razer cortex power plan, balanced or energy saver. <br>&nbsp;Have fun with more FPS, also Razer Cortex doesn't seem to work for me so i wouldn't reccomend it personally but if it works for you do it, however make sure you select "high performance" It is more effective than razer power plan no matter what.
