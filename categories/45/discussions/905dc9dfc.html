The Berlin market attack
by
<a href='/users/Myworld6.html' style='color: Gray'>Myworld6</a>
<small>December 20, 2016 at  9:12 AM UTC</small>
</h1>
Yesterday, a lorry smashed through a Christmas market in Berlin, killing 12 people and wounding a further 48. Daesh have recently claimed responsibility, but as we all know Daesh would claim that someone tripping over and hitting their head was something to do with them.&nbsp;<br><br>But I digress. I know that a post about this was archived by its creator yesterday, which is why I am creating this one in memory of those poor people who died as a result of a spineless attack on innocent people celebrating a holiday that was sacred to many of them.&nbsp;<br><br>However, this attack is a very clear reminder that Daesh, even if they weren't responsible, are still a very real threat to the lives of innocents. While I believe that we should continue to celebrate in defiance of these cowardly monsters, I urge everyone to be extremely careful, particularly if you are visiting areas that could be targeted by groups such as Daesh.<br><br>You don't have to comment if you don't want to, but I think that a thread should be made about this, just as one has been made for the other terror attacks too.&nbsp;<br><br>Stay safe, everyone.

It's a shame the world can't just learn to get along. Unfortunately, I can't see this situation improving.&nbsp;<br>I agree that Daesh may or may not be responsible and it does serve a reminder that there isn't a lot of safe options. I know that Australia has it's share of terror threats and it's a shame that people can't just leave each other alone, especially at a time of peace, joy and giving like Christmas.<br><br>However, what is great is how the rest of the world can band together and support countries affected by this plague of disaster and tragedy. The way the world reacted to the Paris attacks and even the Berlin attacks the other day is what adds fuel to flame of hope that burns in this world.

Like the Russian ambassador being murdered? If you want to mention it, then make a thread for it. This is intended to commemorate the victims in Berlin, no others.

You're right Crimson and also, why didn't we focus on the attacks in Kenya? The man who tackled a suicide bomber so they wouldn't explode on other people....the war in Syria, innocent people dying. What about the Maynmar burning Villages?<br><br><br>Why are we focusing on one city? I undersrand that Berlin just went through a terriost attack, but they aren't the only ones suffering, there's others too that we should pray for. Maybe instead of "Pray for x", Pray for the World is the right words to say. It seems like the richer countries get the sympathy for such events, but when a poorer country is attacked, it's just like a "oh no" to us...

I did not say that at <b>any point. </b>Refer to my last post. If you want to talk about those other cases, make a thread about them. I would do the exact same thing if something occurred <b>last night</b>.<br><br>According to some of the people who posted, it's unfair for me to make a thread about innocents who were massacred last night. In that case, give me a list of every terror attack that has ever occurred. I'll see to it that they all get a thread since people here are being critical when most of them haven't done anything like this, or indeed anything to do with the victims of terror attacks worldwide. If that's what you want to argue about, take it somewhere else. I'm not dealing with this on a thread dedicated to &nbsp;both the victims and the families that are only now receiving the news that just last night their loved ones were slaughtered by a potential extremist.

I did not say that at <b>any point. </b>Refer to my last post. If you want to talk about those other cases, make a thread about them. I would do the exact same thing if something occurred <b>last night</b>.<br><br>According to some of the people who posted, it's unfair for me to make a thread about innocents who were massacred last night. In that case, give me a list of every terror attack that has ever occurred. I'll see to it that they all get a thread since people here are being critical when most of them haven't done anything like this, or indeed anything to do with the victims of terror attacks worldwide. If that's what you want to argue about, take it somewhere else. I'm not dealing with this on a thread dedicated to &nbsp;both the victims and the families that are only now receiving the news that just last night their loved ones were slaughtered by a potential extremist.

I know you didn't say that, you're expressing your thoughts about what happened and I'm expressing mine. I can't express my opinion about it?<br><br>Edit: My opinions perhappened to be like Crimson's.

You're right Crimson and also, why didn't we focus on the attacks in Kenya? The man who tackled a suicide bomber so they wouldn't explode on other people....the war in Syria, innocent people dying.

Because it's no news that people in Syrya are dying.<br><br>@OP I hope Putin takes action for his ambassador and wipes Daesh outta the map.

The person who killed the ambassador was a Turkish special forces officer. The last thing we need is for Russia to retaliate.

The war in Syria has been going on for 5 years already, it's quite obvious that innocent people will be killed in the war. In the news, they just generalize it as a civil war that is taking place.

It's really just the media like Fox News, CNN, a lot of Internet articles, etc. that never mention things happening in third world countries. The only place I've actually seen people acknowledging the terrible things happening in Aleppo and the great heroes (the White Helmets) &nbsp;in Aleppo is Instagram, which is a little sad.

Very sad, very tragic, especially because Christmas was just around the corner, I feel so bad for the families that have lost their loved ones and have to go through Christmas without them, what a shame.
