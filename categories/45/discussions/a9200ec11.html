A few people have made threads that thank certain people for all that they've done. Example being Jozz's Christmas thread, and Refuse's thank you thread. Lately all I've done is act pessimistic, and that's no fun. The truth is, my mind acts weirdly. I'm constantly happy, then upset because I see a little flaw in someone or something, and go out of my way to fix it. It's silly, I don't know why I do it. I can't stop myself from doing it. I've affected a few people negatively from it, and I'm sorry. I really am.<br><br>Honestly, and truly, 100% honest here,&nbsp;without you guys, I don't even know what I'd be doing in life at the moment. I was dealing with some rude people on other servers, along with IRL people, and I (literally) fled to MC Zone. I met a lot of nice people, and some of my friends came here as well, and stayed. An example being Poppy (DoctaPop/Poptyler945). He was one of my first Minecraft friends, and we still chat a bit to this day. He's fabulous, love him. x3 Anyway,&nbsp;once Avicus came out, and I was promoted to JrMod + Mod, I was the happiest person in the world. After dealing with the issues with those other people, I tried really hard to please people with my work. It worked. I was constantly getting praise for the things I did, and it was great. I enjoyed it. Then some things happened.<br><br>Commands broke, I got worn out, and people started being rude to me again. I left.. Bad idea. I went to OCN for a while, had a bit of fun. No complaints there! Then I went to another server. I stayed there for 5 months, and had a miserable time. I even wasted $10 on it! I left that server, and cleared out some.. things, involving that server. I came back here, and got JrMod again. I was happy again.<br><br>I've learned now, you guys really make me happy. I don't know if it's nostalgia, or the amount of praise I get, but something about Avicus makes me happy. I wish I didn't leave before, but oh well. Although things still happen, I know I have people to talk to.&nbsp;Really, it's you guys that keep me going. I still remember a few weeks ago. I was having some issues, and a few people messaged me about the. Although I wasn't too comfortable getting into detail about it, just knowing that you would help me made me happy.<br><br>Yes, I have constant issues. I don't talk to people about them (other than Para bb o3o), but I know I have people to talk to. I have you guys to talk to. I can't thank you enough. And sure, I have OCN, and I love OCN. I also love you guys! I don't really have a lot of people to thank individually, but the few that I can thank know who they are. You guys are especially great &lt;3<br><br>This may stay up, this may not. Maybe it's spam, maybe it isn't. I'm not worried. Just know, I may not show it, but I do care about the server. Both servers. I may not be extremely well known, due to me never being in TS, being a little.. weird at times, but I try as best as I can to be somewhat active on both servers. I may not stay on both servers forever, but I'll stay as long as my mind allows me to. :P

Thought I'd say, I mainly made this because I also made a post in Jozz's thread, basically saying these same things. I've also been contemplating whether of not I want to continue playing Avicus. I've chosen to stay for now, but school will start up again shortly, and it'll be hard with 2 MC networks to moderate. I don't know if I can do it.&nbsp;<br><br>Something to think about I guess. :P But yea, thought I would say all this just in case that happened.<br><br>EDIT: &lt;3333 The support is nice o3o

&lt;3<br><br>Since I've come to a final conclusion to not leave for a while (regardless of whether or not school is a pain for me), I've taken on a couple projects. One is private, and kind of small, but will still benefit Avicus, and the other is a little more public. The former will be finished within the next few days, and the latter will take a month or two.&nbsp;<br><br>Hype!<br>(And thanks for the support, it's pushed me to come to this conclusion)
