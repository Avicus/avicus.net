Hello Everyone!..<br><br>I would just like to tell everyone that I am leaving Avicus/McZone (Just to be clear Avicus, not MineCraft)... After about 2 years of game play, I am officially leaving. I am mostly leaving because of the intense lagg that I am receiving and it is not my internet or MineCraft 1.8.3 ... The new update has put me off due to the fact that everyone looses there prestige rank and I have been unhappy lately and I am finally over it and overwhelm by it. My decision was greatly based on the new update right when school holidays start here in Aussie and the loss of my prestige &nbsp;(even 1st prestige put me off) . I have met and enjoyed participating with other players and like to thank everyone for the wonderful years. Avicus has enabled me to absorb all of other player's experience and I have evolved from it thanks to Avicus. Now when I play SkyWars it's really is easy.&nbsp;<br><br>There are enormous amount of skilled and advanced players out there so me leaving won't affect anything but I hope everyone can enjoy Avicus just like I have.<br><br>I might be re-join if I see changes.

Leaving just because you lost your prestige rank? You do realise you can buy them again with different types of stars/badges and customize their colors for 10k-100k credits?

Not all of us bought our ranks. (I was given Gold as a gift and Emerald I won)<br><br>Anyways, you can just buy it back Platinum .-. I have a feeling you're gonna be back in around 3 days

You relise that have a rank doesn't make us better, right? All it does is give us a few perks. And with the removal of /surface and some other commands a rank was almost useless, they had to find something to make up for it.

Ye they really need to do something about the ranks :p I feel as if my rank provides little benefits compared to what I paid, at least we have ours for our lifetime :)
