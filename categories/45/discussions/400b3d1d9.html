Hey everyone! Recently, I just thought of a new gamemode Avicus could possibly create in the future. It is called Elimination DTM.&nbsp;<br><br>The idea is simple: Basically, there are 3 teams or more and each team will have a monument and the idea is to destroy it like normal. Once your team monument is destroyed, you are out and cannot rejoin until the match is over.&nbsp;<br><br>So really, it is similar to the Mute Cities (4 team DTMs) in the sense that one team will be victorious, however it could make the players more competitive as if your eliminated, your out for the rest of that particular game.<br><br>Now I am not an expert around the gamemode plugins, XML, YML and etc, but if this gamemode would be possible to implement onto the server, I would be more than happy to help.<br><br>Let me know what you guys think!&nbsp;<br>If you still think  my thread lacks details on how it will be played, let me know and ill edit accordingly.

I'm not 100% sure but this may be possible in Atlas.

It is very similar to Annihilation on SB server. There you you can respawn while your Nexus isn't broken. Last team alive wins.

There is already an elimination module in the XML...<br><br>With the "Checks" system being as reminiscent to OCN's "Filters" system, we could possibly activate the elimination module after an objective is destroyed.<br><br>It's gimmicky... and I don't know whether this will work (Or crash the server, lol) but it's worth a try ;)

Appreicate it to those who replied! If it &nbsp;is possible, that's great to hear! If not, maybe someday, it'll happen. xD

It's very similiar to Egg Wars, SB Anhiliation and stuff and im not sure if it is going to be very fun if not many ppl could be in the game... And as we all know the server has pretty much active players but mostly there is like max 40 players on. Good luck! &lt;3

How about once your team's monument is destroyed, you cannot respawn, but you can still try to destroy the other team's monuments. Once you die however, then you are force joined to one of the other remaining teams until one team becomes victor. Just to allow players to keep on playing instead of waiting.
