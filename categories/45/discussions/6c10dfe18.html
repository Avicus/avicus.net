I am sure most of the older Minecrafter's have noticed that Avicus' player count dropped, due to their time on the server. This is half-sad to me because this was one of my favorite servers back when I used to play. Problem? I&nbsp;think&nbsp;so.&nbsp;There are so many problems that I see straight off the bat.&nbsp;So for this topic,&nbsp;I am just going to rant some issues and hope that the staff tries to fix them.<br><br><ul><li><b><i>THE LOBBY: </i></b><i></i>I was a mod at the time when the current lobby was being done by the staff. Secret rooms were being made, and unmade, signs were getting fine-touched, and people would just come on to admire it. It is, doubtless, very impressive. Huge, detailed, and... huge. My screen couldn't even render the signs from the middle or the top of the lobby. No one wants that. I think that a smaller lobby, perhaps the size of the original Avicus one, would be more welcomed.</li></ul><br><ul><li><i><b>TRY-HARD MODS: </b></i>This is just my opinion and all, but I think you guys are really not caring who becomes a mod. Like look at the Staff Apps. Skype is not a requirement? Really? That is honestly just ridiculous. How can y'all contact each other effectively and constantly? The staff team needs to be able to be in contact for issues and for staff meetings and shizzle. And, from what I can tell, some of these mods are incredibly strict... Like they have a trigger finger to just get someone kicked at the slightest offence. That ain't cool... Like they say one bad word and instantly get warned or kicked. People have their moments. (Pls bringk bak Mr Nice Guy)</li></ul><i><b><br></b></i><i><b><br></b></i><ul><li><i><b>NOT ENOUGH ADVERTISING: </b></i>I don't see Avicus on any of the major server websites... They may be there but no one votes for them. Simply, just bring back the McZone system... Person with&nbsp;most votes&nbsp;on all&nbsp;websites for that month&nbsp;gets diamond rank, second highest gets emerald, third highest gets gold. I enjoyed that and it definitely made me vote.</li></ul><br><br><ul><li><b><i>MAP QUALITY</i>: </b>Yeah... The map quality is not too great. All the pretty maps get accepted. Sadly, the gameplay ain't too great on them. We should raise the standards and criteria for the maps. I have seen a few good ones get denied. The people who made them were not well known by anyone. I have also seen many crap ones get accepted. The people who made those are considered really great builders.</li></ul><b><br></b><b><br></b><span><b></b><b></b></span>

Skype should not become a requirement, you know, there is an easy way how to find out ip's using a little skype bug. That's why some players don't write their skypename on their profile and I give again, a big, fat +1

We actually have a different way of communicating now, and it is much more efficient than skype and much more easily organized. <br><br>We are getting a new lobby with the Omega update, I've seen it and it looks great! <br><br>The map devs take a lot of time to make sure that gameplay will be good on maps and they are now trying harder than ever to get ready for the new gamemodes.

Yea, I really have seen the player count diminish, but hopefully the count raises with the Omega update. I also agree with your point about advertising. I remember the reason I went from an emerald rank to a diamond one was because of the voting. I think that we should add it back to give people a reason to vote, and hopefully attract more people. About the moderators, I feel that we are all trying to go by the same guidelines and hopefully we will be able to please the community. About the map quality, I agree with you somewhat. Some are blatantly getting accepted for the aesthetics, and we are losing maps with good gameplay such as some of the older maps. But in this, I agree with Rile and how hard the Map Developers are trying their hardest. I hope that the entire server's hard work pays off in the Omega update. :)

Agreed. Just one thing about advertising.<br><br>I personally would like Avicus to be advertised in a appropriate manner, I've seen other players go to other servers advertising our server in a disrespectful way, and truthfully, I would like it if that wasn't so. We don't need a reputation as a server that tries too hard to earn players. Just a small word.

People can make a skype in literally 5 seconds. I have like 9 Skype accounts because it's so easy. If people can't create Skype because "my parents won't let me", then what makes you think you can moderate a server? And Skype is a better way of communicating in general. I'm not talking solely about other moderators. I'm talking about players who need help. Skype has saved this community's ass at least 100 times because it's so easy to get a hold of moderators.

No my friends I'm just saying that we use a different form of communication other than skype. The reason that skype isn't a requirement is because we use a different form of communication and that is the way that staff can efficiently talk to each other. Yes it is easy to get a hold of mods on skype because as you stated it is really easy to get a hold of them, and that is why 95% of all of the staff still have a skype. Almost all of us have one, but we do use another form of communication so that we can be more organized. Thanks for the understanding :]

Skype should be a requirement. Yes, you use Slack. But here's a few things I'd like to point out.<br><br>1. You have the ability to make voice or video calls if needed.<br><br>2. Group chats can be created if any issues arise between multiple members of the staff team, or the Community.<br><br>3. How do you expect players to contact you if, let's say; a player is harassing them, or a player is DDoS threatening, etc. Skype needs to be a requirement. Without it there's almost no way for players to Communicate with the staff, unless through the server itself.<br><br>Just a few pointers.

If we give away 3 ranks each month at some point everyone will end up getting a diamond rank. And what if there is a tie for first? Its really easy to do. Just vote every day. That is a big problem.<br><b><i><br></i></b><i>"</i><b><i>MAP QUALITY:&nbsp;</i></b><i>Yeah... The map quality is not too great. All the pretty maps get accepted. Sadly, the gameplay ain't too great on them. We should raise the standards and criteria for the maps. I have seen a few good ones get denied. The people who made them were not well known by anyone. I have also seen many crap ones get accepted. The people who made those are considered really great builders."<br></i>I disagree, the maps look really nice and have good pvp. Yes there are a few maps I hate due to bow spamming and kill farming (ahem, Quintus) but many people enjoy more than hate it, hence it would stay. And there is a giant process for maps to getting accepted or denied. After a map becomes accepted it is not "fully accepted" to the rots until it is tested. Take my map for example.&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://avicus.net/forums/07ed460a2">http://avicus.net/forums/07ed460a2</a>&nbsp;It was accepted, but never put in the rots. Found out a few months later it was denied due to being too buggy through testing. Even if it was told accepted on the post it can always be denied after because it could be bad in action. Accepted on thread = Accepted due to looking amazing and looking like good pvp. Accepted through skype (Or silently) second time = Accepted due to looking good in game and having good pvp. So this would go out of context too.<br>&nbsp;<br>All the stuff you are bringing out is from what we have now. Check out the Avicus Facebook and look at the sneak peaks.

Skype should be a requirement. Yes, you use Slack. But here's a few things I'd like to point out.<br><br>1. You have the ability to make voice or video calls if needed.<br><br>2. Group chats can be created if any issues arise between multiple members of the staff team, or the Community.<br><br>3. How do you expect players to contact you if, let's say; a player is harassing them, or a player is DDoS threatening, etc. Skype needs to be a requirement.

<i>"</i><span><i>1. You have the ability to make voice or video calls if needed."<br></i>Which is why we have teamspeak, all of our meetings are on teamspeak, it's a requirement.<br></span><i>"2. Group chats can be created if any issues arise between multiple members of the staff team, or the Community."<br></i><i></i>Admins have the ability to make private &amp; public chats and we can always PM if needed. For the community we have teamspeak help rooms (forgot what it's called xD), and a Sr Mod would come soon and help ya out there. You can always type in there too, so no need of voice chat if you can't talk.<br><i>"3.

<i>There is a new and much better lobby in the Omega Update with secret rooms still. Our current lobby is temporary.

So this is out of context too (But the trigger finger part is your opinion but still out of context in my brain :D)<br></i><br>Slack is useful, but if Skype isn't a requirement, people who don't have it wouldn't feel the need to install it, leading to poor communication with players. Sure, the staff team&nbsp;can communicate efficiently with each other through Slack, but that doesn't do much when a player needs to contact a staff member. You might not realize this, but more infractions are given out than what you think. And no, staff don't always verbal warn first. I've seen it with my own eyes; players getting warned/kicked out of the blue, even if it's something only worth a verbal warning. I know I should contact a senior staff if I have problems with a staff member, but I'd rather post it here as well.<br><br><br><i>Advertising with the voting system is good, but not giving a rank.
