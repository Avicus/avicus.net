Ok... before I talk, I'll give u a little bit of understanding, I was in TS talking to ppl while playing avicus... and &nbsp;Cyclops and some mod were playing this Japaneese server, while I was playing Avicus I suddenly got bored, and asked them for the IP. Then they told me the IP and I was so curious how the Japaneese server looked like. But when I tried to join...I couldn't, and when I checked the reason................................<br><br><a href="http://imgur.com/a/J8OAC" rel="nofollow">http://imgur.com/a/J8OAC</a>

So, they ban you because you're region locked? Or what? A lot of products do that (region-locked) such as games and that's how imports on some products work. It's a block server with stuff you wouldn't understand anyway, if it concerns you use a VPN.
