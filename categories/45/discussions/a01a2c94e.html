So I was born June 15 2001.<br>I'm a boy and I love playing sports video games and hanging out with my friends.<br><br>The reason I'm making this post is because I have seen other people get bullied and the whole community helps them out.<br><br>So from grade 1-7 were the best years of my life but when I hit grade 8 (I'm in grade 9 now) I got bullied 24/7 every single day at school. So at first I was like meh its just a couple of people it doesn't matter that much.until about the end of the year this one guy and some of my friends told me to go kill myself because I was useless and that no one cared for me or loved me.. and that hurt a lot since then I have been thinking of suicide and I finnaly had the guts to tell someone about it and I know many of you might not care or anything but It doesn't matte. So yeah that's pretty much I'll I can say if you want to talk to me feel free to ask around or find my Skype.

Stay strong. If you ever need to talk, I'm here for you and I'll always listen to what you have to say. I've thought about it too, and tried it twice. You live for a reason. That reason may not be clear or visible at the moment, but one day you will find out what your purpose is. &lt;3

Sheep, How long have I been skyping you for? like 9 months. You would never kill yourself. You made me laugh so much fucking times and we had some of the best times together. There is no need for suicide because you are an amazing person. If people actually know you better (Like me) they would know you're not just &nbsp;a ban evading walls player. As others said Stay Strong. You aren't a useless! You taught me so much about walls; you showed me the diamonds when we skyped. You taught me so much about everything that I needed to know :D I truly will never forget the times we had together.

Man, I've been in the same spot as you and seen other people in the same spot as you. It's bad, but think ahead sometimes rather than in the now, in a few years time I doubt you'll see them again =) Ik it can feel useless at times but if you focus on the good things rather than the bad, things will cheer up pretty quick. Also gj for telling someone, I never had the guts to :P

The bullies are the weak ones, not you. They need to make themselves look powerful by making you look weak. Bullies want to get a reaction from you to feel accomplished.<br><br>Try this out, tell me what happens.<br><br>Say thank you to everything they say and look happy, they will stop bullying you.

No one is useless, don't forget that. Everyone is here for a reason, though you may not know it. I can't say I've had suicidal thoughts, but I've been in very bad places also. You just need to work through it and never forget that you're an amazing person.<br><br>We need people like you in the world. If you ever need to talk, Skype me. My Skype is FrozenSolstice.<br><br>@Noice: Then just say; "So, do the voices in my head bother you?"
