Quints lost it's glory...<br><br>I remember this map as one of the best maps in the game. Now every time I play that map it's me praying "Please don't spawn kill, please don't spawnkill-" OH look what everybody on the opposite team is doing. And no don't say "Oh it's not spawnkilling it's kill farming".<br><br>It's the same fucking thing, you are only doing it 5 blocks away.<br><br>Sure they can just build above or around it. But then some assholes think it's cool to block every path way around for us to have the hardest time to leave.&nbsp;<br><br>Remember the monuments, of course you don't no one goes for them anymore on that map. Like, I can't stand that map anymore. This is probably the most fun maps on the server but no one plays it for the actual objective anymore. Sure there are a lot of other maps that have more diamond, but it's just that the map is so confined and "small" (not really that small but for comparing how many diamonds per area it's a lot)<br><br>It's annoying. Can we do something about this.

Agreed. However, what some people don't realize is the amount of paths you can take to leave your spawn. Most people just get killfarmed and either rage, or leave.

I was actually going to make a giant thread (and you know me, when I say giant, I'm serious) debating this. I 100% agree, it's just a major loophole to the spawn camping rule.

I agree with you 100%.<br>This would literally happen every game, and it's very annoying. Either let one team spawn with some time for "spawn protection", or reduce the amount of diamond armour in the chests.

Nonono. Don't change a classic imo. Just maybe change spawn rules and boundaries. How far away people can farm from the spawn.

Big comment so bear with me<br><br><br>Agreed. This is why i dont even bother to play Qunitus anymore but im glad its being fixed im tired of getting killed in spawn and im also tired of the people who is saying&nbsp;<br><br>"oh there couple ways out you know" or " deal with it" or "rpeort the spawn killers"<br><br>i have had enough of that bougus. In case you havent noticed people, this map NEEDS TO BE CHANGED. Sure there are couple ways out like you can bridge to the side but they can just shoot you off and some players are NEW to the server and we are leaving a bad impression if all we do in Qunintus is spawn kill. Also, how are we supposed to report the spawn killers eyy? I mean you can record and that will help but lets be honest, who records spawnkilllers these days?!?! Like some people cant even record on their computers either due to bad specs or they dont even bother or take the time to. Mods do their best to get rid of these spawnkillers and i apperciate that. its not the mods fault.

There are old maps in OCN that i dont want being changed. However, this change is necassary because it just kills the fun for people.<br><br>I also do not like the people who just spawn kill and /or kill farm and COMPLETELY ignoring the objective.

Agreed and even if you report the kill farmers the mods won't do anything because it's technically not spawn killing.

I stopped playing Quintus just because of this and the diamonds, something that really annoyed me though was the fact that staff always kept a set or two extra in their inventory. I will not namedrop anyone. If only staff and/or their friends should be able to use the diamonds, then make the map staff-only.

Uhh, when the other team are just spawn camping you, at least 3/4 of the team are on your side. Just rush &nbsp;out of spawn (Don't go straight, you'll definitely die.) go left, and then bridge as fast as possible and then go to their side. Because everyone is kill farming, there are little to no defenders, and you can get the monuments soooooo easily.

Understandable it should be fixed. Personally I have kill-farmed alot on quintus, but how fix it? Its like team stack. You can stop it apart from getting a bad reputation towards the Avicus community. And if you are being kill-farmed do something! Take advantage of most of the opposing teams players being on your side. I honestly don't understand why people whine and cry about kill-farm when there is a clear path to ending it.

Thank you for this thread! It was definitely needed. The problem is as well as the spawnkilling (according to the winning team, its called killfarming. ????), some staff do it and staff don't listen to people like me, and they think I'm just a sore loser. As well, the teams become overly one-sided, all the donors will go to the better team, so its like 30-20 in the end. I loved Quintus, in fact it was my favourite map. Now its one of my least. Some improvements should be:<br><br>- Diamond Swords &amp; Bottle O' Enchanting instead of diamonds.<br>- Make a direct route to iron, maybe a no-kill thing? Don't know hoe that would work.<br><br>Please improve Quintus! It has great potential, but right now it is terrible.
