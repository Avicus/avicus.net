I was on a cruise, earlier this year (it was going too New Caledonia)<br>It got extremely hot, and I didn't put sunscreen on....<br><br>I turned into a red raw tomato. It was the worst cruise experience.

Went to Cuba (in real life I am pale white) so when I arrived in Cuba the first full day I got so burnt I could bearly sleep since I could feel the heat IN my arms, got better 4 days later, I had to wear long sleeve shirts or else my arms would get more heat in it and it would be burning and I would have to blow my arms every 10 seconds

I'm Thai. I grew up on the red hot beach all day, every day. Which is why I'm extremely tan.
I've never had a sunburn in my entire life. What does it feel like?
