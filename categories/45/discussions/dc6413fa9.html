Hello Avicus! :) Not too long ago I got a new intro for my YouTube channel and I'm just looking for a few opinions on it! Constructive criticism is allowed, but please no hate :) All comments are appreciated.<br><br>Link -&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vuD9JFVnuk&amp;list=UUiGZgsyBcAhaRGgESpF6Fsw&amp;index=3">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vuD9JFVnuk&amp;list=UUiGZgsyBcAhaRGgESpF6Fsw&amp;index=3</a>

Stop begging for subscribers and leeching for attention everywhere. You don't even play Avicus anymore and you post tons of videos about your channel and do challenges that are annoying and that harm you for no reason. You constantly ask for subscribers, even over skype and if I like your videos, I'll subscribe. You don't need to beg like 30000 other youtubers and send mass skype messages telling me to just "ignore" it. For actual feedback, Minecraft is overdone and anything related to that will not go far anymore. Regarding giveaways, those are purely to get people to subscribe to you in the hopes they'll win something.

Like para said... First of why do you want to become pewdiepie? The 500+ subs you have, 90% you earned (Actually got with no effort barely) To give giveaways... And only 1 person can win it... If you do post on the avicus forums, I suggest you do ACTUAL avicus videos... Seriously this is just a complete mess... My words cant even describe it...&nbsp;<br>Like para said.... Just dont get attention from OUR forums for something not avicus related...

Guys I'm just doing YouTube because it makes me happy :/ I'm not doing it to gain subscribers, of course it is nice to gain subscribers because they are the people that watch my videos but I think Avicus is a good server, and I don't "spam" My channel out on Skype, I occasionally (Once a month maybe) Post a video that 90% Of My Skype contacts will enjoy. I really do want to start an Avicus series back up, but it's hard when the support I get from certain staff members is absolutely disguising. Most of you guys are amazing but there are certain people that are really making me not want to do an Avicus series. Btw, The reason I only have about 10 videos and 500+ Subscribers is because I recently restarted my channel :)

It isn't about why or how much you enjoy doing YT, it's about your attitude, and how attention seeking you are.

I'm really if I offended you, I didn't intentionally mean to. But I kind of think you are wrong when you said "It isn't about why or how much you enjoy doing YT" Well... Because it does matter. Everything matters in life, even all the small things and sometimes you just need to accept that the small things matter :) You just need to enjoy life, and do the things you enjoy doing and you need to accept for me... well it's doing YouTube :D

It isn't the fact that you want to "do youtube" and "enjoy the server", it's the fact that you write posts about your channel <i>ON</i> Avicus even though it has <i>NO</i> Avicus related videos. As I understand it you don't want to promote Avicus because of "certain people", not the fact that your attention seeking attitude is the main reason.

I understand what everyone is saying, and I respect and accept it. But I can't see what is wrong with my attitude? I have a very open mind, and I'm generally a chilled out person and I hate fighting or flame wars. I'm just trying to do what I enjoy doing, and have fun getting a little more involved with the Avicus community. I understand I'm not everyone's ideal piece of cake but I certainly try to just make friends with as many people as I can, and just have a good time with whatever I do.

You can still enjoy YT without 80% of your posts being about you, your channel, your videos, and everything else about you, and your attempts for attention, like painful challenges that are a pain to watch

They are also great fun to do! And I don't know why you can't respect my opinion, just like I'm respecting yours. And I can say this over, and over, and over, and over, and over again that I am not "Spamming", I am not "Asking for attention" I am not, "Asking for Subscribers" Or anything else along those lines. It is called being INTERACTIVE with people.
