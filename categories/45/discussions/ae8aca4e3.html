Hey guys... So, I thought this was needed.<br><br>Over the past few weeks, I've been an ass to a few people on Avicus; this stems from my recently denied application to become a member of the staff team and therefore most of my angered temper was directed towards the staff team. I took my denied application a bit too much to heart and this therefore led to my attitude. I wanted to say that I'm very sorry to the staff team for my recent behaviour.<br><br>All others I might have had a negative attitude towards either on the forums, in-game or on teamspeak I am once again sorry.<br><br>I, personally, felt that this was needed but if a staff ember decides to lock it it's fine. Again, I'm sorry to anyone I might have been rude to and I will do the best to be a good upholder of the media rank and I am really looking forward to the upcoming official tournament.<br><br><br>Thanks for reading &lt;3
