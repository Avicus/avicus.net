Hey Hey!<br><br>Me and Sunrise just prestiged, I'm still stuck with 9th. However, Sunrise has accomplished his goal on being the first person to get prestige 15 on Nebula.<br><br><b>Congratulations!</b><br><br>-<a rel="nofollow" href="http://prntscr.com/5eitn7">http://prntscr.com/5eitn7</a>(Prestige Messages)<br>-<span><a rel="nofollow" href="http://prntscr.com/5eiwsp">http://prntscr.com/5eiwsp</a>&nbsp;(Prestige 15 color and shape)<br><br><br></span>

No offence Pizza. However, first prestige on Avicade isn't that big of an accomplishment, since 5-6 people already have it. However, prestige 15 is a unique accomplishment, and since Sunrise is the first person to reach this, he does indeed deserve a post for all his hard work.

It's my opinion and I don't have to know him IRL to know he plays a lot..<br>I don't wanna get warned or anything else, just wanted to know if everyone agreed too.. maybe that could help him to do some other stuff apart from playing computer and I don't know why it's offensive, if he wants to play MC, then he shouldn't be offended because it's a thing he likes doing and if he likes playing it then he wouldn't care.<br><br>I don't know what's your point.

Devoid of any bad intentions, I'm rolling with Juano and his bandwagon... naively allotting that much energy and devotion to a Minecraft server&nbsp;— not to mention the inhumane number of hours spent playing&nbsp;— is unhealthy, to say the least. Unless you were absolutely certain that wasting all day on a trivial video game was the most beneficial thing you could do with your time and resources, I wouldn't recommend even considering it.&nbsp;Of course, I'm all for liberation, so do whatever makes you happy; I can't force any of my beliefs onto you, but I can surely give you my best advice.<br><br>That's also what Juano was doing before Peachy censured him: it's an irrefutable fact that someone who manages to reach fifteenth prestige in one month is dedicating too much time to their endeavor. People deserve freedom, sure, but a friendly suggestion to slow down won't hurt. In fact, I've lost countless friends who've festered into worthless degenerates because no one told them that doing drugs was deleterious to their health. Similarly, it's wrong to admonish someone for exercising their rights and offering a passive opinion on how long someone gazes at a computer monitor.<br><br>TL;DR: I also think Sunrise is spending way too much time playing on the server and should consider toning down a bit. Because of the context, I don't think Peachy should encourage people to continue wasting their time on something this meaningless.<br><br>On a more positive note... congratulations, you two! Seeing a different prestige symbol by Sunrise's name every encounter was always pretty amusing; too bad that won't be the case anymore...

Devoid of any bad intentions, I'm rolling with Juano and his bandwagon... naively allotting that much energy and devotion to a Minecraft server&nbsp;— not to mention the inhumane number of hours spent playing&nbsp;— is unhealthy, to say the least. Unless you were absolutely certain that wasting all day on a trivial video game was the most beneficial thing you could do with your time and resources, I wouldn't recommend even considering it.&nbsp;Of course, I'm all for liberation, so do whatever makes you happy; I can't force any of my beliefs onto you, but I can surely give you my best advice.<br><br>That's also what Juano was doing before Peachy censured him: it's an irrefutable fact that someone who manages to reach fifteenth prestige in one month is dedicating too much time to their endeavor. People deserve freedom, sure, but a friendly suggestion to slow down won't hurt. In fact, I've lost countless friends who've festered into worthless degenerates because no one told them that doing drugs was deleterious to their health. Similarly, it's wrong to admonish someone for exercising their rights and offering a passive opinion on how long someone gazes at a computer monitor.<br><br>TL;DR: I also think Sunrise is spending way too much time playing on the server and should consider toning down a bit. Because of the context, I don't think Peachy should encourage people to continue wasting their time on something this meaningless.<br><br>On a more positive note... congratulations, you two! Seeing a different prestige symbol by Sunrise's name every encounter was always pretty amusing; too bad that won't be the case anymore...

That is why I don't play Minecraft anymore when I played it that much everyday it made me miss out on lots of moments with my family and friends. I realized quitting for a few days that there was so much more to life then video games. So not to be rude but Sunrise it might help if you take a week break before try to get 15th in Nexus...

Guys stop complaining about Sunny's life or discussing in this thread and let's see the good side, tell him Gratz because I know play much hour is unhealthy but don't be like this. He'll do what he feel that he should do, stop playing so much hours or simply continue as well now and finish his life without and IRL friend. But, who we are for judge him? You don't know him, what he does or what he wants. He didn't say anything about this because he maybe doesn't want people saying it and doesn't feel happy reading what you are saying, guys. See the good side on this, be optimistic.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Congratulations Sunny! Well deserved! </b>:D

No offence Pizza. However, first prestige on Avicade isn't that big of an accomplishment, since 5-6 people already have it. However, prestige 15 is a unique accomplishment, and since Sunrise is the first person to reach this, he does indeed deserve a post for all his hard work.

Knowing his IRL situation counts as knowing him IRL.<br>And as you said, the&nbsp;<b>majority</b> of the comments go into a congratulatory section but, where's the rest of the comments?<br>And.. if he has a lot of spare time in the day.. he should divide it into the PC, study and going outside, because if playing PC is.the only thing he does, then his life is not going anywhere to be direct, still not trying to be rude dude.
