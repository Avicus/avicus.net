<b></b>Hello! I realize I'm a bad pvper, but I decided to make this anyways. Recently, I've been seeing lot's of people asking how to get such knockback. This is a topic that will list numerous strategies that will tell you how :D (<b>Please comment some strategies you use!)<br><br></b><b>The AD Strategy</b><br><b></b>This strategy can give you just enough KB if used correctly. This is also very simple. You click as fast as you can while quickly tapping A and D. If the timing is correct, you will be able to get your opponent into a good combo.<br><br><b>The Sprint Reset Strategy&nbsp;<br></b>This strategy gives you a great amount of KB. It's literally what it's called. You sprint and hit someone, then stop sprinting then sprint again, and so on.&nbsp;After you get your opponent into a 1-2 hit combo, if you start crouching fairly quickly, you'll reset your sprint multiple times, allowing you to get some awesome knockback.<br><br><b>The Hybrid Blockhit Strategy<br></b><b></b>This is a really powerful strategy. In this one, you hit someone normally 2x then do a quick blockhit. This strategy can give a great amount of KB and make a great combo, too.<b><br></b><br><b>The Head Twitch Strategy<br></b>In this strategy, you must only do it if you're aim is good. If your aim isn't good enough, you'll miss wildly. What you have to do do is swiftly twitch your head to send you opponent flying through the air.<br><br><br><br><b></b>

Oh, for the Sprint Reset strategy, after you get your opponent into a 1-2 hit combo, if you start crouching fairly quickly, you'll reset your sprint multiple times, allowing you to get some awesome knockback :3<br>Just a tip ;D<br><br>Also, another good strategy is to <b>stun them</b>. You can do this with the known fishing rod stun, but since I can be quite sloppy with my scrolling and particular with how items are arranged in my hotbar, I don't like using it, and, thankfully for me, there isn't much string on most Avicus maps, so not many people can use it against me.&nbsp;<br>So, what I like to do is to use my bow. If someone's charging for you, aim upwards, pull back a small amount (kind of like bow spamming), and release, hitting your target. Then, if timed correctly, while they're still in air, you can hit them from either sprinting forwards and block-hitting or sprinting to their sides and hitting them there.&nbsp;<br>Keep in mind that players receive more knockback if they're not on the ground :3

He admitted to clienting, but that would be about the proper rate you blockhit and hit at. You blockhit for the&nbsp;hit that registers, the normal hits are just to help with timing.

I guess I'll just paste a tutorial thingy I made a while ago :P-<br><br>Knockback-<br>Knockback is a really wacky thing in Minecraft. People have found ways to sort of control knockback. Basically, in Minecraft there is a thing called sprint knockback. Sprint knockback is where you deal more knockback than just standing by sprinting toward your opponent. There is a glitch however. When the sprint key was released in 1.7 you are now able to hold it and you can keep sprinting even after you hit your enemy, but only the first hit is sprint knockbacked, the hits after your first hit will deal the same knockback as if you were just standing. People have found this glitch and found out that after you hit someone and reset your sprint you can enhance your knockback. There are a couple ways to increase knockback: W repressing, hybrid blocking, and hybrid sneaking, sprint key spam, and hybrid "s"ing. To do a W repress you have to quickly release and repress w after you hit your enemy. To do a hybrid block/sneak/s you quickly right click/shift/press s after you hit your enemy. To sprint key spam you, well, spam control (or you can time it by pressing it quickly once after each hit). I prefer using the w repress because you can make up a bunch of cool strafes with it.<br><br>Also, there seems to be another glitch. If you change your motion right when you are hit the knockback you receive will be decreased to almost no knockback given. I also found a couple ways to do this: You can press w and d to circle strafe and then press a right when you are hit (You can also press w and a and press d when you are hit). You can do a special zig-zag strafe where you start by pressing w and d and then when you are hit you let go of d and press a instead, then all you have to do is to repeat the pattern. You can switch from pressing w to pressing s when you are hit. And there is another cool trick that <a rel="nofollow" href="http://avicus.net/Stimulating">Stimulating</a> made, but he wanted to keep it a secret :P.<br><span><br>There is also a trick where you can enhance the knockback YOU take, its called S-Stepping. Its where you start critting your enemy (By holding the space bar) and then you press and hold the s key right when you get hit.	</span>

S-Stepping is good for refills, but isn't that great for anything else.

Well I find it nice to use when I got to eat food/golden apples or drink potions, run away when I'm low on health, get out of combos, debuff the enemy with potions, and make bow spamming last longer or something.<br>But yeah, its mostly for refilling in soup/pot pvp.

I didn't make the no-knockback trick, but Splade/Fastplace and I formed another version of it, where you take less kb, but it's more situational, which can be pretty useful.&nbsp;<br><br>Twitch your head upwards really quick and/or mash forward and blockhit like mad if you want to launch them. If your aim isn't good, don't twitch. <br><br>Anyone who's fought me on Kohi with normal ms knows about the launching :) <br><br>What you do is you sprint reset lightly to get a combo and then you uplift mid-combo, since you take more kb in the air in MC. Eventually they go really high into the air and get launched like over 5 blocks in the air and like 10 away xD.
