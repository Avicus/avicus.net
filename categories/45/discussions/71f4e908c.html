Kohi. That's all I need to say.<br><br>Watch people like Cayden!, StimpyPvP, Dualzz, PvPCD, etc. Those players play Kohi, and after watching how they do things you understand how it works. After understanding, just play nonstop on Kohi. This is only recommended if you get 70 fps and above. Kohi makes your game laggy af. If you get a lot of lag, go to Badlion and go to UHC FFA. People there are bad, but it will help your aim with a bow and arrow. Afterwards, go to ranked MCSG. That will give you better tactics to play with and you will be able to use a fishing rod easily. After that, Build UHC. This is basically where all the try hards are. Another good server like Avicus is OCN. People there are a lot better, and when I got temp banned for void logging for 7 days, I went there. When I came back, I was a lot better.<br><br>But at the end, it's all&nbsp;practice,&nbsp;practice,&nbsp;practice!

I have no idea where you got that idea from. You see, there's the MCSG PvP style, the Kohi PvP style, the UHC PvP style and the OCN/Avicus PvP style. At the end, the hardest but most &nbsp;effective style is Kohi. I'm just telling him this so he can learn the PvP style; aggressive, yet cautious. I never said for him to cheat.

That's not entirely true.<br>Even though Kohi might seem to be more on the competitive side, each of those pvp styles have different aspects of it that makes it special. If you look at MCSG or UHC where you have to be able to use many items efficiently compared to pot pvp, it might seem more complex and harder.

Yeah, that's why I recommended those types of PvP too.<br><br>But if you want to get good at PvP fast, Kohi is the way to go. We don't get much fishing rods or fns in Avicus :P. And I can say that from playing only Avicus, OCN, and Kohi, when I hopped on to Badlion and did some ranked MCSG I got rekt :P. Same thing for BuildUHC. I used to be so much better :P.

Yeah but he can easily learn how to w tap. Do you honestly think he's going to learn PvP on Avicus? Most people here are either a bowspammer, people that stay in teams and killsteal, campers, and defenders. Not many people which are randies actually know how to do something.

I'm sorry, circle strafing was his PvP style. He might have the client that gives him perfect aim, but his circling was on point. And to my knowledge, you can't have a client that strafes for you. I agree, he had a client that helped him aim, but there is no denying his circle strafe was amazing.

I'm sorry, circle strafing was his PvP style. He might have the client that gives him perfect aim, but his circling was on point. And to my knowledge, you can't have a client that strafes for you. I agree, he had a client that helped him aim, but there is no denying his circle strafe was amazing.

There's clients that can improve your strafe though, but circling really isn't that hard at all.

Tbh the way he does it is really good. It just proves if you have good aim and do that you can be a g0d

Never seen that before, but I'm sure that you could pay a private developer a few hundred for a client.
