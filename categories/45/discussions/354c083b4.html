I've been staying in the shadows for a long time away from you all. I just thought I should update on what's going on with my life. I barely played avicus in the past three months. Mainly because of lack of the server being "updated" but I can understand why, Ivy's an adult, and I'm probably one of the biggest man child's there are. I just can't see myself being more mature than I am right now.<br><br>Anyway, my graphics card broke because of my nephew breaking it. So I'll be getting an R7 260x, slight upgrade, but same price so, yeah :I Guess I should be happy about this but that's like two weeks of reduced performance. I was praying to god that it was the RAM because it was easy to replace but nope.<br><br>As for school, nothing special. Just continuing it.<br><br>For my video's, when I do I move to an apartment with my parents, we'll be getting better internet, so I might be playing on Avicus, if it's still not laggy by then. And not to mention, FACE CAM ON NEBULA VIDEOS :D Getting it from Bing rewards or what ever. (The Webcam)<br><br>So yeah. :3
