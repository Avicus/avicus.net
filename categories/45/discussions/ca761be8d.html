One team leader must participate in the song and if need be they can do it solo however it would be more entertaining if the entire team took part.&nbsp;<br><br>Ok the song has been decided!

Dude how is it aggressive? I'm not demanding any teams i am just trying to keep spam of my thread stop the trend of suggesting songs even though i have said, on numerous occasions the song has been chosen. &nbsp;You seem to miss the point that this is just a bit of fun between me and some other team leaders.
