As many of you have either already noticed or not cared, I have become extremely inactive. This post isn't to justify my absence but rather to tell you I'm leaving, and as the title states, for good. Avicus as a whole helped me through some pretty rough parts of life, and I'd like to thank no one in particular because it was the community's warmth, the fun I had on TeamSpeak and in-game, the staff that allowed me to take some responsibility for one of the first times in my life, and the bonds I've formed with many of the members here that pulled me from a dark time. From the bottom of my heart I would also like to apologize to those I've wronged, even though some people deserve a lot more seeing as I've done things that I'm not proud of. I will not come back, so goodbye.
