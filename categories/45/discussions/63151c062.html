So as the topic says on the top, this is being ridiculous. This kit, pyro is getting too much nerves on me. This kit is too much OP, and it is only fair for those donors. I think you should change that iron axe to wooden sword or stone sword, and put the fire aspect on it, not the iron axe. That is too much OP in my case when i want to to play Nexus, and it gets irritated. So what do you guys think about this absolute-OP kit?<br>I hope this case can be solved, and the fun playing on nexus would continue.<br>Thanks, <br>Steven

Well, they base the kits off of Team Fortress, so they took Pyro's axe and added fire aspect (why they call it Pyro). I really don't care right now about Pyro anyways, since it'll be equal for all when the EULA comes effective so I can't complain if it'll be equal for all in a few weeks.

Extremely op. I personally think it's more op than barbarian. Give it leather armor and it'll be good.
