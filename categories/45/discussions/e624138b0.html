<b>Fortissimus was the exact team I wanted it to be; I take responsibility for what it was at any given time.</b> I would like to thank everyone who made it possible and even those who hated it, as yall made it even more fun. Fort was a different kind of team as everyone who scrimmed them knew. We had fun in our scrims rather than focusing on winning. The decision to disband the team was one that I have been thinking about lately. It comes due to my inability to run the team the way it deserves to be ran, lack of faith in the avicus officials team and a general sense of boredom when it comes to: avicus, minecraft, or even gaming for certain members.<br><br><b>To current and former members of Fort:</b> I wish you all the best, each of you did something that made the team special and fun.<br><br>#PrayForFort

I wouldn't say that, Fort had more members than ever. I just dont have time to run it like I<br>&nbsp;want to with irl stuff going on. I hope a team like fort pops back up so people still have an alternative to the ultra competitive.

RIP D:<br>I really loved this team as it was very unique and not that focused on winning, just having a good time. Fort will be missed to all the casual users that are on the forums.
