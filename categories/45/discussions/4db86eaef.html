</h1>
<p>Hey everyone,</p><p>So some of you may be wondering why I do not have my moderating rank anymore, no I did not get demoted I decided to retire.</p><p>My decision to retire was thought about by me for a while and I came to the decision to retire for a number of reasons, most of which are to do with school. It is my last year in school (I am 16) and it is coming up to a really busy time so I would hardly be able to moderate and then from around Christmas to June I would be busy with revision for my final GCSE exams. This would result in extreme inactivity and a probably demotion so I thought that it was probably best to retire sooner rather than later. </p><p>I also retired because moderating was becoming extremely stressful along with juggling Controlled Assessments and revision, another aspect as to why I retired; In addition to this, it felt like it was right for me to make this decision and I just want to be a normal player for a while. </p><p>There are also other reasons that I would not like to disclose, however I will still be around for as long as I can; I will not be leaving just yet, sorry for those who are disappointed about that :P.</p><p>Lastly, I will hopefully be back to moderating around June, I may change my mind but for now that is what I, and others have thought about. </p><p>I will certainly miss moderating and RIP me joining full games/choosing a team xD</p><p>RIP in Resepignevs</p>

Gonna be honest here, I just don't think you were fit to be staff. I rarely saw you on and at times when you were, you did ignore players. I msged you once in-game, and you didn't reply. But anyways, good luck in life especially your exams I guess...
