Depends on what kinds of shows. For example, I enjoy watching The Big Bang Theory. I see no aspects of it that are brain washing. However, although we've all watched Spongebob when we were younger, watching it too much does affect the mind at some point. I don't watch that much TV since I mainly watch Anime online, with a bit of netflix and 1-2 shows that are actually on Television. Newer shows now are pretty bad in my opinion, and I find them a bit dumb/brain washing.

It really depends on the show and the opinion/perspective of the person watching it. People will think of what they watch probably differently then what someone else thinks of it. Some shows may be a brain wash, while other people might think it isn't.

All shows do that in some way. There has to be a moral from a story which almost all shows have. People say that they show no difference by watching a show but that is a lie<br><br>Take me for example. I wouldn't have said that Naruto has changed me a lot and in reason why should it, it is about ninjas fighting. I learned a lot of lessons from that show and I know I wouldn't be the same person today if I never watched that show.<br><br>Now take Media(Something I hate but love). Media brain washes people vastly which annoys me. Take the Micheal Brown case for example(Using it because more people know about that than our Canadian stories). The radio broadcaster kept saying the cop was wrong and tried to steer the information towards that side so people will agree with him.

Eh. It depends.<br>Research shows that your brain actually is doing more when it's <i>sleeping</i>, than when it's watching TV. So for one, it isn't really helping you in any way other than entertainment.<br>Also, kind of like what Blue said, it can cause conditions such as depersonalisation and depression, believe it or not.<br>The only reason I watch TV is to look at the News, so I know what's happening. But even THAT is over dramatised. Never anything happy on the News. They trick people into getting scared so they keep watching it. Therefore, their ratings go up.<br><br>This whole thing really depends on what kind of person you are.

"Staring blankly" at something would mean you were not paying attention to it, so logically you wouldn't be able to be "brain washed" if you brain was not consciously aware of what was happening. However I'm sure it would somewhat sublimely.<br><br>"Paying attention" to something would mean you were actually being affected consciously and thinking about what you are seeing, increasing the affects of whatever you are watching.<br><br>It's not just because people "watch it all day" or if its "something mindless" that you would be affected, its anything and everything you watch. Also its not a matter of how you watch it, its just watching it at all the matters, whether it be on TV, Netflix, or GooglePlay.

Yeah, that's what I was gonna say — lots of media nowadays has the potential to desensitize its audience's views on controversial issues. Desensitization is a type of influence, and arguably everything is influential in some way, so it's to be expected. It's just that television is one of the more explicit, pejorative conveyors of this now, like video games. The more violent video games you play and the more people you kill in them, the less contemplative and introspective about death you become, invariably; the same can be said about many televised shows and whatnot.<br><br>I'd delve deeper into this multi-faceted subject if it weren't almost dawn... there are a myriad of insightful viewpoints on this interesting topic...

I wrote an essay that was a lot about how media is just deceptive for the most part and tends to leave things out or add things to sway your views. Also all the negative images in media (Ex: Most Rap, we're getting high, getting laid, shooting guns and getting into gang battles. Ofc all rap isn't like this, but a lot is) affect us very negatively. If there were positive images in the media imagine how better off we'd be. Yes, I would agree for some shows.

Which studies? Evidence. Also this is the crux. It is up to the parents to protect from this sort of violent medium. This is why there are ratings on video game disks and when you are about to watch a movie. To prevent young children to be exposed to such a media influence.

Which studies? Evidence. Also this is the crux. It is up to the parents to protect from this sort of violent medium. This is why there are ratings on video game disks and when you are about to watch a movie. To prevent young children to be exposed to such a media influence.
</blockquote>
</div>
I'll address your second statement first. Yes, while there are rating on video game, movies, and TV shows, these "ratings" are not reinforced. I mean, I doubt there is anyone here that could say they have never watched or played something that was outside there age limit.<br><br>I searched the web and found some reputable sources showing how&nbsp;video game and TV violence can&nbsp;desensitize people:<br>-&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.public.iastate.edu/~nscentral/news/06/jul/desensitized.shtml">http://www.public.iastate.edu/~nscentral/news/06/jul/desensitized.shtml</a><br>-&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sitemaker.umich.edu/brad.bushman/files/ba09.pdf">www.sitemaker.umich.edu/brad.bushman/files/ba09.pdf</a><br><br>I couldn't find anymore reliable studies, but all of them agree on one thing, that exposure the video game and TV violence&nbsp;desensitizes the brain to real life violence.

You're soon lucky, I've always wanted to go to time square!!<br><br>but anyway, relating to the 'statement' this fellow has made, there are WAY to many angles to the question to just give a straight up answer...<br><br>Watching like 15 hours a day of whatever is surely bad physically and mentally for your brain and is just pure lazy,<br><br>BUT i watch around 1 - 2 hours a day or two (however i go on the computer more than the TV) and I'm absolutely fine, I'm not "Brain-washed" or anything, and I'm pretty sure nobody here watches more than 6 or tops 7 hours of TV a day..<br><br>So yeah, i think that guy must have religious beliefs or something, but whatever, everyones entitled to an opinion.
