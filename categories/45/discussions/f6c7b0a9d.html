Hey, I know I have made many of leaving post and that was because I kept coming back because stuff ended and other things.<br><br>I know most people here either A. Dont like me or B. Dont know who I am&nbsp;<br><br><br>Avicus changed me even though I am banned once I got banned I started to pick myself up and try to get my act back together and I made a post about Highschool and College help and I need to prioritize and not worry about video games.<br><br>There are to many people to thank but I will only thank the ones that were the closets.<br><br>Porky: You were my first real friend on avicus. I remember that gladiator video you made were you tryed to target me (couldn't because your bad &lt;3) and I will always remember you<br><br>Rilo: I know our friend ship has been on and off recently but you are a pretty decent kid you were like the brother I never had. I hope you can use all the skills I have given you to get better and become a better all around player<br><br>Vlad: I never missed a single one of your videos. Your a great guy and I love what you do helping the community i wish you the best of luck with your channel and were ever you end up.<br><br><br>Seth/Zerkk: we were never really close friends but I respected you as a person. I know you will do great as a MapDev and you just keep doing what your doing.<br><br>Poker Face: We never really talked except on Skype sometimes and I respect you so much and I never ever want you to change.<br><br>jracer: I love your maps and you never seem to disappoint. I really hope someday you will get MapDev you would be a great part of the team<br><br><br>Pat: Your such a good sport and walls player I know you always try to get better and are determined to get better.<br><br>Entire Staff Team: I would like to thank you guys for shaping me into the person I am today. If it wasn't for you I would probably still be some jerk that barley anyone liked. I hope we can put the past behind us.<br><br><br>So yeah guys I might pop on the forums for a bit maybe once a week I will most likely be active on Skype I will most likely come back around the start of summer and when I come back I will hopefully appeal. I'd just like to say thank you everyone for the great experiance and I love you all &lt;3

Sheep_Ship, I didn't know you all to much as well, but those small talks we had on Skype were definitely enjoyable. Good luck to you in the future and hopefully you can return to Avicus.

I am gonna put my full response :D My mini response was on my phone.<br><br>Dawson or whatever you wanna call yourself, You were an amazing friend. We had some REALLY amazing times and you nearly made me shit myself laughing sometimes. You made me come out of my ass in walls and look where I am now. I may of reported you 5 times or so for ban evading but thats the past. We can't anything about that now but you gotta admit that you were the fucking funniest person of my life. We had some horrible times together and some really good times but we all move on. I wish you the best luck in life and HOPEFULLY if you wait 10 months or so you could get unbanned. You truely Dawson, Are the best person in the world in my life. Are you quitting minecraft or just avicus? Because if just avicus we could still be friends over skype and other servers.

That one time I came to Rilo's TeamSpeak, you joined and Rilo's like 'Piss off, come back later', I knew you would instantly be a funny person. Good luck in life!
