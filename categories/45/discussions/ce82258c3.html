Installing a CPU fan

Hi so I got an Intel CPU fan but, it didn't come with the support bracket so I impovised by screwing nuts under the motherboard to the screws that are on the corners of the CPU. The nuts aren't touching the metal spikes on the bottom of the motherboard but, they touch those engraved black lines that go in all sorts of different directions. Will this fry the motherboard? Thanks in advance.<br><br>In other words, will metal that touches the circuit but not the metal spikes fry the motherboard?

It shouldn't, but if I was you, i'd have put a piece of rubber between the screw and the motherboard, just in case it does short circuit it.

That's good, if you ever come across some rubber rings you could use as insulation though, it won't hurt to add them :)<br><br>Otherwise, enjoy the PC :D

You don't want to gamble with your mobo... Are you sure the fan you got is compatible? Also, look on MaximumPC's website for some good guides. (Or look at their "Build It" issue of the magazine).

Well, then return it, and get one that has the mount. If a product is missing a component, then you should be able to exchange it for one that has all pieces for free.
