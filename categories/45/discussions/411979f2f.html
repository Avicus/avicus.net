So I'm at that weird point in life where high school is done but life is just around the corner.<br><br>After spending countless hours alone staring at a wall in my room trying to figure out what I'm going to do with myself, I did start to wonder what my mates on the Avicus Network were thinking about doing after they finish school.<br><br>So what do you think you're going to do once you've finished with education?

BUILD A 300$ PC IF IM STILL THE IDIOT I AM OF COURSE!!!<br><br>Snow, if I were you, I'd write everything that makes me happy down, and pick the one that gets you a job. All the other ones can be hobbies.<br><br><br>I'm going to tell you a story.<br><br>My dad and his brother were both born in Lebenon. My dad REALLY liked to do drums, and wanted to do it for a living. His dad told him "Son, that doesn't get food on your table". At the time, there was a serious civil war happening there and no one was safe. My grand parents finally decided they should go to a safe place. My oncle went to LA, but my dad wasn't able to, and just like that, my dad had to go to Vancouver. My dad was broke in the country's richest place. &nbsp;He was basically screwed. He had to live in an Asian family's basement. He got a job and got some money (the job was delivering pizzas) and went to the University of British Colombia. He did his education there, and wound up meeting my mom. They had my sister, and then me. They are now both pharmacists (ew). But, my dad continues to do the drums. What I'm saying is you can keep connections with what you love even in the toughest times. He became a pharmacist, and he loves his job, but still has time for hobbies.&nbsp;<br><br>I, honestly, don't know what I'm going to do when My life begins. But at the end, I am still a young teenager :P. But I know one thing. I want to continue building PCs, if I'm still into that in a couple of years.

Most people don't think about what they want to do in life until they hit some point in college... I have many friends who wanted to be Marine Biologists, Nurses, Crime Scene Investigators, etc. But now they're changing there minds and are just trying to get a degree they can easily obtain.<br>I honestly didn't know what I wanted to do, until my Sophmore year of college... Now I'm just taking a bunch of Graphic Design courses (Which I Love!!!) to be a Freelance Graphic Designer, and taking some other fun classes (Ceramics, Arts, Photography, etc) that may interest me in the future.<br>You'll figure something out, don't stress yourself out too much and enjoy every last minute of High School!
