It's been days since I've been on Avicus and actually talked to you guys. My profile may say "Online 9 days ago" but that was just for a little 10 minute visit. It's been 24 days since I've been completely inactive.<br><br>So, how are you guys doing?<br><br>What grade are you guys in? I'm a Senior in Highschool btw.<br><br>How's Avicus?

School is normal, attending the same thing going to the same thing, but just more normal. I'v come to the point where I can actually have lessons every other hour, but like high school you have to attend every lesson in the them 6 hours , if that made any sense at all xd

School is giving me cancer, most of the stuff we learn is completely useless, and I have a shit ton of homework, especially for ap calc and ap chem.<br><br>Last year second semester, I stayed up pretty much every night playing ocn until early morning, fucking up my eyes and my grades. Luckily since I'm pretty smart I managed to clutch As in all of my class, but I really have no idea how . . So I'm not nearly as active anymore. Tbh I'm only here rn because of Rilo, lmao<br><br>I'm a junior
