So I'm having my wisdom teeth removed tomorrow and I was just wondering if you have any general suggestions for movies that I should watch? I'm sure that we could all share our favorites and maybe we can all find a new movie to watch. So any suggestions?

If you like intense action, watch:<br><ul><li>Jason Bourne (any of the 4)</li><li>James Bond (my favorite one is casino royale)</li><li>Taken 1,2,3</li></ul>If you like to laugh, watch:&nbsp;<br><ul><li>The Water boy</li><li>Dumb and Dumber 1 or 2 (1 is the better one in my opinion)</li><li>Mrs. Doubt fire (I swear, it looks corny, but it is funny as hell)</li></ul>If you are into just really good/inspiring/dramatic movies, i recommend:<br><ul><li>The Butler&nbsp;</li><li>The One Hundred Foot Journey</li><li>Gravity&nbsp;</li></ul>
