Hello everyone. I have a super basic computer and, I was wondering if there could be anything to get the best FPS without spending any money. I am already using optifine and, everything is on minimal settings. Here is some of my laptop's components.<br><br>CPU: Intel Pentium<br>RAM: 4 GB<br><br>Pretty much everything else is irrelevant as I do not see how it could affect my game.&nbsp;<br><br>Thanks everyone!

Whats your gpu? and sometimes running things like malwarebytes and ccleaner regularly to clean up your computer from viruses and useless programs can help. Otherwise, there is nothing you can realy do :/<br>Hope this helps :)

You could start by possibly running Minecraft with the smaller resolution.<br>Me i record on the smaller resolution to get the maximum fps. Me i run a whole lot faster with smaller resolution. You could also not have any other games or applications open.&nbsp;<br><br>Then when you find some money, if you have a spare ram slot you could get an extra 4gb of ram for about $80 - $120 depending where you go.<br>Or spend less and get 2gb.<br>Or if you find even more you can upgrade your processor.<br>Tell me what you think of this.<br>Good Luck.

Don't use Skype the a first, team-speak is much more efficient in terms of processing speed and improving connection, meaning your ping should also improve.

When i say change the resolution i mean change the size of the screen.<br>When Minecraft opens it is already at its default resolution. Leave it at that, don't make it full screen. If it is full screen then press f11. Or go into settings and change it. Hope this helps, tell me how i did with helping :)
