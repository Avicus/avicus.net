<b></b>Hello Avicus,<br>I am sorry to say that I am leaving Avicus for now.<br>My life is one big stressful mess. I need some time away from minecraft to try and tie up some loose ends in my life. This server is the best thing that happened to me for a while, so many friendly individuals, always very happy and joyful. I will hopefully return in the future to say hello again. I will remain active on skype and the forums. Before I leave I would like to say a few things to my Avicadian friends.<br><b><u>Zintenka</u>:</b> Thanks man, for everything. So many good times together. Building maps, skyping and just being awesome in general. I will miss you a lot and I hope we can meet up some time again in the future.<br><b><u>Roman: </u></b><u></u>My first friend on Avicus. You've always been there for me. You were by far the nicest person on Avicus, Always helping others out. Im really glad I met someone as joyful, awesome, and enthusiastic as you are.<br><b><u>Zaids, Keller, Vsplesk &amp; Cinnamon: </u></b><u></u>You 4 were always really friendly to me in game. Always saying hello, inviting me to do certain activities. Saying hello and chatting with me constantly. Ill never forget you 4.<br><b><u>Evocal:</u></b> Evo, You were always very happy to help me in everyway. From helping me create a YML to improving my skin, You are an excellent Map Dev and Staff Member.<br><b><u></u></b>
