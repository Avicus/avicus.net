I don't know how so many of you do it, you go off for like a month and come back still a god. I go off for two weeks, I come back becoming shit. It hurts, my playing style is suddenly different, I can't get my old one back, which is the one I like. Don't know if I should be worrying about this lol, but doesn't hurt asking

You probably just have to consistently play...then you should get back to your old playing style

My skill is a lot less consistent. I can be at home on my PC not playing MC for a day then start playing at 8 PM and I'm still shit after 2 hour of Kohi. I have to start playing before a certain time and get good sleep and not be hungry to be good. That's why I can be really bad one day and be a g0d the next.

I went away for two weeks last summer and it took me a mere 3 days of 2 hours of practise to get back into my play style.

I went away for four months came back and wasn't too much worse, thing is i remember the exact movement and way I pvped because before I left I was so focused on it I just didn't forget it. Maybe put like a conscious effort into remembering and being aware of how you play. When I was at the peak of my pvp, back in 1.7 there was a period of time where I would consider myself the best on the server and that was purely from effort and time analyzing my own pvp style. <br><br>If I put effort into minecraft I'm sure I could pick it back up but I really cannot be bothered if I'm honest.<br><br>In short know how you play, remember how you play and improve on how you play and rust becomes irrelevant especially on a fairly low skill ceiling game like minecraft.

Best is to practice until you known you are at a point where you are good to play again. Best not to ruin your stats (if you care about them a lot)
