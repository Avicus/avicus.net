Hey guys, so I retired.<br>Probably not hard to see.<br>So yeah, I've had a lot of stuff going on in life and I haven't really been enjoying moderating or Avicus in general as much as I used to, so I've decided to call it a day. As some of you may have noticed, I've been inactive af these past few weeks, so I came to this conclusion. <br>I didn't think I'd ever lose interest in Avicus. Since I found this server with a few friends back in January 2014, I knew that I wanted to stay here. But sadly, it's come to an end. I'll still be here, just not as much as I used to be. But if you ever need some advice, cheering up or just want a cheeky chat, I'm only a Skype message away :).<br>So seeing as this is also kind of a leaving post as I'm gonna be inactive for a while, I thought I might thank some peeps. <br>NOTE- This may be edited with more people. If you're not here now, you might be.<br><br><b>Awesomerp</b>- My swaggy troll buddy. One of my best friends on Avicus, hope we can meet up some time. Maybe for the next Star Wars? ;)<br><b>Pel-</b> One of my first friends on here. Our old chats in the Event Slack were awesome xD. Hope we can still meet up in May if you come to this strange island of ours.<br>Lego- Took on the impossible task of teaching me PvP. I appreciate it &lt;3<br><b>SBMous-</b> My irl friend. Introduced me to Avicus on one of our all-day Skype calls. tks m9.<br><b>BloB_Gaming-</b> Prick<br><b>Poss-</b> Thanks for letting me into Cronus. Backing you for admin pretty soon, wombat &lt;3<br><b>Cyanide</b>- A decent bloke. Still got that dodgy pic ;). Our rants last summer were great, thanks for letting me vent. &lt;3<br><b>Eric-</b> The sound of you saying "Oscaaarrrrr!" has made me smile for a long time now, thanks :)<br><b>DeliciousShoes-</b> A great guy, I can see you going far as a mod :)<br><b>BoggleMindedTree-</b> Thanks for being a sexalicious bastard and my favourite form of communism in America.<br><b>McPie-</b> Doubt you'll ever read this, but when I joined, I worshiped your rushing. Our simple conversations never failed to make me smile :)<br><b>4lextr-</b> You also helped me learn PvP. Much appreciated.<br><b>Snow- </b>A decent guy, your laugh always made me smile.<br><b>Cyn-</b> Our chats are the best. <br><b>Flo-</b> Can't ban you anymore, rip :(<br>Rilo- Oi Rylo m8, Rah-lah. Rah-lah m8.<br><br>There's probably more, but I'll edit them in when I think of them<br>Cheers for the ride guys. This is easily the best community I've ever been a part of. Make sure to keep it alive and well. <br>Most of my social media is @oscarelnana, so go follow me and I'll send you a picture of a cute cat.<br>Love you all more than you could imagine,<br>Oscar &lt;3<br><br>Oh yeah, and this can be an AmA if you guys want, might not answer all the questions, but why not?<br><span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.701961); font-family: Whitney, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Lucida Grande', sans-serif;    font-weight: normal;    text-align: start;       display: inline !important;  background-color: rgb(54, 57, 62);"></span>
