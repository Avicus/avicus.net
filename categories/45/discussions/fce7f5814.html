Because it's important.<br><br>So very simple question. Over the past&nbsp;<b>1 year</b> on Avicus, what has changed, and what has stayed the same? Just name some things, how they happened, what they caused (or didn't), what failed, what succeeded, why these things happened.&nbsp;<br><br>(This post will likely be ignored but it's more important than you think)

I have recently been put in charge&nbsp;of the social media team where we have gone from no leadership to a point by point plan to revive the team and add new features so we are able to market the server better and hopefully in the new feature focus on bringing player counts up.
