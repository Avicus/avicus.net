As someone who snipes names and knows lots of other people that snipe names and also the owners of both snipers most OG/good semi names are taken for snipes within the first day of being able to snipe the name. Also a majority of OG names are account transfers. And if it is&nbsp;<b>Not</b> a transfer and you actually get the snipe queued for it, an account seller will just come along and out-buy your snipe. Best way to get an OG is to; #1 be lucky #2 Buy it and #3 have money<br><br>Not trying to trash the thread but it really isnt worth trying to hand snipe an OG that's already being sniped.
