<span><b></b>Basically what the title says. <b>If your going to leave, leave!</b> Don't make a leaving post and come back 2 days later. If you are making a leaving post then please leave but if you know you are going to come back within two days (including on the forums)&nbsp;and the <b>temptation is strong</b>.<b> Don't make a leaving post</b>. Simple as that.&nbsp;It just spams the forums and is&nbsp;just very unnecessary (especially when you come back).</span>

Yes.&nbsp;<br>Because If you took the decision of stop being a staff member, why should you be it again? If you wanted to stop, now deal with it. If you want to be a staff member, you'd never stopped being it.

What's wrong with coming back? What if you enjoy moderating and don't know why you retired? New staff is always welcomed.

The problem is, that the retired staff only have to ask and don't have to write an application/having an interview. They are like, Hey can I be staff again? Then, Sure you can, I'll give you jr mod.<br>IMO they have to apply again to be moderator again.<br>And as you said <b>New&nbsp;</b>Staff is always welcomed. They are old staff members...

Seeing as you've never been a staff member you don't fully understand what you're talking about. When a staff member retires it is not always because they're leaving the server, most of the time it is because they need to focus on school. When they come back it's usually because school has gotten less overwhelming so they can continue their moderating duties. Why make a moderator go through the whole process again when they have already proven they are capable of being an effective staff member? Also, more moderators are better for the community and server as a whole, I see no cons to this.
