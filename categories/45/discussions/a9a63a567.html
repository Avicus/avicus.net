You're such a good friend who's improved so much since joining Apollo. I vouched for you getting into the team after subbing for Qrysis loads and I was extremely happy the leaders decided to trial you. We've stopped talking as much as we used to but still really good friends thankfully :p

Honestly I found you extremely annoying when you played for Qrysis. Always screaming in chat and following behind everyone else. Since then you've calmed down and become a member of the community. Good luck with any other teams you're thinking of joining because you've become a much better player as well.<br><br>Although BoE was soooooo much better than RtV, I'd like T4 to still have much better organisation. It would also be nice to have teams that didn't no show sign up so we'd actually be able to play matches. I remember in the group stage of BoE I was literally begging Necro to not no show because we hadn't played a game all day and were extremely bored.

I used to not like you at all but when you came back from a break not too long ago we've been pretty good friends (I hope). You're really chill to be around and doing well as a TS dev and jr mod. Plus you have more experience as a staff member than all the mods combined (memes) which means you help lots of us out.<br><br>Also I want your bean bridge back

You're a pretty nice person to talk to in TS but sometimes you can go over the top causing some of your infractions in-game. However I know you don't mean some the things you say. You're a pretty good player but need to improve with bow a lot. Good luck with the competitive scene because with some maturity I can see you getting into a better team.

You're a pretty nice person to talk to in TS but sometimes you can go over the top causing some of your infractions in-game. However I know you don't mean some the things you say. You're a pretty good player but need to improve with bow a lot. Good luck with the competitive scene because with some maturity I can see you getting into a better team.

I respect you hugely for leaving Hustlenomics and forming your own team, hopefully it's a step towards someone different putting up some competition. It's enjoyable talking to you in ts and our rushes in public were op.

I used to think you were quite annoying but you've calmed down a bit recently. You're always looking for a scrim which I guess is somewhat a good thing but can be annoying if you spam the TS chat with it :/ If you got a mic you'd be a really valuable player for any team because somehow you just end up capping the wool most games. Haven't really talked to you that much so I don't know you personally :v

Really nice person in game and on teamspeak, pretty good as well. You should definitely come on TS more for things such as mega scrims and UHCs.

Used to think you were a complete asshole but since you've come back we'be been somewhat friends. Try to stay away from&nbsp;becoming extremely toxic like the last time you were banned and I'm sure you'll work your way back into the community because you're pretty chill now.&nbsp;<br><br>I respect you for putting together a team from such a small community who scrims "10 times a day". You do have a lot of potential with the very good roster you currently have but sometimes you guys can be quite cocky with your 'scrim record' which makes other teams really want to beat you.<br><br>Loved being in the team before SOC because we were so active and all got along really well. After the tourney we were all kinda depressed and it was 2-3 weeks before we started scrimming again. That's when Banjo kicked me and I basically lost all respect for the team. I still love the old grim players who are on the roster but I don't like how wrap has basically immigrated into the team along with other 'higher' and more 'top-tier' players. I would like to see them do well in the last tourney but then again it would be pretty funny (no offence) if they didn't because half the old grim members were kicked or left and it's a completely new team now. Might as well call it Opus :/<br><br>Well... I'd like to say I'm pretty good player but I'm only 1200 on kohi and I somehow always lose loads of build matches on arena. When it comes to Avicus and OCN I can still somehow beat the much better players and idek how. I also like to think that I'm fairly well known among the Avicus community and that I'm a nice person to be around in ts but I really don't know :p

O God...<br><br>You're really friendly and nice to talk to but sometimes it's a little annoying when you mini mod. I like how you're a public and competitive player too. We should talk more because you're pretty chill<br><br>I couldn't write 100 paragraphs for anyone xd

I haven't really talked to you much but you're a good mod and you have your opinions to which you stick by and that's a great thing, I respect people like that.&nbsp;<br><br>Ehhh nah<br><br>Nebula (CTW)<br><br>Game as in video game?

ERIC MI AMIGO<br><br>You're probably the most active player on this server which is good and bad :p You're so funny to talk to in TS and you care so much for apollo. Sometimes you need to calm down in scrims because it can mess our comms up but you're very good at melee and getting better at bow.

I don't really know if we're good friends but I consider us friends. You can be very aggressive in scrims but overall you're pretty chill and a very good player, improving at bow quickly as well. Keep it up leading Apollo as well, you're doing a good job

I'm waiting for the day to come that I can beat you at pot...<br><br>You're really chill but sometimes you don't take stuff seriously (especially in scrims) which can be funny but gets annoying after a while. Then you become all serious and tell other people to stop being immature which I find quite hypocritical :/ &nbsp;You're a really good player and can solo carry us on sky and I do enjoy your memes when they're a high enough quality ! !

I have 0 respect for you. After continuously calling other players out (specifically from Apollo) then deciding to hack yourself? You probably could have gotten into a better team if you'd stayed legit. Then again I never really enjoyed talking to you in TS either.

Ayyyy whitever, I really hope you do join this community after OCN closes because it is better than people think. You're such an underrated player who occasionally gets subbed out in scrims because of it. You did play most of the matches in SOC though and you were a solid player. Good luck scoring if you didn't already xdd
