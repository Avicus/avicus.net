I know that this is going to do nothing but annoy some people but here we go:<br><br>Saying "lag" into the chat, or anything else for that matter, actually&nbsp;<i>increases</i> the amount of lag that you'll experience. &nbsp;Don't believe me?<br><br>When you send a message to the server, what happens is it has to a) receive your message, b) get a list of everyone on the server, and c) send it to each and every one of them. &nbsp;And then you want it to also process every step that you and every other player makes, while sending a message to everyone else on the server about how much you are annoyed with it? &nbsp;Why are you wasting your time complaining? &nbsp;You're making it worse!

You Do realize it takes only miliseconds for it to process?. And I never seen a chat spammed with "lag"<br><br>Take into consideration... "lag" has 3 letters.. (Dont quote me). 1 letter = 1 byte, 'lag'= 3 bytes... Not much at all

I know exactly how long it takes to process. &nbsp;I develop for servers. &nbsp;But do you know what milliseconds adds up to when you have tons of people saying lag at once? &nbsp;And it increases based on how many people are online. &nbsp;It takes milliseconds to send to each person there. &nbsp;By the time you get a message, it may be seconds after the sender originally sent it on large servers. &nbsp;I never said it's an earth-shattering amount of time, but it doesn't help anything. &nbsp;What's the purpose of saying anything anyway?

I have seen it on a server with 200 people on it, (not Avicus) and almost everyone of them said lag and it eventually crashed every time.

Why are you all like: "You are not right, I am!"?<br>He is the developer and he should know it. You never developed anything for a minecraft server, so don't think you are right and he is wrong.<br>He is making this thread, because he hates that people write "LAG" in the chat. He is doing the same as you. You make multiple threads about the staff efficiency and he just makes one thread about writing Lag in the chat.

The keyword here is "may". It "primarily" funds the server, and, I would assume, "may" be allocated among developers if there was leftover money, for example.

Well actually, when there is lag, and you spam all together "lag" in the chat, then it will make it worse, but at the end of the game, when it is over, then it's okay to "spam" "gg".

I think Avicus is losing like 5 players everyday because of the lag. I think it's time to change server hosts :/

That's actually kinda true what Poker said, there are a lot of people keep saying in the chat "Oh my god this server is so laggy". When are you guys going to fix this lag? Avicus is loosing players (because of the lag).

<b>Solutions for the FPS Lag and Lag Spikes:</b><br>- Re-upload / Revamp / Rebuild maps which seem to be corrupted FPS wise (for<br>example...
