My views on Avicus, what's yours?

</h1>
<center><h1>What is this thread about?</h1><i>A lot of things has been going down lately in the Avicus community, so I thought I would post my opinions on it all. Some of what I talk about will be based around me, but most will be around the issues that have been brought up recently.</i><br></center><center><h1><br></h1><h1>Reasoning's on the restart of my channel.<br></h1>Now I know that this isn't a topic that is fully directed towards Avicus, but I still want to give the full reasons to why I have decided to restart my channel. As some of you may know I have made a lot of video, over 100 to be exact. Most of the videos are influenced heavily by Avicus and the community that's apart of it, so you guys! When I first announced me thinking about deleting the videos and starting again it was an idea I came up with spontaneously. As time went on I gathered more reasons to go through with the idea, and it seems like a lot of you don't yet fully understand why I would want to do this.<br><br>I have had lot's of negativity around the idea and I needed to address it. My main reason is to become/look like a much more professional channel, with most of my videos I hope they look professional because that's what I want them to be like. But to most of you restarting for only this reason may seem like a bad idea but I am looking towards the future and you are looking into the past. I was told by many that keeping the videos would show my progression and I fully understand that but I came up with an analogy to further explain what I think.<br><br><i>If an artist were to show their artworks, they wouldn't show all of them. They would most likely show their best, and the ones they don't like they might keep but do nothing about it. If they start to have too many they would start getting rid of some of their works and usually the first to get thrown out are the bad ones. And out of these artworks they may have some favorites and want to keep them to continue to show off.</i><br><br>This leads on to the videos that I am going to keep. The Before the Restart montage was going to showcase "my favorite artworks" and keep them as memories for both you and me. And to a select few of the videos, I am going to be keeping them as their own.<br><h1><br></h1><h1>The commotion around the staff.</h1>Since I have been on both sides, I can't say I am experienced with the topic but I have an idea about what I am saying. I understand where both sides are coming from with this topic, causing me to have mixed opinions with everything. When the community carries on about nothing getting done. they have complete right to do so because nothing really has been done...yet.<br><br>I know that some staff are actually trying to change things for the better, but it is really hard to change something without support. And since not every mod seems like they want to change things the progression seems quite slow. Slowly but surely things will be changed but by that time I feel a lot of players and regulars will have left. The best way to try and stop this from happening is to further involve the community and frequently update them on things that are going on. On the other hand the community needs to chill with everything, because to me it seems like we complain that nothing gets done, then when someone actually decides to do something we continue complaining. I have to admit that to the community there are some staff members that seem/are biased as well as power hungry, I really don't think that is ever good to have in a team and some things need to be done to resolve this.<br><br>In all honesty I think that everyone needs to chill and actually work together to get things done. Even though the staff are called a team, the community can work as a team with each other and even the staff themselves.<br></center><center><h1><br></h1><h1>What I think can be done to improve.</h1>In the past I have made a post about how the staff system can be improved and it got quite a lot of good feedback. If you missed the post&nbsp;<a href="https://avicus.net/forums/84e52202d" title="Link: https://avicus.net/forums/84e52202d">click here</a>.&nbsp;I was happy to hear that the idea was being taken into account and if pulled off correctly can lead Avicus to it's first step in the right direction. I was also happy to hear that the server will soon be going into full 1.8 which people said will take away most of the blocklag that occurs on the server.<br><br>Seeing and testing out the 1.9 snapshots, changing to them would be a HORRIBLE idea. I think that if the update stays the way it is now, which I hope it doesn't, it will slowly but surely kill pvp. To make it just a little better though, someone told me that servers can disable parts of the game and if so the cooldown NEEDS to be removed. This feature is what mainly makes the pvp so bad and removing it would ease the pain if we were to ever update to 1.9</center><h1 style="text-align: -webkit-center;"><br></h1><h1 style="text-align: -webkit-center;">An overview of everything.</h1><div><center>All in all, Avicus is not dying. It will if we don't do anything to stop it from happening but I know that this server has potential. I also know that people here have enough brains not to let something die that they love. This commotion will need some work and time to resolve but if people are really willing to fix things it will happen, and there is a reason many haven't left already. And I would like to think that it's hope keeping them here.</center></div>

<p>+1, Avicus is not dying, we just need to help progress it even further. </p><p>About your channel restart, I personally think it looks very professional already but it's good that you're keeping some of your best videos for nostalgia reasons. I would suggest making some slightly longer videos. Otherwise, keep up the good work!</p>

In my personal opinion. Avicus is dying, It has been for over a year now, With the staff team getting very fragile, The players getting annoyed by issues not being fixed and the player counts dropping from 1,200 to 60.<br><br>There isnt much time left

This is copied from a response that I made to another thread.<br><br>I think we all need to stop blaming each other. This isn't a divided 
country where it's police vs the people. It's like a small hometown 
where all the officers know everyone in the community, and are a part of
 it. Back in our setting, the community wouldn't bode well without some 
users stepping up to <b>sacrifice their time and work</b> to help keep 
the environment fun, and staff members wouldn't have a fun time doing 
their work, if they always thought it was them versus everyone else. 
We're all friends, and yes, sometimes staff members make mistakes, and 
yes sometimes we have bad staff members, but in the long run, we're all 
one in the same, and arguing won't help.

That's exactly right. People just seem to think that staff are separated from everyone else, and with that mindset it kind of becomes true. We just need to all work together as one big community!

This is exactly my point though, you already have the mindset that it's not going to work. I know it is easier said than done but I guess we need to keep trying til something works.

Sorry if I wasn't clear, that wasn't exactly what I was trying to say. I'm just saying that this definitely won't be an easy task. I never even brought up my willingness to try it. But, to set things straight, I just got bummed about my demotion, and it temporarily put me in that mindset. I haven't lost faith yet, though I guess you could say I'm on the verge.

Staff on this server is a big joke. Most biased staff members belong here. ( Not stating that ALL staff members are biased ). I've been in games where staff lower the severity of a punishment for a serious offence because " He's my friend". Yes I believe Avicus is dying. Not because of the community but how are we going to support a server when there is constant lag, inconsistent performance e.t.c.

<b>Too little too late.</b>&nbsp;<br><br>In my views, Avicus NEEDS to fix the problems it has or there will be dire consequences, namely Avicus&nbsp;dying. If Avicus is going to change, it needs to be done now and it needs to be done quick. Staff bias seems to be a problem. I am not 100% certain as to what the situation is as I have not been a member of staff myself but I have talked to lots of staff so I do know quite a fair amount to the situation (although I have just returned after a week of vacation, so I don't know much about the more recent problems in detail). The main problem about the bias is not the bias itself, but fixing it. From what I see, a fair amount of people try to fix it with good points, but nothing happens. Change needs to happen, &nbsp;Change also needs to be established well, it's no use just having the staff making the changes-just like it's no use having just the community bring them out. We need to work together. Sitting around screaming for change brings attention to the matter, but nothing ever happens. In fact, screaming at the staff loosens the bond between staff and community. Instead, people need to stop shouting and get together again. This post will probably have some useful criticism which is much needed, but I can assure you that there will also be a mug comment .-. As to how we get together again, just stop shouting and see what happens. Being too over friendly with players is quite frankly&nbsp;creepy, and not doing anything is ignoring the matter. Acknowledging players presence when they talk is a step forward, especially when dealing with reports as a lot of the time staff get distracted. Someone once told me that they don't need to take all the reports, they can just leave it to another staff which they presume is not afk. This is completely wrong. You have people defending themselves that it's just human nature and whilst that may be so, it doesn't excuse them fully. Staff should be actively pursuing reports because they want to help players. A staff member going the extra mile is exactly what we need to fix the staff-community bond, The moderator is doing their job fully and caring for the community at the same time. Staff apps are coming soon and that should hopefully bring new possibilities and bring power to the people that want Avicus to be amended. However, new staff applications won't be enough. The community needs to be accepting, supportive and constructive. The community also needs to be a bit of all three attitudes listed above rather than just one or change is hindered and sometimes turned around to be negative change rather than positive. The lag, as mentioned most frequently by players, needs to be fixed. Not partly, but fully. I hope the devs take time in fixing in-game issues in order for them to be as good as possible.&nbsp;<br><br>I honestly can't fix &nbsp;these problems alone. As mentioned above, staff and community need to work together to bring about a better Avicus. Once a change has been made then we can advertise in the hope to gain more players because right now Avicus is in no state to be advertised.&nbsp;<br><br>plz no flame ;-;

Ey yo! It's that mug reply I foretold xd but being serious here, I'm over that warn, I'm just using it as evidence&nbsp;=) And that console thing was an ironic joke, the humor from its ironic-ness

IRON-ic<br><br><br><br><br><br>Avicus was fun, it was enjoyable. I never had this thought that I would be so bored and annoyed so much that I would play OCN, but I do now Avicus has tons of problems, brought up by the communtiy, yet hardly any progress has been made. Block Lag, ghost hitting, lag, random fall damage are some problems that really annoy me. As for the staff team, I haven't been through much with the staff. Some ignore reports, some fail to admit their mistakes, some are immature. I don't even believe that Avicus is in this state. Dying.

<span style="color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  ">What we all need to realize is that the staff and community are one. There shouldn't even be a division. The staff are players just like everyone, except with a bit more responsibility. Lots of us are bias, inconsiderate, and don't follow the rules I will admit. Many of the staff including me have forgotten or have decided not to follow parts of our guidelines and even parts of the rules sometimes. A lot of staff treat the community like dirt, and I admit to doing that a few times which I regret and I believe most of the other staff do too. If I could develop, I sure as hell would get to work on your ideas since I really do believe Avicus needs to go back to the way it was before. We need to have a reassessment on ALL parts of the staff team including Devs and Admins which would probably be done my Kylo. The community calls the staff team "shit" which a lot of us actually agree with. But, you guys need to realize not all of us are inconsiderate power abusing fun killing strict asses. I try my best to have fun with you guys, but I can also choose to be strict to get points across, which many of you may consider wrong. A lot of the staff have admitted to their faults...or at least a few have...now, not to be rude, but the community has flaws too. You guys constantly bash the ENTIRE staff team for things that only a FEW of them do! It feels really awful when we have the people we are or should be doing our work for yell at us for stuff we don't do.&nbsp;</span><b style="color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  ">It'd be nice to have everyone, including the COMMUNITY to admit to their faults.<br><br><br></b><span style="color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  ">Typed on an iPad, so sorry if some parts make no sense.</span>

And if you havent already noticed, the only admin at the moment is Mango, who has always been a very&nbsp;capable&nbsp;staff member and servant of the community.&nbsp;<br><br>Evidently what the staff team isn't falling back on at the moment is the guidelines that were drafted and the ideals formulated by the managers and senior moderators of late 2013, early 2014 avicus.</span>
