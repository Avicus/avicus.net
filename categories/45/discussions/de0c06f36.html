<span>Mels daddy, when I first saw you on avicus you annoyed me because you were the kid that got iron armour and that made me rage sooo hard. But when we started to talk in voice chat ( when you joined Xenarch (REEEE)) I realised: HEYY THIS IS A NICE LIL KIDDO, and from then on I've seen you as one of my best and funniest friends. I can't say how much fun I had with you because I just had too much that words can't explain. The amount of times I laughed with you were more times than minertedtoad applied for mod, more times than ALM used /disguise in game, I've laughed more times with you than we have listened to September. I don't see you as a block man I met playing mine and craft but I see you as a best friend and a daddy. The memories I had with you and the TEAMWORRK we had together will be remembered forever and I wish you a lifetime of happiness in your vast future. If I come to the Netherlands I'll give you a call *wink* *wink*.<br><br>Goodbye my friend and I will remember you for the rest of my life.<br><br>Thank you for being my friend and I would just like to say one last thing to you:<br><br>Whenever it's September I will always, always think of you.<br><br>Goodbye Mels, have a good life.<br><br>From your Son: Power_Pixel68<br><br>PS: MAY do a face reveal.<br></span><span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.701961); font-family: Whitney, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;     font-weight: normal;   text-align: start;       background-color: rgb(54, 57, 62); display: inline !important; "><span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.701961); font-family: Whitney, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;     font-weight: normal;   text-align: start;       background-color: rgb(54, 57, 62); display: inline !important; "><br></span></span>
