I'm a leader of PPB and a member for about over a year, and I'm a two time Tournament Champion. I've been mod twice. I've played for PureBlox, Eclipse, and Starbeans over on OCN, and I've been playing minecraft a good four years now too. Oh and also its my birthday Aug 1. I'll answer every question with 100% honesty. TBH's or any other question you have for me.

15<br><br>Far and away the best person on that team is Brick. Although if you account for bow and sword maybe Loo.&nbsp;<br><br>Well I haven't really met everyone but at least considering the people I've met I was very impressed with the way Loo has progressed since first trialing him. I think a lot of people consider him a bow god now, but when we were trialing him, he wasn't particularly strong at bow over sword, but because we put him on such bow intensive positions, he learned very quickly and impressively. His sword has also improved but not as dramatically in my opinion.<br><br>From personal experience I think you're pretty chill and funny to talk to but I've heard you can be toxic at times from a lot of people on the team. In terms of pvp I know you are definitely in the upper crust in terms of general avicus skill (when you're not lagging that is) and I'm definitely interested to see where you go next. I think it'd be way cool to talk to you more though (haha generic) although I do really mean it.

I don't really know you all that well even though you're in my team. I pretty much added you to this team for memes and chill but overall I don't regret that all too much which is pretty much saying something. I think you're definitely a down to earth kind of person and I really can't thank you enough for introducing me to the hidden memes of Avicus. Oh also you kinda made the PPB chat explode a bit lol. I do want to get to know you more though and I hope we're able to talk more in Allah.<br>Probably neither but if you made me choose probably Liz. Liz was the one I first added to the team and Robo thought it'd be a good idea to add you as well so I did. Not that I know either of you well enough really to make a distinction but I definitely get a weaker hate vibe from Liz so yeah.<br>Well I went to Canada in the summer and I was stuck in a museum I walked to and it started hailing so one of the museum workers offered to drive us home to our hotel so we didn't have to walk home in the rain so I'd say A++ Honestly though I don't see too much of a distinction between Americans and Canadians on the whole so I'd say I respect them both pretty equally.

Personally I think you're a really cool person and I've always thought of you as a funny guy but I'm sad that I don't have GTA or Overwatch and that we're not able to dick around there and kill deltadragon. Sometimes I think you meme too hard but I don't hold that against you because in the end I'm always able to look back and laugh. I hope we're able to continue to talk after OCN though.<br>I think at one point you were definitely better than DeltaDragon but honestly I'm not sure anymore. Delta's determination at being good at this game is very spooky. You're better at bow though for sure and general OCN game sense/skill.<br>You've been playing for much longer iirc.<br>You won a tournament.<br>Honestly other than Minecraft I don't have many games but I think my top is Portal and HL2 was very good as well when I played it.

I'm almost certain you used to hack and honestly I find it hard to respect someone who used to hack. The lack of decisive evidence makes me not actually dislike you but I've always been suspicious since maybe T1-T2. I think it's improbable that you still hack but its unnerving and I definitely don't respect you if you did. In fact I don't think I even trusted you back then, but my perception has changed a lot and I wouldn't be opposed to talking to you more if you were up for it. I don't find you toxic outside the standard Apollo levels and you're probably one of the chiller people in that team. If you don't hack you are probably one of the best Avicus players sword.<br><br>I realized my dream team was basically PPB and some BC and Apollo so I just kept PPB and added some BC memebers.

I really don't know you that well other than you're on Apollo, sorry.<br><br>Winning. We're consistent and our communication is only getting stronger. I think you guys will be our biggest challenge next year and if we don't win, you will. I might stop playing that much though during school, and that's really the only way I could see PPB kind of slowing down. I don't think that'll happen next tourney but it will come.<br><br>My closest friend that I met on Avicus is probably Robo.

My favorite match BY FAR is the 2nd map on Sand Ocean versus BC in the finals of T2. That was so close and there was a lot of great team play as well as individual play by Delta, Ihze, Tazz, and Applez on that map.<br>Pope I'd say you're probably the chillest individual I've met on Avicus and it's great being on the team with you. I never saw you as a pvp tank or anything but it doesn't matter because of how well you work with teams. I don't know a team that wouldn't want you on their roster.<br>In terms of improvement with sword and general pvp play Badlion a lot and Basic if you get a wl. A lot of people don't believe me when I say this but if you want to get good at OCN skills and develop OCN game sense, play OCN pubs. Quite a few people think pubs are shit, but that is pretty much how every good OCN player developed their first OCN unique skill set and honestly it's helped me hone my offending skills thusfar.

Honestly 3rd I'd say. As long as you can beat Hete's team that is, which I think you can. Maybe if you're inactive that will sink but if you're really active I'd say you could probably take down Apollo which would be cool.<br><br>Right now: Allah, Apollo, Camel<br><br>18 Players:<br>Me, Cyclops, Brick, Delta, cookize, BmB, zero, pope_panda, Tomqss, Loo, Hete, Stim, Tazz, Cyclones, Applez (if he was active), Creep, Ihze (if he unquit), Glitchy (If he unquit)

I thought you hacked for a long time and I apologize for what I said which only may have been true. I'll say what I said to Raging, I really didn't trust you for a long time and I think that's just now starting to end but I don't regret being thorough with looking for hackers, especially when at the time I had already got an anonymous tip from Tazz that someone hacked that was on the team so I was really jumpy. I think you're a really chill guy and I respect you as a player and as a person nowadays. If you weren't on Apollo I'd probably try you again for PPB if you were down, and I do think you're incredibly skilled with sword. If you did hack, well then I don't respect you, but I guess I'll never know.<br><br>My best friend online is definitely cookize but I knew him irl first so if you don't count that then FileFish.

I think for some reason you dislike and I'm not exactly sure why. I'd like to think its a meme but at the same time your memes are so stale I actually am starting to think you don't like me for real. I'm not sure how that started but even if it isn't true I still think you're stubborn and have a hard time listening to others opinions, which is sometimes good, but almost always negative. Maybe that's just me and my ideas but idk. Despite this however I think you're one of the least biased staff on the team, and overall I'd say one of the most valuable staff considering your activity as well. I don't find you to be a good player pvp wise but I don't think you ever were aiming for that.<br><br>Already asked but the 2nd map of Allah vs BC in T2<br><br>I think I got one in 30 seconds on some rush map at 3 am.<br><br>When Delta killed Tazz to win us the game in the aforementioned match.

As a player I think you're above average at both bow and sword but not particularly insane at either. As a person I think I used to think less of you but as soon as we started making maps I think I realized that you're really chill and you have some good ideas when it comes to maps.<br><br>I've always thought Apollo was really cocky, especially considering their skill level, which may be less true now but that notion still sticks with me. They're not a bad team, but when they think they're all that it really bothers me. I appreciate how long they've been together for though, and the skill they have is well earned.<br><br>I'm really really hoping for Mixed Gamemodes with KotH, TDM, CTF, CTW, DTM, CP, and some cannoning gamemode.

I don't know why I used to dislike you so much but that's definitely changed. It might've been because you started only using fist in an AoA scrim we were destroying APush in which I think bothered everyone from Eclipse at the time. But I realized sometime before I joined PureBlox that you are a really chill dude and your memes are pretty swoll, about the time I realized you were actually a good offender.

I respect you as a player and I definitely think you're chill dude. I don't hold the fact that you left my team against you, although I do wish it hadn't happened. You're chill to talk to in TS and I've always valued your game sense as a player and considered you a friend. I wish you the best of luck with your new team.

If Cacal did it first sorry for blatantly stealing your thing. I think people are a little too uptight about their rosters sometimes, started as a meme but I think it serves a double purpose.

I think you're a team swapper and will do anything to be on the winning team, which is honestly pretty gross, maybe I'm wrong or something, and it was just a coincidence, in which case I apologize, but that's at least what it looked like to me going in and out of PPB whenever in between tourneys. But other than that you're a chill dude and I think you're a good pvper. I enjoyed having you on PPB during the time you were on.<br><br>Yes.

As a player, you are one of the most valuable people on PPB. Not only because you are a defender, but because of how incredibly active you are and I can tell how much you care about PPB and making it better. I think you're one of the best defenders on this server and I'm glad I picked you up off of what was basically one throw away scrim.&nbsp;As a person, I always like talking to you about whatever news there is and I think you are a super funny guy as well. Overall, I'm glad you're on this team please subscribe.

15<br><br>Far and away the best person on that team is Brick. Although if you account for bow and sword maybe Loo.&nbsp;<br><br>Well I haven't really met everyone but at least considering the people I've met I was very impressed with the way Loo has progressed since first trialing him. I think a lot of people consider him a bow god now, but when we were trialing him, he wasn't particularly strong at bow over sword, but because we put him on such bow intensive positions, he learned very quickly and impressively. His sword has also improved but not as dramatically in my opinion.<br><br>From personal experience I think you're pretty chill and funny to talk to but I've heard you can be toxic at times from a lot of people on the team. In terms of pvp I know you are definitely in the upper crust in terms of general avicus skill (when you're not lagging that is) and I'm definitely interested to see where you go next. I think it'd be way cool to talk to you more though (haha generic) although I do really mean it.

When we met I had no opinions of you really, I didn't think you were the best or the worst, I just thought you were an Avicus dude from Berzerk. Nowadays, I think you've gotten better, but I still don't consider you to be one of the best from PPB and to be honest it was annoying when you complained about not scrimming before you left. I think you can be a chill dude but sometimes you seem a little pretentious, and overall I see this as hurting your personality. I still respect you though and it was sad seeing you leave PPB. Good luck with your new team.<br><br>I'm going to go with PureBlox because it was my first team and really the one that tought me about and introduced me to the competitive community.<br><br>4th, as it stands. It's still early and pickups could completely shift things. I think I'll have a solid answer after registration though.<br><br>Pasalecqua but honorable mentions to Emer, InLoc, and Brick

Brick if you're only talking Avicus but if it's Avi and OCN Hivlik is better all round.<br><br>Loo again if just Avicus and probably if Avi and OCN. Honorable mention to Lachlan but he doesn't have the OCN game sense Loo has.

If you said hi to me and I didn't respond I definitely didn't see it. I either was afk or just not paying attention. I'll always respond if I do.

1. You posted your unwanted, unneeded and unasked for opinion on an AMA, you know, where you're supposed to ask questions. The worst thing is your posts are completely irrelevant to lgmatias and the purpose of this thread.<br><br>2. You can't just talk shit about other people and not expect an argument.<br><br>3. No one cares what you think.<br><br>I'd appreciate if you had the maturity to end this here and not spam an AMA thread without even asking questions.

Well, I haven't talked to you much, but from what I've gleaned from the brief interactions I've had with you as a person I think you're a fair map maker and generally a chill and funny dude. As a player I can't let go of the fact that you were banned for autoclicking which really tarnishes my view of you even though I think you're a fair offender. Actually, I can't see if your punishment on your account anymore so maybe I'm missing something but I'm sure you'll correct me if I'm wrong.

I haven't talked to you much, like a lot of people on Apollo it seems, but I remember that you're definitely one of the chiller people on Apollo and you were fun to talk to in that mega scrim. As a person I assume you're ok but I don't ever think I've directly observed your play.

I was banned for autoclicking 3 years ago which was false as well, appealed later with evidence and the staff that banned me admitted to banning me with shitty evidence for biased reasons. lol

Portal<br>Longest standing friend by far cookize. Other than that, for people in Avicus: Robo, and if you're talking OCN AdamChen.<br>DaGoldBrick but if you mean all round Loo is pretty strong.<br>I've always respected you as a leader and seen you as one of the strongest leaders on Avicus. You're great at sword as well and I think you have enough all round skill to be considered the best on old BC and one of the stronger players on this network. As a person I thought you made a good friend when we talked more and you were on the team, and I'm hoping that still continues. Honestly I was really disappointed when you left to make your own team before T3 but hey you're back now so that's chill.<br><br>That's good although we probably won't scrim a lot until OCN tourney is over. Not saying it won't happen but fair warning.

I don't know a lot about you but it annoyed me when you pressed enter after every sentence when you made a post like Zintenka does but it looks like you don't do that anymore so it's fine. Honestly I think you say a lot of things that are a lowkey brag. I don't know if you intend to do that, but that's just how it seems to me although really I've experienced very little of you. Hopefully that changes.<br>Idk, my mom's car is pretty cool.<br>24<br>Maybe. I've been mod twice and I disliked it both times. Leaning towards no but I consider it every time. Too much of a time sink in my opinion, especially since I'm trying to lean off this game.
