Any reasons why you think they're better other thank they're trendy? xd<br><br><br>I dunno, in my opinion they're all mainly the same thing every time just getting bigger, thinner, and don't seem to really be getting any update. Also, from experience, I've noticed that if you update an old device too much it literally becomes useless. Keyboard types like an idiot and has a mind of its own, taps don't register, etc.

I'm not a rich aristocrat who likes to waste money on white-girl junk. Windows Phone is just so much better than any iPhone. PC is way better than any Mac. I don't see why people spend money on Apple stuff.

The only good Apple products in my opinion are the iPhone and iPad. Everything else is WAY overpriced and not worth it.<br><br>I also hate how they're "updating" their technology so quickly, when really they're making the screen bigger...
