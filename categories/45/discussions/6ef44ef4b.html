Please don't skip :) I'm only posting this here as I thought it had a nice impact on me and I want to help everyone else with this post as well.&nbsp;<br>Thank you Giggity69Goo if you see this<br>Enjoy!<br><br><b>------------------------------------------------------</b><br><br>Mother: Clean your room!<br>Child: Get out! You're not the boss of me!<br>Mother: Clean it now! It's a mess, you can't live in this!<br>Child:</i>&nbsp;<i>I hate you, get out of my life!<br>*slams door on her face*<br>Mother remembers her children's words... "get out of my life...out of my life...<b>my life</b>"<br></i><br><span><i><b>---</b></i>​</span><br><span><b>No</b>&nbsp;<b>no</b>&nbsp;<b><i>no</i></b>.</span>&nbsp;This is not okay. I see this too much. Us teenagers disrespect our parents, I'm not saying we all do, but it does happen. We lose our temper and all that we've kept in lashes out. What you think you said may have seemed little, but this takes a huge toll on the people who have tried raising you in life for the past years.<br>When this happens, parents feel like crap. They really do, they feel like what they have been trying to do for a good part of their life is really going to waste and that they're not doing it correctly. You can't have them feel that way. Imagine if you were in their position. Raising children is a real challenge, from birth until they go off to college. If they're going out of their way to make you happy, I suggest you do the same.<br><br>Even if you don't want to do the big things in your life and go out of your way to make these people happy, just do the little things. When you wake up in the morning and see them, tell them you love them or just give them a hug. That's what I do, and it seems my parents appreciate it.<br><br>As many of you know I'm an avid 4chan user (even though I'm below the age limit *oops*). There was a time where I came up onto a feels thread, this is where people post things to make people feel bad or try and experience pain others are feeling, and someone posted some nostalgia from a past 4chan thread back in 2012 when I didn't even know the website existed. What was said here really hurt, but it really showed me that some kids who are out there really love their parents and they try their hardest to make them happy. Here it is:<br><br><span><img alt="IMG" src="http://static.fjcdn.com/pictures/Almost+made+me+cry+just+found+this+browsing+r9k+first+post_c00ca0_4082602.png"><br>​</span>Brought a tear to my eye. It really did. Although you can't trust that this has happened, you can still at least imagine the situation happening. When you read it yourself, you kind of put this all into your head and you imagine if this was you and your father. It hurts. It really does. But look at that line there that says "&gt;He smiles the happiest smile I have seen in years"<br><br>Now here comes the question I ask all of you who say you hate your parents, what if you did this for your parents? What if you made your parents happy for the first in your eyes, and you finally exchanged that feeling of love?<br><br>A human cannot live without love from someone. The people who will give it to you the most are your parents. And you know, sad to say here but some people may not have biological parents. It could be their grandmothers and grandfathers, uncles and aunts, etc. It could even be a mother and mother or father and father. Hell, a lot of times it's just one mother or one father. Whoever it is, you have to show them that you love them.<br><br>I have heard people here call their mothers and fathers w****s, b****s, s***s, f*****s, etc. If you've experienced that at the same time as me, then you've seen me flip. You should not be mad at the people who have brought you into this world, and have done all they can to raise you. They go to work everyday, they try and make money everyday, just to put food in your mouths.<br><br>Now I know, if you are experiencing child abuse from one or more of your parents then you have no right to love them, because they're not being the parents you're supposed to have. Or if they've done something illegal and ended up in jail, they're not showing you the brightest path. But if you're not experiencing this then you don't have a great reason to hate your parents.<br><br>Just please, after you read this, I hope I can change what you think about your parents and give them more respect if you haven't in the past... and before I end this thread let's just imagine a different scenario.<br><br><span><b>---</b>​</span><br><i>Mother: Clean your room!<br>Child: Will get right to it mom!<br>Mother: Thank you.<br>*Smiles and starts to leave the room*<br>Child: Wait mom...<br>Mother: Yes?<br>Child: ...I love you<br>Mother: I love you too.<br>*Leaves the room with a smile that can light up the darkest areas of the world*<br></i><br><span><b>---</b>​</span><br><span><span>Real talk,<br>Andreas<br></span>​</span>TL;DR?

That made me cry.&nbsp;Judge me all you want, like it will change anything. I can't relate to the story, but the way the father calls his son "buddy" reminds me of my dad. My dad wishes the best and only the best for me, and that in my opinion is where the feelings begin to come out when reading this.<br><br>Seeing a post like this truly makes me evaluate.. And re think the way I treat my parents sometimes. Thank you for bringing this up, Vlad.

I totally get what you're saying, love your parents unless they're abusing you in ANY way, physically, emotionally, verbally or anything.<br><br>But the story is sad. The kid has to pretend to be hanging out with his friends and goes to sleep in an abandoned lot, something that's kinda dangerous on it's own, just so his dad is proud? They should be able to work through their problems by talking, not avoiding that and having the kid go pretend he's somebody he's not. I understand that the dad wants him to be happy and have friends but personally I don't think that's the way to go about it.<br>It's wrong that teenagers have to do that stuff. Respect your parents if they respect you, but you shouldn't have to sleep in a car alone every weekend to please them.

It's sad to see our generation growing up to learn to hate our parents.<br><br>Love your parents kiddies. They're not going to be here too long and when they finally go, you may have nothing to stand upon.

This is a bad thing that I see happening so often now. And children think it's normal.<br>It breaks a Mother's heart to hear the words "I hate you." Even if said out of anger.<br><br>I really hate myself if those words slip out during a fight.<br><br>But really, love your parents, they love you more than anything, <i>anything</i>. There is no stronger bond than the one you share with your parents.

If your parents ended up being gone the next day, what would you do? Do you think you loved them enough? Did you do enough for them? Reflect and think. Don't screw yourself up because I went through the disrespect thing but I believe it's okay to get angry with your parents; it's a natural part of life.<br><br>Although, try your best. Do what you can to help your parents out and know that their struggle is your success.

If your someone like me, who know how people feel, people call it 'standing in the their shoes'. Then you know how much they care for you, even if it doesn't show. For those with grandparents make the rest of their life amazing, they may not be able to do the same things as you, but you can do the same things as them, have a convosation with them, talk about the football match last night, just something that lets them know you've acknowledged them.&nbsp;<br>This thread was very touching, and it made my just think how I would even come close to what my parents are now.

I just wanna say, I have really overprotective parents, by the point that ever person on the internet MUST be a perv to them, because they dont trust me with ANYTHING, even chatting.<br><br>I "hate" them, but in the way teens feel like, how theyre all "grown" up now, so they THINK they can do whatever they can do.<br><br>This is how I feel, and tbh some of the things my parents forbid me to do are things that I should be allowed to do. But by reading this post, I realised that most are right...<br><br>Thanks Vlad :)
