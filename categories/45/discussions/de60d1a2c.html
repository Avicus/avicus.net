#BringSkywarsBack<br>Now Skywars is just skyblock survival games. We need the old McZone version back!<br><br>Many people want HG/SG back but I highly doubt it ever will return.<br><br>Aaaand no to survival, especially modded. It just doesn't fit Avicus imo...

I want survival games back, I think we'll have SG and SW back due to what Howsie was saying in the discussion #1

I think this is a catch 22 of sorts... Bringing more games will divide the player base even more... as of now walls has less than 50 players, nexus has less than 20 and all other games have almost none except nebula....&nbsp;<br><br>I know the thought is - if we add more games more people will come, I am not sure it will work exactly that way... My suggestion is get the current game modes perfected with maps. fixes, etc .. remove the games people are not playing -. then think about more games... I would really like to see Avicus with a sustained 1000 count player total for most of the day each day....

Also coding these things take time, who knows, a new gamemode could be almost finished.
