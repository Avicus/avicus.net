Watch this first.<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9d67cY-r4Xo&amp;list=UUh93f4b4n-6jV14Ce0R1Gdg">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9d67cY-r4Xo&amp;list=UUh93f4b4n-6jV14Ce0R1Gdg</a> <br><br><br>Okay, so basically, a very young kid in our school got sexually molested, twice, the parent of the victim blamed the ISS (Janitor Cleaning company), ISS payed the parent a certain amount of money (Unknown Amount).<br><br>The parent asks the court for JIS (My school)&nbsp;to pay her even more money, the court says "No", because the molesting was done by the janitor of ISS, we assume the parent is paying the police (Cause in indonesia, there is lots of corruption) To get them to agree with her.<br>CCTV footage the shows that on the specific days. The child was fine and then the mother blamed it on two teachers. The Police put them into temporary jail-detention.<br><br>I personally know both of them, and they did not do it. It was claimed to be done in the office, but the office walls are glass..<br>And many people pass through it 24/7.<br>Please sign the petition in the description of the video.<br><br><br><br><br>here is a public letter I sent to my teachers, it's all viral now, they also have a Facebook group.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Dear pak ferdi and Mr Bantleman<br><br>Hi! This is Neil, Neil ________ (Last name).<br>I am writing this letter addressing on your false accusations. I support you in every way there possibly is in the entire universe that we know of. The universe with such interesting creatures, one in particular. Us, humans.<br><br><br><br>We watch movies of superheroes that have the power to carry huge things, the power to fly. But sometimes, us, the regular people, Have the strongest power of them all. Hope. An optimized attitude, ability to do such great things, stronger than the strongest steel, Less violent then the most cutest puppy. A power, a talent only we have. Just like in the JIS values, perseverance, To not give up.&nbsp;<br><br><br><br><br>I cannot do much as I am only a child. But many others can. Share this message with all. Alert them that something can be done. I am only a child but I can do this. I can hope and persevere to something I wish. If only a child can achieve that, imagine what millions of people can achieve. As I am only A child, yet still I try. I am only a child but I do what I can do. I am doing the best I can.<br>So I hope you can get off your seat. And Hope. A power so great. This letter shall show you. Much greater things can be done, if you hope.&nbsp;<br><br><br><br>Pak ferdi, many years ago, You were the TA for the lunch duty. I ate very little back then. I would never finish my food and you would always tell me "One day, you'll finish it" And if I did, you would congratulate me. As I moved up the line, years go by. And now, its time for you to finish your "food", I'll be waiting at the end of the line. Waiting, to congratulate you.<br><br>Sincerely,<br>Neil
