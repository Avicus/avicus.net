Have a look at professional websites, that do gaming things, but 550 pounds is &nbsp;a bit ambitious for a gaming PC in terms of lowness in price, you might have to go above 700 pound.

Don't go with alienware. You might think they are good, but theres better. I would go on newegg.com and check out some lenovo gaming laptops. Not sure what you will get with your budget but thats your best bet.

Workstation pc's are extremely overpriced if your primary use is gaming, particularly minecraft. Also, there is no such thing as a "regular" i7

regular intel core i7, I mean as in intel core i7 with no 4770k or dat crap.<br><br>And i have this workstation for Solidworks -.- my dad lets me use it until my desktop can be fixed... (the hardrive and the GPU are broken for some reason)..<br>But i totally agree :P

There is no such thing as a "regular" i7. $3000 is a long way off from the $880 asked for in the OP. If it fits your specific uses and not his specific uses, why are your recommending it to him? The thread is not asking "Brag about your computer here" it is asking, quite specifically for a maximum $880 laptop that will run minecraft. I really do not understand the logic you are using here, and you clearly have a limited knowledge on computers and computer parts as I have noticed in previous threads.

I'd recommend getting one that has a solid state drive, at least 8gb of RAM,a decent graphics card, and at least a Core i5 or i7. The solid state drive really boosts FPS.
