I assume you meant everything on your Mac.<br><br>I don't really know, I used to use a Mac and yeah, it was really slow. But I just got a Windows pc. That's the only solution I know. Sorry :)

U guy FUKIN srs? Mac isn't bad. It's as good as PC. Btw I have 2012 Mac air and I can use Final Cut Pro x, Photoshop, and many programs with no problem. Mine craft isnt that hard as others. If you wanna get good fps, the solution isn't going Mac to PC. Mac is better then you guys guess.&nbsp;<br><br>And 'but a new pc' isn't a real solution. But 'clean your data/Use Dr. cleaner/ set your mc settings lower' is a solution

I know from personal experience that updating your applications and updating your system can make things a lot faster.

If it is an old model then it is just the computer getting old. I had a Macbook 2009 and it was just really slow. I now have a iMac Late 2013 Model and can run Minecraft, edit and upload videos fine. Everything I need.
