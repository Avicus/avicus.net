US 2016 Election Satire

</h1>
<p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px;  font-family: Helvetica;  ">Before I make this post, I want to explain that this is satire. I currently lean to the Conservative side of the political spectrum because basic Economics proves that less Government is better (Social issues aren’t too big of a deal when we are in 18.2 Trillion in Debt). But honestly, what your about to read is all satire, meant to be funny. (And yes, some stuff is exaggerated in this post. But some, surprisingly, isn’t)</p>
<p style="margin: 0px;  font-family: Helvetica;  "><br></p><p style="margin: 0px;  font-family: Helvetica;  ">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I feel bad for our next US generation. We have to vote for the people that will become the President and make up Congress. And honestly, it doesn’t matter which way you lean: they are all idiots.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px;  font-family: Helvetica;  "><br></p><p style="margin: 0px;  font-family: Helvetica;  ">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; First off, we’ve got the left (Liberal Democrats) who currently have a criminal running for office… And she’s the frontrunner!!! Jeopardizing our national security in return for payment (“Wait, do you mean wipe the servers with a cloth?” [Hillary Clinton to Justice Department]). The only qualification she has is that her husband was president and that the went to a few countries representing the US… First off, the first qualification is like asking Tom Brady’s wife to be the starter for the Patriots football team. “Having a talented husband makes you a talented person.” (Every Democratic this year) Secondly, everywhere she went for the US blew up in her face (Benghazi, Russia, Syria, shall I go on?) But wait! There’s more: The second one coming up the rear is a socialist named Bernie! Half of the US has only heard about his name, and about a tenth actually knows about his policies (not me!), but he might just be better than Hillary.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px;  font-family: Helvetica;  "><br></p><p style="margin: 0px;  font-family: Helvetica;  ">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And next off, we have the (Conservative Republicans) who currently have a buffoon and an army of idiots running for the primaries. Donny might be better than Hillary, but if he is: not by much. The (HUGE) wall building fanatic will most likely bar all immigration and build quite a few Trump hotels and casinos while in office (don’t worry, he promises they wont go bankrupt like last time). With an ego the size of the White House itself, we will most likely have a billionaire whose net worth changes based upon his mood in the White House. The next runner up (I think, honestly can’t keep up with 18 other people) is most likely Ben Carson! The next black president to take on America. With this man’s 0 years experience in politics or business, this man somehow is in second! Way to go for Neurosurgeons across the planet, we all appreciate this man’s brave and bold decision to attempt to become something in which he has no credentials for!</p>
<p style="margin: 0px;  font-family: Helvetica;  "><br></p><p style="margin: 0px;  font-family: Helvetica;  ">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Did you think I was done? Guess again. Next up, we have all of Congress (besides two thirds of the Senate) running for reelection! Now we can reelect men to go waste all of our money for us! You dignity think the last 11 trillion dollars in the last 7 years was just Obama? Think again! This loft of dumb asses will most likely be reelected (mostly). If you can, please vote for your local Potato Man to become your next Congressman/woman. We might have a positive change then!</p>
<p style="margin: 0px;  font-family: Helvetica;  "><br></p><p style="margin: 0px;  font-family: Helvetica;  ">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now, I know Im asking a lot from a Nation fool of idiots (roughly 51% in 2012 [people that voted Obama]), but please find someone to vote for (if you can). Lets get these dunces out of office and vote for a real person. Thats right, Im trying to rally support for the one, the only Kanye West to become our next Supreme Dictator. He promises to not only balance the budget, but he shall do good for our great nation under God. He says that, “I’m the closest that hip-hop is getting to God. In some situations I’m like a ghetto Pope. (Kanye)” If this man’s ambitions are to become the Pope one day, don’t you think he is qualified to run this nation? I do! So go influence someone today and change America.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px;  font-family: Helvetica;   min-height: 17px;"><br></p>
<p style="margin: 0px;  font-family: Helvetica;  ">God Bless “The Tupac of Clothing (Kanye)”</p>

You're claiming how Clinton, Carson and Trump have no qualifications because of their lack of political background, yet you are claiming that Kanye does because of promises that don't have any ground.&nbsp;<br><br>In my opinion, Carson is extremely qualified. He's experienced the toughest parts of life and excelled, and I think that he can provide the leadership that this nation needs.

I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but recently I have learned that Darth Vader is actually Ukrainian. He is currently (or was, it was a while ago) running for the presidency on Ukraine's Internet Party. Unfortunately for us Americans, he most likely is not eligible to run for the US 2016 Presidency because of his lack of citizenship and Constitutional Rights. <br><br>For more information regarding these surprisingly true facts (no BS here...), please look at the few reliable articles below:&nbsp;<br><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2014/10/27/the-real-loser-in-ukraines-election-darth-vader/" title="Link: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2014/10/27/the-real-loser-in-ukraines-election-darth-vader/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2014/10/27/the-real-loser-in-ukraines-election-dar...</a><br><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/31/ukraine-darth-vader-president-internet-party" title="Link: http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/31/ukraine-darth-vader-president-internet-party">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/31/ukraine-darth-vader-president-internet-party</a><br><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-26882664" title="Link: http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-26882664">http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-26882664</a>

You know in order to assume an office in the executive branch you need to hand control of your buisiness while in office, Trump can't really coordinate with his interests (himself) to abuse his position. This is why we don't have Bill Gates running for president. Billionaires love their money, imo Trump is running as a publicity stunt.

Trump has always made poor decisions, it's nothing new. If he wants a publicity stunt, he already has enough fuel to last a while, especially with the media all over him. I think he's just dumb enough to legitimately try.
