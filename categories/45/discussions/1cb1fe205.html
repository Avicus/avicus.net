Hudmister,<br><br>It's a good thing that you're putting in the effort beforehand to start working on making money, because it will really make the mile in the long run.<br>So here's what I do to make money, and it takes very little work, just plenty of studying and research.<br>With a parent or guardian, you can set up your own way to invest in stocks, or shares of companies. Normally, your parent or guardian will have a decent understanding of the stock market, and investing in stocks would be a fantastic way for you to make money, and a great learning experience.

You have a 14 in your name, if you're actually 14 you're able to get a work permit I believe. Do some research on google and it could help you out.

Yesssss! That's what I do! @OP look into a Roth IRA. This will keep your money that you got from investing tax free until you take it out in retirement! But for right now, try walking dogs, or shoveling snow (winter), or raking leaves! That will give you a base.

Also, of you are interested in Law Enforcement, a lot of county sheriff departments have youth programs where they train you, and do police stuff. Even if you don't want to be a cop when you grow up, it is a beneficial experience.

You need to make an account with a source of money, which is where the parent or guardian comes in.

Just getting into it is where the studying and research comes in. Then again, you're not going to start out putting too much into it in most cases, so if you play your cards right and look into what you purchase, you will make much more than you lose.

Stocks will take along time, but you will gain some pretty good money at the end.<br>ATM, stocks are going down horribly, this could be a bad or great way to earn some money depanding on how you play it.<br>And yes, as sulorak said, you should <b>definitly</b> read about it and study it.<br>I hope I helped!

Ahh, so you're not really amazing at sculpting, drawing, reading, etc? You can sell those talents if you have even the slightest interest. But if you need quick money garage sales work as well (or anything you'd like to get rid of for cash).

Dude, some people like to make really cool YouTube banners, sometimes for money. Also, there's a big thing out there for desktop backgrounds and cool looking images. If you're really interested in Photoshop, you could even consider a career in things related like magazine covers, etc. It's just a thought but it could go a long way.

Costco sells iPhone 6 16gb for like $20.00 usd, if you sell it for around $40, that's a nice profit and a good deal for the people who sell it to you since they'll get it for around $160 lower than the normal price.<br><br>What most people want:<br>1. iPhones and other smartphones<br>2.

I don't think the US site ships to Australia, but Australia Costco has the same things I'd assume, but you need a membership to actually shop and it only has 7 locations so unless you live near the locations, use ebay or google shopping or maybe gumtree, which all have&nbsp;cheap things compared to what you usually get.<br><br>Costco Locations:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.costco.com.au/Common/ContactUs.shtml" title="Link: http://www.costco.com.au/Common/ContactUs.shtml">http://www.costco.com.au/Common/ContactUs.shtml</a><br>Gumtree:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gumtree.com.au/s-phones/iphone+6/k0c18313" title="Link: http://www.gumtree.com.au/s-phones/iphone+6/k0c18313">http://www.gumtree.com.au/s-phones/iphone+6/k0c18313</a><br>Google:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com.au/search?q=iphone+6" title="Link: https://www.google.com.au/search?q=iphone+6">https://www.google.com.au/search?q=iphone+6</a><b></b><b><br></b>
