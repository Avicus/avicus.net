</div>
Well when the initial game came out I loved it! It was fast paced and fun and everything was great. However, then I started to realize that the amount of luck in mk8 is significantly higher than in past games. Now, every since the last DLC pack back in November I feel that the items have been a little bit nice, and maybe they will change some things in the next DLC pack that counes out on the 23rd, but I can only wish. It is a fantastic game still! Its the best looking game on the Wii U, Deffinatly best sound track by far. So yes it is a fantastic buy! I highly recommend it, but there will be raging also bundled with the game so be cautious.
