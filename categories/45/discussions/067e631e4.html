So I recently had a friend who lost his father to cancer and the topic of, "Why do bad things happen to good people?" came up in my psychology class. I already have a pretty solid answer on why it happens but I wanted to hear your opinions.<br><br>So, opinions?

Theres not really a logical answer to that, in my opinion.<br>Unless you believe in god, which i dont.<br>Bad or good things, can happen to bad or good people wether it be the post above, or the other way around. There isnt some high and mighty all knowing creature up there that decides what happens to who, wether they be good or bad.<br>But in general, if you are a good person,&nbsp;<b><i>Good things will happen to you.<br>But, if you are a bad person, Generally bad things will happen to you more often</i></b>

Its kind of harsh but think of it this way, without bad things, would you be able to appreciate anything?

<p>There's a reason for everything. If nothing bad <i>ever</i> <i></i><i></i>happened, what would a <i>good</i> thing be. We wouldn't know what a good thing is. Imagine of nothing bad EVER happened, what&nbsp; would the world be like. Most of us would say 'Perfect' I don't think so. The world would be full of people who think they get everything they want all the time. It's impossible to have something bad not happen, other wise no one would die, and we wouldn't be able to walk out of our own house.</p>

Everything happens for a reason, you probably heard this soo many times, but it's true. I thoroughly believe in this, everything happens for you to become stronger. A lot of things happened in my life, which still irritates me but then I think what I'm going to achieve from this, then life's all Gucci. Trust me.

This same thing happened to me, instead of my father, my grandfather. I do believe in God. I really believe that he is better off where he is now, rather then where he was, suffering in a hospital every few weeks.

Well usually happy and good people can enjoy what they got untill they are actually dead.<br>Sad and mean people will have nothing, untill they are dead.<br><br>I'll rather live 30 years of happiness than 70 years of sadness

what is life if it has no conflicts? bad things make us who we are. if you're father passed away, the way you deal with that would change who you are. you could try and seek revenge or move on in life and think about what he would've wanted you to do. if everything in life was good and happy, life would be pointless and boring. you would automatically know that you were gonna win 1st place since you were a good person. ruins the suspense.

Good people are still people, they are not immune to the risks of life merely cos of character...<br>tho it certainly helps, if you believe in one of those sorts of religions...

I honestly dont know, no logical explenation.<br><br>But me, being christian, I honestly think that the good people die early, to go to Heaven. Idk, maybe something else. They say life isnt fair, right?

Cancer is a horrible disease. It runs in my family, but just know this.<br><br>My grandfather had cancer for 70 years. He had one stroke and survived, a heart attack and survived, heck he even got rid of cancer.<br><br>When it isn't your time to die, you won't die. When it is, you will die.<br><br>My condolences to his family and friends. :)

What evidence is there to support the claim: good things happen to bad people?<br><br>There's no statistical evidence showing that someone who's nice or kind-hearted goes through unfortunate events. The chances of this happening are, most of the time, coincidental. We only use this phrase because we're able to relate it to so many second-hand experiences and use it to classify what we're currently experiencing.<br><br>And to go even deeper and somewhat broader, what would be the direct guideline for "good?" We're not good people under any circumstance. We've all done wacky shit and things we regret that have probably caused some major damage in our lives. Just because you did that&nbsp;one good deed doesn't mean you automatically qualify as a kind person.&nbsp;<br><br>Wouldn't this then lead you to believe that the phrase "bad things happen to good people" is completely false as the idea stated above blocks out the independent subject(good people in this case)?
