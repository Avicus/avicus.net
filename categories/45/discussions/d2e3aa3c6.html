What? since when do you have to be good at pvp?<br>No one has to be good at pvp, and Optifine Capes certainly don't make anyone any better at pvp than what they are...<br>if you make fun of someone for their pvp, that's just wrong...

He is not. You don't usually find a good pvper without an optifine cape. It's just how it is.

And also, look at all the players in the top 10 I don't think any of them simply don't have a cape.

Having an optifine cape doesn't automatically put you in the expectation to be good at pvp, after all, I have an optifine cape, and I'm bad at pvp :P<br><br>It doesn't matter how many people have OF capes, the generalization is that it's more of a 50 - 50 thing, more people that are more popular just happen to have them.

You can get an OptiFine cape, but they cost money and can only be seen by people running OptiFine.<br><br>Or you can go to Minecon, which is hard to do, and costs a ton of money depending on where it is and where you live.
