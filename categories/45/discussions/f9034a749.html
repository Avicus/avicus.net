<b>If you, like me, play walls more than any other game, you know that Polar needs a pat on the back. He has made more maps than anyone else I know, and fast! Polar has a way of making time to create the biggest, and most amazing maps out there! The maps he makes are sometimes have bugs and need tweaking, so he spectates us testing them out, and he fixes it right away. He built the majority of all the maps on walls, which is amazing! Anyways, Polar, if you see this, please know that your spectacular, and give yourself a pat on the back! </b><b>-Ez &lt;3</b>

Really like the Map Devs really proud of them they are amazing. Also like to see people to make these type of forum posts. The MapDevs are people who can create MineCraftArt. Anyways congrats to all of you MapDevs. Sometimes you guys will be forgotten but you guys are people where you can learn from.....
