<b>Why do you have the skin you have?</b><br>I made this skin &nbsp;while ago as a "PVP skin". It was a temporary skin but now that I have a new computer and haven't got my old skins currently on this computer, I'm stuck with this one, which is fine because I've always liked this skin.&nbsp;<br><b>Did you make it yourself?<br></b>Every skin I have every made has been original.&nbsp;<br><b>Where'd you get it if you didn't make it?<br></b>N/A<br><b>Do you plan to change it when 1.8 comes out?<br></b>Yes, I have made a handful of skins since I started Minecraft, I plan to make a skin that merges them all together to form one "Super skin" if you will.<br><br>This skin isn't supposed to resemble anything and is completely random if you were wondering.<br><br>And there you go :)

My skin is me. Legit, so close. I'm even wearing the bear onesie as I type. I chose it for this reason, plus #OnesieRevolution. I edited a skin with my old one, then added the onesie. I plan to make the onesie 3D in 1.8.

<ul><li>Why do you have the skin you have?&nbsp;<b>I found a website on the old forums to add a new layer to your skin. Evocal made the skin inside the onesie, and I&nbsp;experimented and added this onesie layer. I liked it and I kinda kept it until I used novaskin to make wallpapers. My skin would always glitch and turn parts of the teeth black. So I changed the skin, and I messed it up terribly so I had to add a different onesie.&nbsp;</b></li><li>Did you make it yourself?<b> No</b></li><li>Where'd you get it if you didn't make it?<b> Evocal and a website</b></li><li>Do you plan to change it when 1.8 comes out?&nbsp;<b>No</b></li></ul>

My skin has gone through a lot of changes, all are custom made by me. My first skin was a Priest shrouded in gold with a wide smile and a golden tooth. He was a priest of the Toastism religion, centered around the wonderful wonders of toasted bread, and he had a piece of bread on his back. I had him for a long time, and only recently changed it this year, before I joined Avicus, to my adventurer, and even more recently, like last month, I changed it to this Constable skin, for a roleplay server I belong to. All have kept the same smile and golden tooth :)<br><br><br><ul><li>So, atm my skin is a constable for a roleplay server</li><li>Yes I did make it myself</li><li>I will probably change back to my priest cuz I miss it.</li></ul>

I have this skin because I like Pokemon trainer skins.<br>I didnt make it, but PlaZa_17 edited my original trainer skin and made it blue so we could match (then he changed his to like him as a 2 year old).<br>And I might consider changing it to something... different

<ul><li>I used to have an Herobrine skin but one day i decided to change it (it was before i discover Avicus). I have a ninja doge because in that time doge was a really popular meme. I just added the ninja part because, well, ninjas are cool aren't they? xD</li><li>I grabbed the Doge skin from a website and then added a ninja custom made by myself.</li><li>I don't remember where i grabbed the Doge part...<br></li><li>Hell nah ;P</li></ul>
