So, what's the most embarrassing thing that happened to you?<br><br>Mine happened just a couple of days back. I was at my gym period at school, and it was just ending. We were all crowding at the door to let us back in from outside. My friend happened to be there with some of his friends. Well, he just recently broke his ankle, but that's not the point. Anyway, suddenly, he slaps my butt (he does that a lot). I'm stunned for a second, giving him time to pants me. The worst part about it was that everyone in my gym period was there to see (if not the people around me) and....<br><br><b><i><u>My Crush<br></u></i></b><br>Great, now I have some things to deal with.<br><br>But anyway, what's the most embarrassing thing that happened to you?

In my school, if you pantsed, you wouldn't be there the next day.&nbsp;<br><br>Anyways, I can't think of anything extremely embarrassing. I mean in 4th grade I once slipped on some ice and fell into a huge water puddle ass first. That wasn't enjoyable.

I was playing basketball trying to impress my crush but when i jumped for the ball... LEts just say things did not end well..<br><br><br>Also, another embarassing moment ((didnt happen to me). A small student climed the wall to get a grip on the basketball board support bar. He was haning there bragging his students that he was the best climber. Eventually, a person pants him and threw his shorts in the grass field (it happened in the gym btw) and everyone saw his boxers. Again, lets just say, it was very bad for him ;-; (happneed in high school)

Eh.. .-.<br><br>Happened yesterday. Me and Jozz really like to share nightcore over Skype, but sometimes he sends me tons of links of songs I like :)<br>But yesterday, I was in school, and I forgot to put my phone on the do not disturb mode, and right when the lesson started, Jozz decided to send me around 10 songs, but here comes the embarrassing part. I brought MLG to my school. So I decided to set my message ringtone to "OH BABY A TRIPLE OH YEAH", and then Jozz messages me all of these songs and the teacher is like, there is no reason to laugh! And right 2 seconds after it OHVBABY A TRIPLEEE PH YEAH scrims all over my class 10 times..XD

This happened to me a week ago. So I was falling asleep as I read a book, as you do and eventually did fall asleep. Mind you, this was IN school. Anyways, I was dreaming and stuff when I suddenly wake up and I was surprised when I still at school, but someone two tables across from where I was, walked up to me and asked "Are you asleep Warbry/irlname?" From there I woke up but I panicked so I just said "Nope." From there I just Wtf'd at the fact I fell asleep during class.

If someone pantsed someone else in my school they would probably have ISS (In School Suspension).&nbsp;<br>Once I walked into the ladies bathroom in an airport, but I was young so people probably thought I was a girl. xD

I just remembered another one. At my school I told 2 kids which girl I like.. I invited them to my birthday party. Obviously when we are in the car to get back home &nbsp;(My 2 friends and my step dad are in the car) One of them whispers to the other person something about the girl I like.. Then I say "What?". Then they said "Wait do you like x or x again?" and my stepfather heard that and I don't like him so it bothered me a lot and embarrassed me.

I was in France once on a school trip, (bear in mind I speak little to no French) and I walk into a toilet clearly labeled Men's. Upon entering the toilet and locking the door behind me, I hear the main door open and some feminine giggles coming from outside the toilet. I panic, I finish my business and walk out to see 4 middle-aged French women staring at me looking scared out of their minds. But then, to make matters worse, I make eye contact with one as I walk out, and for some reason I smile. It must have been the creepiest looking smile, because this woman goes gasping into the toilet I was just in.<br>And I forgot to flush.<br><br>Also, is it bad that I've read every single one of the posts on this thread?

Your friend slapped you in the butt? That's really awkward specially next to your crush but you should've acted a different why like slapping your friend or something, considering that you guys hit each other in the butt.

Mine would be...<br><br>When I was walking around, minding my own business, when I noticed a bunch of people staring at me and snickering. I discreetly looked down at myself, and noticed that somehow, my bra strap had come undone and was poking out my sleeve.<br><br>I turned a deep red, and walked away to the bathroom. My hand holding my arm like I was injured.

I got a kiss from my grandma and then there was a big lip mark. Then I went to the krusty krab and everyone made fun of me. Then I told grandma kissies are for babies and then Patrick got all the attention.
