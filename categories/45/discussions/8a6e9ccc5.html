Hey this is just for me apologizing to all the mods and all the people I have hurt or offended I'd like to just state I'm not actually the same person in game as I am in irl and most of the things I said to people were stupid and not called for and I would have made a list of people to say sorry too I would just do it through here and I hope we can put the past behind us and I have been talking to Excellence and I'm done ban evading I'm gonna either appeal again on my birthday June 15 next year or when I'm off to grade 10 until then or ever this is good bye thanks for the memories&nbsp;<br><br>Love You All &lt;3<br><br>Sincerely-Sheepy

You were really rude to me 9 hours ago but ok :D<br>Here are some tips on getting appealed. I ban evaded like you so I ended up waiting 3-4 months for an unban. I believe you should wait about 6-7 months and you will be appealed. Another tip is to make numerous posts on the server's forums. These posts may include helping others by answering their questions. In your appeal make sure to right exactly how you feel about your ban. If you post something like.......<br><br>"I really wanna be unbanned. I have changed and I am not ban evading ever again."<br>To my understandings that would get denied. Actually put meaning into the appeal and don't lie. Adding the mods on skype and talking to them will increase your chance of getting appealed because they will actually start thinking you have changed.<br><br>Good Luck buddy boi. If you are still mad at me after I helped you it's ok :D I understand

I never really knew you until I saw all the ban evasions, but hope you get appealed and come back on the server. In the meantime, have fun and good luck with life.

I used to skype dawson (Sheep_Ship) and he was replying to your posts. He was saying in the skype chat you are being rude to him. Sheep is actually a nice guy, you just have to know him a lot better.
