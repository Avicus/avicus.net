Hey guys I have a YouTube channel and I use Fraps to record and movie maker to edit. Although I'm getting tired of movie maker, is there any free editing software with no watermark? No I don't want to go straight away by torrenting or illegally downloading, unless its that good lol. Also if you know a better recording software please tell me! I'm fine with fraps, but sometimes I like to try out new things :)

Hey, I use Sony Vegas to edit but I think you could use that but I think for you I would commend to you Camtasia Studio and use the Camtasia Editor. Myself for a few scenes in my YouTube videos I am forced to use Camtasia Editor because of what I wanted todo then I would use Sony Vegas.<br><br>You can easily Google 'How to get cracked version of _______' either Camtasia or Sony Vegas. Try them out and come back and ask me if you need help.

There is a glitch or trick that you can use if you look at my response above I told you how to do it, by basically Googleing or searching it on YouTube.

Yes xd<br>It may be a good way to start if you don't have a lot of money tho because all the good programs cost a lot of money.<br><br>I guess it's your choice, I was full legal with my recording software and editing software and thumbnail making (photoshop elements) were they were all paid but now I'm moving to photoshop, adobe premiere pro and after effects which cost much more if I were to pay irl.

Nope. Just like pirating movies or anything on the internet these days, millions of people do stuff like this every day, and no one gets caught.

Yeah I agree with Vlad here all my software I use (exempting Camtasia) was all paid by me. FRAPS, Sony Vegas and Paint.net (which is free) all paid and owned by me.

It's not meant todo that, which means you must have either done it wrong or you must restart the process and recommend following a YouTube video.
