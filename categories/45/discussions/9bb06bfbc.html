Hello there!<br>Here is a new Forum Minigame called A poem to a friend.<br>It is pretty easy;<br>You have to write a poem to a friend, to your best friend.<br>It's steps are first think about your best friend, someone who you love with your heart and would give anything for his/her safety, or a really good friend. Think in what he/she makes you happy, why is your friend, why he/she makes you feel special, etc.<br><br>I'll give mine as example.<br><b>Mine:&nbsp;<br></b>"<i>I know I say it and repeat it everytime, but I never can stop feeling very glad for have you as friend: Thank you for be my friend. Thank you for understand me everytime. Basically, you are the reason of why I'm alive, otherwise, I surely won't be alive. You are what makes me happy, what makes me wake up each morning, and go to sleep each night. You are the reason of why now I'm being happy, and why I feel I'm special only with you. You occupied a very special place in my heart, and if you'd stop being my friend, my life would stop having sense. the best part of all is that everything I wrote is truth, and I wrote it with my heart. I love you, friend. Promise me you will never stop being my friend, because &nbsp;you are who helps me and supports me in the downs and the ups.</i>" - I don't feel very comfortable publicly saying to who I wrote this poem, but if you want to know, feel free to ask.<br><b><br>P.S.:&nbsp;</b><i><u>Please note that you can if you want tell to who was directed the poem tell us, otherwise it isn't necessary.</u></i> Thank you. :)<br>Please, do not spam. I'm talking seriously, don't make any spammy post here. :)

<b>Shooting Star&nbsp;</b><i>by: Owl City<br><br></i>Close your tired eyes, relaxing them.<br>Count from 1 to 10 and open them.<br>All these heavy thoughts will try to weigh you down, but not this time.<br><br>Way up in the air, you're finally free, and you can stay up there, right next to me.<br>All this gravity will try to pull you down, but not this time.<br><br>When the sun goes down, and the lights burn out,<br>Then it's time for you to shine.<br>Brighter than the shooting star, so shine no matter where you are.<br>Fill the darkest night, with a brilliant light,<br>'cause it's time for you to shine.<br>Brighter than a shooting star, so shine no matter where you are, tonight.<br><br>Wooh, wooh, wooh.<br>Brighter than a shooting star,<br>Shine no matter where you are, tonight.<br><br>Gazing through my eyes, when the fire starts,<br>And fan the flame so hot, it melt our hearts.<br>All the pouring rain, will try to put it out, but not this time.<br><br>Let your colours burn, and brightly burst, into a million sparks, but all dispursed and illuminate a world,<br>That'll try to bring you down,<br>But not this time.<br><br>When the sun goes down, and the lights burn out,<br>Then it's time for you to shine.<br>Brighter than the shooting star, so shine no matter where you are.<br>Fill the darkest night, with a brilliant light,<br>'cause it's time for you to shine.<br>Brighter than a shooting star, so shine no matter where you are, tonight.<br><br>Wooh, wooh, wooh.<br>Brighter than a shooting star,<br>Shine no matter where you are, tonight.<br><br>A thousand heartbeats beating time, and makes this dark planet come alive. So when the lights flicker out tonight, you gotta shine.<br><br>When the sun goes down, and the lights burn out,<br>Then it's time for you to shine.<br>Brighter than the shooting star, so shine no matter where you are.<br>Fill the darkest night, with a brilliant light,<br>'cause it's time for you to shine.<br>Brighter than a shooting star, so shine no matter where you are, tonight.<br><br>Wooh, wooh, wooh.<br>Brighter than a shooting star,<br><span>Shine no matter where you are, tonight.<br></span><br>&nbsp;<br>I dont know, I tought of this as an inspiring song so i decided to share it with you guys &lt;3&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7KMRBoqQUg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7KMRBoqQUg</a><br>Yes I know this is not a poem, but songs are really Free Verse :P
