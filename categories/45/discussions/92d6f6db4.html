Howdy there,<br>I am Zac. I am applying for mod with the intention of getting Senior Mod quickly. I have been criticized for the methods I use to push my agenda on avicus which include: threatening, ddosing, keylogging, leaking, and blackmailing. I find my methods effective and the best way to get avicus staff which I am generally extremely critical of to do things I believe are good either for myself or for the network. In an effort to become more translucent with the community and staff team to gain their trust despite the methods I have used in the past I will be accepting questions both on TS and here with full honesty as long as these questions are of substance and are not useless questions such as "What is your favorite color" or questions soliciting certain sensitive material such as "what was said in staff chat on 12/11/2016 at 5:30 pm?". An example of a question would be "How do you justify keylogging or ddosing morally?" or "How did you get steven unbanned?". Please note that I can and will only answer the questions to the best of my ability so if I do not know certain information I cannot share it. I would ask that despite the controversial topics and questions being asked staff allow this chat to remain open since I do this with the intention of being honest with the community and them. I hope that at the end of this you can see the benefits to having me as a Senior Mod and will support me in this en-devour. :)<br><br>I will cover a few things first:<br>I want Senior Mod to fix TS, the staff team and the rules. In fixing TS I intend to overhaul TS and rebuild it to get rid of useless features while retaining the core elements that make our TS such a great community building service. In fixing the staff team I intend to change the moderating program to focus more on activity and training especially in the mentor department. In fixing the rules I intend to make a public guideline as to which the staff team will abide by with reasonable leniency for moderator discretion. In addition the rules would be made to encompass the widest variety of infractions yet as to leave no doubt when punishing.<br><br>Thanks.

1. I along with Venomous and Michael made an atlas update for avicus on another TS which fixed many issues. It was never released despite it being finalized 2 months before actual atlas and kylo being notified of it's completion.<br><br>2. I was a part of a team that had several disagreements about the direction we should be going in.

I only have one question. I'm not criticising you or your methods, much as I detest them. However, here it is: Why don't you just create your own Teamspeak and invite people to do it instead of constantly going on and on about the ranks on a block game server? Would it not make more sense to create your own Teamspeak that you have absolute control over?

I personally do not have avicus members keylogged however I have associates who do. I do not know specifics due to my minimal amount of actual involvement with that side of our operation. I act as a face to me and my associates however my involvement in these matters is really minimal. What details I can afford you I will however: Arigenn (currently), Para (at least formerly, Keenan (at least formerly), multiple current and former developers, at least 2 officials, at least 5 moderators, at least 1 junior moderator, at least 1 senior moderator.

I have my own TS. The reason why people on the staff team ask these sorts of questions is because they believe that the only way to show actual care towards the server and the community is to be a staff member or a minimod. I have interest in avicus and it's community so I stick around.

And you believe that keylogging, blackmailing, and DDOSing the people who run the server and are the reason why it's even still around is a good way to get your message across? It just makes the problem worse as staff members resign and begin to neglect their responsibilities as a result.

The results. I have acheived a number of things in my agenda through these methods. I define effective as the greatest possible result while spending the lowest possible amount of resources, in the case of the listed actions it requires no time of my own and no responsibilities added.

I had access to TS before and the user database, not to mention I have a senior mod who leaks to me regularly (senior mods have access to it as well) if I wanted a regular user's ip I would have it. The only time I actually participated in ddosing someone on avicus is when they have threatened me or ddosed my friends. Outside of that it has all been threats as far as ddosing goes. If that makes you uneasy sorry, but honestly unless you have a properly set up vpn it is so easy to get your ip that you really shouldn't feel anymore uneasy than normally.

I respect that but keylogging junior moderators and moderators doesn't seem practical at all.

This is true. It is completely illegal. Idk what you mean when you say "&nbsp;especially in real life". It is effective because it gets me results. You can give me an argument saying it is immoral and I will discuss this with you but it is effective regardless. You listing all the information I can get just proves how it is effective. I have not chosen to use any passwords or bank details that I recieved while doing this maliciously so I also fail to see how that is a good argument for it being immoral.

Tbh, I think he only did that to see what's happening in the Staff Team currently, so he knows what to fix if he makes it back onto the Staff Team, so that he doesn't have to waste time finding solutions...that's just my opinion.

I did what I did for multiple reasons. I fixed things while not being staff however you are right in your assumption that I wanted to know what was wrong with the staff team to address these issues, however there are other reasons as well.

i'm a bit skeptical about whether or not you actually did any keylogging or ddosing, but i suppose extravagant claims like that will instill a healthy amount of fear or perhaps even respect in the relatively young userbase of the server.<br><br>anyways you have my support because it's pretty clear at this point that the so-called "establishment" has lost control of the situation on the server

You keylogged staff members. It may have not been directly, but you still caused it. You didn't plenty of bad things after you lost your rank. Not to mention, your encouraging that friend of your son to spam the forums in order to get your way.

+1&nbsp;<br>I've seen some good things come of you in the past and some of the things your proposing to help the server grow seem very convincing. I'm curious to see how far you get as to become staff with the knowledge some people have of you but anyone willing to help the server in ways your proposing is a hit from me as I've seen some of the darker sides of staff and avicus in general. Anyways goodluck on your way and hope to see changes once I'm unbanned seemings how avicus has potential to be a great server. But with the way things are running currently I don't see a chance of recovery or the community changing

I want to be senior mod to push this agenda. While I can't promise it will be done (due to me having to work with other seniors), I can promise you that I will be far more effective at pushing these changes than current seniors who are either inactive or unmotivated to change. At a senior mod level I want to change the way topics are handled. I want to make a voting doc where if an issue recieves 1/3 of the senior staff support for it to go to a vote then it gets entered into a doc. Where in order to vote senior mods must be able to explain their pov and vote within 72 hours at which point voting closes. This should help us get through issues quicker and help push more points on my agenda. I would also want to be assigned to the mod training and TS departments to help the sections that are more my specialty.

You listed only the bad things without mentioning the part about joining the staff team. I am going to assume what you mean is "Did you seriously do that". The answer is more or less because although I am not directly responsible I am in the end the source of it happening.

It wouldn't exactly save reputation, but I haven't noticed as a community member from a user standpoint the staff trying to fix their public persona. It is how it is, we're tight knit so a lot can go by quick with spread of information. We don't need to fix up our presentation but just fix up ourselves and let the presentation do the work for us.

Yes I broke many rules, if I got caught I would be banned. You wouldn't believe how much they discuss banning me anyways. However, if I were banned what would that solve. Look at steven, he is network banned and he still gets on, spams and forums and is possibly more active than ever.

Just a prediction of sorts.<br><br>And if you want, and make it to mod, I am willing to coach you and give advice providing you ask. I'd rather have you going in ready and prepared.

Teamwork: I don't think many people on the senior team appreciate the ways I do things and would resent me, hopefully we could move past it together and work well as a team.<br><br>Thanks for the support, I'll hit you up when/if I need anything.

 According to all known laws
of aviation,

  
there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.

  
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.

  
The bee, of course, flies anyway

  
because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.

I would continue if I were not given staff, yes. As stated I find the methods effective but not appropriate for use when staff. It is not intended as a threat but if you want to view it by such terms I understand how you would assume this.

I believe it was you and spookz who once told me that I should use legitimate staff means to change the staff team rather than all the other things I am known for. I would assume that this means you were only telling me to do this in order to try and convince me to stop doing bad stuff without actually thinking of what you were suggesting to me.

I did not ddos, kelog and blackmail people into ruining their lives or anything. I did it to the extent of reaching some benefit for either me, my friends or the network. Its like saying why do mods ban community members if they love the community. In my case is done sometimes in self interest but I also do it to make the server better.
