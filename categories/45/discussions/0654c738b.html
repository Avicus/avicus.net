Okay, for starters, im writing this on my phone, so apologies for mis-spelling<br><br><br>Okay, where to begin, lets start with my first week or so on avicus,it mostly consisted of me playing nebula and not talking to anyone, even when i did talk to someone, it was most of the time insulting. And, that attitude started to change when i met 3 important people, bennettxl, mlgtino, and panda137, as i had people i could call friends or allies. As time went on, i grew in skill and started to know the maps, and i met new people ingame too, however, i wanted to talk to them, i wanted to HEAR them, so i connected to the teamspeak server for the first time, around january or so. I met great people like gi_jose, steven, emerald, hunting chick, and many more that i cant remember. In the next few months, it seemed that alot of players knew me, and i was still active on teamspeak, this was around the time that i got 5th prestige in nebula, at that point that was my goal, 5th prestige. And when i completed said goal, i would leave.<br><br>But i couldnt leave.. Id lose all the great friends id have made, like yoav, nolan, mooch and the list goes on and on, i didnt want to abandon them, i felt.. Attached to them, in a friendship way.<br><br>and just recently.. Something remarkable happened to me, i got accepted for interviews, i can clearly remember everyone saying in march or so " glitchy if you get mod youd ban someone for faggot" &nbsp;id never actually do that..<br><br>I think i should atop rambling, and all i have to say for everyone on the server, thank you so much for being here for me &lt;3
