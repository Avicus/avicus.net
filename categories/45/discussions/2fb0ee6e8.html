hi, I'm looking for a great budget phone, which one out of these two? Oneplus X, oneplus 2 or the moto x 2015? At the moment I've got a moto x 2014 and it's time for an upgrade. Or ditch them all and get a nexus 6? Hehehe

I've used my friend's OnePlus 2 and I'd say it's a pretty solid phone. Although I'm an iPhone user, I would definitely consider using the OnePlus 2.<br><br>Goodluck. Take your time finding the right one. :)

Dont get an iPhone. Chargers are fragile, ends up dying if you update it too much, etc. My brother has a Samsung Note 5 and it's one of the best ever. :^)

The one plus 2 is a great option if you can get it. The X is a even better performance/dollar champ. Advantage of the Moto x is the better customization and the to you already familiar OS which is almost stock Android.

Of the ones you listed, the Oneplus X is noticeably weaker than the other two.<br><br>Here you make a choice between power and looks.<br><br>The Oneplus Two looks like quite a powerful beast. Two quad core processors, 3 gb of ram and a powerful GPU for a mobile. With a 1080p screen it's got quite a high pixel density which looks very nice. It also has a nice 13mp camera.<br><br>The Moto X 2015 has its own strengths. It also has 3 gb of ram, but instead of two quad core CPU's it has one quad core and a dual core. Despite this is still quite a hefty amount of processing that it can do. The GPU is also of a slightly older model from the Oneplus Two, however also still very powerful. What the moto x does have, is a very very nice 1440p screen, with a pixel density so high you literally won't see a single dot with your naked eye. It also has an impressive 21mp camera.<br><br>This is just the generally important specs of those two phones, but there's more you might like to take into account. Things like storage limitations, the OS layout and features, and many other smaller things.<br><br>Anyways, I hope this helped :)
