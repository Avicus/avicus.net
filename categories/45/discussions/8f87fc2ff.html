Trys everything to keep a relationship from failing and is good when it comes to listening and talking (not to girls). Also know best for his abilities and experience in bed. A great friend and the best boyfriend to be with. On the other hand not the best person to mess with because he can fight. Adrian for some reason cannot hold a grudge for little things, but can and will not let it go if it horible. Even if he says he got over it (he really didn't). Another thing is once he likes someone he wont move on til he gets that person or he finally accepts that he is never going to get her. BUT just give him a chance... he may just be the best thing thats ever happen to you.<br><br>c: xD Kinda true doe o.o</span>

Watch out, my butt has sunshine.&nbsp;<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Quinn">http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Quinn</a><br>The hottest piece of man-meat ever to exist. An intellect sharp as a knife, and a wit to match. Quinn's generally are always right, which bothers people, but Quinn then gently explains why it's okay that he's right, which calms them down. Women are naturally attracted to Quinn's, mainly because of their swimmer bodies, which consist of rocking abs, massive biceps, calves of iron, steel triceps, etc. People are jealous of Quinn's, because they are very fun to drink with, and an absolute god in bed. Easily described as bisexy, Quinn's have tight buns, and chiseled features that could score glass. Most usually half asian. Quinn's are friends with all the beautiful, gorgeous, popular, movie-star-type people. In fact, a Quinn began that clique. The sun shines out of Quinn's anus, and makes everyone smile when Quinn walks by. Quinn is always more successful then everyone else in everything. It has been said that everything that has ever happened in history has been either the result of a Quinn, or happened to produce a Quinn. Getting a Quinn for a friend is the best thing that could happen to anyone, a Quinn will light up the dark, will make the ordinary extraordinary, make the plain magnificent. In Quinn's hands you will find trust and comfort, happiness, and joy. Everyone trusts Quinn, and in turn Quinn will always be trustworth. A Quinn is an aesthetically pleasing addition to any room, and brings a unique pleasing aroma into the room, not unlike a basket of roses after a mid-days shower. THE most amazing guy you will EVER meet.<br>Hot Girl: OH MY GOD THAT MAN IS BEAUTIFUL!<span><br>Hot Girl's (Non-gay) Man Friend: Yes he is, he is totally a Quinn.</span>
