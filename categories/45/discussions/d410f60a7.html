<b>Hey Guys!</b><br><br>So, I don't know how to start this off...<br><br>I
 first joined Avicus in 2013 when it was still McZone. I had just 
started Minecraft and I asked my cousin if he knew any good servers. He 
brought me here. (This was the first server I joined). Avicus was easily
 the best server I ever played on. I went through many good times and 
bad times on this server. However, recently they have been bad. I was 
recently promoted to Jr. Mod, but then demoted and that kind of started 
the decline. It was then that Avicus started fading away. I started 
coming on less and less because each time I got annoyed by the players 
on it and sometimes (although rarely) got frustrated at the staff (for 
things such as never being on TS [That is just my observation]). 
Basically I liked it better when it was a quite server with players I 
was used to. But enough with the badness, I DID say I had some good 
times. Now I would just like to point out some people:<br><br><u>resepignev:</u> You are awesome, stay that way. But seriously, you are probably my best friend on Avicus.<br><br><u>Ryilo:</u> I always had fun chatting with you on TS and skype. Not to mention you are amazing at&nbsp; PVP.<br><br><u>Random_Guy:</u> Thanks for always testing out my maps. You are really funny and make me laugh a lot.<br><br><u>_TinyBear</u>: You are just awesome.<br><br><u>Spartamex:</u> Even though it was short lived, thanks so much for the build server.<br><br>So I know I did not include everyone (you know who you are), these are just the people <u>I knew the longest</u>,
 or who have done the most for me. So anyhoo, I guess it is time for me 
to say goodbye! (That just got really bittersweet as I typed that 
thinking back on all the good times I have had). Wish you guys the best 
and good luck in life!<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Sincerely,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Redstone, I had a lot of fun working with you. Hopefully you will visit the server again when the update rolls out, because there's a lot of promising stuff! Good luck with your endeavours.

Yeah, xD I probably won't be able to stay away, because Avicus was like a second home for a while.

Sorry, but Avicus isn't enjoyable to me anymore...although Nebula is probably the best game besides skywars...

Sorry I had to end the build server, but it was just too expensive.<br><br>Good luck with everything! Btw, you're great with redstone. You should look into coding! You'd be great at it :)<br><br>Seeya :(
