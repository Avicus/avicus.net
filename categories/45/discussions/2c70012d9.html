Obviously that was cancelled without notice, as no one ever got a preview in February 2016...<br><br>I've rebooted Project Float completely, and I have been working on since October on paper, and finally am bringing it to life... BUT. It's different.<br><br>Project Float will be a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/" rel="nofollow">Raspberry Pi</a>&nbsp;based project, where I will utilize a Raspberry Pi, to run handheld, and for it to be an epic handheld and TV connectable games console which can run for a lengthy amount of time, on the go. I am aware there are like 100s of other projects similar and like this, but I'm working to make mine just the tiniest bit different.<br><br>I'm currently building this project off a Raspberry Pi 3B (the latest build as of December 2016), which means it has the best potential.<br>It can currently run Nintendo 64 games at a smooth fps, and Dreamcast games at a smooth fps, which means it has plenty of potential.<br><br>Currently it is in Alpha 2 as of 26/12/2016.&nbsp;<br><br>Here is the splash when you start up the Pi<br><b>Whoever guesses where I got the sound from gets a prize!<br></b><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7LM_Q72c2o">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7LM_Q72c2o</a>
