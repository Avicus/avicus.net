It depends on the computer you're running.<br><br><b>If you're using Mac,</b><br>Try Quicktime. It's a pre-installed program that should record your minecraft gameplay pretty well, that is if you're not already lagging in-game ;v<br><br><b>If you're using Windows</b><br>I recommend Fraps. It's a pretty smooth running software.

Fraps create Huge files. If you don't have a good computer I wouldn't recommend it.<br>You also have to buy it.<br><br>OBS on the other hand is free and I hear is quite good for recording.<br>Although I haven't had experience with OBS or Fraps myself, I have heard that OBS is quite good,<br><br>Don't get me wrong, Fraps is excellent. But unless you want to pay for it and have large files from the recording I personally would get OBS.<br><br>Bandicam is also another recording program but I personally ddon't know much about it.<br><br>But it's your choice :)<br><br>Here bud:<br>OBS:&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://obsproject.com">https://obsproject.com</a>&nbsp;<br>Fraps:&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.fraps.com">http://www.fraps.com</a><br>Bandicam:&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.bandicam.com">http://www.bandicam.com</a>

Ok no. If you run 800 fps you will not get below 500 with fraps... I have a Laptop running 300 fps and recording with fraps doesnt go below 100 -.-<br><br>I would recommend DxTory, its a VERY good recording software<br><br><ul><li>20 minute video doesnt take more than 100MB</li><li>FPS drop about 60</li><li>Quiality: Outstanding</li><li>However needs a LOT of experience of what recorders do to be able to run it correctly ._.</li></ul><a rel="nofollow" href="http://exkode.com/dxtory-downloads-en.html">http://exkode.com/dxtory-downloads-en.html</a>

Some people have great fps, but with certain programs such as FRAPS it can decrease immensely.<br>I would recommend using action! it's better and faster :P
