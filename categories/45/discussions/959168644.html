An Honest Opinion

Hey,<br><br>First off I'm just going to state that I ran this past no one on the staff team as I desperately want the community views on this matter. So recently I've been thinking about the staff team, and more specifically the differences between its members. First, I'm going to make a disclaimer stating that I'm not making this post to slander anyone or to start an argument - I just want the community's opinion and share my own. <br><br>So what are my opinions on the Avicus Staff Team? I could legitimately rant on forever but I'm narrowing it down to one word - divided. The inactivity of the team itself is a major issue yet I feel the staff team has a much bigger issue that has been very problematic recently; the division. <br>In an attempt to stay as far away from the cringe and corn as possible let me try to explain. You have those who are referred to as "sweaty, tryhard mods" and you have those mods that "do nothing" apparently. <br><br>Personally, my main focus and the main reason for becoming a mod was not to turn into a glorified, pretentious little brat trying to feel powerful on a Minecraft server - it was to create a better experience for the community. If we are real here for a minute that's what most mods would say when asked why they became a mod but their actions say differently in my eyes. <br>A mod shouldn't seek out to give infractions and it should not be their main goal. I'd confidently say that most of the EU timezone players can vouch for me when I say I'm a more than fair mod in my opinion. <br>I don't try to give out infractions unnecessarily, I am (for the most part) respectful, and I get what needs to be done done. Yet I am by no means "a sweaty mod". I have always taken a more laid back approach when it comes to moderating. I joined Avicus for the first time and within 4 months of playing AS A PLAYER (not trying for Junior at all), I was referred and given Jr Mod. <br><br>During my Junior trials, I maintained a chill aspect and got Mod. In my eyes, you don't need to try hard to get promoted. I have never set out on getting any more than Mod, my focus has been on being a Mod. This is where the moderators are losing focus in my opinion. <br>They are too busy trying to be innovative and impress the Seniors and Admins that they simply are not doing their job correctly. However, it seems that these Mods are those who consistently get the praise and the promotions. In the least offensive way possible I'm saying that I think something is wrong here. <br><br>Honestly, I have contemplated retiring at some points but decided against it as I can actually recognise how bad the staff team is currently. Now that I gave my honest opinion on the matter in a cheeky rant, let me hear yours. Try to prove me wrong, try to back me up. I just want honesty from ANYONE.&nbsp;<br><br>What do you prefer? A "laid-back Mod", or a "stricter, sweaty Mod". Why?<br><br>Give me rants. I luv em

I prefer a happy medium because yeah, you will have those mods that sweat and yeah, you will also have those mods that are chill. But I think there should be more of a happy medium (I can name a few that fit into the three categories) because that way rules are enforced, but players do not feel like they get punished for doing something small. If I was to choose between those 2 types of mods, I wouldn't choose any of them. This is because if you have all laid back mods you get nothing done, and all sweaty mods isn't any better because then players feel like they can't do anything without it breaking some type of rule. If this makes no sense I'll be happy to clarify.

Ciaan,<br><br>Thank you for making this. There isn't really many opportunities where we can reflect on our staff team. So here's what I think.<br><br>I am one of the more uptight strict mods, but I also like to have fun. I personally think stricter mods are better because they do a more efficient job paying attention to chat and activity wise. A couple months before staff applications came out, I started seriously sweating for mod. Like.... Seriously sweating. I was honestly giving out more verbal warning than the mods themselves. I was given a lot of negative feedback, but I still enjoyed it, and I still enjoy it to this day. I also think I do a pretty good job of making the experience of the Avicus player better by introducing new players to the community (forums and teamspeak) as well as helping any players with immidiate help when they need it, and having an overall good time. As you said, our jobs are to make the experience of the Avicus player better.<br><br>With that being said, I think the current state of the staff team is alright. Some staff members dedicate themselves more than other, but we all care. A lot of players give us a lot of negativity if we are "too sweaty" or we "try too hard". I just want to say that if we seem like we over dedicate, or if we seem to take our job too seriously, it's just because we care. It's a community we love and we want to support it by doing our jobs. If we seem to harsh it's just because we're doing our duties to the full extent.&nbsp;<br><br>I think the current mods are doing a good job fulfilling their job, but we can always do better.&nbsp;<br><br>Anyway, that's my ramble.&nbsp;<br><br>Koja.

You are one of the mods that people call "sweaty". You can find out if a mod is sweaty by his jr mod trial.<br><br><br>I have actually seen a very large improvement in the staff team. Rarely have to ping for mods in discord. I do think some mods need to stop moderating on scrim servers, because we all know how it goes. If you are a mod on a team and you get salty you wont punish your team, but you will the enemy team. Has happened multiple times. This is why team rocket doesn't let moderation staff in our team, (poker is a coach) because most mods focus on moderating in scrims, when they should focus on the match. Ciaan, mad respect for you, very chill- laid back mod, you allow the salt on scrim servers which shows your standpoint in these two positions.

I don't call mods sweat or anything, if I do it isn't really serious/meant. As for scrims, yeah I know some mods can be salty and not punish (what you said basically) but they are a mod, if they aren't doing their job get a Sr or a higher staff and they will definitely deal with it. I hope I didn't misunderstand what you said but this is how I saw it.

The problem is that the Senior Staff team often sees the sweaty Mods as the people working the hardest and contributing the most, hence leaning towards them when considering a promotion. That idea often isn't true and is a facade put on by many Moderators to make themselves seem as if they're the hardest-working. Since there are a limited number of Senior Mods, it becomes difficult for them to pick out the high-quality Mods. When this happens, they try to look for the Mods who stand out the most, which often turns out to be the robotic, sweaty Mods. In no way can this directly be blamed on the Administration nor the Senior Staff team as a whole, but it's definitely something to consider when looking for someone to promote.&nbsp;<br><br>Regarding your question, I definitely prefer someone who's a lot more laid-back. It's not enjoyable to talk to a stiff Moderator who could honestly be mistaken for a bot sometimes. Mods who don't hide their personalities/opinions and interact well with the community are usually of higher quality. This is why <img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/408727ad9deed8682820a40290ffe516?s=20&amp;default=mm" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/PieZ.html" style="color: #FF9805">PieZ</a> is one of the best staff members the server has had. As a Mod, Pie always did his job in a relaxed manner, treating those who broke the rules with the same respect as he did those who didn't, and explaining both how they broke the rules and why the rule was in place. To add on to this, Pie spoke to everyone the same way no matter who they were, that being casually and respectfully. Pie also voiced his opinion very often and showed that his intentions were to better the server, not to better himself.

Alright, so here's my 2 cents on this. Even before I was a Sr mod (like when I was a mod on this server or OCN), I was able to see that promotions aren't always based on how much you 'tryhard'. Heck, most of the biggest tryhards on OCN never got mod. Attitude, maturity, and the quality (?) of the work I've always found is a bigger aspect in regards to promotions. However, sitting back waiting to be picked doesn't always work (or at least not as quickly).<br><br>How I got mod is very much like you story. On OCN, a referral was created and I got Jr. After being promoted, and even to this day, I've been generally pretty laid back. When I came over here, I felt like I had something the Sr team wanted (or as Greg put it "we need good mods" - ones with experience). And then a few months (maybe it was weeks honestly) into my time as a mod here, I was messaged by an admin at the time telling me they were looking for more Srs, and that if I showed what I could do, I might get Sr. At that time, I had no idea what I was suppose to do. I tried to be online as much as I could for that week, and tried to be the best moderator I could. After the week ended, I never heard back from that admin &amp; I presumed I had failed that opportunity (or whatever you want to call it). A few more weeks passed and I retired from all staff positions. I came back to the staff team 3 months later, and was promoted to Sr within a few days.<br><br>Now I'm not saying that promoting me to Sr a few days after I came back was a great choice. Heck, it was a pretty bad choice in my opinion. I had to struggle with learning all the new changes in the staff team, the server, and on top of all that learn how to be a Sr. But what was different this time vs when I was offered a chance to be a Sr was that I actually felt like I had done something to "prove" myself. Just around this time I was in the process of revamping the SMedia team (I could have done a better job on the whole thing, I'll admit that any day). During this time I was able to show the Admins (and I guess anyone else who cared, I really only communicated with Posighdun) that I was able to do work to a decent level, and that I had initiative to work on something that no one else put any effort into for months prior.<br><br>Now that I'm starting to feel that this is just a post about me, so let's get back to the point I was trying to make. How much you 'tryhard' and at what level you do it doesn't always matter. Like doing work is great, but it's more than just that. This is why not every guy you see tryharding gets the promotion they were after.&nbsp;<br><br>edit: wow ok this post really is more about me than the point I'm trying to make. Sorry about that. Just like focus on the first and last paragraphs

You need to split the power from the very upper staff and down correctly. There are power dividing problems imo where the admins get too much power at certain occasions seeing as they're the highest staff, in other occasions they DO need to have more power than the rest and they don't.&nbsp;<br><br>I feel the staff team is more divided by groups of friends that try to get eachother demoted, rather than "laid back" and "sweaty" mod. I mean I have literally seen in my eyes people asking for feedback or smth on their map or the way they moderate whatever the fuck, they get negative feedback from a fellow friendly moderator and then start hating on him for giving him bad feedback and try and get him demoted and always give bad feedback to him back<br><br>Thats a sad butthurt and sounds really unrealistic but ive seen some cases like this which sucks.<br><br>Also for those of you going to &nbsp;complain about bias: YOU CANT<br>Bias is in human nature and you are biased irl everyday, its human nature to prefer a friend over somebody else. So dont try to "REMOVE" the bias or tell staff to not be biased since its not possible. Therefore there are other ways of taking decisions and trying to MINIMALIZE the bias by involving lots of the staff in the decision rather than a small group of people - like tourney decisions involve refs (that are not playing for the team that is being voted), officials. there are lots of other ways u can think about im sure but dont try to remove the bias - its impossible.<br><br><br><br><br>i also fucking despise the way posighdun runs the avicus staff team its horrible but unfortunately i dont see any of the current sr mods being able to run it better.

I have been close to the staff team for maybe a month and the way some of the moderators treat each other is a fucking joke.

Didn't know staff could state their opinion without getting demoted!&nbsp;<br><br>Anyways, on topic. I like the mods that can actually take&nbsp;<u>A FUCKING JOKE</u>. It is extremely hard to find those kind of mods nowadays. These kind of mods know the line, they know when jokes are excessive but know how to do their job. The people who farm the infractions because they want to look "cool" are pathetic. They are the ones that shouldn't be getting Senior Mod, Official, Map Dev, etc. I just feel that "caring" isn't an excuse, they should take a chill pill, put on your sandles, go to the beach and relax.

It's fairly easy to distinguish who works hard for a rank and who works hard for the community.&nbsp;<br><br>I used to to be strict as hell when I first got mod in early 2015, but that's because I didn't know any better.<br><br>These days I'd like to think I have a laid back Moderating approach.&nbsp;<br><br>I've done this long enough to distinguish the difference between "we need to issue this guy an infraction because the guideline says so and nothing else"<br>and&nbsp;<br>"we need to identify the situation and help this person learn from their mistakes and teach them how to avoid doing it again in the future"&nbsp;<br><br>I think 'tryhards' tend to go for the first option and decent mods go for the second.

The laid back type of approach is all well and good but I think a laid back moderator is more likely to just moderate where as a "sweaty" moderator tends to go beyond just performing their moderator duties and hence stands out.<br><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><br></span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><i>What do you prefer?

All of the "sweaty" mods meet some form of criteria if they're promoted to Senior. We wouldn't just promote someone off the fact they do x amount of bans per day or follow the guidelines to the letter.<br><br>There is honestly nothing wrong with doing that, It's playing it safe. Whether they are lenient or not, we can't force them to be lenient. That's just how they are. &nbsp;<br><br>Yes, I don't mean laid back moderators are slack and don't do extra. What I mean is genuinely, from what I see, the ones who put more effort in get more out of it.

Alright, so here's my 2 cents on this. Even before I was a Sr mod (like when I was a mod on this server or OCN), I was able to see that promotions aren't always based on how much you 'tryhard'. Heck, most of the biggest tryhards on OCN never got mod. Attitude, maturity, and the quality (?) of the work I've always found is a bigger aspect in regards to promotions. However, sitting back waiting to be picked doesn't always work (or at least not as quickly).<br><br>How I got mod is very much like you story. On OCN, a referral was created and I got Jr. After being promoted, and even to this day, I've been generally pretty laid back. When I came over here, I felt like I had something the Sr team wanted (or as Greg put it "we need good mods" - ones with experience). And then a few months (maybe it was weeks honestly) into my time as a mod here, I was messaged by an admin at the time telling me they were looking for more Srs, and that if I showed what I could do, I might get Sr. At that time, I had no idea what I was suppose to do. I tried to be online as much as I could for that week, and tried to be the best moderator I could. After the week ended, I never heard back from that admin &amp; I presumed I had failed that opportunity (or whatever you want to call it). A few more weeks passed and I retired from all staff positions. I came back to the staff team 3 months later, and was promoted to Sr within a few days.<br><br>Now I'm not saying that promoting me to Sr a few days after I came back was a great choice. Heck, it was a pretty bad choice in my opinion. I had to struggle with learning all the new changes in the staff team, the server, and on top of all that learn how to be a Sr. But what was different this time vs when I was offered a chance to be a Sr was that I actually felt like I had done something to "prove" myself. Just around this time I was in the process of revamping the SMedia team (I could have done a better job on the whole thing, I'll admit that any day). During this time I was able to show the Admins (and I guess anyone else who cared, I really only communicated with Posighdun) that I was able to do work to a decent level, and that I had initiative to work on something that no one else put any effort into for months prior.<br><br>Now that I'm starting to feel that this is just a post about me, so let's get back to the point I was trying to make. How much you 'tryhard' and at what level you do it doesn't always matter. Like doing work is great, but it's more than just that. This is why not every guy you see tryharding gets the promotion they were after.&nbsp;<br><br>edit: wow ok this post really is more about me than the point I'm trying to make. Sorry about that. Just like focus on the first and last paragraphs
</blockquote>
</div>
&gt;<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Heck, most of the biggest tryhards on OCN never got mod.&nbsp;<br><br>Learn from me: tryhard for 2-3 years then stop for 1 and you get insta-mod<br>-<br>@OP<br>Anyways, to this day I'll never understand why so many people struggle to be both a "sweaty mod" and a laidback one. You can be a bit of a tryhard and still manage to be laidback. You can also appear to be one but actually be the other, which to me is an ineffective but rather interesting way of going about things. Regardless of which type you are, as long as you do your job and do it well, there should be no issues.<br><br>I've noticed that the ones who make the most mistakes tend to be the sweaty ones only because they "tryhard" and as a result people notice the mistakes more, resulting in mild chaos on both the "player-side" and mod-side of things. The laidback ones, when they make mistakes, are generally brushed away since the laidback persona makes any mistake seem far less severe, therefore they can just go on with their regular schedule and not worry. However, when a sweaty mod doesn't make a mistake, they generally do perform extremely well and get the deserved promotions.&nbsp;<br><br>There's division everywhere and you can't really stop that. You can try your best to make it as unnoticeable as possible, but it's impossible to get rid of it. Nonetheless, I wish you the best of luck with doing what you can. ;p &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>

I think being a "sweaty tryhard mod" is a good thing at times, because when there are rule breakers people want them to be punished so they don't ruin the game, but when there are no rule breakers people want a "chill laid back mod" to hang out with and talk with. That's just my opinion.

imo a mod should be able to be laid-back when it's something simple, like using caps or a bit of spam that was "DEF" because there's someone at the monument, but when it needs to be a serious time, like when someone is legitimately spamming to annoy everyone, there should be punishments dealt. There's a line that everyone sees differently, the line called "should I be laid-back right now or not?" <br><br>I like to think that I'm very laid-back, but I know some people would disagree with me, then again, those are the same people that get a lot of punishments from me because I asked them to stop 5 times and they didn't so I kick them. xD Anyway, I've always taken a more laid-back approach about some things, like caps and spam for example. But I've always been a lot more strict about suicide encouragement and racism. Honestly a lot of "tryhard" mods are just more strict about more things, and their opinion (that makes sense to an extent) is that the rules are rules, no exceptions.&nbsp;<br><br>Just to add on, I've always noticed a line between Senior staff and Moderators. I think that most of the time, a regular player, or someone who hasn't been around the staff team much, would say that the Mods and Seniors seem to get along and they all (for the most part) know each other, and I would agree, sort of. From the first time I was Mod, and now, I've always felt like I don't know anything more than the community does about anything. That's not always a bad thing, but it is a bit frustrating when I feel like if they had ran through some ideas with the Moderators, just to make sure there's not some major flaw, or some new idea that could work really well, with whatever they are making, it might turn out better and not completely fail. I never know anything basically until the community does. (More recently that's because I've been so inactive, whoops.) I will say that in the recent times, meaning since the new Senior Mods were promoted, I've seen some more activity within the Seniors, and a bit more communication, but this has been a problem for at least as long as I've been staff, and I know before me this was even worse, sadly.<br><br>Anyway, like Koja said.

I feel they promote the Jr Mods that are 10% brain cells and 90% sweaty for infractions instead of the people who have 100% fucking brain cells and know what they're doing. If I was Senior I would rather promote a guy who has 10 infractions and knows what they are doing then some guy who has 10,000 infractions and has no clue what they're doing. Being a sweaty Mod is just plain stupid and I mean you can't demote them for the reason of 'two sweaty' but you can teach them...<br><br><br><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/neurogenesis-how-to-grow-new-brain-cells_us_56253c16e4b0bce347019a2c" title="Link: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/neurogenesis-how-to-grow-new-brain-cells_us_56253c16e4b0bce347019a2c">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/neurogenesis-how-to-grow-new-brain-cells_us_56253c16e4b0bce34701...</a>

There's a difference between being "chill" and careless you know...

Junior Mod is not the position to be chill in, if you haven't noticed. You can do that once you get the position, but trial ranks are just to test you, and if you don't show that you deserve to pass, you won't.
