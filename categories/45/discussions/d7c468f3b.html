I don't expect this to happen but can we go back to the pre-update Avicus (when prestige was a thing). Avicus only receives ~100 users a day while on the previous Avicus the server received ~500 users. So, isn't it for the better to go back?

I don't think going back to prestige's is the only factor in getting more players.

Avicus isn't like it used to be. You are right but the main reason is not prestige. Maybe block lag, temp ranks, untalented mods<u>, 'FALSE BANS: 4lextr/Spookz [i don't know who's next]'&nbsp;</u> If Avicus keeps doing like that, they will lose most of their good players.

I can't say anything about Nebula, but prestiges were a lot better for walls, with the way the kits are. Being able to just walk in and get any kit you want almost makes walls not fun, there's no thing you're trying to get to, or reason to play. There needs to be a ranking system with the kits, it just gives the gamemode something to work for, other then winning after getting 3 kills... :/

May not add players, but people will enjoy it more and Avicus wouldn't be loosing players. Seems like a better deal then doing nothing and watching the server rot ;p

Minecraft in general is going dying out slowly, it's almost 5 years old after all. I'd be surprised if old servers <i>ever </i>got back to their golden days.

It's turning more modded. The previous versions were fun, I just don't find the recent updates interesting.

In my opinion, what killed Walls was:<br><br>1) New maps seemingly every week.&nbsp; Some were nice, some weren't, but if you didn't know the map how were you supposed to do any good?&nbsp; People weren't doing well and lost interest.<br><br>2) Lowered height limit.&nbsp; If you can shoot somebody in the max height skybase, while you are standing on the ground, the height limit is too low.&nbsp; And it is too low.&nbsp; Raise it by 30 or 40.<br><br>3) Stupid, stupid rules.&nbsp; "Oh, you shot across the walls before wall drop, you will be banned".&nbsp; Stupid stupid stupid.&nbsp; If you don't want people to shoot across walls then build the walls higher.&nbsp; Frankly, now I often play on a similar game on a different server (bridges) where shooting across the water before bridge drop is a part of the game, as it should be in walls.&nbsp; Make and enforce stupid rules and people will stop playing.<br><br>Then you have some mods who have no clue, like the one who was threatening to kick me for telling my teammate in Walls what the enemy was doing (as I was playing the game), he said I wasn't supposed to be giving tactical information.&nbsp; As I was playing.&nbsp; <br><br>I remember when there would be 10 players per team on a Saturday afternoon.&nbsp; Those were the days.<br><br>There used to be a game on Avicus where you would spawn on a random map and you had something like 5 minutes before you could start attacking other players.&nbsp; Normally you would look for iron for a sword and some armor, then it was a pvp battle or you could sneak up on people while they were mining.&nbsp; Maybe bring back that game?<br><br>And why was Prestige taken away?&nbsp; Why not keep it?&nbsp; What about the kits you could buy for $1.99?
