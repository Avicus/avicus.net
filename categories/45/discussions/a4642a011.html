<b>This is going to be a little rant...&nbsp;<br></b><br><b></b>So, I&nbsp;was playing nebula today and saw ONE TOO MANY people complaining about how the moderators suck and that they don't do their job. Or that they don't arrive quick enough.&nbsp;<br><br>First off:&nbsp;<br><br>Shut the hell up. Mods can't be online every second just to watch the server. They have lives to live!&nbsp;<br><br>Second:<br><br>Mods aren't supposed to announce their arrival when there is a hacker. Those kinds of people don't even deserve to be mods because to catch a hacker you have to be discreet, tricky, and smart.&nbsp;<br><br>Third:&nbsp;<br><br>To the people who say the mods here suck... &nbsp;You should be EVEN LUCKY that there is a damn REPORT button! Mineplex, one of the biggest servers in the Minecraft community, doesn't have a report button. Their staff also suck, I ended up being kicked in the PRESENCE of a hacker. (Sorry mineplex, it's true. )<br><br>Any mods/juniors/seniors reading this, Don't think poorly of yourself. You are doing a fantastic job in keeping track of the server. The only reason people hate on you guys is because they're jealous or have no patience.&nbsp;<br><br>Continue the great work.&nbsp;<br><br>Midnight

Dear, I hate the people that expects the staff to constantly moderate. Just because they applied, therefore making it a bit of a job, doesn't mean they have to work their asses off 24/7.. At least Avicus isn't flooded with those kind of people, though. &lt;3 &lt;3

I was kidding when I said that, but since you asked for a list:<br><br>- Mods should forward suggestion directly to managers if they have potential to help the server. Suggestion posts generally get ignored for whatever reason and SO many good minigames and additions are overlooked. Come on.<br><br>- Learn more about hacked clients, aka the most common issue. Prime examples being djbuilders, fazer, kingt, etc. All banned for hacking while being not even CLOSE to that. It's ridiculous. People expect perfection, and even if you can't give them that, you can at least not falsely ban people because you thought they were hacking. These mistakes count. People notice and then forum spam starts from complaints.&nbsp;<br><br>- God help me with this one. Some moderators just try and rack up infractions by kicking/warning people for the dumbest things. Sometimes a word slips out but COME ON. Somebody dies and says "fuck", he doesn't need a warn. If he does it again I think that's when you might wanna get involved. Now if someone goes on a profanity spree yelling the most grotesque and obnoxious words ever coined by mankind, then you wanna warn on the first. Or maybe something really silly, warning people for caps when they leave it on by accident. I've seen it happen. Just no.&nbsp;<br><br>- To end this (hopefully), why are some moderators so just... boring. Do you expect people to like you if you just read out of a textbook? Does that help you connect with players (which is what a moderator should be doing to help promote the server)? Be more laid back for Christ sake, you aren't talking in front of the goddamn president. Sometimes its needed, but sometimes its not. If moderators are considered "just very responsible and active members of the server who are at the same level of everyone else", why can't they just be opinionated and not tell others what they have on flash cards?<br><br>Was that seriously so hard?

Looks like I need to add to this. Lets see...<br><br>Oh yeah, the staff team. Used to be about like... 40 people total on the team...? Now we have almost 25 at guess. Staff are retiring every month, and with school approaching, most will be inactive/quitting more than ever.&nbsp;<br><br>So let me put this into perspective. School has begun. Staff may be quitting. We have 1 map dev and 1 regular dev. Where is this going?&nbsp;<br><br>But thats only the beginning.<br><br>You may say "WELL STAFF SAID APPS WILL OPEN SOON SO WE'LL BE GETTING MORE RITE!?!??!///!/1/".<br><br>lolno<br><br>Last time, staff apps opened on the 30th of March if I'm correct. Then the staff were given ranks IN JULY. That's 3 months of waiting. And most didn't even get promotions until August. So in 3 months it'll be December - and maybe not because the applications aren't even open yet. That's a long time of waiting before new mods (and there will only be like 14, which is not many at all). This is a major flaw in our system that has only really presented itself recently.&nbsp;<br><br>Fix it. Choose moderators from active members of the forums who care about this server. If I could ever suggest anybody, Arachadonic, Splade4812, smitdalt, and plenty of others should be on the team. Don't be afraid to use OCN's staff choosing system.<br><br>Ok, ranting finished... for now.

Some things I don't like about the Avicus staff are:<br><br>They don't even check someone out if they get enough reports; <br>A few weeks ago myself and a few people on the OCN mumble got together and derped around on Avicus, jokingly we all reported a player for hacking, and guess what? Without anybody actually coming online to actually spectate him, he was permanently banned.<br><br>They don't like people giving their opinions;<br>I feel as though Avicus can't take criticism, and I feel that the staff treat being negative as if it is actually punishable, this virtually makes no sense. The only way Avicus can improve is through community suggestions and criticism and for whatever reason that's frowned apon.

I noticed when people become STAFF, they completely change. I mean, so many mods use to be so awesome and fun! Then when they got their rank, they just acted completely differently. The only mod who still really acts like a fun player is Dubstep. Sorry if I some hoe offended you.

This is a major flaw in our system that has only really presented itself recently.&nbsp;<br><br>Fix it. Choose moderators from active members of the forums who care about this server. If I could ever suggest anybody, Arachadonic, Splade4812, smitdalt, and plenty of others should be on the team. Don't be afraid to use OCN's staff choosing system.<br><br>Ok, ranting finished... for now.

I agree with Tino.<br><br>Staff apps aren't really smart, people'll just lie and abuse everything. We need hand-picked mods: People who are active, helpful to the community, friendly, etc.

Some things I don't like about the Avicus staff are:<br><br>They don't even check someone out if they get enough reports; <br>A few weeks ago myself and a few people on the OCN mumble got together and derped around on Avicus, jokingly we all reported a player for hacking, and guess what? Without anybody actually coming online to actually spectate him, he was permanently banned.<br><br>They don't like people giving their opinions;<br>I feel as though Avicus can't take criticism, and I feel that the staff treat being negative as if it is actually punishable, this virtually makes no sense. The only way Avicus can improve is through community suggestions and criticism and for whatever reason that's frowned apon.

I noticed when people become STAFF, they completely change. I mean, so many mods use to be so awesome and fun! Then when they got their rank, they just acted completely differently. The only mod who still really acts like a fun player is Dubstep. Sorry if I some hoe offended you.

I feel the server could use more staff, especially now that it is shaking staff up a bit which can only mean more demotions.

Midnight is absolutely right. We are lucky to have moderators that actually like doing their job and do it well.&nbsp;<br>Have you not seen the report pages? There are dozens of warns/kicks/bans in a day, which means that the staff members are doing their job well.<br>Compared to the Mineplex staff, as you mentioned, Avicus staff actually knows how to determine is someone is hacking, and they do not unfairly punish players, unless it is by accident or confusion (hacking for example).
