As some of you know, a recent male was shot unlawfully by Louisiana police officers for allegedly carrying a gun - even though Louisiana is an <b>Open Carry State.<br><br></b>Now despite the man's past criminal actions in the 1990s, he still did not deserve to die. <b>He was killed like a fucking dog.</b><br><b><br>They just held him down there with the car he was tackled besides shaking... one yelled out... "He's got a gun..!" and... they pointed the gun at his face... the two gunshots... Oh no.<br><br></b>I don't feel safe in this country anymore, I want to move out now. Not only because of the continuous prejudices I face with my skin color but how the police forces handle situations such as this.&nbsp;<br><br>The American police training needs serious reevaluation, they use&nbsp;over-excessive&nbsp;for such minute situations.<b><br><br>So, on this side note... I feel that this is necessary for multiple reasons. Not only am I Minority who is likely to targeted more often by police forces, I also wish to survive, I want to grow up and have a family... away from such a harsh atmosphere this country continuously exudes.<br><br>I'm about to be in college, and I'm one step away from going out into the world on my own.<br><br>I want to live. I want to get a future <i>WITHOUT</i>&nbsp;occurrences&nbsp;such as these...<br><br></b>I'm scared shitless right now, what countries would be a good place to live where the laws are fair, free healthcare and the police don't have a mindset akin to a third world country.<br><b><br><i>Please. No unnecessary flame, I not only want suggestions for where to move but a discussion on this whole situation in general. Even if you have opposing opinions, you won't be attacked. We just need a debate.</i></b>

Intolerance is a common share of society. A lot of people, on both sides, will hate each other no matter the cause and can't face any denomination of unity. It has been a cruel nation and will continue to be a cruel nation until something is done, which may be how long. We shouldn't live in fear of those who protect us, and we could use a non-violent revolution, for both parties to come together and stop these prejudices from our enforcers. Corruption and scandals erupt more than they should in what is supposed to be a developed country, and I would personally make demands for transparency if this were the case for these scandals to be disproven, which the United States is notorious for not doing. It's supposed to be innocent until proven guilty here.<br><br>People take disagreements to the extreme, and those are the ones who are mentally ill and aren't afraid of taking a life for their opinion. A foundation needs to be structured for the citizens of America, keep education strong and not cut it. We should have any sort of authority heavily evaluated mentally, and take more intensive training courses. I also think that we need body cams on every acting officer on duty, and no excuses like other cases where they 'accidentally turn off' while handling a suspect.<br><br>The more liberal side of me came out, but oh well. I actually don't really want to narrow it down to one race, but to everyone on both sides.

No, I'm 17 turning 18 in September and I'm going to college in August 26th.<br><br>I have to start looking for a job soon so that I can support myself and I'm one step closer to being on my own.

I'll look into why the police was called.<br><br>According to the video that I saw, the man was standing still whilst one police officer tackled him to the ground causing the nearby car to shake a bit.<br><br>The man was on the ground struggling and trying to get his bearings for a bit, understandable when you've just been bodily slammed to the ground by two police officers.<br><br>He was on back and staring at the cops, one holding him down whilst the other was patting him down for anything <b>(Not visible as he was partially obscured by the car, however I assumed he was since he yelled out that he had a gun)&nbsp;</b>when the man yelled out that he had a gun <b>(No, he didn't pull it out or anything. He was being quite docile up until they tackled him)<br><br></b>The police man holding him down pulled out his gun and hovered it a few inches from his face.... the man was screaming. The cameraman <b>(Which i assume is his son or wife)&nbsp;</b>pointed it away to get out of the car, then two gunshots rang out and the man on the ground screamed no more.<br><br>It was horrifying.<br><br>Now according to the owner of the store, he had permission from him to sell CDs on his property and hadn't down anything to warrant for police to be called.

Don't really know how to reply to this... I mean it's really philosophical and pretty much says everything that I would suggest be done.<br><br>I do not wish for another Baltimore to happen again.

I&nbsp;<i><b>really&nbsp;</b></i><b></b>hope that doesn't happen, however things are going to slow for everyone's liking and more people are being slaughtered as a result of the current system in place.<br><br>A 24 hour camera being put on the policeman is really needed with heavy repercussions for it being turned off.

It is sad to hear that about this. &nbsp;It seems more frequent but you have to realize what police officers go through. &nbsp;Everyday they put on that uniform, they never know if they will return to their families. &nbsp;It's a scary world out there. &nbsp;I didn't hear about this story until I read this post, but from what I read in this thread, the police might have abused their gun privileges. &nbsp;However, you shouldn't be scared. &nbsp;If you are scared, you won't have the courage to step out of your comfort zone and make something of yourself. &nbsp;Otherwise, you will just be like everyone else and have a 9-5 job. &nbsp;I understand your uneasiness about the situation, but just realize that as long as you obey the law, you have nothing to worry about. &nbsp;This am obviously did something wrong that got the police's attention. &nbsp;Just stay strong and live life without fear.<br><br><i><b>Update:</b></i> <a href="http://www.fox4news.com/news/171359952-story" rel="nofollow">Ironic</a>

Of course they shouldn't. I'm sure this mistake costed this cop his job and probably his social life.<br><br>However, he is a human and nobody is perfect. Like I said cops make many correct decisions and rarely make false decisions.

<div>I do believe that the majority of police officers are good people who believe in the "To Protect and Serve" motto. All cops are not bad people, lets not get into generalizations. However, it was very, very unnecessary to take this man from his family. On the contrast, who knows what was going through the officers minds. They could have some unheard reason to be afraid as well. I doubt they went about it with malicious intent, they probably thought they were doing the right thing in the moment. The thing that would keep THEM safe. The thing that would let THEM go home and eat with their families.&nbsp;Was it the right choice? Certainly not. Another note, this type of stuff is VERY overhyped by the media. You can't say I'm wrong. For every mishap the police commit that the media report on, there has to be at least 1000 good deeds done by officers. Maybe more. They are not a force for evil. </div>

The police were called due to the fact that people felt threatened by this man because he had a gun. The man was also being restrained by police, which made him unable to harm the police, let alone reach for a gun. I don't know the full story either, so I can't reach for conclusions, but this is all I know of so far.

Oh, is that why?<br><br>You have to realize that this is Louisiana which is an open carry state that allows guns to be displayed fully.<br><br>Inside a Walmart you'd often see men with AR-15s strapped to their backs or hips. Those are assault rifles talk less of a pistol that the man restrained and killed by the police had.<br><br>I don't know why they would feel threatened meanwhile he had it holstered and they were fully aware of Louisiana's laws. I just don't know how to explain this without seeming like a race-baiter to some people.<br><br>I just don't know how.

<div>I do believe that the majority of police officers are good people who believe in the "To Protect and Serve" motto. All cops are not bad people, lets not get into generalizations. However, it was very, very unnecessary to take this man from his family. On the contrast, who knows what was going through the officers minds. They could have some unheard reason to be afraid as well. I doubt they went about it with malicious intent, they probably thought they were doing the right thing in the moment. The thing that would keep THEM safe. The thing that would let THEM go home and eat with their families.&nbsp;Was it the right choice? Certainly not. Another note, this type of stuff is VERY overhyped by the media. You can't say I'm wrong. For every mishap the police commit that the media report on, there has to be at least 1000 good deeds done by officers. Maybe more. They are not a force for evil. </div>

I can definitely agree with you there, there are tons of good and honest cops in here. And I can understand what you mean by them being worried for going home to THEIR families.<br><br>Perhaps they were mulling over how if they had not restrained him quick enough he would've probably shot them and they were overcome with anger? I can understand their worries.<br><br>However, doesn't mean that they shouldn't serve punishment.<br><br>And it is as I've said before, due to our vaunted and corrupt media system we have these events that overshadow many other things.

Of course they shouldn't. I'm sure this mistake costed this cop his job and probably his social life.<br><br>However, he is a human and nobody is perfect. Like I said cops make many correct decisions and rarely make false decisions.

Ill be perfectly honest with you. I agree.<br><br>But, I think both of us agree that this was more than a mistake.&nbsp;<br><br>From im what I gather, the man was selling CDs while carrying a gun, which he had a permit for and was allowed to carry. People weren't comfortable with the man displaying his weapon, which is understandable. They called the police, which in my opinion is a bit much but also a pretty understandable thing to do. Cops come, see the man and tackle him. They look for something and find a gun. One of the cops screams that he has a good, and points it at him. The man starts shouting, and at this point his girlfriend is filming this. The man, with no way to defend himself and restrained, is shot right in front of his girlfriend and son two times.<br><br>Number 1 mistake: The cop<br>shouldve been a lot gentler and tried to handle the situation differently. Only when the man was acting hostile should he react with force.<br><br>Number 2 mistake: He shouldn't have taken the gun and pointed it at the man. By that point the man was panicking.<br><br>Number 3 mistake: He shouldn't have shot the gun.&nbsp;<br><br>Maybe there are things I was not well informed about but the mistakes the policeman made will stay the same.

haven't read all the posts on this topic, but I just wanted to state my opinions. from my own personal view saying Muslims and African Americans are minorities seems a little much. since you're still a fucking human, just because you have a different skin colour or have a different religion you shouldn't be treated differently then anyone else. That being said... you also have to do your part. African Americans especially were treated like shit for hundreds of years as slaves but after that all ended they turned in to homie gangsters shooting each other in the downtowns of big U.S. cities. that's why I don't particularly enjoy the race card being played but police do profile by colour because of the reason I stated above. when you have most black people being apart of gangs they profile it in a way that is unfair. I don't agree with these people losing their live but all the media pisses me off seeing "black lives matter" shit EVERYONES LIFE MATTERS. if you don't want to be treated like a minority stop acting like one, quit playing the fucking race card at every turn. white people get shot every day too, along with blacks. I dont see people parading around saying white lives matter? black lives would matter a lot more if stereotyping and rappers saying nigga every two seconds would stop? our society has caused this not the police. putting cameras on the police isnt going to do squat. its not a police problem its a problem with the society we live in. you saying that you dont feel safe and want to run away is a major overreaction. every place has its problems not just america.

sorry about my phrasing. it sucks that you and your brother had to deal with crap like that because of your skin colour. certain people can be real dicks about that. I do think that singers and media openly using the words "nigga" and "nigger" in songs makes it worse for our society cause it makes people think that racial slurs are something that is okay. and not all black people are members of gangs but a lot are. some of the people I know are members of gangs which makes the police profile them differently. &nbsp;media is both the cause and helper of our world. at the same time you think its doing good by exposing violence its also causing more unnecessary hate.

What I'm saying is the guy doesn't seem like the best guy in the world, if he's already served jail time.

haven't read all the posts on this topic, but I just wanted to state my opinions. from my own personal view saying Muslims and African Americans are minorities seems a little much. since you're still a fucking human, just because you have a different skin colour or have a different religion you shouldn't be treated differently then anyone else. That being said... you also have to do your part. African Americans especially were treated like shit for hundreds of years as slaves but after that all ended they turned in to homie gangsters shooting each other in the downtowns of big U.S. cities. that's why I don't particularly enjoy the race card being played but police do profile by colour because of the reason I stated above. when you have most black people being apart of gangs they profile it in a way that is unfair.

Actually you need to take a look at the statistics proportionally to the correct location.<br><br>The second set of statistics are for NYPD only as stated. In NYC the population is 25% Black and therefore it comes in just under the percentage of the population.&nbsp;<br><br>Also note that while, 67% of gun related violence against police in NYC comes from black Americans, only that 22% of people killed by NYPD are black. Therefore, despite clear evidence that black people in NYC cause more gunfights their average amount of deaths is the only statistic that actually comes under their average percentage among the top three races in NYC: white,black and hispanic. According to these statistics therefore, NYPD are very unsafe around black people, whereas black people are safer than the average NYC citizen in terms of deaths.<br><br><i>Please note the statistics are from NYC because Zin is from NYC and claims he doesn't feel safe</i>

You're all clueless and basing your statements out of something you didn't live. You can't just take 1 side of the plot by merely looking at a video (Which doesn't show what happened a significantly amount of time before the issue).

Some people are content with current systems since it's not affecting them.<br><br>Being honest, I think a lot of changes need to be made. Mindsets need to be changed, gun laws need to be revised and thought about and much more. It's easier said than done though, sadly. Id love to snap my fingers and change this, but it won't happen that easily. Many people are brought up to fear what's different, such as the LGBT+ community and people of different race and religion. That's a mindset of the narrow minded, and we all know how hard it is to convince those in that mindset to change.

Like stop taking offence in every little thing, everyone has their own opinions. If your that in secure about what he's saying, about this? then fuck... Your gonna have problems later in life..

Ya I get it, maybe my first post was a little aggressive towards you, I get your opinions and everyone has their own.

That's the kind of attitude that hinders societal advancement. Reaching out to the few people that will read this forum is victory enough for me. What's wrong with talking about it here? If you don't like it, how come you've commented? Seems like all you're trying to do is rain on the parade.

A little confusing to read but I got the gist of it down, I'll make sure to take your advice to heart man.<br><br>I admit that these events have been weighing me down a bit, It's just that I just can't comprehend... why someone would just... do this to another person? Like, what do you get out of it?<br><br>Why? I just can't understand what would cause someone to murder someone like this? For what reason?<br><br>I really don't want to assume that it's a race issue but that's all that's coming back to me. I did extensive research for each story. I viewed multiple sources and ignored their biased opinions favoring one side or another.<br><br>Maybe the officers didn't do it on purpose based on race - consciously, I'd like to think not. After all many people have subconscious stereotypical views against others that often influence their actions.<br><br><b>Here are the facts of the matter:</b><br>- Louisiana allows for open carry, so the civilians and officers&nbsp;<i>shouldn't&nbsp;</i>have a problem with Alton carrying a pistol talk less of an AR-15 or shotgun.<br>- The store owner allowed Alton to sell CDs on the property.<br>- People go into places of business and other huge population centers with AR-15s or shotguns strapped to their backs or thighs and hips. <b>(An AR-15 is an automatic weapon, can injure or kill a lot of people inside a very short amount of time... shotguns.... just imagine a watermelon exploding, that's what would happen to anyone who is close enough)<br></b>- The man had a pistol and he made no motion to grab it. Even when he was restrained, he couldn't even make a motion to go for it.<br><b></b><br>The second death, Philando Castille, the man warned the officer that he had a gun in his pocket and said that he was reaching for his ID. He shot him FOUR TIMES in his arm in front of his girlfriend and 4-year old daughter.<br><br>I don't know... since it isn't racism - conscious or not - then what is it? It can't be an accident, you have to be a mentally impaired person to make such a stupid "mistake" like this. It's like making a mistake on breathing, you just can't make a mistake.<br><br>There was no "Split second action" or anything. These events were both slow-going and evenly paced.
