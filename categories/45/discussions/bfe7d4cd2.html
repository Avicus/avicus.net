I remember when my train got to it's final destination, but I didn't want to get out.<br>I stayed in my seat, til the train started again and went back to where it came from.<br>As weird as it felt, I enjoyed it, and it was worth the extra time.<br><br>As much as this may be the final destination of this Avicus train, we can always go back or atleast remember where we've been before.<br>It may be sad, but after all the stations and places we've passed, there is always a final one.<br>Luckily there's lots of different tracks left to take, and when there's too little, more get created.<br>But the tracks you travel on the most, you will always remember...<br><br>I feel like it's worth looking back, trying to remember the amazing places we've traveled by.<br>From little moments and achievements, such as an amazing game of DTM. To bigger ones like tournaments and great updates and events.<br><br>This isn't as much of an AMA, but more of a place where we can ask questions, and you can answer whatever question asked.<br><br>I'll start of with a few, answer if you want or ask your own.<br>- What was your biggest accomplishment on Avicus? What are you most proud of?<br>- What will you be doing after this, and what things you learned on Avicus will you take with you?<br>- Which players do you really not want to lose contact with, after the shut down?<br><br><br>I want to thank everyone for the amazing experience and the awesome moments.<br>I've met lots of great people, and learned how to deal with the ones I didn't find too great.<br>I tried making a list of players to thank, but it got too long so I gave up :(<br>Just know that if you did any map development or building for Avicus, you're most likely in it.<br><br>Hope y'all have an amazing experience after this, and have had great moments on here, just like me.<br><br>Thanks for all,<br>Clijmart<br><br>Info not to lose contact:<br>Discord - Clijmart#5793<br>Twitter - @Clijmart

Thanks for making funky maps that were really fun to play. I always thought you retired a bit too early, but I'm glad that you stayed in the community till the end.

I stayed mainly because I felt like I could learn a lot from the players. Building, XML/Mapfigging and moreover some social skills.<br>I also loved being able to help players. I tried to support mapmaking as much as possible, while always being honest.<br><br>What I love about the map making really isn't just the building. I love trying out new things, both buildwise and gameplaywise.<br>I tried to predict the gameplay of my maps, before they would get played and edit them if I expected flaws.<br>As little as most of my maps were used, most of them followed my exact gameplay plans, which I guess is a good thing.<br>(Please don't talk about 'The Toys', it was shit I know...)<br><br>I'm feeling great lately. Really busy IRL, but Minecraft is always high on my priority list.<br>Stupid as it sounds, it did help me get through depressing stages in life and I improved my autistic social skills by doing so.<br>I'm working hard on what I enjoy doing, and everytime it pays of a little, it motivates me even more :)
