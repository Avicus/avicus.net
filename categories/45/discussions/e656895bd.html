Well my first Name (Dzekio3) I pretty much keyboard smashed my phone and let it auto correct, well that was the stupidest thing I've done in my minecraft career. Next, PretzelSave, I lived in Germany for 3 years and I started playing soccer there. I Still do now, but we had these tournaments and at half time I was eating a pretzel we had to go on field and I still had it, so I was trying to get my dad's attention by waving but then the ref looked at me (I'm a keeper / goalie) and stopped the game. My dad rushed over and grabbed my pretzel and everyone looked at me strangely for the rest of the tournament. Therefore I saved a pretzel creating PretzelSave. My new name (InfiniteChillMC) (don't know why it's no showing up right now) &nbsp;was a random suggestion from my friend ninja4ninja also known as Totally not Evan.

Like your name man. +1 At first I was questioning the "save" part, now I understand!<br><br>My old names eh. When I came to avicus, I went by the name "canuck_pro" And no i'm not a canadian. I got sick of people calling me "canuck_notso_pro," So when the name change update came out, I changed my name to "ShamrockSpectre_" However, I really didn't like that name... So I changed it again to the name which makes most sense for me: SenorSombrero!

I used to be __SkyGirl__9, that's because I like planes, and they fly in the sky. I'm a girl, so that molds the <b>SkyGirl</b> part of my name. The number was a typo, and the underscores were random xD

I am a fan of the University North Carolina Tar heels so that is where the <b><b>Tarheel</b> </b>of my name comes.&nbsp; And my father is from New Zealand, so that is where the <b><b>Kiwi</b> </b>comes from.&nbsp; So I am half American half New Zealand.&nbsp; So my name is half American ( Tarheel ) and half New Zealand ( Kiwi ).&nbsp; And you pronounce it Tar-Heel-Kiwi.&nbsp; Dat logic.
