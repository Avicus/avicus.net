<a href="http://translationparty.com/">http://translationparty.com/</a><br>This site can be used to type an English phrase into it and have it translated back and forth between English and Japanese until the phrase is translated back and forth perfectly. It taught me how hard it must be to translate anime.<br><br>So I typed in "If God can do anything, can he make a rock that he can't lift?" and somewhere along the line it translated to, "God does nothing, but you can lift him can do it, can't shake him"<br><br><br>I'd love to see what you people can come up with.
