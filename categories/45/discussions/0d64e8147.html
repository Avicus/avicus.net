Hey guys!<br>Today I turned 17. It's been so far a really good day for me!<br>Many bad things have happened throughout the year, but it's never late to search for a new beginning.<br>I'd like to thank ALL of you, community and staff, for being an important part of my life. Being a staff member on Avicus has helped me become a more mature, understanding, patient and dilligent person. I've made so many friends in here and I could not possibly even say thank you enough times for all the good moments we've all spent together. I've been a staff member since April last year (Map Developer) and September last year (Moderator) as well as a member of this community for around 2 years and some more time, and I hope I get to stick around this server for more time, during both good and bad times.<br><br>So, that being said, ask me anything, if you want!

@MidnightBeats: Conveniently enough, it wasn't taken! And thanks, buddy!<br>@GrapeSmoothie: I'm not ready to be an adult lmao<br>@Jellowazza: Pizza, definitely. :&gt;<br>@DaFrozenBlaze: Well, Blaziken is one of the few pokemon to be put in ubers without being a legendary or pseudo-legendary pokemon so what possessed them to give it a mega evolution I will never know! Either way, the speed boost is useful and both pokemon are nearly unstoppable if used correctly. Blaziken (and its mega-evolution) are easy favorites to many trainers.<br>I live in Ecuador, South America!<br>@Robin_DD_J: You're a great friend! Even though we don't talk that much. I've gotten to know you a bit better before you were promoted to Map Developer for the first time and you are pretty insightful about maps, you really know your stuff. You're very funny to hang around with and overall just a really chill dude. Also, nice hair dude!<br>@Dawning_: I've been playing Pokemon Showdown again for a while and Mega Blaziken is a beast there, I've been using it constantly so yeaah why not lmao
