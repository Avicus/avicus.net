<p class="MsoNormal"><b><u>If any comments on
this are stupid and about how toxic I am, I will be asking for their removal
through an edit.</u></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><u><span style="text-decoration:none">&nbsp;</span></u></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Well, where do I start?<br>
<br>
This is going to be my formal apology for events in the recent like 3-6 weeks.
People have told me that I have been cocky, annoying, salty, toxic,
"acting like a g0d" and related activities. This is all true, and
it's time for it to stop. This has also been happening in real life, losing
friends because of how much I show off. I underrate things, and I make too many
assumptions. I also take credit for things that I didn't even do, so that is
also part of it. I've been a total dickhead for doing things that I wouldn't
normally do. I don't do what had brought it on. After talking with friends
about it, I've decided to make this post because I want everyone to know that
I'm sorry.<br>
<br>
Firstly, cockiness. Over the past month or so I've been saying things relating
to how good I was and how bad everyone else is or that they're just not on my
level. While I worked hard to get where I was, it was stupid to blow it by
showing off the "newfound skills"<br>
<br>
Secondly, swearing. Yes, I swear a lot and it's time to stop. It's not needed
anymore (it never was) and people think that it's stupid.<br>
<br>
Thirdly and finally for the time being, is toxicity. It’s a bit hypocritical
that I make a post about toxicity when I contribute to about 60% of it myself.
I’m known for getting a bit salty when stupid stuff happens to me, and I’ve
said this just before, but I’ll say it again, but it needs to stop and it’s
going to stop now.<br>
<br>
So, It's time to learn from my mistakes and get back to what I love, talking
and playing with the community. I'm sorry each and everyone of you if I've been
toxic over the past month or so.<br>
<br>
Thanks for reading this and taking this into account.<br>
<br>
- Ben</p>

Hey Man,<br>I read this and I have seen some of your toxicity but mate, these things happen and I'm glad you've owned up to it and have apologised.
