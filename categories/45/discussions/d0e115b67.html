So, since the ama's are now on high demand again, I made one, again. But, with a little twist! &lt;3<br><br>You can ask me anything about building and I will try my best to explain that building aspect you have in mind. From the silliest questions to the hardest ones! Don't be shy :D<br><br>For reference, I guess, here are some of my builds and a link to&nbsp;my personal imgur:<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://awarriorvenom.imgur.com/all/">http://awarriorvenom.imgur.com/all/</a><br><br><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/BlE448c.png"><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/Fw8yye9.png"><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/vhrmTAy.png"><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/sIY88wv.png">

</div>
I was always an artistic person, in anything, I draw a lot (Patterns, Builds, Schematics)<br><br>So after a lot of practising and tips from other great builders, I developed my own style.<br><br>I bought Minecraft when it was 1.3.2 so 3 years ago? But I began building seriously around 1 and half years ago.<br><br>At the beginning, I copied shapes and designs form other builders, and then, made my own shapes using bits and pieces from builds I found here and there.<br><br>After a lot of time, I could make my own stuff :)<br><br>World Edit played an huge role in that aswell!<br><br>If you know how to //copy, //flip, //rotate you are off the a amazing start :D (Because you can play around with build more without wasting much time, thus, developing your creative mind faster)<br><br>If could go more in depth about building if you ask me, but I think this will do haha<br><br>(EDIT: I might add more text from time to time)

How good are you at doing modern builds/architecture? I've done a few in the past but sadly I gave up building because the server that I built on went down :l<br><br>Also, what's your favorite block/block combination to build with and why?

I never actually gave modern builds a go, because I prefer fantasy and being able to do anything. (Shape, form)<br><br>Definitely Sandstorm's block combination, I did a lot of builds using this block combo, and compared to a lot of other builds, they all came out great!<br><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/vVMkbp0.png"><br><br>Stonebrick, Stonebrick Slab, Stonebrick Stair<br>Sandstone, Sandstone Slab, Sandstone Stair<br>Wool (35:8), Wool (35:0), Glowstone
