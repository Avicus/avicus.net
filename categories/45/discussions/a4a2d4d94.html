Is it even legal to sell a /go command on a minecraft server? I recently read the EULA and it's not specified. Could you guys please clarify that for me?

having /go and not having /go gives no gameplay advantages based on how I see it

If I recall correctly, the EULA basically states that a server cannot sell any feature that affects the gameplay of players or gives and advantage to one player over the other.<br><br>This means that stuff like joining full teams, having lobby pets and customizations, and multipliers on a credit based system to buy cosmetic items are allowed.<br><br>Adding a /go command is no different. In no way does having a command that allows a player to teleport to another player while in observers or on another server affect that player's gameplay, or the gameplay of others.

Yeah that makes a lot of sense.

I would assume that this refers to selling the commands for in game usage. For example, if /go worked in game (while you're <b>playing</b> the match), and you could use it to teleport around the map.<br><br>Realistically, /go doesn't really do much other than make you not have to go /seen &lt;playername&gt; and then /sv &lt;servername&gt; for what ever server that guy is playing on.

Please don't go offtopic.<br><br>@OP<br>Since it doesn't give any player an unfair advantage, it should be compatible with the EULA. Funky (the owner) is someone who supports the EULA and wants to comply with it.

The ability to join full teams is one of the very few things outside of cosmetics that the EULA allows.
