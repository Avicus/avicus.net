Idk how to fix it, but I see you got a cheap headset, and I assume if you cant get it to work your gonna wanna get another one. If you want one that isnt too expensive, but is still good, I recommend either the Corsair 1400 or SteelSeries Siberia RAW. Anyways, what I understand from your problem is that either your microphone or headphone jack on your PC is broken.

Try to Unplug &amp; Plug the cable again, if possible, and do that several times. Also, Restart your computer

I've got a Turtle Beach headset as well.<br><br>Quick question, when you wiggle the jack around inside the plug, does it make a crackling noise?

I use the exact same headset, and I have issues with one side of the headset not working while the other is just fine. What works for me is messing with the volume wheel on the wire. Turning it all the way up seems to fix it for some reason. Beyond that, I don't know what else I can do to help you. Even though I have the same headset, this is what it looks like for me :<br><img src="http://i.gyazo.com/917d7f36bce292f5b22d20fc9fb6820d.png" title="Image: http://i.gyazo.com/917d7f36bce292f5b22d20fc9fb6820d.png">
