Hello! :)<br><br>I really need your all help. In a week I'm flying to London for a week, and I barely have any places to visit in. I'll &nbsp;be more than happy if you people from London or anyone that knows good museums or fun places to visit will tell me them and explain me a bit. I really need it.&nbsp;<br>Thanks, Electra :D

Personally, I've always wanted to visit the Natural History Museum in London. I've heard that it's really fascinating, so I would really recommend seeing it if you'll be in London!

I went England for 6 times, London. That is amazing. You should visit the National History Museum, London Eye, Big Ben,Travalgar Square (whatever) and Apple Store. Subways are amazing, not like USA's... And finally, of course Hyde Park! If you need something about there you can ask me 'cuz as I said I went there for 6 times ;)

It's a big Aquarium by the London Eye. I recommened it, totally worth it. On a side note, try and visit Windsor Castle. It's around 20-30 minutes by train from London Waterloo.

As a person who has lived in europe, and has travelled to London numerous, times, I would recommend, &nbsp;the following:<br><br><ul><li>The tower of London: This is a must buddy. there is so much history, and beauty to this castle. I would seriously try and get your spot to go on one of the tours with the beefeaters! It is really cool!&nbsp;</li><li>the British Museum: This museum is pretty awesome. I would say that you'll need good walking shoes.. The museum is pretty big!</li><li>Tower Bridge: This magnificent treasure of england, is truly amazing. Just walking across it is really cool!</li><li>Go to the London EYE. Personally, I hate touristy places, but this one is truly awesome. Nothing beats a 360 view of London from above right?</li><li>I would strongly recommend, going out and seeing the Imperial War Museum!</li><li>Hamleys Toystore: Ok, you might not be into toys anymore, but this toy store is freaking huge! I mean 6 stories tall of toys, candy, giant teddy bears, and Lego</li><li>Here's a good tip for london: Get an oyster card (transportation card) This thing will take you anywhere, you can take the tube, or the busses, or anything that goes on wheels and requires the oyster car!&nbsp;</li></ul>Hope this list helps &lt;3

Ok the oyster card is basically like a bus pass, where you scan it, and you are free to enter the bus. The card is prepaid, and is rechargeable. I would recommend, researching on the london tube website, to find out more! I haven't been to london in two years, so things may have changed so yeah! Just check the website, or ask your parents buddy. I'm pretty sure they could help
