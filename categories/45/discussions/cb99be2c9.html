Do people even use the Forums that much?<br><br>I only see on a daily base average from like 5-10 people max.<br><br>There is also a problem with Viewers and Repliers. I really don't like.<br>

Would the Viewer number still go up for people who aren't signed in?<br><br>Like for example I know when you sign out people can still go to "Forums" and enter a discussion.<br><br>This to me just feels like an evasion of privacy on the website.

Viewer number is the number of users logged in viewing the forums... You can count to find that out :P<br><br>What's wrong with 68 views and 12 replies? 68 users have viewed it, some have viewed it multiple times, and 12 users have replied... If you view a discussion, you aren't required to reply to it.

Oh. Sometimes the Viewer amount is so much higher then the Replies, I just thought it counts people who aren't logged in and it counts them.<br><br>Sorry if I'm wrong.<br><br>However I still don't like the fact people can read discussions when they aren't even signed in.<br>
