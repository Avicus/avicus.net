Its awesome! I think I already have a headache tho .-. probably because I've been in front of my computer screen for the past 7 hours and had half a slice pizza in the past 7 hours (parents forgot to feed me therefore my dad gave me half the last slice since he had to eat) xD

@Tarheelkiwi My goal as a Staff member is pretty much like all the other staff members, to help the server grow bigger while keeping all the rules breakers away to make the experience on the server fun and safe for all players all ages :)<br>@BALLZI Oh yea, I'm pro alright, better than MLGPorkEY, I am 501% amazing (yes the 01 is there)
