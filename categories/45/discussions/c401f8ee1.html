Welcome to the forums!<br>Make sure you know the forum rules. You can find them <a rel="nofollow" href="http://avicus.net/rules">here</a>!<br><br>If someone dies because of fire you don't get the point beacuse you weren't the person to get the killing shot on them.<br>Personally I think you should get a point for it but it might be a bit hard to put in the game because I think it's a vanilla thing too.

the placement of the light green piece third from the bottom is just awful.<br><br>when you make bad choices in tetris, that will lead you to gateway drugs which then means you are getting hooked on heroin sub 3 weeks

What about death messages that say "JKawesome was burnt to a crisp whilst fighting FrostedNubcakez"? They could just do the same thing, since it works in nebula. However, sometimes it says "JKawesome went up in flames"

You do get a point from it, it should say:<br>Player burned to death whilst fighting Player,<br>unless he didn't die from the flames, but something else. ^-^

When the person you have attacked have been taking fire damage for "x" amount of seconds the cause of death will simply be fire as it did a reasonable amount to finish it off. It is a vanilla thing and probably wont be changed as its bot that big a deal - try go for another sgot next time. Oh and, welcome to tha forums ~ where avicus is avicus .-.

Yea.. I think it's all determind on how long you were hit before you went up in flames if you know what I mean.<br>If you're fighting someone and you knock them into lava while still hittin them and they burn up. Then you'll get the kill.<br><br>But if you hit someone into lava and the lava does all the work then you don't get the kill.&nbsp;<br><br>Considering that's it's also in the vanilla game I'm not sure how easy it'll be to code it so that you get the kill each time.

If You Shoot Someone With A Flame Bow And Then 1 Secound They Die When You Are Still Shooting Them It Was Say Player Was Burned To Death While Fighting Player<br>If You Shoot Him Once And Then 5 Secounds Later He Dies He Burns To Death Because Fire Killed Him More Then You Did
