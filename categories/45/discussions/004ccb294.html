These thank you threads and AMA threads seem to be the kool thing to do these days so I thought I would hop on the bandwagon and make a thank you thread!<br><br>You might be asking what the hell does this guy have to be thankful for? Well simply I want to thank everyone here who has been so warm and welcoming to me. I came from a big minigame server and I missed the closeness that I have experienced so far here. I have even resigned from the server so that I can spend all my minecraft time here. I also got sick of the greed and corruptness but thats another story. I bought Emerald just to give back a little plus green is my favourite colour so why not!<br><br>Anyway thanks a bunch and I'll be here for awhile yet I think and look forward to getting to know more of you guys!&nbsp;<br>mucho lav &lt;3

I love posts like this! I have been inactive for a while now so I doubt you've met me, but welcome! :D To be honest I think I should be thanking <i>you </i>for posts like this- *faith in humanity restored*.
