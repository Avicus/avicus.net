Hello,<br><br>I will be taking this thread seriously, and I hope many of you do so as well. I have a few questions and what to hear your opinions as well.<br><br>Why is it acceptable for certain individuals to call others autistic, or saying they have another illness for a stupid reason? I don't understand, but is this a laughing matter to some people? Why is this not looked at thoroughly and taken seriously? I mean, I know there are some very salty people in the minecraft community, but is this not a big deal to some people? Millions of people suffer through this, but yet we've come to a point where being called austistic or even told to get cancer is socially acceptable in some way.&nbsp;<br><br>For instance, there have been a few cases where I've heard others called autistic, or a "downy" on teamspeak, for killing someone in minecraft. Why does a simple game made for entertainment and amusement have to give off such negative effects? And most importantly, why is this ignored? Even staff members/former staff members have been noticed in these "funny jokes". Any opinions on this?<br><br>Enjoy me being serious for a bit, it won't last that long. Have a good talk, and stay triggered.

I think insults vary from the person your saying them too. In Minecraft if I was to call someone Autistic and they were someone I've been playing with for a long time everyone that knows we've been friends for a while would be fine with it. But if I was to call someone I don't know at all it'll be a different circumstance. Also knowing the persons background and any recent occurrence can vary in what insults/jokes I make. For example I had one of mine closest friends make a stupid joke about another persons mother (kinda like in the moment for a little chuckles) saying "what is your mom brain dead", end up the dudes mother died few weeks before he was upset but okay with it after. <br><br>Now to racists jokes, at my school we have like 20 African Canadians (Small school of like 400 or 500). I talk to around 5 of them that I deem are chill, I'm on a level where I can openly say the N word in a joking manner, the one ending with the a of course. I'm Native and they sometimes joke around and call me a red skin and what not, I don't care. I can make racist jokes, and honestly the few friends I have that are of darker skin tones love them. Like a little whisper in the ear "Don't be so mean you might get shot", gets a little laugh from them. <br><br>Relating this back to the Minecraft Community I think it's exactly similar. If I'm on a level of friendship where I can make jokes that would be offensive and they take it as a joke then I'll say it.&nbsp; If I said a joke to Trigger and you happened to hear it, I wouldn't take offense to it, I'm not talking to you and if you do, I don't care (Unless it's extremely sensitive). <br><br>My opinion on the means of making fun of something, if you do it to a point where you aren't bullying the said person and they're fine with it. Being accepted into a society allows people to make fun of whatever it is. Like I have a gay friend, and we joke about him blowing people in the back alley ways and he laughs and likes it, if I can't make fun of you and joke about something (again not extremely sensitive like death) then I won't get along with you to that level of friendship.<br>If you can't really joke about something you want people to like you for, then how to expected to be liked? Here's an example, in Grade 9 pantsing was really big and me being funny kid I was a easy target, one time I tried countering the pantsing by tieing my waistband tight and when the kid got me the whole package came out. Being from Canada it was like -30 outside and the thing was halfway inside of me, so I got made fun of it. The only way I could stop people from laughing at me was to make a joke out of it, if I laughed with them they would see I don't care and soon forget about. Week later everyone forgot, it stills comes up time to time but it's whatever. <br><br>Hopes this answers the question:)

From what I've learned, the world is so sensitive at this point everyone gets offended really easily (some people have a right to though).&nbsp;<br><br>All I do at this point is try not to make any even mildly offensive jokes, and if I ever do it's always to someone that I know and am friends with and even then disclose the fact that I do not wish to offend anyone in any way.

Without reading anyone else's responses, my answer to this is that it's all about <i>intent</i>.&nbsp;<b><i></i></b><i></i>Nine times out of ten, no one is being malicious in their intent, and when they are, its worth letting someone who can deal with it, just deal with it - and move on.

Humour is another thing that varies from person to person. I personally see where you're coming&nbsp;from . I've always taken quite harshly to blatant uncalled for insults for the sake of 'humour.' Some are very limited creatively, so most insults will be pretty basic. (Just speculating. Don't take my word on that statement.)<br><br>But yeah, if you're having trouble with it, just understand intent. Calling someone 'gay' was the go to not too long ago, now its 'autistic/retard', tomorrow it'll be something else. Just brush it off and realise you're better for not participating. :)

Its all about who says it. You can't tell whether the other person meant to be a dick or meant to make some banter unless you know them. If like some boy on the other team in a scrim calls me a retard or something because I fuck up my bridging I'll get pissed. But like, if one of my friends called me a retard in that exact same situation then I'd know its just cheeky banter.

I think that most humour is fine as long as its with someone who you are comfortable with. If I do not know someone well and they start making jokes that are racist or offensive I find it strange and rude. Both Autism and Cancer are terrible conditions; however, as I said before. If both sides are comfortable with the jokes I think its OK.

Honestly, &nbsp;the only ones that annoy me are racism and cancer joke. I know from personal experience that it's not something to be taken lightly, and I despise jokes about it.<br><br>With that said, a lot of it is just black humour. From someone with a quite dry sense of humour, I can appreciate some racist, sexist, etc. as long as they're not meant in a malicious way, even if I would prefer that they weren't used.

Personally I believe it depends on who you are joking with, and who else can see what you are saying. I personally do not get offended by most of these jokes, but I also know that some people do get offended, because of their background and the situations that they have been in. As such, I believe these jokes are fine&nbsp;<b>only if they are private and withe people who are ok withe them</b>. For example, porkyyy and I are quite good friends, and he sometimes calls me autistic, etc, as a joke, because he knows I won't get offended by it. Whenever we are in game, he will privately message me these things because he is aware of the fact that not everyone in the is fine with that, ando he doest want to offend anyone. I think that is the right way to go about making jokes like that, should you feel the need to.
