Ayyyyy, so a suggestion thread exploded with stuff about politics, so i thought why not make a thread on it.<br><br><br>Feel free to debate over countries, forms of leadership, etc.&nbsp;<br><br>Please make sure to be respectful, and don't get so hurt over a comment that you don't like.

Oh please you think he listens. I agree with you completely but my friend a week ago (Hispanic) had to go get checked if he had papers because trump demanded it even though he can't do that. He will gett impeached. Honestly he should be declared unconstitutional himself. In obamas latest speech I think it was called senators stand or something. He mentioned about how all races should be treated with equality and no one race is higher than the other. Donald trump has 2 cares<br>1) money<br>2) white people<br><br>Nothing else

I'm saying the judicial branch will impeach him as well as the people can vote him off. The only thing I can see why he might want to become president is immigration, which is a good reason don't get me wrong, but his solution is to kick everyone out except white people. Asians and Indians are ones I've never heard him say anything bad about either

I don't like Trump, but not knowing stuff about him and assuming or making stuff up about him is wrong. He said he wants to temporarily stop Muslim immigration, which is bad, but not as bad as kicking them all out.

The problem is people keep associating Muslim with Isis. &nbsp;They are Islamic Extremist meaning when they read the Quran they interpret extreme ideas. &nbsp;Even Christians have had extremists, (KKK), we need to treat them as a terrorist group not some big bad because frankly that's what terrorist want, to strike fear in people, and when politicians&nbsp;make rash decisions because they're in fear well that's not a good idea.<br><br>Reply to Grape: I think this could work, just don't get butt hurt if someone doesn't agree with you &nbsp;and I hope we can talk politics of other countries too

Most of the people here are 14 and older. I doubt you're any older than that, and if you look through the thread, the people here at least seem to know a little.

Bernie actually knows what's going on socially in the country, and can really help it. Trump is racist and doesn't get what America really needs. He's a guy who is rich, and just wants to get more rich, and get power along the way.
