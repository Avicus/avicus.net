I don't have a set budget, but I'm looking to get a new gaming mouse for my PC. Any recommendations? Thanks.

Anything from Razer is a good call, but it depends how you hold the mouse, have a look at their website, they have a guide on what mouse is best for you, try having a look at that! I hope I helped!

Razer is shit. No offence, but the amount you pay for their mice are so bad that I almost throw up when I see the 180$ price tag on their new "Technologically advanced" Razer Mamba. Sure, it has adjustable click force and RGB lighting etc, but all their mice, except maybe for the DeathAdder, are bad. The DeathAdder is pretty good though, except for the build quality.<br><br>@OP If you're willing to spend 100$, and not play MMOs, The Mionix Castor is the best mouse on the market rn. You think of it as a smaller, lighter, more agile and more accurate DeathAdder, which fits like a glove with ever single type of grip (I'm lucky because I have small hands and a palm grip, and the Castor is small compared to some other high-end mice). This mouse has 4 layers of grip coated plastic, 2 side buttons, Omron switches, rated at 20 million clicks, and a simply superb scroll wheel. The ergonomics are incredible, and it just fits like a glove. It's for right handed people. It has RGB lighting like the Razer Chroma mice, on the scroll wheel and logo. Just think of it as a mouse 2x better than the DeathAdder in almost every way for around 30$ more.<br><br>Here's a review from my personal favorite tech reviewer.<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc8k131nb3Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc8k131nb3Q</a>

Still haven't had problems with my DeathAdder. When or if it does break, I'm getting the Castor off of MassDrop. If you haven't checked this mouse out yet, for the love of god, please do. It's basically a DeathAdder but better in almost every way :P

I'm going to rephrase what I said.<br><br>Razer is shit compared to Logitech, (I don't know how your mouse died, probably just a defective unit) Mionix, Corsair, SteelSeries, etc.<br><br>If you take care of your products of course they won't break. But your Naga fell off a table and broke?Now that's bad build quality. Also, Razer's cheap "Gaming grade mechanical green key switch" is made from a company called Kaihl, which is Chinese. Most gaming companies use these key switches to REDUCE the price, since they are A LOT worse than Cherry MX. But, being the idiotic hype based Razer they are, they INCRESED the price. And btw, Tge Logitech G600s is more ergonomic, has a better sensor, has RGB lighting (Chroma if you will), and a ring finger button. AND it's cheaper.

I'm not one of them. Unfortunatly for you, I actually KNOW what I'm talking about. Razer uses chesp material, for a higher price, end of story. Again, they don't make bad products, they make ok products. But for a company that size, I would expect at least some of their products to have somehting else other than plastic.. Just look at the Corsair K70 RGB. It has the best Multimedia Controls Ive ever seen. It has 2 choices of GERMAN made Cherry MX keyswitches. It's also made out of ALUMINUM. It has all the other features the BlackWidow Chroma has and a couple more. And it's LESS MONEY. Have you ever experiences a Cherry MX Blue switch? Or a Razer Green switch. If you have, which I doubt, you will notice the difference between the feel; the Cherry MX blues have the same click and tactile feedback, but feel A LOT lighter, and I am NOT exaggerating. So please, for the love god, do your reserach before you talk. Unlike you, I actually look at comparison videos, tech reviews and amazon reviews of most well known keyboards and mice, and to my knowledge, the people that actually have the sense to do their research say Razer is bad compared to other well known companies. Argue all you want, I am not wrong.

If you're looking for a wireless mouse, I recommend the Logitech G602.<br>I normally use this one on my laptop, just kind of prefer wireless to be honest. But it's totally up to you! Haven't broke it yet.. Which says a lot considering the fact I've accidentally flung my mouse the room one or twice.. My bad.<br><br>A good wired mouse I would recommend is also by Logitech. It's the Hyperion Fury G402 mouse, use it at my dad's and it's works really well.

If you want fast clicking, go for the DeathAdder. Easily the fastest clicking mouse on the market.

I'm not one of them. Unfortunatly for you, I actually KNOW what I'm talking about. Razer uses chesp material, for a higher price, end of story. Again, they don't make bad products, they make ok products. But for a company that size, I would expect at least some of their products to have somehting else other than plastic.. Just look at the Corsair K70 RGB. It has the best Multimedia Controls Ive ever seen. It has 2 choices of GERMAN made Cherry MX keyswitches. It's also made out of ALUMINUM. It has all the other features the BlackWidow Chroma has and a couple more. And it's LESS MONEY. Have you ever experiences a Cherry MX Blue switch? Or a Razer Green switch. If you have, which I doubt, you will notice the difference between the feel; the Cherry MX blues have the same click and tactile feedback, but feel A LOT lighter, and I am NOT exaggerating. So please, for the love god, do your reserach before you talk. Unlike you, I actually look at comparison videos, tech reviews and amazon reviews of most well known keyboards and mice, and to my knowledge, the people that actually have the sense to do their research say Razer is bad compared to other well known companies. Argue all you want, I am not wrong.

If you're looking for a wireless mouse, I recommend the Logitech G602.<br>I normally use this one on my laptop, just kind of prefer wireless to be honest. But it's totally up to you! Haven't broke it yet.. Which says a lot considering the fact I've accidentally flung my mouse the room one or twice.. My bad.<br><br>A good wired mouse I would recommend is also by Logitech. It's the Hyperion Fury G402 mouse, use it at my dad's and it's works really well.

"G502&gt;G402 in almost everyday except price"&nbsp;<br><br>And weight, G502 is on the heavy side, even with all the weights removed, whereas the G402 is fairly light.
