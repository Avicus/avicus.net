Exactly guys! As expected god is giving us some signals that the Avicus Tournament 3 is going to be sometime SOON, as what I could have understand of this weird signals, I expect it to be announced in around 2 weeks!<br><br>As promised, I will show you guys what god showed me for being a good religious guy, he chosed me to be the comunicator with the Avicus Community.<br><br>1- I almost see Juanoh, exactly, the Juanoh you guys are thinking is the one I am talking about.<br>Yesterday while I was road to Queenland I almost saw JUANOH, I SENT him my location and he sent me yours, we were 90 meters away. Proof:<br><img src="https://imgur.com/cPDmW3R.png"><br><br><br>2- The sky is falling in our heads.<br>How god told Moises there would be 40 days and 40 nights of rain, he told me the same to me, and it started raining already so everyone who has been aganist the awesome god of Avicus is going to die drowned.<br><br>3- The Ban of the Truth<br>The other day I was on Team Speak talking to my fellow Avicastians about our Lord and Savior God when suddenly the user named as "Foulded" banned someone with the reason "666 you are death, expect bad things to happen", at the start I was scared but I used my bible to translate it to the Argentinian language (also known as Cuantas Copas Tenes) and what it said was "Pibe, el torneo se viene en 2 weeks y las malvinas son argentinas" (Dude, the tourney is coming in 2 weeks and the falklands are argentinian)<br><br>That's all guys, I hope you guys trust in my high quality research about the upcoming tournament, if you got any extra info remember to tell me so I can add it to my post.<br>And remember, may god be with you!
