So if you haven't noticed I haven't been on t.s or in-game for a couple days and the reason for that is 3 days ago I got an Cray and the doctor found a small brain tumor.<br><br>Now if it wasn't for my doctor I wouldn't be here right now being able to make this post.<br><br>I know some of you may be like oh why do we care but the reason I'm posting this is because maybe some of you guys know people with brain tumors or lost close people that died from them, and I know how it feels to lose someone to a brain tumor.<br><br>I might be on Team Speak or Skype if you want to talk but if I'm not I'm probably asleep or back at the hospital so wish me luck.<br><br>-Dawson

Cancer isn't diagnosed in just <i>two days</i>. It takes years for cancer to develop and because cancer can spread you need to do mri, pet and ct scans, which take weeks up to months until the scan results arrive. It doesn't happen in just two days. <br><br>You don't have cancer, as easy as that.

Have you considered the possibility that he's/she's had it for a while, but the doctors didn't know it was a tumour? God, stop acting like you know what people are going through. You're not a doctor, so stop acting like one.<br><br>There was no need to say that. You have no evidence that it's a scam. You obviously have no idea what people on the server are like.

no need to be a dickhead, but. Aphelion just said his own opinion, if you don't find okey, you could basically use other words instead of dickhead. As in this situation, it is more likely that people will go and comment like Aphelion did because like Nerfgun2002 did. So there is no need to call him ''Ok Dr Aphelion..................Dickhead.........''.<br><br>Ontopic: Get well soon buddy! =)
