Hey There!<br><br>This is just a forum game i used to host and it was fun with what sentences they came up with. So what do we do here I start with a sentence the beginning of the story amd after that the next person that reads it can write another sentence and this will go on for a long time i hope. I have no idea if someone hosted this before if so now its back.<br><br>Rules:<br>-You have to wait for 3 other people to respond after your sentence.<br>-No sexual sentences.<br>-No discrimination.<br>-No hurting others (Aiming with a sentence to someone to hurt his feeling)&nbsp;<br>-Have fun<br>-And just all the other inappropriate&nbsp;&nbsp;stuff i think you can come up with the rest of the list.<br><br>so I'll start:&nbsp;<br>Once upon a time there was a player called Bob.<br><br>Now the next person needs to give another sentence good luck!
