I'm sure about that lots of people love map called Quintus. I think that it should be on more servers like Nebula01 or Luna. I mean if people love it, it should be playing much.We usually KillFarm &nbsp;on thish map. It's really fun!

Quintus is already on 2 servers.. Plus, have you ever even thought about how the people being killfarm er feel? Not very fun for them.

It actually isn't hard to avoid a killfarm if you know tactics to get through them. If you just charge through in hopes of them not seeing you, then the game will suck. A tactic that I use is sneaking along the outer edge of the map. If a diamond guy sees me, he would have to lean over to shoot me, which, in that case, a teammate could easily knock them off. Another tactic is to get on top of your spawn and fast-staircase, and try to get onto the diamond towers. From there, the killfarm could be easily avoided.

It's a good map, but it should definitely not be in more rotations. There are so many maps that contain better gameplay and look nicer, they deserve to be in more rotations just as much as this. Just because Quintus is a nice killfarming map doesn't mean it deserves this.

When other team is kill farming our team, I rush or brake the woods that protectects farmers from void. And rushing to kill farmer team is easier.

I disagree with you bud, you need to think first about this, almost every map is good in this server so we need to play some others even thought this map is our favourite right?<br>I think 2 rots is enough.<br>^-^

Idek why everyone complains about kfing, I literally just go to back of spawn, or somewhere and make bridges around the edge/tunnel. Depending on how aggro the kill farmers are, you can sometimes manage to bridge to one for your side mons and to the side of spawn. Bridge to the side of the main area, where kfers usually hole up, low and just sneak around the edge of that main area and bridge out to the other side. Since they're all pushed up, there should be next to no-one to stop you from getting the mons. Easy.&nbsp;<br><br>If I ever start to get kf'd on Quintus, I'll start recording and try to avoid it.

It's allowed as long as you don't pass the "crossroad", meaning the intersection between the main lane and iron paths.

Quintus is already on the McZone rots. There's no point putting a "popular" map onto a category of rotations it doesn't belong to.<br>McZone rotations are around for a reason. To preserve nostalgia, really.<br>Quintus is a map where kill farming is the norm, it annoys a lot of people, so why would you want to bring that annoyance onto other rotations?
