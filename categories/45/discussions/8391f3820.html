Going to keep this short as posible, it would take too long to apolgize for everything I've done and to all the indivual players/groups I have been rude to. Anyway I want to say I'm sorry for the way I have acted the past two and a half months, my behavior towards the staff team and towards cerrtain teams has been very bad.My rudeness and salt has caused me lots of troubles and ruined old friendships. ;-; I hope that the people I have affected accept my apology, once I get home you will see that my attuide has changed for the better. c; -99

I appreciate your honesty, and I will say that you were courageous and spoke up against things that other's wouldn't. My only concern was the fact that it got excessive and nitpicky at times, but you did have motives and backing behind it, and I did appreciate your contributions as a moderator. As long as you're making an effort to improve, my respect escalates for you.

People like you made me feel like shit, that's why I tried to apologize to you afterwards but you constantally rejected changing.

The reason I was angry with you is the way you acted to me and to other staff members. I hope we could get past it in the future. It's nice to see you actually apologizing for what you did because I am sorry for what I said to you.

Lol you had reasons to be salty. In my opinion an apology wasn't necessary, all you did was state the truth... And in life not many people like the truth xd

Hey Para. I have something to talk to you. I'm so sorry I don't know how to post on forums. So i can only say what i want to say here. Hopefully you see this. The reason i'm writing this is I am ban and i Want you guys to unban me. It's been almost a year since i have been banned. The reason i was ban is because i have been talking trash to RefuseToSink a moderator at that time. First of all, sorry RefuseToSink. It's been almost a year and i really regreted my decision. I don't understand why some people use hacks and they get temporary banned but me, just talking trash about RefuseToSink gets permernantly banned. I'm sorry if there the ban appeal format is wrong but i really hope that i would be unban. Please unban me. I'm sorry for what i have done. I miss this server a lot.
