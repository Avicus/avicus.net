It looks like he took your skin and name. .-. Not sure if you can take this to Mojang or something but I be a little bit mad if someone took my skin and username and posted things on youtube with it.

I don't think it is. I am a friend of Noob and on his and the guy has the same skin. Its a little hard to have the same skin and same name of Noob830. There is a bunch of names to pick from and Noob830. And with the same skin.

I don't think its a coincidence because every time i change my skin he changes his, because i use to have a skin with sleeves and i got rid of them and poof just like that his sleeves are gone. soo i change my skin to a more x-mas theme and now i waiting to see if he changes or not.

It should work, unless your password isn't good enough.<br>Try using a complicated password, something that would be hard to guess. Also, add some security questions if you want more security. ^-^

Most likely, your minecraft account was hacked, since two people can't have the same username. One of the videos shows him dying, and it says that Noob830 fell out of the world. It's sad that this guy even posted videos made on a hacked account. As others suggested, if you haven't already, change your Minecraft password. It'll definitely help.

If you think or even have the notion that your Minecraft account was hacked, change your password&nbsp;<b>immediately.&nbsp;<br><br></b>It's a very simple process and will tighten your security.<br><b><br></b>If you ever need personal help with it, you can add me on Skype and I will try to aid you in the best possible way(on my profile).<br><b><br></b>Good luck.&nbsp;<b><br></b>

confront them and let them know you are going to do whatever it takes to catch them and then - as Roman said - change your password, good luck man :)<br><br>EDIT: when i say confront, i mean go to the stolen channel and post, comment, etc. your confrontation :S
