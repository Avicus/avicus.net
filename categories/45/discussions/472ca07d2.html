I just wanna start making proper videos instead of shit ones that I do xd. But just wonder, what's the best screen recorder software for Mac? I tried ScreenFlow and isn't that good actually. And I see many people using OBS. But still need to get your suggestions...

I use QuickTime Player, also, it's free since it should already been installed in your computer since your mac comes with it.

My pro tip: Don't use Mac.<br><br>But if it's too late already, get OBS Studio.

I'd definitely recommend using OBS. It allows for tons of customization to fit your needs for recording quality, format, and other settings. It's open source too, which means if you are having problems with it, you can get community support as well as official support. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Because you're using Mac, you can only install obs-studio, which is alright because the classic version is deprecated and is no longer being developed.<br><br><b>Edit:&nbsp;</b>Lossless recording quality is also very possible in OBS, so if you're looking for top-notch quality that would be available.

I use Screenflow 6 to record my videos. Even if it is not for free, it is certainly good. If you are considering to get one, I can send you a link of a video that shows the best export settings. (I just found out) :D

Quicktime Player is a good program to start out with. Also, OBS is good.

I downloaded OBS, but it gives me like 1-7 fps in game. Xtra told me that there is an option that doesn't use your CPU, so you can use your CPU for mine craft and no lag! But unfortunately when I click there I only see one option. Anyone has an idea? Btw I have screen flow too, @Athena thank you :)

I had Screen flow 5 and it wasn't really good. Now got Screen flow 6 and only makes me lose 5-10fps. I think I got what i need :)
