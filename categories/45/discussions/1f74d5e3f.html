This question popped up in my mind while I was studying some historical technology stuff for school.<br><br><b>What do you think technology will be like in the year 2020, five years from now?</b><br><br>Personally, I think that laptops wouldn't common anymore, and most people would either be using a tablet for home and portable use, or a higher-end desktop PC for professionals and gamers. Storage capacities will grow much larger, and 512 GB of storage space will be normal in a phone, with computers and tablets starting at a few terabytes. 4K TVs will be common to see in most people's houses, and 6Ks will start to make their debut. Wearable technology will become even more popular, with smart watches replacing regular ones. Driverless cars will be open on the market, but I don't think a lot of people will have one at first.<br><br>Those are just some of my thoughts. Share yours!

2020 is pretty soon but im guessing wearable technology will be next, because holding a phone is a tremendous amount of effort .-. Laptops will be gone because everyone will realise how shit and useless they are and yeh, i have no ideas about cars or tv's, but we could be using some kind of techno glove instead of a mouse.

I agree with what build_high said. Wearable technology will be the new "thing" even it isn't the "thing" today. I expect Google Glass to go pretty far and&nbsp;<b>SOME</b> of the the smartwatches to still be around during that time. I think self-driving cars will already start to be regularly manufactured. and I hoe that they make a projector for a room that displays video on the walls all around you so it is a very immersive experience, and hopefully the Oculus Rift will be out by then.

I'm mostly fascinated with the development of military technology. (Im a twisted bastard, I know) They may seem far-fetched, but with massive human advances in technology I feel that we can at least gain ground in these fields.<br><br>Stealth Cloak: These things are already in development, blankets made of tiny glass beads spaced approx. 5 microns apart, they have the ability to bend light around the wearer, making them "invisible." This could prove vital to protecting armed forces during special ops missions, b/c we all know the current "camo" is pretty much useless. :/<br><br>Exo suits: These are already being tested today. They are mainly built for supporting the weight a soldier has to carry. With suspension and spring systems, they can alleviate the weight one has to endure. By 2020, I'm pretty sure we would see Advanced Warfare exos in the field. :P<br><br>3d Printers: This creation has revolutionized technology in the history of humankind. As time progresses, things tend to get smaller and more powerful. By 2020, I'm pretty sure the idea of a gun 3d printing bullets *cough*IMR*cough* would be in early development.<br><br>3d maneuver gear: Hate on me for being an Attack on Titan fan, but what Im thinking of isn't even close to a Titan slaying hookshot-jetpack thing. This could be designed for scaling difficult terrain with grappling hooks. It could enable easier movement on a 3d plane, such as scaling a cliff or steep slope. It could be used for workers during construction. Screw scaffolding, you can just latch on to any secure metal beam and hang there while welding away with you blowtorch. Sure, you could make a bunch of soldiers ziplining around with ARs, but I feel this could be used for more safety purposes rather than military use.<br><br>Biological regeneration: By watching the Game Theory video about this possibility, I found out that this field is already being explored. The Xotl (I think that's what it is called) is a species of salamander that can regenrate any part of its body. If scientists can find out at least the basics of regeneration 5 years from now, severe injuries with a risk of death would not be so challenging to face.

I will have a PC that will can run minecraft ore than 10 FPS.<br><br>The common Tablet storage will be 1TB, And it will be more expensive. The Tablets' RAM will be about 6-12 GB.<br>The normal internet connection speed will be 1 GB p/s and for servers around 4 TB p/s. We will can take a photo of us and see how we will be in 5 &gt; 10 &gt;20 &gt;30 &gt; 40 &gt;50 &gt; 60 and 70 years.<br>We will have a simple programming language free-for-all, that in fact it is an application / software that when you write in it something it do it.&nbsp;<br><br>Robots will be more common and better, approximately 2 robots per 10 persons.<br>The desktop PCs will have 100 TB of storage and around 128 GB of RAM.

we actually already have <a rel="nofollow" href="https://bleen.com/en-us/">hologram techonology</a>, so i think that will become more common but not too common to have in your house.<br>we also have <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/142464853/hendo-hoverboards-worlds-first-real-hoverboard">hoverboards</a>, coming out this fall, so it might not be extremely rare to see that around sometimes in 2020...<br>by 2020, we won't be seeing huge advances like everyone having robots and stuff, but better versions of existing technology will be more common (such as paying less for way better computers/tvs/etc)

That already exists.<br>More than the 10-15% of Tokyo habitants have it, only that it is a bit different, it isn't using screens, it is using a special helmet.
