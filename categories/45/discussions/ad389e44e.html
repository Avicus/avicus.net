So, here's my "problem," so to speak.<br><br>I need a keyboard that's better than my current one. This is it right here:<br><img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/Apple-wireless-keyboard-aluminum-2007.jpg"><br><br><br>Yeah, it's not the best for gaming, or even typing in my opinion.<br>I find it somewhat uncomfortable to use because, while sleek and modern, it doesn't feel very good when I'm typing on it, and my hands feel a bit sore when using it for a while. The keys don't feel as satisfying as I'd like, and it's also getting really dirty (more so than I would like, lol.)<br><br>So, I'm wondering if anyone has good suggestions for a moderately-priced "gaming" keyboard. Here's some criteria:<br><ul><li>Preferably wired, with a USB connection</li><li>Clean and appealing design - nothing too flashy, nothing too plain. Colors and backlighting would be cool, I guess.</li><li>I've never tried a mechanical keyboard (or at least I don't think I have) but I've heard they feel very satisfying to the touch and are recommended for gaming. Membrane keyboards are fine as I'm used to them, but a mechanical keyboard would be cool.</li><li>Volume buttons - absolute necessity, though I'm sure most keyboards have them. Media buttons are a nice addition as well.</li><li>Relatively light and easy to clean.</li><li>Price range: Up to $130 USD, though I REALLY want something under $100.</li></ul>I don't need macro keys or a screen on my keyboard, or anything over the top like that.&nbsp;<br><br>Thanks in advance! :D

I heard someone called for me!<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.roccat.org/Products/Gaming-Keyboards/ROCCAT-Isku/">http://www.roccat.org/Products/Gaming-Keyboards/ROCCAT-Isku/</a><br><br><ul><li>Rubber dome keys</li><li>Large wrist rest, makes it very comfortable.</li><li>Backlit cool, makes you look cool!</li><li>5 different levels for brightness</li><li>3 easy shift zones</li><li>36 total macros (easy-to-reach)</li><li>1000Hz polling rate, faster than most normal keyboards.</li><li>Profile switching (Comes with drivers)</li></ul>One downside with this is that you don't get the mechanical keys because of the rubber dome keys, but it is not that much of a big deal if you ask me.
