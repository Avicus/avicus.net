I think you should improve on your maturity and learn not to go way too overboard on your jokes. That is my opinion. On your pvp skills, they are good and I don't think you need to improve them as much as I need to improve mine.

your pvp skills is below average, you think you're better then what you actually are, you're pretty salty but idc because its minecraft everyone is salty in the community, when you say that you have been playing on OCN for many years i interpret it as you being cocky and saying that you're very experienced and better then the average avicus player TBH you're really not

Youre on mars so probably a pretty average player.<br><br>Very annoying/cringe on the forums. Like when you spammed Lg's AMA with useless nonsense.

Can't take a defeat or getting proved wrong and you start useless shit like chatting shit on lg AMA so you're obviously gonna get banged. Gets so salty over nothing and calls people&nbsp;unnecessary things when you don't understand people's situations<br><br>but you are an understed player and good at pvp
