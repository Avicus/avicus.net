So, I'm sure all of you have heard about windows 10 that came out 2 days ago. (29th of July 2015)<br>And I'm sure just like me, there are multiple people who have&nbsp;<b>not</b> gotten Windows 10 yet but are thinking of getting it.<br><br>Well here is the thread for all of you people who&nbsp;<b>have</b> upgraded to windows 10, if you want to give your review of the following:<br><br><b>Previous version of Windows</b> [Which Windows version did you have before. Ex: Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, 8.1]<br><b>Performance</b> [How smooth/fast is Winows 10. Is it better than your previous version? Is it better?]<br><b>Layout</b> [How do you like the Windows 10 layout. Do you enjoy it more than your previous version?]<br><b>New Features&nbsp;</b>[What new features do you like, and which features do you not like]<br><b>FPS during Gameplay</b> [Did your FPS rise in Minecraft, did it lower, is it the same? You are allowed to use other games as well]<br><b>Overall Rating&nbsp;</b>[What is your rating out of 10? Was it an improvement to your previous version? Do you like it better than your last Windows version?]<br><b>Is it worth upgrading to Windows 10&nbsp;</b>[Yes or No]<br><br>You may give your opinion of Windows 10 if you&nbsp;<b>do not</b> have it from the reviews (can be from Avicus, can be from other sites) as some ideas may not be given from these questions. If you do take from other sites please try giving the links as well from where yoou found your info so everyone knows where you are getting your information from.<br>&nbsp;<br>Thanks for answering these questions :) I'm sure that everyone who is thinking about getting Windows 10 will believe this is really helpful!

Some people didn't get the notification for whatever reason Microsoft has so that link is just a link where you can download it faster. I got the icon notification though, I just used that link to download the ISO file of Windows 10 so I can test it out on a virtual machine.

Can you try to give any arguments before saying Windows 10 is garbage?<br>Like, I find it way better than Windows 7. My average FPS improved a lot and I found it easier to work with even more now.

Gaming wise you may get a minimally better performance however every version past 7 is catered away from pc users and the tech savy.

You don't lose your files when you do the upgrade, to be safe though I would make a system image because that's what I did. Didn't need to use the image though :P Hope this helped :)

Don't upgrade to windows 10. Microsoft already screwed up a ton of times, and now they got you again, but in a sneaky way. <a href="http://thenextweb.com/microsoft/2015/07/29/wind-nos/" rel="nofollow" title="Link: http://thenextweb.com/microsoft/2015/07/29/wind-nos/">This articles</a> explains how Microsoft doesn't care about cutomers at all, but letting them use their software for free.<br>And people say, "That's a nice thing to do of them".<br>In my honest opinion, I'm not upgrading, windows 7 will be the best version of windows no matter what. If there is DX12 or Performance increase idc. I can play all the games I want and I dont need it. Just a fair warning.

Sorry for the minor bump but for those still looking to see if they want windows 10 here is something helpful.<br><br>This is how you find out if your drivers &amp; programs are compatible in windows 10.<br><br><img src="https://i.gyazo.com/e94882678588e10293dd3ac6e0ef892b.gif" title="Image: https://i.gyazo.com/e94882678588e10293dd3ac6e0ef892b.gif">

Sorry for the bump just wanted to make a comment a this. <br>I downloaded Windows 10 tonight after three tries of downloading/installing finally got it to work. My first thoughts of it aren't the greatest, as it just looks like a hybrid of Windows 7 and 8 mixed which is kinda awkward IMO. <br>So my advice for anyone that didn't update, don't do it yet its not worth it, stick to Windows 7 if you have it. The update isn't all the great which is why I held off for so long.

I doubt that they will change the user interface this far in. If anything, they will only fix bugs from Windows 10. Nothing wrong with holding it off, but make sure you upgrade before time is up.<br><br>Windows 10 does loom like a hybrid, but hey.. at least the sample pictures are good this time lololol

So, I recently got windows 10 (5 days ago) so I'm gonna put my thoughts here<br><br>So far my experience is great. I've had lots of performance improvements.<br>Minecraft doesn't really have a difference, but other games I play do have an increase in frames<br>I can actually run multiple programs without my computer lagging now.<br><br>As for the other things:<br>Task view/multiple desktops: Seems neat but I don't really have much of a use for it tbh<br>Cortana: Haven't set it up yet, again don't really need it tbh<br>Edge: To me it's too "simple". I just don't like the theme of it. I'm sticking to chrome<br><br>Also kinda random but the windows 10 minecraft is actually pretty cool, it's free if you have a minecraft account (just go to the mojang account page). It's different but still cool imo<br><br>+1 from me

Did you try re-able the mic from the settings (assuming you know where it is)?<br>If not try changing the level frequency as there should be a microphone area and adjust it to you and others likings.<br>Windows 10 likes changing the output levels from a microphone
