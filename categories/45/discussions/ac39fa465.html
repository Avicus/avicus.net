OK, so im currently sitting in the hospital right now beside the man I admire the most.....<br><br>So.. I was just having a good ole time on skype and I get a random call from my grandmother.. as soon as I pick up the call she's in tears and I already know something bad happened after she talked to me and said it would be all right she told me the bad news..<br>Today Oct26,2015 at 7:00pm my Grandfather was shot and killed... im making this post because I just need someone who I trust and I can talk too... Im currently drowning in tears x3 but also dying a bit inside because he was the one person who understood me and knew the kinds of things I went/am (going) through and seeing him gone forever is not even the worst part it is that someone would kill someone so nice and kind like my GrandFather...<br><br>Ill do you pround Grampie &lt;3 and ill never forget you :(

My grammy died in December. I still can not believe it. She had Pulmonary Fibrosis (A retarded lung disease) and when I was like 3-6, I spent every work day of the week from 7:30 - 3:30 with here. When school started I went to her house after for like a hour. (Kindergarten like 3 or 4) &nbsp;And then her sickness got so bad my pop pop had to come to my house instead of her watching me. The day before she died my two siblings and I visited her. She looked the happiest she had In a few weeks... we were the jewls of her life. The next day, she must have decided she had been happy to see us and didn't want us to spend the Christmas in the hospital AND she didn't want us seeing her in that position. She probably decided it was time to shut down, and died Sunday December 21st 2014. May she always be with me, and your Grampa be with you. I am in tears righting this rn<br><br>Why did a fucking scumbag of a person killed your Grampa? I wish I got go up to them and give em the finger and say "Fuck you, your an asshole, killing someone" and sic em in the face<br><br>Best of Wishes,<br><br>iiDarudePvP<br><br>Pulminary Fibrosis Foundation website &nbsp;<a href="http://www.pulmonaryfibrosis.org/" title="Link: http://www.pulmonaryfibrosis.org/">http://www.pulmonaryfibrosis.org/</a>&nbsp;(incase anyones intersted)

Sorry to hear about that I hope you get better. The reason why we are so close to our grandparents is because they are the parent of our parent basically so they know our parent inside out so therefore they'll know us inside out. It's a hard shock but you will adjust to it. My deepest condolences to your family hope it gets better
