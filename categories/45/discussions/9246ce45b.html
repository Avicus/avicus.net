So acceqted recently a member told me something about an avicus community slack and if I have it. When I asked what it was he said "stop the act I'm done with you". So does anyone know what it is or am I just being dumb?

Ok woah. I think other people are getting a misunderstanding. Community slack is a platform such players can give feedback, talk about school, music ect. &nbsp;I suggest getting it as it is very helpful. You can ask an admin to add you if you like!

Staff have been locking quite a few threads once the owner requests a lock. They've been doing it for a while.

Staff lock threads if the question has been answered. The presense of a request for the lock should only be a coincidence. If done on request, it would be staff misconduct.

For a long time. Para even confirmed it in community slack while he was still admin and has told the staff team multiple times as well to not do it.
