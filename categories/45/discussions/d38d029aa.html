I don't see a point in religion as most religions are just a rehash of each other (Paganism, Judaism, Christianity, Islam, etc.).

i only liked it because Star Wars fans knew there wasn't going to ever be another movie but then disney or whatever bought it out from lucasfilms, so it's just the fact that there are movies for Star Wars again that makes it good.

The inordinate majority of music produced nowadays (particularly the mainstream tracks that gain the most popularity) is overly simplistic and monotonous, devoid of harmonic and melodic cohesion and flair, and takes little to no creativity, originality, or talent to compose yet is disproportionately admired and praised. A shame that so many people can be impressed by garbage.<br><br>John Green is a prosaic author whose writing is second-rate and lacks complexity, elegance, and a natural flow or cadence, appealing mostly to naive teenage girls who don't know any better.
