Team channels tend to be a bit of a gray area.&nbsp;<br><br>Team leaders (designated with their respective ranks) call the shots in the channels. In most cases, staff will not enforce rules in Team channels, with certain exceptions l, such as staff misconduct.&nbsp;<br><br>If they team leaders don't want someone saying/doing something in a channel, they can kick them out and change the password.&nbsp;<br><br>I bope this answers your question.

Ok<br><br>So let's say a death threat or ddos threat is issued in the team channel, and the team leader isn't there. Could a staff member be involved in that sort of situation or no? Since it's a bit of a bigger problem<br><br>I know you said they don't usually get involved with situations in team channels, but could this be an exception,

It depends if a team leader allows it. If not then they can be punished.
