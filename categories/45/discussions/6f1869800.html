So yea, the idea popped into my head to program a tower defense game somehow based of Nebula. You will have to defend your monuments, but you would also have the option to attack the other team. Well, what do you all think? Any suggestions/ comments/ questions/ concerns? People can help me out by doing art / graphics, if i need them.<br>Crappy 5 minute title screen:&nbsp;<br><img alt="" src="http://i62.tinypic.com/rm5g7m.png"><br>As you can see i cant design a good title screen :(. But that's what you are for! I can do the programming! So yea post what you think :)

I've actually had this idea a while back, but never had time to code it. It's nice to see that someone else has started this, and I'd love to see this project evolve into something great :D

Looks cool. If you used Java for this, you have to tell me how you learned.

Programmed for two hours. Mostly worked on things that the average user wont see (like the tile engine), but also made a "level selection" screen:&nbsp;<br><img alt="" src="http://i60.tinypic.com/23rtksj.png"><br>As you can see all my levels are called "Testing map".<br>I also made main menu a bit better.&nbsp;<br>Edit: What should the back ground be like? Post suggestions!
