My $800 iPhone 6+ Became a $800 dollar paper weight. I was victim of the cruel #BendGate<br>I saw no apparent bend, but apple employees told&nbsp;me that there was an LCD hardware error, which basically means my phone doesn't respond to touch, and white lines cover the phone screen. Upon that, the phone randomly selects things whenever I turn it on. I am going to talk to my insurance provider to see if I can get a replacement, even though my one year warranty is up. Wish me luck :(

Welcome to Apple!<br><br>Once I went to the apple store because my old ads iPhone 4's lick button was stuck. The guy told us to wait and me and my dad waited for around 45 minutes. Guy comes back without saying a word, holding an iPad with the screen showing us all the available iPhone 4s. LOL, they can't even fix a broken lock button.<br><br>Sorry for spelling mistakes I'm on my phone rn and too lazy to fix xd

Similar situation happened to me too.<br><br>My phone screen was coming off and there was rainbow lines on it and I couldn't type on it or anything, so I took it in. We waited about 3 hours and they said that they couldn't fix it due to reliability since everything fell out of my phone when they took the whole screen off, so they decided to give me a whole new phone.

Good news, after standing in line for several hours and after getting pissed off after several incompetent&nbsp;employees, I will get a new phone for a small fee, and a freaking two week shipping, which I have to play for. &nbsp;I love apple products. Not apple employees.

Pc isn't better, Mac isn't better. They are the same but it depends on your own idea which one to buy. I personally think that Mac is easier to use, comfortable. That's the true one for me. I've never said that pc is bad as I used pc too, but Mac fits better with me.

Actually windows is a lot more customisable and gives clearer directions, &nbsp;and it gives you more power over the OS... And Macs are overpriced just because the brand name, for 2k I can go build a pc that would run gta 5 with highest possible setting at 200 fps on a giant ass 1080p monitor

Agree, for gaming I prefer Windows too. But I usually edit vid/photo. Also HTML. Doing these on Mac is easier. If I used my computer for gaming, I'd buy Windows too. Cheaper and better quality. But I only play Minecraft so yeah :)
