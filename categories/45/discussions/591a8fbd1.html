i suspect maybe some donators are hackers but i don't think all of them are the reason why i say that because no one expects them to be hackers cause they have special perks but you never know some could be hackers for all we know &gt;&lt;

Donators are treated the same as normal players are.<br><br>If a donator hacks they will get banned just as easily as a non-donator.

I don't think too many people pay just to be banned for hacking. I've seen plenty of donators acting like complete dickheads, swearing, spamming and just being rude to everyone, but I don't think I've ever seen one who hacks.

So what, that's one guy out of the maybe thousand donators (random guess)&nbsp;<br>I'm not saying he's the only one, but lets just say that there's a 0.1% chance of a donator hacking, so small that I wouldn't even bother claiming that someone was, and even if they are, you don't call out in chat and tell them that you are on to them, you join observers and record them before they realise that they've just thrown away the money that they spent on their donation rank.

I must admit it does seem a donator would hack after they payed for a rank (unless they hacked their rank), but it isn't impossible
