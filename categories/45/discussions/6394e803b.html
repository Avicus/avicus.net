Saw the dress on another site. it was blue and black when I saw it for the first time, I then scrolled down. Scrolled up and then it was white and gold. I looked at the picture for like 5 minutes to see&nbsp; if it was a gif. It was not. -.-<br><br>EDIT: When I saw this thread for the first time it was blue and black, after I posted my post I went back to the first page and it changed to gold and white. .-.<br><br>now it is blue and black again

I believe it's because of the white balance and what you best see in. Night owls, and people who don't use lights as often - ie, people who play games or such at late night, with only their computer as light are much more likely to see it as its "correct color". I am more of a day person, though not a morning person, and I play with at least one light on. I'm more inclined to see it as white and gold, though I've seen it as both.

Guys, the BBC already said it's Blue and Black, I knew it.<br>WHERE THE FUCK DO YOU SEE WHITE AND GOLD?<br>That's gonna happen only if you're high.<br><br><br>Also, this color changing is related with the light going throught the dress and from the angle you see it. ^.^

So if you stare at it long enough, it most likely will turn blue. I can see both &gt;:)

first saw it as white and gold, then blue and black, then i saw it as what the actual dress is i believe: a dark brown and lavender, somewhere in between white/gold and blue/black.&nbsp;<br>if you go into photoshop and select the colors of the dress, you get the brown/lavender. its freaky. especially if you see it as white/gold

For me I see blue and black. The person I believe who first posted it says that it is actually white and gold in real life, but looks black and blue for some other people due to bad lighting. The view of the colours may also change depending on your mood. Using paint, one can easily find that it is blue and black in the photo, but once again it is due to bad lighting.

When I looked at it at first it was white &amp; gold, however after I turned my brightness up all the way on my phone, it was black and blue.?¿ But now when I look at it, I see it both ways. It just takes a few seconds of staring at the picture for it to turn either black &amp; blue/white &amp; gold.

Theres actually any explanation to why some people see blue and black and others white and gold, and it has to do with the lighting.<br><br>It's called Photoshop

My friend showed this to me yesterday, and at first glance it looked white and gold to me. I kept looking at it and it just turns out that the lighting was very, very high, which is why it&nbsp;<b>appears</b> to be white and gold.<br><br>The dress really is blue and black though. :P
