Hm, this is a very hard question, but here I go xD. There first time I ever went on Avicus was about 2 years ago or so. It was still MCZone and I wanted to play Nebula. I won't ever really know who the first person I met was, but I remember meeting Vice around a year or go? (Something like that). He was one of my first close friends on the server.
