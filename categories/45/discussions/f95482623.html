Okay, since I got on last night to play Nebula because (long story short) my life is moving slow, I noticed there was negative people screaming at their teammates being negative vs the other team just focusing on the game I find if you give your team positive support "hey good shot!" what ever positive message you send the team just has better attitude and doesn't start screaming "!@*#*!". So if you can, give anyone or the whole team positive vibes, if something frustrates you, don't take it out on others just say dang or gg to the other person cause really GG, but never give negative attention because the negative cloud wont go away and it will pass onto others, and if someone's getting uncomfortable because of positive vibes then okay just move on, that's not something to shut down about. Thanks for reading!

Most of the people here already much know about the situation we have: can't see it getting too much better in the near future.

I know, the main point was just support your team, don't get frustrated and be positive.

Ya supporting your teammates is a good way to be positive, but there are always a few dumbfucks who just can't be saved and you have to learn to let them go and suffocate in vats of salt
