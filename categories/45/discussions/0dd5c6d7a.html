So, in light of Alexanderjoe10's post of him and some others filling in the middle on Rendezvous, <i>some of us</i> decided to try it on Rendezvous 3. Chaos insued from that point onwards, until one certain troll decided to break the monument. :/<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/EA5vxfm.png" alt=""><br><br>I"d like to thank Chipmunks95 for starting the charge for fill it in with me, as well as izjust4fun and Crazy_Clownz for starting it on the opposite side. In addition, thanks to every other random user that pitched in! <br><br>May this map be filled in one day...

I don't think the guy who broke the monument was a troll, I am pretty sure he was playing the game normally.

I remember seeing him swearing quite often, and messing up his own team's monument defenses.
