Well here is a list of things I think Avicus could do or use . I thought of these ideas, after playing Avicus for about year and a half :<br><br>The amount of "XP" you get for breaking a monument could be at the minimum of 10 "XP" because gettting a monument isn't that easy for some players and It should feel more rewarding after breaking a monument.(Nebula)<br><br>There should be a new staff rank called "HELPER" which would be useful for the people doing extra for the server and the powers they get would be /kick and /warn command. And people that maybe want to be "Moderators", can apply for this .<br><br>Thanks.

But I think there would be many more helpers that only get the /warn and /kick commands to help out the mods a bit

I don't see the point. If there was a hacker on and no mods al<br>&nbsp;helpers can do is kick them. Also there would need to be another set of applications for helper and interviews and that requires more time and effort on administratiors.

Basically the same.<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://avicus.net/forums/7873c4b91">http://avicus.net/forums/7873c4b91</a><br>Also, the "Helper" rank you've described is quite similar to what a Jr.Moderator does already.
