since i can predict this becoming a pretty big deal, and with the fact that you can change it once a month, i suggest there be a subforum to post about your name change. probably one that wouldn't show up in recent discussions. if you see someone and think "hey, that person could be _____!" you could check the subforum for that user's post..

I'm not sure. I'm considering spelling "cinnamon" right in my name, though currently it gives me a sort of nostalgic feeling that brings back memories of earlier games that I've played.<br>I've also considered things like "CinnamonCroc" or just "Croc" or "Cin," but I still like my username as it is. It has a nice roll on the tongue (or maybe it's just me x3) and it's sort of a random thing. Like, what's a "cinnamon croc?"<br><br>Idk, I think I'm arguing over this myself too much xD

I don't think you can have 2 character names. Yes I know they are out there but those are really old accounts. Now I believe you can't do that anymore.<br><br>@OP Most people know me for this name so I won't be changing it though I am considering changing my alts
