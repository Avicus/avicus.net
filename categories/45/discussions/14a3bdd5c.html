So what is your opinion on betrayal? For example what if your best friend all of the sudden calls you an attention seeker, and sides with someone else who you despise. Personally I'd be in tears...But how would you feel if you weren't in that specific position but in lieu you were a friend of the person who had just been on the receiving end of said insults. How would you help them? Well you see, right now I am in that position. I haven't had friends for a long time, and I'm very poor socially so I do not know what to do. Though I do not think that is an excuse to make if a friend is in need of support, but it is what it is. I have a tiny mind so I cannot easily comprehend such events...So again, what is your opinion on this matter?

This is the reason why I don't just hang out with one person, but I have a few friends who don't even know each other. If someone does that to me, simple. They're no longer my friend.

They betray you, or abuse you, you don't have to take it on the chin, when this occasionally happens to me i confront the person and be hostile about it, because at least they know you aren't a weak person who is vulnerable to their bullshit..<br>Anyways they betray you like that, they don't deserve your friendship or time :/

I'll go to my true friends, buy an iced tea and some food, sit down, and forget about the past.

Personally, this has happened a lot to me. People have taken advantage of my kindness towards others and used it against me, saying I was only friendly to them because I was seeking attention.<br><br>Mostly, you need to listen to yourself and realize that those people really aren't your friends anymore, and that you are who you want to be. It's not too hard to make new friends that will stick by you no matter what

Just stick with your real friends. &nbsp;However, you need to know why your friend betrayed you. &nbsp;If he/she is going through a rough time, help him/her out. &nbsp;We all have our bad days. &nbsp;But, if he/she was being a total jerk and doing it regularly, don't hang out with that person. &nbsp;You will know who your real friends are. &nbsp;Friends come and go, but family stay together. &nbsp;Family are your true friends. &nbsp;Biological and the Avicus Family ^.^

Personally, the thing that harms me is not the attack from my enemies, but the silence of my friends.

There are two sides in my school. The drama-filled side, and the drama-free side.<br><br>Thankfully I'm in the drama-free side, so I haven't really experienced any of this nor do I want to. But it does sound terrible.

I'm always willing to give a second chance, and if you blow it...gone. I'll be cool with you as long as you're cool with me. People do stupid stuff and make bad decisions, one does not determine anything, but if you didn't learn from it, that's the issue. No i'm not going to be your friend because your Dad owns a Lambo, idgaf. Show me you're worth being a friend, to keep around. The people you keep as friends always are reflections of a part of you. Do you really want to have the people, your friends who reflect who you are, be the people who stabbed your back and turned on you?

I wrote a whole god dang paragraph and my phone froze... Fml. Anyway on topic...<br><br>I've had situations like this in the past with a lot of my current best friends. Sometimes it's just temporary and sometimes it's a permeant thing that can really hurt a lot. But you always have to stay strong, just remember that. Always try to stay strong, everyone has their bad, good and absolutely amazing days that they'll remember forever. Everyone should be equal in this world and not judge each other, but with conflict there's always some type of solution. Sometimes the solution is hard to find and sometimes it's easy, there will always be people who have different views on things no one is exactly the same ever. Talking to the person who I had a fight with or had a misunderstanding with always seems to help me, but when you talk to the person just make sure not to overreact or say anything offensive no matter how heated the conversation gets. If talking doesn't work/saying sorry, then I honestly don't think that person is such a good friend. All of us usually accidently say something we don't always mean which can lead to the other person responding to it in a wrong way. I'm not sure why you aren't fond of this person because I don't know the whole story. But always try to get to know them better, there may be a nicer side to them. I'm going through that right now, my friend is hanging with someone else who I'm not very fond of either. But I'm always trying to be nice to them and I try to be nice no matter what they do wrong or whenever they do something I don't agree with, everyone makes mistakes. If you really wanna be that person's friend go for it, but always be careful too. If the person really cares about you they won't expect you to change for them in order for you to fit in and meet their expectations, they'll like you for who you are. I've been called an attention seeker quite a few times as well, and sometimes I do admit that it's true because I do sometimes try to draw attention to get more people to like me which I know is wrong. Everyone tries so hard to fit in but they change something about them most of the time to do it. Never change for anybody, sometimes it takes the right people to see the shining star in you. Everything will be alright, no matter what. Sometimes we just need some bad change for some good change to drop in. Whatever the case I wish you luck :) You're amazing Warbry, remember that okay?
