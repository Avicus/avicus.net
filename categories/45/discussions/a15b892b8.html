Sorry guys I know you all hate leaving posts...<br><br>(Also I didn't really know what category to put this in..)<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So, down to business. &nbsp; So, lately I have playing a ton of minecraft being on the computer instead of enjoying the outdoors and playing with friends, I've started noticing how much I have been playing, and also, minecraft is getting more boring now. &nbsp;I have just been playing that much. &nbsp;Also, I mean, I'm 14. &nbsp;I need to start doing more than the computer. &nbsp;So before you start worrying that I will never come back, thats not true, I will be online, just a LOT less. &nbsp;I've had such a good time so far in the community, and will probably never EVER leave completely, but anyways. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Goodbye for a little while (Maybe a long while :P)<br><br>kthxbai.
