Hi. Only the people who have been with Avicus from the start will remember me, so you're probably wondering who I am. I was a senior mod on this server since it was MC Zone and left close to the start to focus on college and getting a job and just because I was really down about my life and how I'd done nothing to be truly proud of and how I wanted to turn things around. Well... I did. To a certain extent. I got high grades in college, was unemployed for 6 months which was horrible but eventually turned things round, got a job, made good money, got an amazing car (a Mazda 3 hatchback) and things started to look well for me over the new year.<br><br>But I'm not here to talk about my success, because I completely ruined everything last night.&nbsp;<br><br>I was driving home at like 1am (I work til late) and the roads seemed fine, wet, but fine. Then just the next thing I knew I was sliding off the road at about 50mph and all I had time for was to think about how this could be the end of my life. I crashed into a concrete wall stopping cars from going into an embankment, knocked the wall clean out, flipped over and the next thing I knew the car was on its side (my side) in the middle of the road (but I thought I was in a ditch at the time and that no one would find me). I rang the police (god knows how I got the signal cause I was in the middle of nowhere) and climbed up and out the car through the passenger side and it was only then I realised there was barely a scratch on me. The car, however, was completely gone. The engine had been completely ripped out and debris was scattered all over the road. The police came, breathalysed me (zero, I'm not bloody stupid) and took my details and I was checked over by an ambulance and warmed up then my dad came to pick me up. The car's been written off and taken to a scrapyard. I only had that car 3 months, it was second hand but had only done 40,000 miles (I had only done 3000) and it was my pride and joy. I have no idea how much its going to cost in insurance but whether I get a new cheap car or not the Mazda is on a 5-year finance deal so for the next 5 years I'm going to be paying off a car which isn't mine anymore.<br><br>But I'm not here for sympathy either, cause it was me that fucked up, and no one else. I'm here to just get one message across. I was well known back when I was a part of Avicus for making long boring motivational speeches about "don't waste your life" but last night has made me realise something even more important.<br><br>Don't take ANYTHING FOR GRANTED ever again.&nbsp;<br><br>The fact that I didn't go into the embankment is a miracle. The fact that I could get out my car without a scratch is an even bigger one. Someone up there must like me, cause if anything had happened to me that would have been it. I would have left this life with no story, nothing to be proud of, only a handful of people would know or indeed care, and everything that I've worked towards in life would have been for nothing. But I was given a second chance, I could go home and hug my family which I never do, stroke my cats again, and finally tell my best friend who I've been mad at for some stupid reason and ignored for weeks how much she actually meant to me.&nbsp;<br><br>But not everyone gets that chance, and I found out that it doesn't matter how okay everything seems, or how good you are at anything. Something can go wrong at any given time, when you least expect it. So, just for me, if you have anything you want to say to anyone, if you're sorry for something but still too mad at that person to say it, or if you miss them, love them, want them to know anything, just fucking say it. Cause if you miss that chance, that's it. They'll never know, and what could be will never happen. So stop reading this, and go and do it. Please.<br><br>I just wish it didn't take this for me to realise that.<br><br><img src="http://imgur.com/OMFxp3Q.png" title="Image: http://imgur.com/OMFxp3Q.png">

Thanks for the support :/ I'll come out of this a better person, I'm just more gutted about the car than anything else. I'm still trying to piece together what happened, cause the roads were absolutely fine before and my car was amazing at handling roads like those, i've never slid in it before and it could detect if roads were icy and warn me, which it didn't then. So i don't know why it happened, and I can't remember the few seconds before the crash but I was going nowhere near the speed limit. I don't know if it was my fault or not, hopefully I'll find out what happened. Thanks for the posts from people I've never met before. You guys are the exact reason I wanted to post this.

In fact, I tell friends that I'm busy af and that's why I didn't apply, but truth be told, it's actually for the reason above.

Adding on to this, always have the strength to keep going, always try to find the silver lining in things, don't let grudges drag you down and live the best you can while you still can. Sometimes learning the hard way is the best way, though I'm kind of hesitant to say so, given the circumstance. If you need a friend, someone to talk to, I got your back. I was in a car crash over a month ago, so I can kind of relate. The car in front of us stopped, we managed to break in time, but the car behind us smashed into us at around 80km/h and pushed 5-6ft into the car in front of us. Our car had $15k worth of damage to it, barely off being totaled. After being hit from behind, another car hit us, meaning both my Dad and I's heads had snapped 3 times, giving both of us whiplash. I had put my hands out in front of me to stop me slamming into the dashboard, the 4 fingers on my left hand all got pretty badly hyper-extended and took a month of therapy to repair the tissue and tendon damage to my hand, but I realized how fortunate I was to even be living. My PC was also in the back, unscathed. Both my dad and I were ok and only one person went to the hospital with minor injuries (at least from my knowledge). Though this isn't about me, or a pity party for me, the point is we were all so fortunate that nothing worse happened. A lot of us are very fortunate. Be thankful for every day you're given, you are so lucky to be on this planet alone.

At least that's the only thing that's gotten messed up out of this situation, and you're still on a pretty okay footing.&nbsp;<br>From wot you told me about your driving before, I'm fairly certain you were being really careful, and I hope it didn't turn out to be your fault if you do end up finding out.&nbsp;<br>My uncle, he got his car totalled too in a ditch, but he ended up dying and leaving behind his wife and kids. I'm glad you're alive and you didn't ever have to leave someone without saying goodbye or how much they mean to you and all that. Even more so that you weren't injured too terribly, as you can still keep working and you don't have to go through therapy and stuff, like my cousin's husband who messed up his leg pretty bad from colliding with a bus.&nbsp;<br>All This just means imo, no matter how bad it is, the universe wants you to keep at it, make your life wonderful and succeed. Otherwise why would it have given you this second chance? C:

Hey Fight, I'm not sure if you remember me, maybe not since it has been a while and I used to be only a little active in the community.&nbsp;<br><br>It's so shocking that one moment you can have everything going for you and the next minute it's taken away. I'm thankful that you made it out unscathed and that you want to help the community you used to be such a big part of.&nbsp;<br><br>I've always looked up to you and respected you as a thoughtful person and one who understands life for what it is. If you ever need anyone to talk to, I would recommend the people in this thread that have offered their help. As much as I would like to give any help I can, I'm just not the best person for this. Thank you and I wish you luck in life.

Sorry about your car man, hopefully you can get a new one. Or used one. Whatever works out in your price range I guess. I've only been here for about 14 months even though it says 2 years on my profile (10 month ban). But it's great you're okay. - Never heard of you. But that's really not the point.

Thanks for the support :/ I'll come out of this a better person, I'm just more gutted about the car than anything else. I'm still trying to piece together what happened, cause the roads were absolutely fine before and my car was amazing at handling roads like those, i've never slid in it before and it could detect if roads were icy and warn me, which it didn't then. So i don't know why it happened, and I can't remember the few seconds before the crash but I was going nowhere near the speed limit. I don't know if it was my fault or not, hopefully I'll find out what happened. Thanks for the posts from people I've never met before. You guys are the exact reason I wanted to post this.

And thank heavens you're alive. We haven't talked in ages, but that doesn't matter. I don't know what I'd do with myself if you had been taken in the course of that accident. Good luck with the car man, this kinda shit sucks to deal with. I'm just glad you're still around. You'll always be a legend in my eyes. Hopefully we can chat again soon!
