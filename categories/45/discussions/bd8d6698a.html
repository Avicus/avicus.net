Fanfics. Staff hate them so much that they forced us to compress them. Nonetheless, this is the fanfic of the new Avicus. Episode 1 has not been written yet. After the thread, I will start on that.<br><br>Preview: What happens when someone gets banned? We know. The guardians of the land, dubbed the moderators, hit them with the hammer. The banhammer. The banned have 2 options. Then can either give up and fall into the banspace, like most do, or they can fight into a cyber-purgatory. From there they are given a trial. If they are decided to be brought back, then they can re-unite with their bodies and roam the land once more. Under secret eyes.<br><br>But if they fail? They fall into the banspace, a world of unknown terrors. We have nightmares about it. Falling, in agony, eternal regret, it is the most scary place for us.<br><br>And what about bringing them back? Only the higher up can do that. But only if that wasn't true? What would happen?<br><br>EPISODES:<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://pastebin.com/r5nXBU4K">http://pastebin.com/r5nXBU4K</a>&nbsp;(Ep.1 Trials of Hell)<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://pastebin.com/ind8wJc2">http://pastebin.com/ind8wJc2</a>&nbsp;(Ep.2 Glitch in the System)<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://pastebin.com/yUSS4ctX">http://pastebin.com/yUSS4ctX</a>&nbsp;(Ep.3 The New Recruit)
