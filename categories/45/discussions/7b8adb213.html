Recently I have noticed a lot of toxicity among chat on Avicus. Whether it's servers or scrims it's kinda everywhere. Most of the time it's friendly banter, but there's the odd exception of a salty person, toxic about things nobody cares. Let's be real - it's a block game. No need to be toxic and put players down. So what you are a better pvper than others, I'm sure everybody would like to hear it in the form of an, EZ or an L. Nobody cares about what you have to say to others in order to make yourself feel good. So let's all chill and enter a happy place. And if you do choose to remain toxic, take it out to another place, cause nobody cares.&nbsp;<br><br>- Ya Boi GALEOPHOBIA

You are right, nobody needs to be toxic, but a lot of people are.

Imagine if it was that easy to change something about so many people. Toxicity is just something we all have, if you know how to control it or not. Some people get toxic over falling into the void, some people get toxic over losing a game. There is many different ways of getting toxic, and its so hard just to put an end to it. Toxicity will always be a thing in society, it is harder than you think to change. I'm not saying its right, i'm saying it happens.

Toxic badly poisons the target, and has an accuracy of 85%. When the target takes damage from the poison, the damage done will be N * x, where N starts at 1 and x is 1/16 of the target's maximum HP (rounded down, but not less than 1). While a Pokémon is badly poisoned, N increases by 1 each time it takes either Toxic or Leech Seed damage (meaning it may increase twice per turn if a Pokémon is affected by both). When an afflicted Pokémon is affected by Haze, switches out, or when the battle ends, the Pokémon's poison status becomes regular poison.<br><br>Taken from Bulbapedia

Its probably easier for people to become less salty than it is for people to become less offended by stuff.<br><br>@poofy i agree with you, nice post!

We try our best to deal with toxicity although there are times when there is not sufficient staff on to deal with it, although if this is the case we try to act.<br><br>We all do our best to prevent it, so I guess it's all we can do.

Toxicity will always be there if you like it or not. The best thing to do is just ignore the person being toxic and they will stop eventually. If they continue, that's what Moderators are there for.
