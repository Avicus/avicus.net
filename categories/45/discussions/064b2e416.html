Is this the end to donator ranks and maybe servers in general? It clearly states that you can't have a player base with paying and non players.&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://mojang.com/2014/06/lets-talk-server-monetisation/">https://mojang.com/2014/06/lets-talk-server-monetisation/</a>

2 things.<br>1. It says if you want to <b><u>GIVE ACCESS</u></b><u></u> to the server you may not allow any other people in for free...<br>2. Buying ranks are donations, but servers like giving something in return to their donators

Mojang wont allow pay to win servers. Donor ranks are fine. PEts, and gizmos are also fine but whats not ok is getting a donor rank so you have an advantage in gameplay.

I honestly hope this happens. I hate people who donate hundreds of dollars to servers and are invincible. I could care less if my rank was removed right now.

It appears you cannot sell anything that effects gameplay. This is a big change and will effect many servers, but I think it will be worked out.

But basically you can't have different classes them in like nexus, or commands in walls as they give you and advantage in game play

It most likely will be discarded as Mojang is getting a lot of resistance from it.

It's their game. They can do whatever they want. It's part of their legal documents, they are just starting to enforce it.<br><br>The only real way it would affect Avicus is the in-game shop items on Nebula, such as gernades and time bombs. Otherwise than that, we're mostly in the clear

nu man<br><br>Even if it's their game, they have to weigh the consequences... If they change+Enforce the EULA to what they threatened.... they would lose a lot of revenue. <br><br>And the only way it will affect Avicus isn't even that...<br><br>Avicus will shut down. (If they do as they threaten)<br><br>Mojang has stated donors cannot have any perks or such, so they blend in with the crowd, otherwise it would be considered selling, and not allowed.<br><br>Even if mojang becomes more lenient, kits will also be affected.<br><br>Most likely, they will either: make their demands more lenient, and/or scrap enforcing the EULA so strictly.
