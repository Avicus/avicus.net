<b>This is more of a funny but truthful tale of me. I'm not tellin' y'all my real name but here is an example of my literature. Its a reference to the fallout series endings. It's meant to be a joke but also a warning for those transitioning to highschool in the United States. Be ready for this...</b><br><br><b>Tale start!<br></b><br>And so ends the tale of the <b>Weary Cartographer</b> (Map Maker) named Zintenka; and through his time in summer vacation...<br><br>Through a period of PVPing, making maps, and having his topics turned to flame wars. He didn't let the vices around him influence him too much...<br><br>When Zintenka experienced his first flamed topic, he unfortunately grew cold and angered... This lead to the first time of him experiencing a temp ban...<br><br>BUT, there is always time to think back on what you did and learn from your mistakes...<br><br>When he walked to that dreadful laundromat and washed his clothing and covers, he sacrificed the last day of his vacation for being prepared for school...<br><br>School... many call it a place to learn. Many call it a place to mingle and gallivant around...<br><br>Zintenka calls it... a hell hole... a place where, yes you learn. But hindered by your peers and the judging eyes and mouths of your mentors...<br><br>However, however, however! He didn't let them get to him, he grew stronger through working out with weights and trying to avoid confrontations where they may happen...<br><br>A girl getting slashed across the face with a knife that was smuggled through the "efficient" metal detector...<br><br>A girls weave pulled straight from her scalp...<br><br>Zintenka brawling with another male and fending off aggressors for his Nigerian real name and his ethnicity...&nbsp;<br><br>War... War Never Changes...
