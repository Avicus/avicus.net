I'm 5th so I wouldn't really know, but as I was once a non donator,I can understand how much this must stink.&nbsp;<br><br>If this happend to a lot of people I'm sure a higher up staff member could do something to help :P

Although I don't doubt you, it looks to me as if not everyone lost the same amount of XP. &nbsp;This would make it extremely difficult to put everyone where they were, and even then it would seem like forum favoritism. &nbsp;Not everyone who lost a level or two goes on the forums, I'm sure.
