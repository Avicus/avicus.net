<div>Hi</div><div><br></div><div>It was September 8th and Eric and I were moved into a room with Sli (completely out of the blue) and we were just told that we were the new builders. It might've not seemed to special to other people but I was happy for myself, this was probably my best achievement on this server and without Eric I wouldn't have been able to do it and I really am thankful for him helping me to get to Builder. It was mid-December and again, out of the blue I got a promotion to mapdev which had been my dream ever since I started making maps on this server. It's the beginning of January my behaviour is changing and I'm starting to think about retiring from mapdev as other people are saying: "the server is trash" etc and myself at that time was drawn into that and I ended up retiring to fit in.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>To anyone wondering why I'm making this post, I feel as if I've been a d*ck by sh*tposting and being rude to people here in general. I would like to start a fresh and erase those weeks where I was an idiot.</div><div>I will try to be making maps for this server.</div><div><br></div><div>Sincerely&nbsp;</div><div>Ryan</div>

Chill out, everyone. This is an apology thread, so stay back on topic and be respectful. Take your argument of intelligence somewhere else appropriate, Myworld and DaGoldBrick.
