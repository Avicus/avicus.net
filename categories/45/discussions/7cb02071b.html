Astronomy/Interstellar  Concepts

</h1>
Though the subject science as a whole is not my strongest subject or my fort√©, I am extremely interested in Astronomy. I am especially interested in the topics/concepts displayed in the movie, "Interstellar" directed by Christopher Nolan. However, as most people are hardly interested in my discussions about fifth dimensions/beyond a black hole/dark matter, I was hoping to find some willing participants on the forums.<br><br>If anyone is interested, then start off the discussion with this topic, and that would be: What do you think of the ability to be able to travel beyond black holes, despite the scientific belief of their effects (one example would be light's inability to escape a black hole), as also displayed in Interstellar?

It was displayed in Interstellar, but if you try to think logically/rationally, I'm actually not quite sure.&nbsp;<br><br>Right now, scientists don't know what is beyond a black hole, as they're too powerful for scientific observation, considering they have immense gravitational pull.

Didn't watch the movie.<br><br><br>However I feel like I can contribute.&nbsp;<br><br>Black holes are these spots in space where the "inside" has this massive density. It's pretty much a star collapsed on itself. That much mass being pushed together to a pinpoint size will result in absolutely massive density. You can't really travel through one. In fact you can't actually get near one before you're sucked in, like a huge vacuum cleaner.&nbsp;<br><br>However most of the stuff about black holes is generally theoretical so there's really no right or wrong.

That's true, it's hard to grasp the concept of the members in Interstellar being able to travel through one, but it's an interesting concept, at that.

Being a future scientist myself, I do believe black holes could be a gateway of travel. The only problem being human survival. Chances are that going through a black hole would require not only enough oxygen (which isn't supported in space to begin with), but also a human that would be able to take the possible insanity from such a travel. &nbsp;People can only go so long alone before going insane. So yes, I do believe black hole travel is possible, just very unlikely.

Do you now that, scientist thinks that there could be white holes. This mean that they are like black holes but they are connected. So you can pass throught them and go to another part of the univers, or go to another univers

Do you now what a black hole means? When you enter on a blac hole your mollecules get destroyed. And do you now how much gravity is on a black hole, depends too of the distance and of the weight of this black hole.

There is the possibility that white holes exist, however there has been no evidence to prove this (if I'm correct).&nbsp;<br><br>Furthermore, since white holes are considered the sheer opposite of black holes, white holes cannot be entered (unlike black holes, where their gravitational pull brings in everything), despite the fact that white holes allow light and matter to leave from them, therefore neutralizing your theory of "white holes being the portal to another world."<br><br>What you said about them being connected is somewhat true, as black holes and white holes deviate from a similar concept (just reversed in this case).

Supposedly white holes are just the complete opposite of black holes. Meaning that if Black hole sucks you into them, white holes must push gravity away? Very hard concept to understand considering Size is gravity, and that gravity pulls you.

Very cool concept, I also believe that in my lifetime we will have explored huge masses of space. Humanity has already discovered more about astronomy in the last decade than the last century.<br>On the note of black holes, scientists have proven that worm holes in space take you to another part of the universe, as seen in "Interstellar" (fantastic film BTW).<br>I really enjoy studying this concept and, in the future, I wish to be a scientific astronomer (someone who studies space and possibilities in space).

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There are so many unknowns about Black Holes, so until we have better instruments and spacecraft to travel to near to, or even go inside one, we can't prove any theory. But personally, White Holes sound the most likely to me, but we might never know.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I really do love science, so interesting. Also, my grandfather was an astronomer and helped design the Hubble Space Telescope, so that helps my knowledge with science.

Well, from my research i've found out Black Holes contain a strong gravity, one that light itself can't even escape. Therefore, I find it confusing that something that pulls light into it is dark.

Well, considering the only thing that can escape from a black hole is a super-heated quasar, and considering that that the depiction of Interstellar seems to be fantastical (though we really don't know until we witness it), my view on the opinion is very neutral.

Isn't it because of a star's implosion on itself that it creates the gravitational pull of a black hole? And if such a powerful force can absorb even light, it wouldn't be rational that light would cause a black hole to be bright, as a black hole overpowers light itself. &nbsp;<br><br><br>Maybe

Yes, that is why the gravitational pull is so strong, but it doesn't absorb light, it pulls light into it.

I have heard black holes can quite easily crush people, pulling them apart atom by atom.<br><br>Humans would first have to build some kind of vehicle can that withstand the crushing force the black hole can deliver.<br><br>However, it's common belief that wormholes can be used to travel. The problem with this, is that wormholes will appear and disappear in a matter of seconds. Therefore, getting into a wormhole would be hard, and trying to end up where you started would be even harder.<br><br>Another thing I'd like to bring up is anti-matter. What are your thoughts on this? My extent of knowledge on this is quite small, but I would like to learn more. All I know is that if anti matter and matter come into contact, it can cause a very big explosion.<br><br>Somehow, I think black holes and anti matter are linked. Maybe it's a "portal" to an anti matter dimension?

If it's possible to withstand the gravitational pull humanly and have the capacity to create a vehicle that can serve the same person, then I partly believe that time travel will be possible.<br><br>This concept was displayed in Interstellar (One hour on alternate world traveled through black hole = 7 years on earth). Though the theory of time travel beyond black holes (and wormholes) is cloudy to me, I believe time travel also had something to do with gravitational pull and/or light years?

Well, I feel Time Travel is impossible. Sadly, I don't think the human body would survive the conditions.

The temperature on Mars is significantly hotter than Earth, which would make inhabiting Mars quite difficult.<br>This means that there is no water, which is vital for survival.<br><br>This topic is very fascinating, as was Interstellar.

No, if anything, we really deserve it more, we deserve way more than just extinction, we deserve a painful extinction, a long one. Not only are we doing it to ourselves, but we've done it to countless others. The majority of humans who don't pay attention to the trouble we cause is just adding insult to injury, towards the amount of disgusting things we do, not to survive, but to have luxury. We value our own personal comfort more than the lives of other animals, which we share the earth with. We are a disgusting race, and we completely deserve it.

A statement that is true in the state that the human race has done very bad things over thousands of years; yet we do not deserve a painful extinction. We have free will, and who would expect all 7.125 billion people on Earth to worry about every single species of animal or what is happening when we release too much carbon dioxide etc... We have to do these things to survive, and over the hundreds of thousands of years, humans have become the top of the Eco-system, those who work for it deserve luxury. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions and that's what makes this world so great, we can have sensible discussions like these :)

Well, like I said, we can't expect all 7 billion + people in the world to worry about these things. Some are arrogant, some don't really care, some do really care. What we need is people who just care more but until that happens, singular individuals won't be able to accomplish much. We just have to get on with life how it is.

You literally said it. Mars has a very thin atmosphere. Therefore it can't process UV, X-Rays, and gamma rays as efficiently as ours can. That radiation is what heats the planet despite its farther distance. But that still doesn't change the fact that one side is hell while the other is an icebox.

Why the fuck would anyone colonize Mars when you have like 5 other potential candidates that we can locate. We can't really colonize any planet unless we physically give it an atmosphere which is damn near impossible.

Exactly. lol.<br>In my opinion, Mars should be a last resort (or not even an option at all) when it comes to colonization.<br><br>Also, since the "Big Crunch" theory is scientifically true, there is no logical reason to colonize there. We'll get eaten the fuck up by the sun before we finish colonization.

Lol, people aren't planning to go to Mars so that our species has another place to live, we're doing it to see if it is able to be done. I think we can get their, but our odds of starting a new colony on a planet with no prior known life on it, is very low, almost 0% chance. Besides, I personally, I'd rather be dead than to be locked in a pod forever, and having to be in a space suit whenever I go outside into the freezing cold atmosphere.

I'd say our next best, and only other chance of survival on different planets would be Venus. Similar rocky build, similar gravity, only one problem. Venus is around 450 degrees Celsius. While differing temperatures can be worked around, it's a lot easier to keep a body warm in a space suit, than to keep it cool, since the human body helps out producing it's own heat. Personally, though the chances are small, Mar's is the best option, even if it near impossible.

True, but if we want to maximize our survival rate/time, we might as well colonize on a planet that is away from our Solar System or at least a reasonable distance away from the Sun.

Eh, still though, the nearest known star to our solar system is named 'Alpha Centauri', getting to that solar system alone would take around 4 light years. Assuming we could arrive at a solar system beyond our own, we would still take a decade at the minimum, to arrive, let alone how long and expensive it would be to bring the supplies to make the trip.

The most likely theory (in my opinion) is that at the end of the universe we will grow farther and farther apart, and eventually every atom will go far apart enough to not form any new galactic bodies, and it will be pitch black.

Yes, an unfortunate situation. I don't see it as an idiot being born every minute, but a horrible parent being made every minute. We should seriously have a universal law where need to have a license to own, or take of a child, because some people are just, well, doing it wrong.

So in my Science Research class I was talking about the physics of white holes with a friend of mine. Here is my though. So first of all, for those who may not know, a white hole is a theoretical exit to a black hole. It is believed, that since a black hole sucks you into it, then the white hole pushes you out of it. Now here's where it gets tricky. <br><br>I pondered upon this question, and he couldn't answer it, so maybe someone here can. So if everything that has mass has gravity, and black and white holes both have mass, then why does something as big as a white hole not suck things towards its center if everything with mass has gravity, and the bigger your mass is the more gravity you have? (Our gravity doesn't show on Earth because the Earth's gravity is stronger then a person's gravity).

A white hole is theoretical. I don't understand how there is an "exit" to a black hole. It's a one way trip.

Well, Stephen Hawking did theorize back in January 2014 that black holes are not "black" but are actually grey, and he also believes there's no event horizon to a black hole...
