I've fixed my procrastination issue mostly, my goal is to work harder in school, because I haven't really been trying, and it's evident in my grades.<br><br>Edit: I'd also like to become a better friend, and put my friends before myself and Avicus. I tend to get really angry and emotional easily, and I take it out on others, which is another thing I'd like to fix.

Be active. Both on Avicus and OCN, as well as IRL. I spend basically no time being active IRL, which is reeeally bad, and I've gone slightly inactive on Avicus because of OCN. I want to make a proper balance between the 3, while still doing well in school. Even if this means making some sacrifices to my social life, which is definitely a possibility.
