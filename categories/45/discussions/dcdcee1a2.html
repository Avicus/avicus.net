If I were to have not done that people would not take it seriously the next time I say I will do something. I am a man of my word. Had Dawson been reasonable and polite he would have recieved a different result. So yes it was necessary, as I explained to atdit; I am sorry that I did that to HIS Ts but it was his responsibility imo since he was the person who put dawson in that position. I believe me and atdit have remained friendly through this and no further hostile actions will occur as a result of dawson's previous actions.
