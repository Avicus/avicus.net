<b>Hi guys warning if your not into drama don't read ;)<br><br>Well Just as the title this is about my girl friend, She is leaving the school next year and we've been together for this whole year start to end... I don't know how to get over it . . . It's not just because she's attractive, I just feel different about her... If you don't understand I understand but it's a feeling and I never had it with anyone... and It's like the world is dying around us and she leaves I die... I don't know what to do anymore... Does anyone have any idea's or how they got over it. I feel like she has something I need, It's like if we only die once I want to die with her...&nbsp;<br><br><br>;( This will result as me not being on avicus for the last 10 days I have... ;(</b>

Well, if you NEED to be with her, my best guess would to go to the same school as her.<br><br>Otherwise...<br><br>There are plenty of fish in the sea.

&nbsp; I went through something like this... A guy lead me on (irl) and told me flattering words etc. Then next thing you know, he plays you and goes to date your "Best Friend." I was so surprised that he did this to me. I couldn't get over him. I felt so in love with him. Time and time went by, but still the same feelings.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; The hardest part is to let go, because it was supposed to be that way. If it was ment to be the relationship should fall together not apart.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;Think to yourself I can't continue my life this way. Find&nbsp;<b>your</b> happiness,&nbsp;<b>your</b> enjoyment,&nbsp;<b><u>your</u></b> pleasure. I'm sure she feels the same way about you too.<br>&nbsp; Keep in contact with her, so you both can talk and enjoy eachothers company. Tell her how you won your sports game! Keep in contact with her, but as you do that make yourself happy. "Life's too short to be upset and sad, savor the little things."&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; Find things to keep you happy is what i'm trying to say, you'll get over her trust me. A lot of my friends date like people in other schools, but you know what they do? They hang out on the weekends, see movies, swim, and most importantly... Keep in contact.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;You can do the same with her (as friends if you want). Don't leave the relationship right away and move on. It's impossible to do that unless it was a bad predicament. I wouldn't recommend to start dating with a new girl right away, because your ex still may have feelings for you, possibly you too.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Remember this, keep your self busy, and stay in contact! Hope this helps!:D Talk to me on Skype if you need support.I would be more than happy to help!<br><br><br><b></b>

I used to like this girl...<br><br>I asked her out, but she rejected me. at first I was angry, but then I told myself that she was annoying. to this day, I still think shes annoying.<br><br>but just make sure that if you do see your girl friend again, make sure you tell yourself that shes not annoying anymore....
