<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; ">The fact that you are banning people based on them spoiling something like this i find to be ridiculous. Absolutely insane. I guarantee you if i were to spoil a random game you wouldn't ban for it. Let's take the new Metal Gear Solid game to be exact. You are selectively banning as well, not only is that unprofessional but is just wrong. Also to begin with why do you have to ban? I get people are upset about spoilers to the new Star Wars movie. But can you not just mute them and call it a day? What the hell are you accomplishing by banning them? Asserting your dominance over them in a minecraft pvp setting is a very productive use of your time i suppose. There is no point to banning these people, you guys look ridiculous if you do so. So please, try not to be complete idiots. Also if any staff gets demoted for posting spoilers that is absolutely idiotic. The fact that this is an issue is the reason why many don't play avicus. The staff team and the way you handle things is idiotic and inefficient at best.</span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; "><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; "><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; ">TL;DR: Don't ban people for stupid shit, and if you do at least be fair and ban all spoilers.</span>

I was using it as a test to see how the implementation of rules like this works.<br><br>A lot of people were spoiling the Star Wars endings, and it was making a lot of people really unhappy. So I decided to see what would happen if I changed the rules to cater against ruining peoples times for the laughs.<br><br>I was considering the idea of not allowing people to spoil any sorts of "endings" on TeamSpeak due to the harmful intent, so I tested using Star Wars as the variable, as it is very easy to note when someone is attempting to spoil it.<br><br>Seeing as the reactions to it aren't so well, I'll go on ahead and revoke the rule and the idea. All players banned in correlation to it have been appealed. Apologies for any conveniences.<br><br>EDIT: Why are people who never come on TS complaining about it?<br><br>EDIT2: Oh right, their team member got banned.

I know, but that still wouldn't address the nonsensical imbalance of the rules between TS and the in-game servers, which was my point. You could have a channel on TS and a match in-game with the same people in attendance, and someone who spoiled the plot of the movie in both areas would be punished on the former but not the latter, based on the (now obsolete) rule.

I don't have control over the in-game rules.<br><br>A general consensus of staff who are very&nbsp;<b>active</b> on TeamSpeak came to the conclusion that we should at least test it out to see results. Frankly, it filtered out some excess trolling and worked well.
