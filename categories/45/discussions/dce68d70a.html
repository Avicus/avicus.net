Just curious to see what time are people on Avicus?<br>For the past couple of days. I've been joining the server, and it only had less than 12 players.<br>Don't know if it's just their schedules, or if there are certain times to be on?

It depends what timezone you're in.<br>The majority of the player base consists of Americans, so it'll increase when they're all online and decrease when they're asleep.<br>If you're living around Australia <i>(Timezone wise)</i>, then it'll be common to see these low numbers because all the Americans aren't on.

I always see low numbers both when it's like 8 PM or when it's 6 AM....&nbsp;<br>The players counter doesn't fluctuate that much...
