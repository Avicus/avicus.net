Anyways, not listing any pet peeves as Stimulating said but things I hate are:
<br>- Bias
<br>- False logic (like when I get grounded for not doing shit)
<br>- Ignorance
<br>- Squeakers who squeak EVEN MORE on purpose (not naming any Games)
<br>- False infractions (major false infractions, not 1 hour tempbans off TeamSpeak =_=)
<br>- Fanboys (especially the ignorant ones but I do like the ones that troll for example: DualzzRiwiking_17)
