Reduce render distance, turn off clouds and set your particles to minimal or decreased. It looks crappier but at least it kills some lag.

Nope, I have the fps set to 60, I lag on pretty much all the maps. Does the amount of players in a game effect it? Cause I get more lag in bigger games.

Then try getting updated components in the 2010s. Getting 8GB of RAM is 79.99 in Staples and a graphics card and Intel i7 should be around that price range. <br>All together it might come out to 300-400 dollars compared to a computer with comparable stuff that costs $1000 dollars plus.

You have it wrong, there are many versions of i7 CPUs.&nbsp;<br><br>I have an intel i7 870 with 2.93 Ghz out of 3.33Ghz. I can run minecraft just fine (Provided that a large crap load of TNT doesn't explode) and play Planetside 2 at medium fairly well. As well as most other games.<br><br>I have an Nvidia GPU.&nbsp;<br><br>And I have 8GB of RAM<br><br>I can tell you from experience that AMD isnt as powerful as intel (Previously had a Toshiba laptop... ugh...). With the best intel i7 being the 4770k (From my knowledge).

There is no point of arguing, if you don't have enough knowledge.<br>Yes there are many versions of an i7, so there are i5's, i3's, Pentium's, Athlon's, AhtlonII's, FX-8350, 9590, 8320...

You guys are work about you don't need a I7 you need to get a balanced CPU and Graphics Becauae the cpu has to handle the Graphics cards information and if it can't because your Cpu isn't good enough to handle the Graohics data it will make the Graphics not perfrom at its best potential.

I do have enough knowledge, besides I figured that we weren't arguing. I thought we were two computer nuts who were debating?<br><br>For your info, I have a desktop not a laptop. And I for one can tell you that an i5 and an i7 laptop are not one in the same.&nbsp;<br><br>My lil' bro has an HP pavillion laptop with an i5 and my older bro has a Lenovo with an i7. My older brother's laptop&nbsp;<br>performs even better than my little brother's. With a screen rez of 1900x... something.&nbsp;<br><br>As long as your CPU can play some great games at medium or high at +25 FPS and its fairly affordable then I think its worth it.

....<br><br>Anyone who understands standard english can understand that clearly im saying that my brother's laptop performs very good.&nbsp;<br><br>And what operations does he need to perform? Clearly their gamers not youtubers or programers. They have laptops... unfortunately they have no GPU's... well actually I dont know about my older brother but not my little brother.<br><br>And bro, how are you telling me what performs equally and what doesn't perform equally in gaming... I live with two other people who have the two mentioned CPU's I've seen them play games and I've played games on their computers.<br><br>My little brother cannot play Planetside 2 for sh** but my older brother's can, quite nicely in fact. Besides, from this detail alone this can tell you that my older brother's laptop clearly outperforms my little brother's.<br><br>And from your laptop specs and with the different games, the i7 and the i5 do not compete equally with the i7 doing slightly better in gaming and killing the i5 in rendering. The point of the matter is that i7 is better and the i5 is not.<br><br><b><i>Now, I think we're going a bit off topic xD</i></b>
