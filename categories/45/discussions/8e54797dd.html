Hmmmmm.<br><br>In my opinion, I think that this "rule" - if it should be called that... - is stupid. It's funny how you guys are giving special protection over a single movie...

Spoiling a movie for other people is really not cool and you yourself know what you are doing and what the punishment for the rule is. Wouldn't it be smarter&nbsp;<b>(I'm not insulting you, you're pretty cool)&nbsp;</b>if you would avoid this punishment?<br><br>I'm sorry, but come on man. If you wanted to prove a point you could've done it without name changing.<br><br><b>@Staff team:&nbsp;</b>You do realize that this rule is stupid... right? A temp-ban for 30 days would suffice enough, even then this is still unnecessary. If you want to watch the movie, then go watch it now either on some websites or etc. If the movie gets spoiled for you, oh well. Just deal with it.&nbsp;<br><br>I personally don't watch a movie for it's ending, I watch it for the whole part and all of it's attributes.

Many of us have already been spoilt anyway, so 99 did nothing much, except to those who haven't been spoilt.<br>And yea, like mentioned above, this punishment was issued on OCN

It's a justified punishment.<br><br>Different servers have different rules and standards and you are to abide by them when you go on.<br><br>Just because they're different to ours doesn't make it their punishment wrong or stupid.<br><br>Be open-minded guys.

What?<br>What makes it stupid isn't that it's different to Avicus rules. What makes it stupid is that you should not be banned forever from a server for just having spoiled a movie.&nbsp;<br>It is supposed to be one of the most important or known servers, they can't have that rule. This is why minecraft is dying, not just because of the game developers who day to day make laggier our lives.&nbsp;<br>Tell that open-minded thing to the people behind OCN. They are drowning their reputation in that way, not having open minds and banning anyone for something any normal person could just deal with. They are not just drowning their reputation, they are drowning minecraft's one, and making those loved ones quit forever.
