The premium only kits on walls &nbsp;are violating the EULA standards, fix them ASAP

Advantage of commands that give better advantages to donors. Access to stronger kits, etc. Basically, donor was supposed to be removed long ago.

I'm pretty sure Developers are aware of this already, just wait for the update for changes.

Hmmm, that's odd... You have 13 DAYS of play time, been here for more than a year, and then out of no where, you care...?&nbsp;<br>Two ideas:<br>1) Attention seek much?<br>2) Too tired of losing to all the walls players who have put time and effor into the game and beat you all the time?

None of the servers I play in (Which violate the EULA standards) have been closed/punished/removed with this rank removal thingy.&nbsp;Mojang doesn't care anymore.

Mmmm, my point wasn't to be harsh. Literally the EULA hasn't been enacted on any servers, and it has no literal point. But, my point being, this guy has been around FAR long enough to have no good reason to ask about the EULA months after it happened.<br><br>And honestly, if Polar or Murph or Drake or any of those people are on, we all rekt.

Mojang never cared. They would have changed the EULA long before the summer if they did. All they cared about was getting complaints from angry moms saying that their kids spend $500USD on a minecraft server
