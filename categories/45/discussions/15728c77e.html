Hi this post is purely to avoid confusion as it has popped up quite a bit in the last few days : BmB is not my main account, Gimpus is.<br>Gimpus is banned from Avicus because, in the most simple way &nbsp;i can think of it, kinda given the option to have BmB or Gimpus unbanned those few months ago and i chose BmB because i was better known on that account. &nbsp;However on kohi and OCN, which &nbsp;i play considerably more than Avicus that will be my IGN. &nbsp;<br><br>So please mods don't ban me instantly, know that it is all sorted out. <br><br>Also who wants to see me combo a kohi pvper?&nbsp;<br>I do: &nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkqHododog4" title="Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkqHododog4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkqHododog4</a>&nbsp;<br>watch the whole thing the ending makes me orgasm. I'm Gimpus and i know i look sketchy as hell in this vid but i have improved recently and his FOV makes it look a whole lot worse.

Kohi is a noob server, they banned me because I was wrecking this noob mod and he thought I had autoclicker because I was stafing him. The funny part is I'm not even the best on Avicus. Also, does anyone have the page where you can get unbanned?
