The day I joined, I vowed that I would one day help this server become the best it can be. Well it all started off when I became Junior Mod, I had a good application and my interview went semi-well. As Junior Mod I immediately noticed I didn't get many commands, /kick was basically our only useful command. That was my first issue as Junior Mod, so I decided that I would try to become Mod as fast as possible so that I could help the server more efficiently and be able to act faster when a rule breaker was present. I think what really made me excel past other certain Junior Mods was my ability to catch hackers. That was basically the bulk of what I did. Catching hackers became my thing, I was a natural pretty much (not trying to sound cocky). Within around a month and a half, I had successfully became a Mod and I was happier than ever. As soon as I became mod, I was able to do so much more. I could do things like:<br><i>*Forum Reports</i><br><i>*Tempban/Ban People</i><br><i>*Tempban people on Teamspeak</i><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; This made my job as an Avicus Staff member so much easier and I was proud of the work I was getting done every day. I did countless Forum Reports and caught tons and tons of hackers. Being Mod was the best thing ever, it was truly a pleasure. I have lots of tremendous memories from when I was staff and it is a shame Howsie will not give me a second chance.&nbsp;<br><b>________________________________________________</b><br><b><u><br>*Why I Retired</u><br></b>&nbsp; &nbsp; The reason I retired is short and simple and many people do not know it at all. School. School.. School.. School... basically, I was letting Avicus get in the way of my academics and my grades were quickly going downhill. I did not want to retire but I(for my own good) had to. It was a tough decision. I made the decision to retire with the belief that I would one day become Staff again, but I was greatly mistaken and it is unfortunate.<br><b>________________</b><b>________________</b><b>_________________</b><br><b><u><br>*Throwback<br></u></b>Now to the fun part, Throwback.<br>These are the videos I made of hackers I caught when I was junior mod. These were fun to make, and some people said they enjoyed watching them, so I thought, why not show you guys them. I hope you enjoy.<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEVFf-eLR5RZ7XqpNrzQ8uLR8U_h8vf50">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEVFf-eLR5RZ7XqpNrzQ8uLR8U_h8vf50</a>&nbsp;(23 Videos)<br><br>(These are the best of the videos)<br>The first video that started it all&nbsp;-<br>*&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://bit.ly/Wm7Nuv">http://bit.ly/Wm7Nuv</a><br>My three favorite videos -<br>1.&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://bit.ly/1p5CHRD">http://bit.ly/1p5CHRD</a><br>2.&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://bit.ly/1kIjYaA">http://bit.ly/1kIjYaA</a><br>3.&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://bit.ly/1k4Oeli">http://bit.ly/1k4Oeli</a>&nbsp;(featuring itzdylan115)<br><b>__________________________________________________<br></b><br>To whoever reads all this,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thank You &lt;3<br><br><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><i><br></i><b><i><br></i></b>
