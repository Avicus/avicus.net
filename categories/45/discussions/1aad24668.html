Hey guys<br>So about 3-4 days ago, this guy with the Skype name "<span>thatoneguythatlivesinabox" added me, and sent me a link. He proceeded to ask me if the picture in the link is me, and I was dumb enough to click on it. Shortly after, he told me it was malware. The link doesn't work now; it takes you directly to CloudFlare. It's ironic how he DDoS protects a malicious website.<br><br>Our Skype conversation went like this ("Me." is the other guy):&nbsp;<br><br><br>[8/28/14, 3:53:29 PM] Me.: um<br>[8/28/14, 3:53:31 PM] Me.: Are you at a computer?<br>[8/28/14, 4:03:57 PM] JKawesome: yes<br>[8/28/14, 4:05:14 PM] Me.: Is this you? <b>[link removed]</b><br>[8/28/14, 4:29:31 PM] Me.: Hello?<br>[8/28/14, 4:32:24 PM] JKawesome: who are you?<br>[8/28/14, 4:32:34 PM] Me.: I want to confirm your identity.<br>[8/28/14, 4:32:42 PM] Me.: So is that picture you?<br>[8/28/14, 5:13:30 PM] JKawesome: it won’t load<br>[8/29/14, 6:32:27 PM] Me.: Yeah, look at the link again.<br>[8/30/14, 12:25:11 PM] Me.: Alright, JKawesome.<br>[8/30/14, 12:27:08 PM] JKawesome: ?<br>[8/30/14, 12:27:16 PM] Me.: Did you notice the link I sent you?<br>[8/30/14, 12:42:47 PM] JKawesome: It’s not working<br>[8/30/14, 12:42:54 PM] JKawesome: Who are you?<br>[8/30/14, 12:56:41 PM] JKawesome: I will delete you as a contact if you don’t tell me who you are<br>[8/30/14, 12:58:15 PM] Me.: The link is fake.<br>[8/30/14, 12:58:24 PM] Me.: Look at it, it's gyazo.in.<br>[8/30/14, 12:58:28 PM] Me.: You aren't going anywhere.<br>[8/30/14, 12:58:32 PM] JKawesome: Tell me who you are.<br>[8/30/14, 12:58:39 PM] Me.: You don't need to know that.<br>[8/30/14, 12:58:48 PM] JKawesome: Yes I do.<br>[8/30/14, 12:59:06 PM] Me.: You know what that link is?<br>[8/30/14, 12:59:17 PM] JKawesome: Nope<br>[8/30/14, 1:00:07 PM] JKawesome: Tell me<br>[8/30/14, 1:00:50 PM] Me.: Well, why don't you find out?<br>[8/30/14, 1:00:58 PM] Me.: It's better if you get rid of it, you know.<br>[8/30/14, 1:01:01 PM] JKawesome: Because it doesn’t work?<br>[8/30/14, 1:01:11 PM] Me.: The normal link is gyazo.com<br>[8/30/14, 1:01:52 PM] JKawesome: Not found<br>[8/30/14, 1:02:02 PM] Me.: The link isn't a picture.<br>[8/30/14, 1:02:10 PM] JKawesome: Then what is it?<br>[8/30/14, 1:02:16 PM] Me.: Take a guess.<br>[8/30/14, 1:02:28 PM] JKawesome: Don’t send me a virus<br>[8/30/14, 1:02:53 PM] JKawesome: If it is one<br>[8/30/14, 1:04:26 PM] Me.: You already clicked on it.<br>[8/30/14, 1:04:35 PM] JKawesome: And?<br>[8/30/14, 1:04:52 PM] Me.: I'm not elaborating any further.<br>[8/30/14, 1:05:00 PM] JKawesome: It goes directly to Cloudflare<br>[8/30/14, 1:05:28 PM] Me.: Oh no, I already disabled the link after you clicked it.<br>[8/30/14, 1:07:45 PM] JKawesome: I clicked it on my phone.<br>[8/30/14, 1:08:11 PM] Me.: You also clicked on it on your computer.<br>[8/30/14, 1:08:25 PM] JKawesome: How would you know that?<br><span>[8/30/14, 1:08:32 PM] Me.: I'm not going to answer that.<br></span><br><br><br>Does anyone know who he is, or why he's doing this? If he adds you on Skype please don't add him. I'm very lucky that I had heavy anti-virus installed, but many people don't.</span>

The problem is, I can't change all my passwords. I have a job as a web developer, and I have the company's FTP and SSH credentials stored on it, and I can't exactly change them.

Oh sh*t that dude...... "ME." is a really good hacker, he made over 200 virus that corrupted a lot of systems (Such as the FBI, somewhere :P)... You are lucky you even survived that. (If you did). I went up against him once,.. He forgot to block his IP and while we were talking, (Or he trying to hack me) I went into his IP and ddosd him JUST IN TIME (Which is pretty hard to do in such little time). So if you have an anti-virus system, it wont help much. Thats one of the reasons i needed a new PC. The best thing to do is just well.. Not click the link. Or before Left click on the link and hit "Inspect element", If there are red Warning signs, dont click :P. But just dont do anything, and i recommend to change your password.. Or wait and see, cause it does take some time for the virus/hack to actually do something... So just wait then if something happens, drown your PC .-.<br><br>Well not drown, but just save it by using this: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://support.kaspersky.com/us/viruses/rescuedisk/">Kaspersky_Rescue_Disk</a><br><br>Its a system allowing you to look into your "Windows" system by using the Kaspersky System, Which prevents Windows from running, (Virus and everything stop acting).

I've never heard of someone big in the hacking world named "Me." &nbsp;He probably has no botnets and also your IP is not encrypted, so if you were to DDoS a big hacker... yeah, he would have gotten you bigtime by now. &nbsp;Inspect element does little regarding this. Lastly, I spoke with JK already and the source code on it is extremely basic.<br><br>Long story short, "Me." is not a big hacker and he never corrupted a ton of systems. &nbsp;This guy who keylogged JK was just a scrub who probably downloaded a crappy free logger off the internet.
