By now you have all probably heard what is happening to the server now, and after being around for a long time now it is fairly sad to see it closing down. I have met many many people through Avicus, throughout my very long time being here, after my sister told me to come on the server all that time ago. I was basically a meme for wanting mod back then, but in the end, I got it, starting off at Media, then swapped to ref, then finally to mod, and then to top it off social media, and then where I am now. I knew this day would come where the server would die, but I was told that as long as the mods moderate and the developers develop, then server will stay for a long time, so closing fairly soon took me by surprise, despite it did have very low to little players on so we all was expecting it. I have been getting very inactive in game and stuff for a while now, so you might not see me around abit, but in discord I will be there a fair bit playing something or doing something,<br><br>Thanks to&nbsp;Posighdun for letting me in on my first competitive team Cronus, and to lead it, along with everyone in Cronus for being amazing. 4lextr for being the first person I talked to through the server. Nemo we literally known each other for ages now, I can't remember how we knew each other, but we did, and I remember calling through skype aload and stuff like that lol. Ty to pat for taking me in, and to Jalp for being awesome. Thanks to everyone in the Average work place like Coco!! Along with all the other people I have talked to and teams I have joined etc!<br><br>If you got any screenies or anything feel free to post em<br>Here is a few:&nbsp;<a href="https://imgur.com/a/Jg5CX">https://imgur.com/a/Jg5CX</a><br><br>-Cya around
