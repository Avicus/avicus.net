</h1>
So, recently we've been having a lot of troubles in getting our team working on projects. Team members say they can make it on to the server on (this day) at (this time) however only 1/4th of the team shows up, and when they do nothing gets done.&nbsp;<br><br>Due to this reason, I will be recruiting new members to the Raging Incorporated Build Team. Yes, I've made a post about this before. However, we have a big build that is supposed to be done by Christmas day, and we've barely even&nbsp;<i>started&nbsp;</i>it yet. No, this message is not to bring down any members of our team. We consist of members who truly have a talent in building. However the work ethic, has truly gone downhill.<br><br>So if you'd like to apply for a spot on Raging Incorporated, please fill out the application form below!<b><br><br>Application for Raging Incorporated Minecraft Build Team:<br><br>How do you feel you would benefit the build team?<br><br>Do you have any past experience in building? (If so, please list below)<br><br>If you are accepted, how many hours of work are you willing to put in weekly?<br><br>Do you go on Skype&nbsp;<i>regularly&nbsp;</i>and are able to respond to urgent messages?<br><br>Why do you want to apply for a spot on the team?<br><br>In order to see the quality of your builds, please link me to a picture to 1-3 of them below:<br><br>Anything else you'd like to add that would benefit your application?<br><br></b>Thanks for reading! If you're interested, I strongly encourage you to apply. More information about the team and any questions needed to be asked will be discussed personally on Skype.<br><br>Regards, -Jake<b><br><br><br><br></b><b><br><br><br><br><br></b>

If it were placed in the Team section, it wouldn't show up in the Recent Discussions sections of the forums. I want people to see this, because this is urgent.

Exactly, also, teams should really be strictly made for "PvP". There should be a forum tag, similar to the "Teams" section for organizations other then "PvP" teams.

<b><u>[Only if you guys are active in building again]</u><br><br>Application for Raging Incorporated Minecraft Build Team:&nbsp;</b><b><br><br>How do you feel you would benefit the build team?<br></b>Well, I think I would benefit the team by my past experiences. I started building along time ago, and continue on. I hope to get better and better by collaborating with others and help out. I'm very active, and I like to build alot in my spare time. I've also been apart of Raging Incorporation in the past, which reflected on helping my building skills, by a major advantage! I hope to work with some friends again x3<b><br><br>Do you have any past experience in building? (If so, please list below)<br></b>Yes, I do have past experience in building. I've been in Raging Incorporation before, Team Archeon, Team Charmy&nbsp;and some teams with about 1 or 2 people, just for fun xP.&nbsp;From experience, I know that we built&nbsp;<b>Flowdren</b> as a group building in Rage Inc. Which was quite a success, and I wish to continue.&nbsp;<b><br><br>If you are accepted, how many hours of work are you willing to put in weekly?&nbsp;</b>I am frequently active, so about... 3 to 4 hours on building if I don't have anything else to do.<b><br><br>Do you go on Skype&nbsp;<i>regularly&nbsp;</i>and are able to respond to urgent messages?<br></b>Yes, I&nbsp;<i>reqularly</i> am active on skype. I do answer messages quite fast, if there was a urgent one. You can ask Pod about that.<b><br>Why do you want to apply for a spot on the team?<br></b>Well lately, I haven't been building much.

<b>How do you feel you would benefit the build team?<br></b>Work ethic going downhill? My work ethic isn't bad! If I enjoy doing something, I'll be very dedicated! x3 I'm (usually) amiable, you know I'm mature and helpful.. most of the time, and as long as I know what we're doing, I'll be happy to work until I can't work anymore.<b><br><br>Do you have any past experience in building? (If so, please list below)<br></b>I have a lot of experience in moral support! ;) In all seriousness, I’ve assisted in maps, and I
build spawns for myself in my free time. I tend to start projects, then never finish them. Oops x3<b><br><br>If you are accepted, how many hours of work are you willing to put in weekly?<br></b>Oh, there’s a wiiiiide range for this one. I have way too much free time,
so I generally play Minecraft 8-ish hours a day. I’d say 10 hours a week maybe,
Possibly more.<b><br><br>Do you go on Skype&nbsp;<i>regularly&nbsp;</i>and are able to respond to urgent messages?<br></b>Yup. I have a second monitor for a reason. ;) 11pm-9am EST is when I won’t
respond right away… I sleep a lot c: As long as I am on my computer and/or phone, I have access to Skype. x)<b><br><br>Why do you want to apply for a spot on the team?<br></b>I like building. I have difficulty finishing projects by myself. :P Plus I think it would be really fun! x3 And you need people, ye? If I can help you, then that's always good!<br><br><b>In order to see the quality of your builds, please link me to a picture to 1-3 of them below:</b><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://i.imgur.com/qLjt32o.png">http://i.imgur.com/qLjt32o.png</a>&nbsp;I dabble in floor building.&nbsp;<br><b><a rel="nofollow" href="http://i.imgur.com/xXK7gLE.png">http://i.imgur.com/xXK7gLE.png</a>&nbsp;</b>Back when building maps identical to Ternio and Quintus were a thing, I made this.

For some reason, on that world I couldn't toggle downfall, so I made a little roof x3 Ignore it :P<b><br><br>Anything else you'd like to add that would benefit your application?<br></b><span>You never have to worry about my behavior being bad. After all, I’m staff
on both Avicus and Overcast. :P &nbsp;And
although this doesn’t exactly improve my chances at being accepted, it’s
something to consider; I’m not the best at making buildings. I can terraform.. kinda, and I can make floors. Can't do buildings.<br><br></span>I don't expect to be accepted, due to slight inactivity, and my subpar building skill, but you did say that work ethic is a big thing you are looking for, which I do have. :P<b><br><br><br></b>

<span><b><span>How do you feel you would
benefit the build team?<br>
</span></b><span>I'm creative, cooperative, hardworking, and would consider
myself to be a skilled builder. I have a lot of experience working with build
teams, so I believe I am ideally suited to this task.<br>
<b><br>
Do you have any past experience in building?<br>
</b>Yes, most notable among these would be I was accepted into an elite build
community know as WesterosCraft, and have worked with then for over 2 years.<b><br>
</b><b><br>
If you are accepted, how many hours of work are you willing to put in weekly?</b></span>&nbsp; <br>A few hours a week, 3-5
most likely. However, in the holidays I can be on for about 6 hours a day if needed.<b><br>
<br>
Do you go on Skype&nbsp;<i>regularly&nbsp;</i>and are able to respond to urgent
messages?<br>
</b>I have and check Skype fairly regularly, I also use TS.<br>
<b><br>
Why do you want to apply for a spot on the team?<br>
</b>I'm interested in joining a group of other skilled builders to make maps
for Avicus.<br>
<b><br>
In order to see the quality of your builds, please link me to a picture to 1-3
of them below:<br>
</b>- Build 1: A towerhouse and hamlet which I built, obviously not a
mini-game map, but it shows the quality of my building. If you wish,&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0el-ClGhHwk">here</a>&nbsp;is a
link to a video of this build (although I didn't make the video).&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://i.imgur.com/uccOX0N.jpg">Picture link</a>.<br>
- Build 2: A Nebula map I made quite some time ago, although
I still think it is a good reflection of my skill.&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://i.imgur.com/lljCZNL.png">Picture 1</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://i.imgur.com/X5glHpe.png">Picture 2</a>.<br>
<b><br>
Anything else you'd like to add that would benefit your application?</b><br>I
am skilled in both WorldEdit and VoxelSniper, and have used it extensively in
multiplayer environments.</span><br><span><br>Regards, Blue</span><b><br></b><b><br></b>
