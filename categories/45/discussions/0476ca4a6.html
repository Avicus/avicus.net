Just share one. If you werent here back then, make one of Avicus.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; (Make sure to say if it is avicus or mczone PLZ)<br><br>My memory<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mczone<br>So, it was a LOOOONNNGGG sg round. It was me and some other person. I had full iron and enchanted diamond sword. My compass was blown up by a creeper at the wrong time....so for the next 2 hours i asked the person where he or she was. She said she was trapped and didnt know where. So, here is what i did. &gt;&gt;SCUMBAG MOVE&lt;&lt; she ended up getting pissy and mad...so i told her to go to hub on the count of three with me...1..2..3! She left and I stayed.

I'm not sure if this was in McZone, but it was definitely a while ago.<br>A bunch of trolls decided to create a lagfest by recreating Niagra Falls in Rendezvous.<br><a href="http://imgur.com/1YxxGlT" rel="nofollow">http://imgur.com/1YxxGlT</a>

I remember in MC Zone when I was a noob and didn't know what Stomper was. It was me and Googlelover1234. She jumped from her pillar and killed me. That is the event which led to me to get a forum account, so I could report her. I didn't have evidence,a nd it was teh stomper kit. So I looked like a total noob.
