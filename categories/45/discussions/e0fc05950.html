Well I thought it would be a good idea to be able to sell &nbsp;you badge them upgrade to another one this would be a good idea, because it takes along time time to build up your credits so you should be able to sell them but for abit lower! :)<br><b>Forexample:<br></b><br>Badge: * &nbsp;Buy= 10,000 Sell= 8,000<br><br><b>Let me know what you think xD</b>

Yah, it would help people like me, cause I need to get credits and I would gladly sell my badge to get the credits, so it would be nice.

I'd think buy for 10k, sell for 5k. This way people would'nt want to sell them as much, but it still can if you want.

Nah, I think it's better that if you have your mind set on one badge that you save up for it, instead of buying little badges 1 by 1 and then getting the omega (example)

It's not a bad idea.<br><br>I think that people who don't earn a lot of credits (me) can sell them after earning only a couple of thousand credits, and maybe be able to upgrade to another one. It's ok.

I would like the badges to be somewhat similar to prestiges. In this, I mean you would start out with the first, least-expensive badge, then you could purchase an upgrade for whatever cost your current badge needs to have added to it to become as expensive as the second badge (SecondBadge-UpgradeCost=FirstBadge). I find this to be a bit of a better way to see the players' actual progress from an XP standpoint because of how they're more likely to immediately purchase an upgrade instead of waiting and building up for the most expensive badge.

I think its a great idea. I think it should be 1/2 the price. ex. 10k badge = 5k after selling

no pls. Then we will have a bunch of people buying one rank, working the slightest bit, selling it, and then with that money added onto the little work you did to get a new rank.<br>Just work hard and get your badges legit.<br><br>I still haven't bought a badge to save up for the omega one xd

But what happens if you found a badge you really like then in like 2 months Time they find another one? Selling their badge would help them get to their new badge

You can't "find another one". It's not like they're hidden, they're all on a list when you go into the hub shop.

I think he means you just get sick/bored of the badge and want another one. You sell that one for maybe 1/4 and that will help.
