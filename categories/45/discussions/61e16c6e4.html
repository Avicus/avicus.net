This may sound crazy, but this idea they have could actually really help Avicus out. If we were able to quickly resolve the issues we currently have. Maybe it wouldn't be such a bad idea to contact them and offer our server for their tournaments. If done correctly, these 5 Youtubers and their huge sub count could give that boost we really need and form Avicus into the more well known servers in the Minecraft community.

When I first saw the video, like a week ago, I instantly commented on it saying they should check out Avicus and OCN because those are 2 servers with teams. Pretty funny to see that they say ''The first competitive team'' LOL
