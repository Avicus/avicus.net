Hello,<br>This thread is a about how to notice hackers easier than normal.<br>Now, this won't work 100 percent and I don't mind&nbsp;<u><i><b>constructive</b></i></u> criticism.&nbsp;<br>Now this is my opinion so if you don't think this works then don't hate just give some&nbsp;<b><i><u>constructive</u></i></b> criticism.<br><br>Now as you know:<br>1. You can tell if a person is hacking by them flying when they aren't supposed to so you automatically know.<br><br>But some clues to see if they are hacking is:<br>1. Check if the person your accusing of hacking has a rank (they usually don't.)<br>2. Go on the forums and look at their account to see when they joined and how many kills, deaths, server joins, etc. (If they don't have much then they are probably a hacker.)<br><br>You are just making a staff members' life a lot easier by doing this and you won't get an infraction for "accusing of hacks"<br><br>You guys might say or you can just /report.<br>If your that person...by all means go ahead and do the right thing and report them.<br>But if you're a person like me who likes to investigate...by all means use my tips.<br>Still thinking of ideas but if you guys have any, feel free to add them!<br>Regards,<br>Aidan

It doesn't work like this.<br>I do sometimes check when they joined though.<br>Having a rank doesn't mean you can't hack. I guess people trust those who donate.

If I was someone that checks if they were a hacker I would look if they got banned on other servers for hacks

wtf.<br><br>Your method won't work 50% of the time. More like, if you for instance sneak up behind them, and all of a sudden they turn around and start hitting you and you can't land any hits on them, that's when you can call hacks.

Erm, all of this is pretty obvious. Like, flying? It's obvious. I'm sure everyone else knows how. In case you haven't noticed, staff don't like to be told about hackers besides /report, which is fair. But if you're using /report over someone you think hacks from their rank and their stats, it doesn't usually prove anything. They can ban you from false reports. Let the staff stick to the job, as they have some training and knowledge behind this.

All you are stating is that donors won't hack or that there might be an obvious fly hacker.<br>Just report em and that's it. Leave the investigation to Staff Members cause if you continuously follow a player from game to game, even if they are hacking I'm sure they can call a staff member on you and say you were harassing him/her by following him.<br>It takes less than 5 seconds for /report.&nbsp;<br>Only exception to "investigating" would be to record but you would probably have to have evidence if said person does decide to say you were harassing him/her.

Unfortunately checking people's ranks and profiles doesn't work all the time. Someone could be hacking who has a rank, or&nbsp;has a lot of playing time/kills/etc. Or it could be the other way around and a new player who has no rank, and just joined (who is not hacking), is being accused of hacking.<br><br>If you don't want to get an infraction for hackusating (accusing players of hacking) a player in chat, then just don't say "PlayerXXX has kill aura". Instead use that time to type in "/report PlayerXXX hacking - kill aura (head is twitching in a group of players when fighting)". If a mod is online, then he'll/she'll come and save the day.&nbsp;<br>Also, in terms of reports, I'm not sure how they work on Avicus, but on OCN, it's so much nicer to get a descriptive report. So instead of reporting someone for "hacks" or "cheats", you could report someone for "forcefied - hitting players all around him" or "noslowdown - running with a drawn bow".<br><br>Also, if you want to investigate, the best thing to do is join obs, and boot up that recording software. Get some evidence of him/her hacking, and upload it to the forums (<a href="https://avicus.net/forums/categories/47" title="Link: https://avicus.net/forums/categories/47">https://avicus.net/forums/categories/47</a>). If a mod comes on and bans him before you upload your footage, no biggy, you&nbsp;don't have to submit the online report. But if no mod comes (maybe no mod is online), then you just got a hacker banned.
