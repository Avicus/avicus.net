Well ive just been on a game on Quintus and well the people on that game clearly didn't know the rules. For a start someone was being horrible to another player and i told him not to because that mean . Then after he spammed a whole line of capital letters and i said calm the caps . Then he told me i'm not mod so they wouldn't listen to me (There was two people). They continued with the caps and things . Then i realised that a <u>certain Moderator</u> was on the same game and active , but clearly wasn't telling them off im really not happy ! I also told all the people to go Avicus.net/rules and then they told me to shut the hell up then i left that staff member and them people on the game alone . This took place in about 20-30mins. I will not say the name of then Mod that was online at the time and active .
