<br>Today
is a special day. Why? Well, because today is my One year Anniversary
on the Avicus Network, Its hard to believe that back when I first joined, I hated everyone, and all I cared about was PvP. But, as my play-time increased, I got to know some people in-game, and my love for the server gradually increased, But when I saw that teamspeak broadcast message, I immediately hopped on, My first few times on it, It didnt go as well as I thought, but I kept at it, and the more I went on, the more I felt at home. But everything really changed when Staff apps opened around march, I made an application in literally 25 minutes, and submitted it, And I felt good of myself, I felt that I was doing something to benefit everyone, however I never thought I'd get Senior mod, just regular mod.<br></span><span><br>So, what is all this about? It's because I love this server and it's community (While it may be bad at times :))))) It always gives me an enjoyable experience, even after a full year. (Or 2,000 hours of play-time) And the people I've met here, I'll never ever forget, They are some of the most amazing friends I've had.<br>
</span>
<span>
<br>So,
Thank you. Whether you like me, Or if you hate me, All of you made me
stay here for a full year, and I've had such an outstanding time here.</span><span><br>
</span>
<span>
<span><br>Heres to 2 years and an even better 2015!</span></span>

It's been a pleasure knowing you, glitchy. Although you probably wouldn't consider us the best of friends, I know you'd do near to anything for this server and community. You're dedicated, hard working, and fun. I completely respect you for these qualities<br><br>Cheers to one year! &lt;3

When I first joined TS encouraging&nbsp;IronSoldier2000 and buster_U to &nbsp;hop on with me, &nbsp;glitchy was one of the first people I met. At first I felt insecure scared and nervous. But once I started to get on more often and often I learned how awesome you are, and everyone else too. &nbsp;Glas to be friends with you.(:
