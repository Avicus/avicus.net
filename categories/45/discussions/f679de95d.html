I remember all I used to play was walls, and then when I died I went to the hub and clicked nebula and I saw that nebula had so many more people on it so I joined Quintus, told my brother and we have been playing nebula since then lol

My first map on nebula was on senex or frostbite. On frostbite the spawn was riddled with anvils so I couldn't do anything, and on senex I had no idea what was going on. I saw a bunch of skybridges, so I skybridged up and sniped enemies trying to get iron. Oh yeah, it was back in McZone.
