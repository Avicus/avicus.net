The tournament times don't favour you guys at all and i sympathise with you there, it does seem a little unfair but unfortunately that's the way it turned out.&nbsp;<br>But if you are an AU team and have registered for the tournament please guarantee that you will be able to participate in all your games because otherwise you will just no-show which will lead to a DQ, a wasted space for another team who wanted to play and a dissapointed opponent.&nbsp;<br>I'm not bashing you guys in anyway at all but please be considerate when registering for this tourney.<br>The same applies to any team who don't think they will be able to make any of the dates but still register.

Agreed. If your not 100% sure that you can make the tourney don't do it!!!<br>If you no show and get dq'ed there might be another team who would want to participate but can't because of you!

I'm really impressed by the AU players, you guys got the short end of the stick but you're showing a lot of class.
