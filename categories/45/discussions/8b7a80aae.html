I've heard many players talking about this. If it is true, why not advertise Avicus more? I'm not saying to go on servers and blurt the IP. I'm saying, why don't we get as many people as possible to make YouTube videos about it. The Avicus merchandise is definitely taking it to the next level. So, why don't we post some ideas here that could help the Avicus network grow?<br><br>-Sky

IMO it has been going downhill since avicore, the server just feels unpolished but after everything gets polished and fixed, the server can be great.

If you left than leave. No one wants to hear you moan and complain and diss the server tbh. So if you have complaints I'd ask you take them elsewhere because we don't care. People play on the server because they enjoy it. The server's&nbsp;actually been growing in the past little while. Just really, no one wants to hear it thanks.

I hear what you're saying Skygirl, but i can't argue with the mods: I've noticed a phenomenal deviation in the numbers..<br>About 2 months ago, we were topping 200 - 250 absolute tops, and now (as mentioned) we climbed to a peak of around 550 - 570 people :)<br>We're making a comeback in my opinion :)

Ive had enough of hearing this "mczon had 1000 players and avicus has 500!!!11111"&nbsp;<br><br><br>You need to realize that 8/10 of mczone players were inconsiderate rude randies. Sure avicus has em, but we have a lot less now.

funny at the end of mczone there were about 50 people online. hence, why avicus exists
</blockquote>

Perhaps due to them messing up the skywars and other game play they had that were popular, that is why mczone ended. &nbsp;There are already a lot of threads about this topic of why mczone was great and then started losing players.

Don't think it is, but there is a lot less mods attending reports, if you /report people, no staff comes. Check a staff member's profile, they're online. .-.<br><br>I understand that staff members also want to play, but still. If multiple people report someone, then attend it.<br><br>Yes, we can see who's in the match by using /list, it includes spectators and players, and staff still have a tag, so don't respond by "you don't know if a staff member is there or not".<br><br>Sorry to complain, just putting my two cents in.
