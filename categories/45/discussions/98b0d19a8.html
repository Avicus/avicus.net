Lately I have noticed a lot of game modes suggestions especially with HuNger/Survival games.<br><br>This bothers me.&nbsp;<br><br>Avicus has three great gamemodes; Avicade, Control the Hill, and Elimination*), almost always left empty.<br><br>Avicade: Full of fun mini-games, like red alert and minotaur. &nbsp;Both very popular fun minigames, with very well built and thought out maps.<br><br>Control The Hill: &nbsp;Classic, different kits, different items, perks, a very fun game<br><br>Elimination*: &nbsp;Get a certain amount of time to mine for material, and then fight, originial and classic.<br><b>Elimination is pretty much a unique, modified version of Survival/Hunger games.&nbsp;<br></b><br><b></b>Note: &nbsp;I am not saying to stop suggesting mini-games for the server, but please explore all of Avicus wonders before suggesting different things on forums!

As X_Heat said, we are expecting Survival Games in the next update, along with Parkour.<br><br>And I wholeheartedly agree - Avicus has tons of opportunities for fun experiences in even its current game modes. Heck, I've had great times with friends in just Nebula.<br><br>I think people should focus more on the community aspect. Sure, you normally come here for the games, but in order to get the true and full Avicus experience, becoming part of our community is by far the best way to get involved and have fun. We have so many different people, each with different personalities and backgrounds, it's hard to get bored.<br><br>But back to the games - Yes, Avicade, CTH, and Elim don't get the attention they deserve. I think a sort of event is needed to kickstart their return. I'll definitely think about it for the future :)

"Full of fun mini-games, including Red Alert and minotaur" -&nbsp;<br>these are the ONLY mini games, first of all and also Avicade is not even working in itself, which also covers Elimination, which has so little popularity that even I haven't played it after being here for a year, and it is so bugged that you cannot operate, while playing it, and you didn't mention Walls and Nebula :O<br>Also the other games people want are the old ones, which made Avicus/McZone so popular..<br><br>this is why people ask for more, but i hear where you're coming from, we should be grateful for what we have, and not take what he have for granted..:)

CTH usually has no players but when it does, it can be more popular than nexus. So it's far from a completely dead gamemode. I'd recommend a tourney for CTH though, to improve popularity and to test and as practice for running any nebula tourney.
