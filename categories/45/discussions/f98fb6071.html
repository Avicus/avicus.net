Hey everyone! Since it is the season of giving, I have decided to <b>give back</b> to the community with a giveaway. I will be doing a giveaway for not 1, but&nbsp;<b>2</b> copies of one of my games of the year, <b>Undertale.&nbsp;</b>If you haven't heard of this game I would highly recommend checking out some of the reviews that can be found on certain sites. <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/undertale" rel="nofollow" title="Link: http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/undertale">Metacritic </a>has rated the game one of the best-rated games of all time and I highly recommend it beyond belief. &nbsp;You can find the game on Steam <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/391540/" rel="nofollow" title="Link: http://store.steampowered.com/app/391540/">here</a>. The giveaway will end @ 7:00 EST on Friday Dec 18th.<br><br>Here is how you will be able to enter:<br><br><b>Skype:<br></b><b>Thank you note to a member in the community:<br></b><br>That's all that you have to do! When writing the Thank you note, please make it sincere and honest. If you do joke thank you notes, you will not be considered for the drawing. Try to make it at least 2-3 sentences so that they can really understand how much you appreciate what they do. The quality of your thank you note doesn't affect your drawing, but make it seem nice!<br><br><b>Example</b>:<br>I just wanted to say thank you to Posighdun for being one of the biggest bros on the server! Ever since we met I knew that we would grow up to have a really good friendship and luckily that has continued to today! All of our amazing avicus moments, skype calls, quiplash games, and Island Clash fun that we have had, and you have quickly become one of my greatest friends of all time! Thanks for being the best friend ever on this server! &lt;3<br><br>- Riley<br><br>That is all that you have to do, however,<b> there is a second way to win!</b> I have given one random person the answer to my mystery question. If you can find the&nbsp;correct person on the server and ask them for the answer they will give it to you, and the first person to give me the answer to my question by 7:00 EST on Thursday, Dec 17th, You will get one of the copies of Undertale right away! (You still have to enter with your skype and thank you note, though)&nbsp;<br><br>Good Luck everyone, and happy holidays!<br><br>Riley/GuyNamedRiley

Skype: mywayz1<br><br>Thank you note to the member of the community: MLGPorky. For some reason despite the fact I didn't know him, he actually did a lot for the server. He helped advertise the server on his channel, he became a senior moderator at one point because of how popular he was and how he was so friendly with one another. I don't know if he'll see this but keep up the good work my Canadian pal! :D

Skype:&nbsp;luca ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)<br><br>Note: Thanks Billy, Calvin and Keller for being great mates! You're great fun to play with, and I often speak to you on skype or in-game.
