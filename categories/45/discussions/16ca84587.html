Just wondering… why does it say I am ranked gold?<br><br>Anyways hi guys… just want to end anything about me just disappearing.&nbsp;<br>To put it short I just drifted away from video games. I realized (not denouncing video games this is just what I thought) that so much more can be done in real life, or for that matter, on the computer; but it just doesn't come from video games for me. To be truthful the new layout of the forums kinda helped me leave, it just didn't click with me. I know there is a lot of time and effort in it, but it just didn't seem user-friendly to me.&nbsp;<br>So I slowly began drifting away, I checked now and then on Skype (pretty sure I have thousands of new messages) and here and hey! I was in for an interview for staff! I thought that would pull me back but I was already too far gone. I was video game free.&nbsp;<br>Now don't get me wrong I may well come back, but if that happens its going to be a long time.&nbsp;<br>I have looked through posts and seen how this server has changed over my time gone, and wow, I have missed a lot.<br>I hope you took the time to read this. <br>Love you all &lt;3<br>-Cork

We will miss you cork!<br>I agree with you, video games are getting quite boring for me too, and there are so many better things that you can do instead.
