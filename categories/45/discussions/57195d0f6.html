I was just wondering if people would be interested in me making one of or all of these vids. I may include a beginner's and mid-advanced PvP guide(s) sometime. I may also teach a type of strafe I use. I'm not sure if the technique belongs to anyone else but I haven't seen it used before anywhere or by anyone I've faced. So Kohi Montage/Combo-and-Strafe-tage/PvP Guides. If anyone would like to see those videos come out on my channel please comment below. I'd you have any requests for which PvP technique you want me to teach comment saying which. Certain ones are top secret and others I'd be willing to give away.&nbsp;<br><br>Thanks,&nbsp;<br><br>-ShadowSlayerZ7

I can give general tips. I'm not a soup PvPer. If you want top-teir soup tips, ask croc. He's amazing at soup. I can give a few tips though. Learn how to hotkey and always Jeep your eye on your hearts cuz they TANK in soup. Blockhitting is useful if you can incorperate it well. Don't just shift and blockhit and expect to win. If you're getting combo'd turn and run, jump so you get knocked out of their combo, or blockhit. Blockhitting is very good for countering and breaking combos as well. If you watched my 1v1 with Crusty, at 5:55 I blockhit and proceed to counter-combo him. Just some tips

Soup PvP is very complex to learn and master, as you have to be really good at multitasking.

Oh you mean my "build hacks" right? Anyways. There's videos of Breezily doing it on his channel, if you want to learn you have to look at the video and try to figure it out.

Why I play pot more is because the multitasking takes away from my concentration on the fight, making me play worse. I'm good at multitasking but I'd rather preform better.

Yeah it is.&nbsp; But i think if you master soup pvp, everything else you feel easy to you.&nbsp; Especially kit pvp, where all you have to worry about is killing.
