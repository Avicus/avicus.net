I out grew it, and then my mom preaches for god so anything that screams she will say its the devils work (so most shows xD). I used to go out as the stupidest things cause my mom didn't want anything scary. So I decided not to go anymore, since it is "cold outside" as well for my mom, I have to wear a jacket, so I can easily go with a mask and say its my costume.
