So I love the TV show "Arrow" but i'm wondering is flash any good because I have heard mixed review about that show. Please respond with your opinion

I too am a fan of "Arrow", and since you liked that show, I think you'll also enjoy Flash. It's basically just a spinoff of the same show, just different hero. But it's very entertaining, interesting, and plus the star is Barry Allen, which is also a big plus for me. But my recommendation is to watch at least the first 3 episodes, and I think you'll know whether you Like it or not then.

I watch the Flash, it's pretty good. I like it more than arrow, just because they added people that can do awesome thing which is the kind of thing that I like.
