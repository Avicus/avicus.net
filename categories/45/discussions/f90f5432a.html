Everything in this video applies to MC as well. This is a good way to educate you whether you think you need it or not on this issue. I want to hear you comments on sportsmanship as well.

Was playing Showdown and there were these annoying people who mocked me if I did something right, or hate on me for doing something wrong. They even tried to coax me into using the wrong moves. People these days, no respect

In all honesty I find in tournaments, teams act better. Pub is pretty bad on every server. Badlion and Kohi has gotten to the point where I had to turn my chat off to enjoy those servers because people get very angry on how I pvp[I might bow spam a bit]

I saw this on Showdown. It's definitely a big issue in Minecraft as well, and almost all competitive games that are accessible to many people.<br><br>However, I think it's best to look on the bright side of things - there are many people in Minecraft and other games who are still respectful, and others who genuinely have a good time with friends and strangers. It just so happens that negativity sticks out, especially in a place like the Internet and in games.

I feel like the mindset of "Oh you lost, you must be shit" has gone a little too far. People generally use the term "rekt" when they...well rek someone in MC, but it's gotten to the point where people have said "Rekt" to me after a 3v1. Even in the most stupid circumstances, people seem to have to justify their win by saying other poeole suck. You just 3v1'ed me. And that makes ME bad?

This immature "I win You Suck" thought process certainly exists, but it is unwise and biased to assume the opposite does not occur. &nbsp;After a really close fight on Kohi when I beat someone, I'll be sure to let them know: "Hey you were really good lol". &nbsp;If, during a game of Left 4 Dead 2 Scavenge the timer comes down to a few seconds but the enemy team gets the can in, most of the time&nbsp;<i>they</i> will say gg first, and it's a mutual understanding that both teams played great (unless the game consisted of intentional f***ing around).<br><br>I think the immature mindset is mainly portrayed by younger players; as they mature they will likely acknowledge the other team's strengths if they are worthy.

I think that's true, you're right. However my overall worry is that the portion of individuals that believe in good sportsmanship will diminish over time. Also what he said is that the game of Pokemon was created targeting children, respectively. It's supposed to be a fun and enjoyable game. Putting in those sort of comments ruins the experience for people who think differently. It's like déjà vu with MC. The same situation. People getting angry or frustrated over a block game doesn't really make sense in my eyes. Games are created for fun and people should be able to feel that way.
