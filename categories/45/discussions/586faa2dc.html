Hi there,&nbsp;<br><br>My activity on Avicus has been shit the past few months, so I thought I would pop on the forums a bit more often. So yeah, I've noticed the forum activity in general has really decreased, no one really posts anything on here anymore. The recent discussions seem to be really old like 1 to 2 days instead of minutes 2 to 3. It doesn't take too long to create some kind of post on the forums and keep it from being completely dead, and to the people that are not logged in and just stalking the forums you should really get involved in the discussions every now and then. We need to have more open end discussions about current events. politics, news and sports stuff. &nbsp;Keep these forums active so that new players see that we talk about a wide variety of topics not just video game related stuff.&nbsp;<br><br>We all gotta do our part to keep this server generating traffic (advertising would be nice, but I don't know if that is happening). So all you peeps really need to do is make one post or create one topic a day about something you find is interesting and make these forums active.&nbsp;<br><br>MAKE AVICUS GREAT AGAIN!&nbsp;<br><br>~Numberz

Meh, I don't post too much anymore because the forums now pretty much only have AMA's where its usualy the same question, map rotations which I don't care too much because I'm bad at building &amp; I have no power on which maps get accepted and last but not least, new changes to the staff team or updates on other server stuff, which there isn't much to say. Back in the day was the good old days, but can agree that having a smaller interval wait time would be better.

It makes sense to keep the names private, just in case nothing worked out. It also doesn't need to be public info.
