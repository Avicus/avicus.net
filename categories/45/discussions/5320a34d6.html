Ok so this is a REEEAAAAAAALLLLLLYYY old map. usually never took more than a minute. It was this really cool looking tower that was I'd say about 100-150 blocks high (So tall.). On top of the Tower was one monument. At the bottom there were four islands (spawn islands for each team) surrounding it So the map was basically if you died going up it was game over for you, and you wouldnt break the monument. So it was basically a race for the monument.<br><br>So this was in the more ancient days of avicus, so if anyone remembers the map name it would be much appreciated if you could share it.
