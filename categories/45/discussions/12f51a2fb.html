Dont really know you very well, but I dont dislike you or anything.<br>&nbsp; Uh, I just play a game back when I was like 10 where you buildt a town. I was in need of a name for the town, and came up with "The DD town". &nbsp;Later on when I got mc I just put Robin_DD, which wasnt really good enough, and J sounds good I guess. So it doesnt really mean anything.
