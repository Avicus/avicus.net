<div>Hey everyone. Not trying to make this into a big deal, but my time here is over. As of now, I'm leaving Avicus after 3 years.<br></div><div>Before I go however, I want to say a personal "thank you" to some of the people on this server who made my&nbsp;</div><div>time here truly enjoyable. I consider you to be my friends, and I can never thank you enough.&nbsp;</div><div>To those who didn't particularly enjoy my tenure as a moderator; I'm sorry. I failed to live up to the expectations</div><div>of a moderator, and I'm truly sorry.</div><div><br></div><div>I know some (probably not that many) are wondering why I'm choosing to leave. Well, it's complicated. Over the year that I've been staff member, I've noticed how much the staff team has changed, and I've disagreed with a number of these decisions. That's not their fault. Gods know, they're doing what they believe to be right and they should be supported in that, but I no longer feel like I can continue to support something that I don't believe in.</div><div><br></div><div>It's not just the staff team, however. I'm not blind to the way that the community is shrinking and so many of the players I've considered to be friends have left, from Bang to Mels, I don't find Avicus as fun or as inviting anymore. Each day, when I log on to moderate, I sigh and log on reluctantly, and I don't want to moderate when I don't enjoy it. I won't be working at the best of my ability, and the community deserves someone better than I in both ability and attitude.</div><div><br></div><div>Because I know what people are going to say, this thread is not to garner attention. It's simply to thank</div><div>everyone who befriended me in my time here, considering that I won't see most of them due to different time-zones.</div><div><br></div><div><img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/58d037b7dccc4f2eadd4011c6f484555?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/Lokigh.html" style="color: #FF5C5C">Lokigh</a>: Ah, Lokigh. You were the one who first introduced me to Avicus, and I will always be grateful to you for that. You're one of my oldest friends, and I still remember coming home from school all those years ago, jumping on Skype with you and heading straight for Halycon. Good times. I know that we haven't really played together for a while, and that's a shame. Best of luck, mate. I know that if you ever apply for mod, you'll make a great one.</div><div><br></div><div><img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/c455bb2fc5334546b71cc18e77dcbd1f?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/CatCutie_.html" style="color: #5D5D5D">CatCutie_</a> and <img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c7cd248ddc99e9e5314fb8b0cb2b886a?s=20&amp;default=mm" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/zero9178.html" style="color: Gray">zero9178</a>: My two favourite people on the server (sorry, Sayah!). We've only really started talking in the last few months, but in that time I've really gotten to know you both. I hate that people like Mufasa and Shahmi were mocking you both when neither of them knew you. You are without a shadow of a doubt two of the nicest, funniest and all-around most stand-up people I've ever met. It's a shame that we're from different countries. I'd love to meet you someday. xD</div><div><br></div><div><img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/7fd3b7f737e44c55a214878986207576?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/voidloop.html" style="color: none">voidloop</a>: I only really started talking to you in the last year or so, but in that time I've really gotten to know you.</div><div>You made my last few months really enjoyable and you cheered me up whenever I felt down, and I'm grateful for that.&nbsp;</div><div>You're honestly one of the friendliest people I know, and good luck with whatever you decide to do. Like Lokigh, it's a shame that you never got a trial as junior mod, as I personally believe that you're one of the best people on this server.<br><br><img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/d8af9a92cc854eb091a187669a2136a6?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/Buster_U.html" style="color: none">Buster_U</a>: I've known you for years, but we've only really started talking on Snapchat in the last few months.

Please reveal your face sometime. xDDD</div><div><br></div><div><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/75bbb65651fdf39379295c23e9a242d7?s=20&amp;default=mm" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/resepignev.html" style="color: Gray">resepignev</a>: Despite your disturbing messages, you were always able to make me laugh, and since I became a staff member you really helped me to improve. You were always willing to listen whenever something bothered me, and I'm so grateful. You were the one who gave me tips and advice on moderating, as well as being the one who showed me the ropes when I started. Even up until my retirement, you were giving me advice on how to improve and you took everyone's thoughts into consideration.&nbsp;<b>You</b> are a perfect candidate for senior moderator, both due to your laid-back attitude but also your considerable contributions towards the staff team.<br><br><img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/5a0b55defddb448caf5070856cbf39ee?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/BoldAndBrash.html" style="color: Gray">BoldAndBrash</a>: My fellow Star Wars nerd.

Normally with these kinds of leaving or retire posts, I'm thinking 'aww, sad to see them go' to myself, but not commenting anything.<br>Can't do that this time...<br><br>I've not really known you like most players did, but your way of moderating made me laugh, the good way... I loved the non-seriousness you gave the serious job.<br><br>The example yesterday, where me and Mep were messing around with minecarts, together with the enemy team, made my day. Your reaction, 'This crossteaming does not give any team a disadvantage, oh wait, it does... Because when the enemy team sits in your minecarts, there are less left for your teammates...'<br>This kind of moderating is something I had never seen before, and will probably not see a lot with you leaving.<br><br>I'm sad to see you go, like I said, this is the most shocking one for me so far :(<br>Good luck in life, we'll miss you!<br><br>*Clicks 'Post Reply' and starts crying*

You know, I never understood these kind of posts. If you think you're going to annoy me, I pity you, for that appears to be your only fulfilment in life and it remains unfulfilled. If you are doing it to try and look cool, I pity you, for you are trying to impress those who couldn't care less.&nbsp;<br><br>So, Mr Minecraft pro, which of the above is it? Alternatively, are you just trying to be a pain? If yes, then I once again pity you. I've made a lot of mistakes, and I hope that supporting you being unbanned will not be one of them.<br><br>Have a nice life, and thanks for the experience. :)

You would think by now admins and seniors would open they're fucking eyes with the amount of staff and builders retiring. Do you people not realize that the stuff your doing isn't working out and maybe you should change something. I used to think it was one or two people causing the problem but it's all the admins and seniors ruining the staff team making them retire and basically everyone hate the network. At this point you should shut the server down or make someone else run the server cause the people running it now aren't doing the best job ever. Open your god damn eyes and change something or your gonna lose the server cause this is getting retarded. I was looking forward to getting unbanned and coming back to play with everyone but if things aren't going to change from how they are now there's no point. I agree with everyone retiring trying to get a message to the owners and head of staff but they just can't seem to listen to their peers and make a god damn change. Get off your asses and fix the avicus we used to love and stop making people leave, it's fucking got to a point where you don't deserve to be on top of the server and as much as I don't wanna say it your making me say it. Amen holy shit

I'd rather you didn't start blaming the seniors and admins for my decision to leave. Yes, they were part of my decision, but overall they were a fairly minor reason why I chose to leave when compared to my more personal reasons. Contrary to what is being said, the seniors and admins are making the best of what they have, and in my opinion they're doing a pretty good job. Of course they're not perfect, but people are expecting them to improve without providing helpful insight or advice, and thus they are just as bad.<br><br>Gods, it feels nice being allowed to say something positive about a group I always argued with without being accused of bias or sucking up. xD

There used to be a glitch where people had duplicate ranks, but I think he did buy two diamonds...<br><br><img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/6248019ce74a42a4bf4b9cf1c189a72d?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/Myworld6.html" style="color: Gray">Myworld6</a><br><br>Thanks for being part of the community and moderating for us and everything you've done.
