Hey guys, been awhile eh? How's Avicus doing?<br><br>I just saw the new punishment guidelines and I must say - I'm impressed and happy that a simpler and less vague punishment system was implemented. Also with notes displaying mods to use their common sense in situations such as spleefing and etc.<br><br>So, like I said how are things?

Hi. I was moderator recently, but then I retired. The 2nd tournament just ended and PPB took the win! A couple of website updates came as well.

I'm doing good! Just been inactive in-game, due to playing CS:GO more often, which is the reason to my retirement. I hope all is well with you!

Zin! Things are going great. If you didn't know, Mango and Jozz were admins for a bit, but then they retired on Halloween. MidnightBeats &amp; Pelpelajax were chosen to take their position. Pelp then retired and now Para took his spot. Although all of this happened, we seem to be looking up and making progress.

Hey everyone! I'm doin' just fine! Things are looking good in life, about to go to college next summer and my digital painting skills are increasing!<br><br>@Vobase, Ah. It's a shame... Well atleast we have other people who&nbsp;<i>really&nbsp;</i>deserve their positions. I'll greet the others whenever I can. I might even come back... maybe. I don't know yet but I'm thinking on it.&nbsp;<br><br>Despite how things ended, I never forgot about this lovely server. With more advertisement and new YML syntaxes to make maps OP, things will get a lot better ;)<br><br>How is the staff team running? I hope the new guidelines on the rules will prevent people from finding loopholes to do things that are - common sense wise - wrong?<br><br>Alright, you guys keep doing right, running tight, okay? :)

Hi Zin! That slump that we had in players seems to have gone away! And I'm pretty sure that it happened because we have improved the staff-community relationship. Things are looking up now!
