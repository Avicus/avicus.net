Recording doesn't hit your Graphics card that much, mainly the CPU.

I have this problem as well. When I build my new PC in the next 2-4 weeks, I need a recording software that works. Ima probs get 60-250 fps, and I need a recording software with good quality, and I can get 60+ fps while having 256x textures and max settings.

Those are some bad specs, theres close to no chance for you to record at 60 fps with good quality .-.<br><br>Sorry bro, I know you wont consider doing this until you give up, but the best choice is either get a new PC or to build one .-.

Theres a chance your harddrive can't write with the speed that it would have to for your video to be good.<br><br>When recording are you dropping any frames (look at the OBS window)<br><br>My settings for 1080p:<br>6800kb/s bitrate - CBR ON<br>No scaling just 1920x1080 and 60 FPS<br><br>Just my settings that might or might not work for you.<br><br>The higher the bitrate the better the quality of the video.<br><br>EDIT: Seeing your computer specs, its not really up to date so theres a chance that your computer is just too bad for recording. OBS is one of the lightest if not the lightest screen recording software out there.<br><br>As for other software heres my thoughts: Fraps and Dxtory are both really good and make good quality videos but make big file sizes. People also say it really lowers their FPS but I haven't noticed a huge fall in my FPS and you don't really need more than 60FPS. Camtasia is also pretty nice. I wouldn't recommend Action! because I had a lot of problems with it in the past with audio-video syncing and also just recording audio where it wouldn't record or wouldn't record properly.
