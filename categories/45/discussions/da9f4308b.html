You know how people post things that they spend lots of time on like a map, then some of you say -1 horrible. Well that makes people feel really bad then they don't want to post anything agian. Well please don't say -1 horrible, just say what you liked about it and what should be improved or added. Because the person who posted that may not want to play anymore because they will get mad about it. So please don't say it was horrible -1. And thank you to those who already do.

If you think that a map does not deserve to be accepted, you may say "-1", and then your reasoning for that, as TheMasterCow stated.

When people say -1 they are just expressing their opinion. Its not that they dislike you in any way and you just have&nbsp;to accept that they do not like your map. Most likely other people will have a +1 for you if it bugs you too much

and if they do say -1, they have more time to fix it and make <u>even more </u>people say +1(;
