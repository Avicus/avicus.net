Oh gosh,<br><br>I don't hate you in any way, but I have lost respect for you. I get your occasional jokes, they are funny, some are lame, but most of them are funny. I've seen 2 sides of you, one&nbsp;side I like, one I don't. One side is where you are funny, chill, looking out for others. Your 2nd side is being a total dick, stupid jokes and tryharding&nbsp;for anything. I'm not trying to be hypocritical here but when you are in your "Chill Cabin' you are extremely immature. rude and stupid, which I understand you are allowed to be but it's just quite annoying. Don't private message me about this, I know you probably don't care what I think but whatever.

I know I was always annoying to you, but I still find you are a pretty chill guy. You are extremely funny in your youtube videos and very mature when you moderated. Don't know what else to say really? Have a nice day?

Boy, haven't you developed? I remember the old "sheamus4414", extremely fun to play walls with, extremely fun to talk with. I remember all the times I "MENTORED" you, to get Moderator. When you got senior I felt we spoke less and less each day, and when we did speak it was pretty much...<br><br>Rilo: "HEY CAMMY"<br>Cammy: "Hey RILO"<br><br>Then one of us would probably go AFK. If I was honest I feel you have gotten more immature since 2014 and 2015, but idk, could be wrong because I was gone for quite a bit. When you hang around the "Chill Cabin", I guess you are pretty different, but overall you are a pretty nice guy.

I mean, we never really speak. I don't hate you in anyway, and wouldn't have a reason to. On the forums you are a pretty cool guy, and hopefully, you don't&nbsp;hate me much.

Again, like SamuelJacob9. we have never really spoken. Overall, you are a pretty good player and a good defender. I only really see you in scrims against Celestial and a bit on public.

Alright, here w e go.<br><br>About a year and a half ago we were pretty good friends, we spoke a lot on ts, things were fine. When I came back, I found you annoying and very cocky. I feel you want the attention when all the attention you get is people telling you to 'fuck off'. I find you doing things just for the sake of doing them, without you even noticing how big of an idiot you are. You are also a smartass some of the time, which is quite annoying but that's&nbsp;your way.I also don't get changing your name every month, it's quite stupid, but it's your decision, so do what you like.

A legend. Really mature and nice to hang out with, always having a laugh. Has a good American accent &lt;3 #respect. The only time I hated you was when you always killed me in walls but you are a fucking legend.
