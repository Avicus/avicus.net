So after making a temp leaving thread, I was planning to come back and play here more after the update, which was wonderfully done, apart from the server being full 1.8.&nbsp;<br><br>Ok, 1.8 is garb for PvP and IMO it makes zero sense for a server based around PvP to be 100% 1.8, the update many called "The Death of PvP". As a PvPer, I find this especially frustrating, as usually when you don't have speed, blockhitting is usually a core component of PvP, with that being removed, it takes away a big aspect of PvP. Combos are awful in 1.8, I find it frustrating not being able to combo-lock people that may not be at a certain level of PvP, because I feel when there's a certain skill differential, you should get some benefit out if it. You get next to nothing out of having a skill advantage, basically. Also how PvP in 1.8 is 100% ping/latency and cps pisses me off, and it especially screws up players that are not located in North America.&nbsp;<br>Also, the lag is real.<br><br>Now that I'm done with my mini-rant...&nbsp;<br><br>Farewell all my friends, and I hope you stay well and have fun, but I really can't play on 1.8...I just despise it, regardless of the quality of the update and I can't play on a server on such a version. &nbsp;<br><br>Good luck everyone....&nbsp;<br><br><br>I just hope there's realization that a lot of regulars are leaving because of this and there's a decent amount of opposition against this...and maybe hold off on the 1.8 change. It's not a matter of the players not wanting change (for the most part), It's about the quality and gameplay that comes with 1.8 that people dislike. I'll try the update a bit before 100% leaving though. &nbsp;<br><br>I will be on TS and on the Forums, so you know.<br><br>I will still play scrims and most likely the tourney though. <br><br>I wish you all well, and I apologise for any behaviour that may have been...a bit much. <br><br>I guess this is me really saying goodbye. Signing out, <br><br>-Stimulating/Jackson

:PPP&nbsp;<br><br>If the server switches back to hybrid 1.7/1.8, I'll come back, but at this point I really can't play 1.8, as much as I want to stay with friends and such, I just find the version...yea&nbsp;<br><br>I will still talk with people and stuff, I just won't be on unless the server's at least hybrid, and I mean it.

80% of our player base was on 1.8 as of yesterday - it was time to switch! And it's just a matter of time before all servers are updated to 1.8, so will you quit MC at that point? I wouldn't depend on Mojang to fix issues concerning the minority :P

But why I dislike PvP in 1.8 is because if you get first hit in 1.8, you automatically gain 1/4th of a block's reach, if you don't get the first hit, your reach is much shorter. So if the other person has 2ms or can jitterclick with decent aim it's gg. I get like 30-40ms, but that doesn't mean people won't outreach me with cps or ping. That's why 1.8 PvP IMO is pretty unbalanced and highly favours people with high cps and/or low ping.&nbsp;<br><br>Also, comboing is inconsistent and pretty broken.

To be honest, I've used 1.8 for a whole day now and I can't see a difference, have you even tried 1.8 or are you just talking on facts you've actually just heard? Go on kohi with 1.8, for me I even played better. Just try to get used for it for a day or something and I promiss you won't even feel a difference.

That song symbolizes the troll.&nbsp;<br><br>@Robin: Used it, didn't like it, PvP in 1.8 is worse IMO. Those are facts. It kinda sucked because of lag issues at the time, so my reach was really bad to begin with, and the added range advantage to the other person from first hit just made it worse. My ping is almost normal now, like should be 5-10 lower on most servers, but that barely matters now. The main issue is I still spike a bit. &nbsp;<br><br>It was probably just the reach reduction x2 that really turned me away from 1.8 at the time.&nbsp;<br><br>1.8 can be pretty damn laggy at times tho.<br><br><br>The rick roll is stronk.

WOW I tried 1.8 again and my FPS is a third of what it was with a NVIDIA GEForce 660 Graphics card and AMD Phenom 2 (Black Edition) Processor...not to mention comboing is completely retarded and doesn't work. I even lag in terms of ms more. I'll try Avi 1.8, but rn I loathe 1.8 on 1.8.3 as well.&nbsp;<br><br>WAY more overall lag and awful PvP mechanics&nbsp;<br><br><br>Literally went from Rick Roll to I'm seriously considering quitting
