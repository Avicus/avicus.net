You are a pretty chill guy with bunch of skills in game. You are a nice moderator as well you always take care of people's problems and try to fix them. I haven't really seen u defending but I guess you are good at it.<br><br>I don't really eat Turkish food but I can say that my favorite is doner (actually döner)

Very underrated player. You are supposed to be on better teams. From what I've seen you take care of people's problems and help them. You are an amazing player as well. Ik ur gay and it's not a problem for me as long as u don't 'love' me xd.<br><br>Planning on finishing the school I'm going now and moving back to America. My high school is an American school as well so i think it wouldn't be that hard.

I feel like I can talk to you about anything. You are a nice guy with Aussie accent sometimes I don't understand xd You are funny as well and it's nice to play with u :p<br><br>As a player u have potential as a defender. You usually defend on public if it's ok to defend but I think u should start defending on scrims as well. Your melee is already good, I see that you wanna play as a defender and I think you should keep going on this way<br><br>i luv u too man but not gay u know :1

I live in turkey but Im from the USA<br>I was looking for a name for my alt, while thinking I was bleepling, checked on namemc and it was available. I didn't even know about the guy Mr. Bleeple tho<br>3-4 years from McZone<br>Really nice and polite guy. You were my first friend on apollo. We already knew each other but I was cocky to you and eteh (sorry once again) and ye on apollo we became friends once again I guess. You are great at pvp and imo you are a very valuable player that would benefit any team. Many people like you on this server most probably bcuz ur chill and very approachable. Sad to see you go but I wish I could leave it as well :p good luck in life man
