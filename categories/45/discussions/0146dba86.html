Well as a lot of you know by now ive been banned for auto clicking, cant really do much about a decision made by all the staff but it is what it is but I guess hopefully I can see this great community again someday. ill lurk around on ts and ocn still my skype is muckyman123 if you care to ask me any questions or just wanna talk. I wanna say thank you to everyone who made my experience on avicus the best it could ever be and just keep being awesome. Ive had an amazing 3 years on avicus and I wish it kept going but as all good things must come to an end and I love everyone on this server! I wanna thank the family of cronus, jalapenos, and&nbsp;Team Rocket&nbsp;&nbsp;that helped me get into competitive gameplay and hope you guys do good in T4, Lastly I want to thank a few people who were really good friends throughout the years so thank you Xtra (Sextra) Andrew, Koja, Elemental, Sessp, Micah, Josh, Icy, Patty, and reds. I know I might've missed some people but you all know who you are. I hope avicus continues to be the server it always has been. And lastly I want to say don't let Apollo rule everyone on this server, they all have staff ranks we know and tend to ban people for unreasonable things and also think they rule the server but don't let them rule you stand up for your self no matter what its your life, choose what to do with it. No hate towards Apollo cause some of you were pretty cool guys goodluck in T4 but just lighten up a bit. Goodbye everyone in hopes to see you people in a year or two whenever they decide to let me come back in regards your beautiful mucky I love you all and have fun in the future!

Im sorry to see you go muck. Its been a fun time and I hope you stick around on teamspeak. I think EVERYONE should honor the fact that you took a stand. In these times, in and out of game, its impotant to voice your opinion. No matter anyones opnion, you should honor this. To take a stand for the better is not so easy to do. In the end, it doesnt boil down to who's right and who's wrong. Its for the better of the community, and mucky, you sure made this community a hell of a better one.&nbsp;<br><br>See ya around,<br><br>Koja

I just hope we keep getting on ts and meming around as we always do, have fun wherever your going, but again, don't give up

Ok I respect the fact that your trying not to start a fight, but do you really think we are just the casual part of the server that has no idea what goes on in your team and chats? like please people have seen the real side of your other staff members, it's all being nice on avicus, I wonder what people would do if they saw all the things you guys did...&nbsp;<br>I really hope the other part of the server doesn't get exposed to all the shit you've done, it would start a huge fight, like avicus isn't/wasn't already being ruined by some "people"&nbsp;<br><br><br><br>idk if other staff are pressuring you or you guys just can't stand all the things your doing, what like 4 pple retired in last 2 months?

Rip. ;c I didn't want to do that, honestly. I saw multiple things I didn't like and I asked a few Mods and we had a vote. I'm hoping you're not too mad at me. Hopefully we can still talk &amp; stuff, that was my biggest fear going into this tbh. :(

XD<br><br>I'm truly sorry that this had to be done, but the evidence recorded gave us no choice. I really hope that you don't think this is out of any bias or an unfair decision. The people who banned you are people whom I trust implicitly and know are just doing their job. They don't take any joy in this ban.<br><br>Once again, I'm so sorry that this happened.

Ok...<br><br>1) please provide evidence to show that apollo rule the server<br><br>2) if we rule the server, how come we have had pur fair share of false and correct bans?<br><br>3) if you had any common sense whatsoever you'd know that avicus isnt a fucking dictatorship. although certain people (such as the admins) will have more influence on decisions, &nbsp;most of the staff team is involved in decisions such as these.&nbsp;<br><br>3) you say 'no hate to apollo' but then you go and bash us lol<br><br>4) i doubt 5 people out of 30 is gonna enable us to 'rule' avicus<br><br>5) ya boy sessp is more biased than all of apollo together<br><br>i was gonna he nice to you and wish you good luck on getting unbanned, but since you arent gonna show me respect im not either: i hope you stay banned.<br><br><b>Call him that again and he won't be the only one to be punished.</b>

^^^^ I was one of those people, we've been friends for forever, I hated doing this but I can't tell you that you looked legit. I wish you did but I'm sorry. ;( Also- Apollo didn't really have much to do with your ban, SpookeZ banned you before he retired, he had a vote, yes, but so did many other Moderators, there were 12 votes for yes and 1 no. Apollo was 2 of those votes.

<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Don't discuss it at all. I don't think any of the Apollo members want to get into an argument about this and what's the point in the whole community seeing it? There was no "apollo bias" involved in the ban, it was a legitimate staff vote. Also, as some of the others have already stated, there are only about 5 apollo staff members (in the moderation section) that are involved with punishments. I don't understand the reasoning, why can't apollo players be staff members, what's wrong with it. If they're qualified for the position, then they obviously deserved it. They aren't trying to "rule" the server, they're simply helping the staff team &amp; the community.</span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Going back to the topic of "apollo bias", how do you know this? Are you in the staff team? Do you know everything that happens behind the scenes regarding to how punishments are dealt? If not, then please try not to assume so many things without actual facts to back it up. Incidents like this shouldn't be referred to as apollo bias, since the vote was open to&nbsp;</span><b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">all</b><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;moderation staff.

though it is easy to detect or notice theres many people that look like they auto click from what I could see and the reason I haven't tried to get unbanned is cause theres nothing lost from a 50 player pvp server. why waste my time knowing one of my friends was already banned and has been fighting it for months now but has no luck as the staff ignore us. I was told the seniors would discuss my appeal few days ago yet nothing back or atleast no "we're busy atm will pick it up when we have time". point is why fight a case with staff that basically ignore you for weeks just to deny your appeal after.

a) If they spec'd you from 3rd person it's either you were or weren't, no in between&nbsp;<br><br>b) Clear your rep on other servers? Knowing that you cheated here, players like me will flat out devouch you on servs like OCN because of it. Plus having a rep as a cheater isn't exactly great. Also allows you to play when you want. I don't even play pubs or this serv anymore and still put in the effort to get my ban lifted because I don't want to be known as a leaker when I did jack shit. Just seems like a load od excuses, especially because you were invested in this community.
