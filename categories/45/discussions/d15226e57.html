<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Let’s make this short for the sake of time.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s been an amazing year and a half on this server. I’ve met some amazing people here, and it was truly a wonderful experience. However, this server also wasted more than three months of my life. I screwed up my freshman year, and half of my sophomore year, by spending all my time on here. I’m not about to do the same with my junior year. Schoolwork has been piling up, work has become more demanding than ever, and I need to get my shit together. I’ll be leaving the forums and the server (which I stopped playing on around two weeks ago).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Just some people I’d like to acknowledge for helping me during my time on this network, in chronological order. I know some of the listed players won’t see the messages, but I’d still like to thank them.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Netux (Netuxx)</b> - You probably won’t see this, since you haven’t been on the forums in five months. You were probably my first friend on the server, and you’ve helped me out with technical difficulties regarding Java, Bukkit, and other general problems I might’ve had. Thanks for being an amazing friend.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Little (LMNwashere) </b>- You were also one of the first people I met on the server, and one of the nicest. Thank you for being a great friend.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>sfkwww </b>- You might not have realized it, but you taught me how to rush, and you got me addicted to this server. I still remember those Skype calls we had last summer with Slugbo.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Sean</b> <b>(seanfrogz) </b>- Another one of my first friends on the server. We grew pretty close over Skype.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Carrie (carrie_may) </b>- The first person I met back when I was accepted into my first clan, Fancy Soldiers. Though we didn’t get too close, we still had some great times together in Nebula.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>build_high</b> - We had some great times together in Nebula, and had some really random conversations as well. Sorry for not realizing you were a girl until five months after I met you :3</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Battle (ShipTheBattle) </b>- You were like the most lenient mod I knew. You were one of the only people I recognized a month after joining Avicus, but we became great friends after being in Spamship together. I still remember when you kept calling the entire group in the middle of the night, and I would always answer.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Jozz (AmazeModerating)</b> - You were the nicest person I ever met on the server. You helped me through tough times, and we had late-night Skype calls all throughout the summer (winter for you). Thank you for being one of my best friends on the server.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>99 (Kuznetsov_) </b>- Great friend, also one of the first people I met on Avicus. We were in numerous teams together after that.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Heat (Heatless)</b> - I remember raging at you for your rushing skill, and not leaving any monuments for me. We grew closer over the few months on Skype, after I joined the team you and 99 led (can’t remember the name).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Lunub (Xyphos_) </b>- Eyy, my rushing partner. Those Spamship calls… highlight of my summer. Thanks for being a great friend.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Kat (KatLikesPie) </b>- I think I met you after you were added into the Spamship group. We grew pretty close, then you kinda just disappeared :3</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Jess (FrostedCupcakez) </b>- Yeah, I stalked you for a while. I think you were the one who added me to Spamship(?), and we grew closer over the course of a year. I still remember your ruthless dares back in September in the ToD chat. Thanks for being an amazing friend.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Para (Tanpopo) </b>- You earned my respect a couple of months after I joined the community, after seeing your incredible hard work. I still remember you trolling me in Nebula as a mod a few months back :3</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Evo (Darkiur_) </b>- Met you on Quintus. You were also one of the nicest people I met on this server, and you helped me out a ton with map building. In fact, you were the one who motivated me to keep making maps. Thanks for being a great friend.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>BALLZI </b>- You’re like the horniest twelve-year-old I’ve ever seen. You were also part of Spamship, and I think I met you there, after joining the group. I still remember those 1v1s we did.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Michael (Newcleus)</b> - I remember when you first helped me get rid of a piece of malware on my computer. A while later, I accused you of DDoSing me. I’m sorry about that. You still accepted me as a person, even after all the stuff that happened.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Andrew (MasterProX) </b>- I have no idea how we became friends. I think we met a few months ago after I was accepted into TGC, and we shared a common interest in instrumental music. Thanks for being a great friend.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>JJ (Enflaming) </b>- We met in the interviewee chat back in January. You discovered that I lived close, and we became friends after that. Thanks for being a great friend.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Spencer (pavilion99) </b>- Though I didn’t really get to know you well, you assisted me a lot on Skype with programming. Thanks for all your help.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Everyone in BerzerkV2 and the Mapdev team </b>- You guys are all amazing people. I can’t thank you enough, for helping me through tough times, for cheering me up, and just for being great friends.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If I forgot you when I shouldn’t have, I’m sorry. If you were one of those people who I thought were my friends, but trash-talked about me behind my back (you and I both know who you are), I left you out on purpose.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sorry for my bad grammar in this post; I didn’t have much time to write it. I’ll stay on Skype, but will most likely get a new account soon. I’ll still check my old one a few times a year. Peace.</span></p>
