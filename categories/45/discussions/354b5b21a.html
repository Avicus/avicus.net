You have to look at very good players. Spectate good players when they're on. Learn how to strafe first into other techniques and keep building. Don't try to copy someone else's style, you form your own. I find the best PvPers are the ones who generally don't go for crits cuz when they do it makes it easy for the other person to strafe your hit, I punish people immediately if they try to crit me, I just strafe the hit and go behind them leaving them wide open to kill with a combo. From DGB you can take away how to combo and semicircle strafe. From Tino you get counter strafes, semi circle strafes and how to really lock someone in a combo. Learn all you can but I'm not giving away my PvP secrets :3. Or my combos. Check me out in game on a good day to see if you can catch me crit-dodging, strafing. My style isn't average, it's mainly taking huge advantages of mistakes and openings that people make which makes it really hard for me to play against Tino in specific because he counter-strafes so well there's virtually no mistakes or opportunies to capitalize on. I'm not going to give away everything now :P.

PvP guides are poor attempts of mediocore or worse PvPers trying to get attention.There is no real guide for any game with a skill cap, all you gotta do is know the game, have experience on it, and have good equipment for gaming, but a truly skilled player will do good even with the shittiest laptop you give him, all he or she will need is about one day to get used to it. TL;DR: <b>Don't</b>.

When someone's facing you, block-hit, crit, and move to one side. Then, if their aim gets off you or you're getting low on health, sprint forward, shift in mid-air, and get a good knockback hit on them. After that, sprint towards them, moving more quickly to the side you previously chose, and strafe them.&nbsp;<br>Using this, you're trading hits in the beginning, then you're finishing them off. I try to use it as much as possible :3

Np. Last thing: if you look at 5:03 I do make a very subtle fake strafe that looks like nothing when you first see it but look at it again, it's kinda hard to see but I move slightly towards his side at the very start then switch directions twice more. The very starting movement threw his aim off with the fake strafe and made it way easier to beat him there. Fake strafes can throw your opponent off a lot and can be make or break, use them. Also, switch it up, don't always use fake strafes if you use them. Make yourself unpredictable. Someone who does something effective repetitively will have someone find a way to counter this stratagey. If you're unpredictable it makes you harder to play against as you have more things they would need to learn to counter to beat you than just one.

Its almost embarrasing to see you mouthing off about how good you are at pvp when you couldn't beat someone with no arms. You have your OP computer yet your aim still looks like you move your mouse with your face.
