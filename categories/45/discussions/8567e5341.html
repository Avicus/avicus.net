Could someone please explain this?<br><br>People wanted skywars, it's added, and no one plays it.<br><br>People wanted walls back, it's added, no one plays it.<br><br>The Renisance Update promised more advertising, and from what the layman can see none has been done.<br><br>These are just a few things I just don't understand. Could someone please explain?

A lack of advertising answers all of these questions.<br>With little to no promotion being done, it results in no player increases.<br><br>Also, more and more of the core community (long time community members)&nbsp;are either leaving or becoming a lot less active. This doesn't help the existing numbers.

the issue with walls and skywars is that you can't join midgame. avicuz doesn't really have the playerbase to support more than one or two skywars/walls games running at once, so if you happen to want to play midgame you've got to wait, which is hella boring. same goes if you die midgame, then you've got to wait out the rest of the game before playing again. on hypixel on the other hand, they've got plenty of players to the point where if you join skywars you can instantly find a new game the second you join or die in the middle of one.

Apparently the admins are in charge of advertisement now, kord might have said something like that in discord

Piez, Cord and Posighdun were practically the only ones who even attempted to advertise...<br><br>Guess out of the 3 who's still on the staff team &lt;.&lt;

Taking those^ two posts into consideration AND the fact that the only active owner of the server doesn't give a dusty fuck, but instead argues about 1.7, 1.8, 1.9 and is too busy 'punishing' people for making fun of his fatass then yeah, I don't think avicus has potential
