Stay safe, but I'm sorry that these aren't anything for turkey. 1000 people die everyday ONLY at traffic. We face terror twice a month. President is fucking the country with his autistic laws.

I hope everything is ok in Portugal! I remember the struggle Japan went through after the big earthquake and tsunami a couple years back but the Japanese managed to get through it and I am sure Portugal will get through it too!
