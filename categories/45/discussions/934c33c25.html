Obviously, you can see i care about avicus alot and alot of the players are leaving. half of them just think the server is bad, and the other have life stuff or are raging. The point is, people are leaving about 3 a day and the forum is filled with posts like "leaving" and "Quitting". I am just asking how can i and some others help get a higher player count? I just dont want to see the server go down when, when you join and everybody is socializing, and many friendships would be ruined. I just want to healp<br><br>sincerely<br><br>Rattle

Don't allow players to make "goodbye" threads tbh that's unnecessary if you are quitting let only your good friends know!

That's not what he's saying at all. He's referring to real advertising, like voting or spreading the word about the server on the minecraft forums, etc.

Cluttering up the forums is annoying, especially with threads like that. I would hate to see 20 of those on the front page. Number one is also kind of annoying, just having 60 accounts sitting there doing nothing. 4 and 5 are good.

In my opinion it would be smarter to keep the player-base rather than getting new ones. At least in the start, and slowly adjusting it to welcome new players in an better way. I'm sure avicus is losing more players now then they are earning, so ye :/

I agree with Lasuz. I think before we look at getting new players, we need to fix the bugs and bring in new stuff that people actually want are willing to come back tomorrow for those rewards, then work on expanding the player count.

Well i mean<br><br>literally for as far back as probably about 2 years ago<br><br>people have said 'its more important to keep old players than to get new ones'<br><br>but where has that got the server?<br><br>nothing worth playing for has come out since the implementation of badges which many people didnt find fun grinding for<br><br>old players are leaving because tbh minecraft is a near dead game, pvp wise anyway. The updates have made pvp trash and its just not fun to play anymore<br><br>people move onto other games that offer new experiences&nbsp;<br><br>personally i havent been on for a while so i dont knownwhat the current sitstuion is but for a long time, like seriously long, there were no new maps, gamemodes,anything&nbsp;<br><br>ik this is minecraft and these comparisons are wayyyyy different to avicus' situation, but if you havent notcied, people love change, thats a large part of the reason that certain (retarded) decisions happened recently in the real world. People were bored of the same old same old<br><br><br>but honestly who's gonna want to come to a server and play where it has like 20-50 people on max? You might aswell go play badlion or uhc even if avicus does offer a different meta than theyre used to<br><br>gl avicus but i dont see this around at the end of the summer<br><br>please prove me wrong

No. Last time people begged for SG, it was implemented but&nbsp;<i>never&nbsp;</i>played. We need to focus on the 2 game modes we have right now, Nebula and Nexus.

Timezones? I'm sure Pie's promotion is something everybody was happy about, considering how much he taught the staff team and showed us leadership skills. Crazy would've been great, too, don't get me wrong, I'm just&nbsp;saying that Pie's promotion was very well deserved.

Don't allow players to make "goodbye" threads tbh that's unnecessary if you are quitting let only your good friends know!

Bit hard if you've quit the server; how would you let them know? Some&nbsp;ex-players such as myself only check the forums occasionally so you can leave them a message if you make one.

Keenan has made is pretty clear that Prestiges aren't coming back. (Although I think he might be willing to at some point, if the servers gets to the point where there's 10 people on at max.)&nbsp;<br>So some suggestions could be:<br><br>-Find a new money system. Credits honestly suck. They are pointless to try to get, and even if you were trying to get them, what are you going to buy? A badge that isn't all that amazing, a morph that you can only use in the hub, where no one is for more then 2 minutes... A sound effect, that doesn't really do anything for you, and costs a lot of Credits. None of these are even close to spending 7 hours grinding to try to get. Find something that's worth it.<br><br>-A leveling system that can be infinite. I'm not sure if this is possible, but from what I understand the reason Prestiges were removed was because it was too hard to update to keep up with how fast people were leveling up. If there's a way to make it infinite, then this wouldn't be a problem, and this could be possible to bring back.<br><br>-Keep. Your. Promises. Please.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*In the past few months there have been a few different things that have been "Yes, we will add *insert thing &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;here* and it never happens.

There's a way, I know it. Make people somehow interested. - Call a youtuber like SSundee in or someone, or a more PVP style youtuber like DjTasty.
