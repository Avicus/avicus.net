I would like an intro and an outro, a logo would be cool too, I'll add you in Skype later so you can have the template.

The title makes it sound like you're hiding in an alleyway and as I pass by you're all: "Hey! Need editing? C'mere!"&nbsp;<br>Anyways onto topic...Sounds cool! I'd use your service if it weren't for the fact I dislike asking others for assistance even if it is a service, and that I don't make any videos :3
