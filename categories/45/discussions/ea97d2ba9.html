What are the creepiest lyrics you have found in a song/track? Any genre counts but try to keep it PG-13. I personally find Neilio - Obsession to be rather creepy; it builds up and then says scary lyrics at the end. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t4YehXR7TM">Song</a><br><br><i>Hey it's me</i><br><i>So I had a dream about us again last night</i><br><i>This time we were standing by the ocean and watching the sunset</i><br><i>Your hair and your dress gently flowed in the wind</i><br><i>[x2]</i><br><br><i>You looked as beautiful as ever</i><br><i>We sat down and watched the sun slowly disappear beyond the endless horizon</i><br><i>As the glow gradually faded away</i><br><i>We had each other for warmth</i><br><br><i>With your head on my shoulder</i><br><i>And my arm around you</i><br><i>I assure you that you would always be safe with me</i><br><i>We thought about our past and our future together</i><br><i>The kind that I never experienced before you came along</i><br><br><i>We thought about our past and our future together</i><br><i>I thought about how lucky I was to have you in my life</i><br><i>You brought me so much joy, love, happiness</i><br><i>You then try to break free from the the restraints</i><br><i>The muffled sound of your sweet voice through the duct tape was probably</i><br><i>An "I love you", I love you too</i><br><i>always and forever&nbsp;<br></i>

Spooky, scary skeletons<br>
Send shivers down your spine<br>
Shrieking skulls will shock your soul<br>
Seal your doom tonight<br>
<br>
Spooky, scary skeletons<br>
Speak with such a screech<br>
You'll shake and shudder in surprise<br>
When you hear these zombies shriek<br>
<br>
We're so sorry, skeletons<br>
You're so misunderstood<br>
You only want to socialize<br>
But I don't think we should<br>
<br>
'Cause spooky, scary skeletons<br>
Shout startling shrilly screams<br>
They'll sneak from their sarcophagus<br>
And just won't leave you be<br>
<br>
Spirits supernatural<br>
Are shy, what's all the fuss?<br>
But bags of bones seem so unsafe<br>
It's semi-serious<br>
<br>
Spooky, scary skeletons<br>
Are silly all the same<br>
They'll smile and scrabble slowly by<br>
And drive you so insane<br>
<br>
Sticks and stones will break your bones<br>
They seldom let you snooze<br>
Spooky, scary skeletons<br>
Will wake you with a boo!<br><br>:)<br><span><br><br></span>
