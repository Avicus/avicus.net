Will it be nerfed or removed in future updates? Because I strafe alot and when someone beats/ kills me by blockhitting I have a go at them for having no skill ;-; (Sorry if I have done this to you.. I rage too much. Trying to sort myself out.) So, do you recommend I start blockhitting and fit it in with my style of PvP?

It will most likely not be removed... if you're strafing it will slow you down

Yes, but it provides good knockback so I can combo/ strafe easier.

I would only block hit if someone comes to close to you so you can start a combo or continue to strafe

Like zero said, I recommend block hitting only when someone approaches you, and then begin strafing and/or using any other technique. Also, use this in tunnels and enclosed spaces where you cannot strafe. Block hitting excessively only slows you down and is less beneficial.<br><br>If used correctly, block hitting is actually extremely OP and I highly recommend you try out new things with it.<br><br>As to its "nerfing" in 1.8, its animation was changed slightly and I do think that not all hits are registered simply due to the blocking revamp, but overall it is not terribly changed and you can still pretty much block hit.<br>But 1.8 pales in comparison to 1.7 in terms of PvP experience and stability, so I suggest just sticking to 1.7 anyhow unless you really want 1.8.

Block hitting as been removed in 1.8.<br>However, many servers are still supporting 1.7 servers (which makes sense because 1.8 is quite new) <br>Because the servers are still in 1.7, block hitting is still enabled.<br>It wont be until the Avicus sever fully and only supports 1.8 is when we'll see block hitting get fully removed. Unfortunately, that will take a while.

Snow, blocking hitting has not been removed.

Wtf is wrong with block hitting? I strafe seldomly but block hitting is OP. If some tells you there is a easy path and you take the hard path would you do it? This is an example of what you are doing. I have no obligations agianst normal hitting but just let it go. Block hitting is just too OP. SO USE IT... These threads are just useless..

Alot of people do it, when they're in trouble, so anyone says "they haven't done it" is lies.&nbsp;<br><br>Block hitting, is great when you actually do it well. Some people think block hitting is were you press your right and left clicks at the same time, however many good pvpers have develop this skill, into a next level. It is called "Hybrid Block-hitting"&nbsp;<br><br>Many people say it were you hit - block hit - hit - block-hit, however that is away to make knock back. That is not the real way. Hybrid consist of pressing right click , then clicking left, that's the real way.

I'm pretty sure they removed block hitting in 1.8<br><br>It is (In my opinion) really annoying, and at times can be overpowered in a sense and really annoying. But it's a method to survive and kill, and you can't prevent people from doing it.
