<b>To a lot of people, this kind of thread may be weird.But I don't want to have to leave the community to say thanks, some of you may feel the same way. So my idea for this thread is to make a list of people you want to thank in the community and if you ever need to thank more people you can edit your post!</b><br><b>I'll start:</b><br><br><b>Cyanide:</b> I was lucky to have met someone like you. You're like my online brother and I bet a lot of us can say that about you. We need more people like you in this world, and I want to thank you SO MUCH for everything you have helped me with. I know that you will always be there for me, online or not. I want you to know that I would do the same for you. I could write paragraphs on you but I am going to keep this short! Keep doing what you are doing because you are helping so many people.<br><br><b>Harry</b><b>:</b> Where can I start, you are an enjoyable person to be around and I didn't expect to connect with someone like you. I have had some great times with you on TS and I am looking forward to having some more. I know that you can be a bit immature at times, but everyone is at some point. You're a great kid and I love having you as my sidekick!<br><br><b>Eric:</b> You and Lokigh were the first people I ever talked to in TS. That was a big moment for me and I will never forget it. How I was talking to Lokigh for like 10 minutes then you finally realized that your mic was muted, little did I know this was the start of a friendship I would have with you. I was so happy when you asked me to make a map with you and I WENT CRAZY in skype when I found out it was accpeted (You can confirm!). I look forward to spending more time with you and just remember "tunnel snakes rule".<br><br><b>Snow:</b> My fellow Aussie! I have had some great laughs with you, at you, etc. And somehow my bad jokes make you laugh! I love being in TS with you and having some casual banter because you know it is all in good fun. You are a great person and a great mod! I can't wait to bring you to events with me (remember the joke we made xD) and I look forward to the future and getting to know you more.<br><br><b>Sesspee:</b> The better half of the leaders in Cronus. I love having some great banter with you about Snow, we seem to connect in a different way. I feel like we connect on a more professional level, I guess that's why we made a team together! I like coming to you all the time because I can't organise stuff myself (scrims, etc.). I can't wait until Cronus plays in our first tournament I look forward to experiencing that with you and the rest of the team!<br><br><b>Jozz:</b> I haven't talked to you a lot compared to others but you still seem to help me out a lot. There is just something about you that is liked by everyone. Probably because you know how to MUZZ! You seem to be really chilled and relaxed and I hope one day I can meet you IRL (maybe if I go to Pax Aus). I would be really surprised if anyone had something against you and I think it will always stay that way.<br><br><b>Porky:</b> Even though it is rare that I can actually talk to you on TS I feel like you and me have a connection. I don't know if it's that both of us do YouTube or if it's our personalities but something is there. Our channels have been growing together and I love to see that. You are a great person in general and I know I can also come to you if I have a problem. I would love maybe doing a video together in the future!&nbsp;<br><br><b>Petlas:</b> Probably the only girl I have actually had a conversation with on Avicus TS. You are a nice person and a nice mod. I hate to say it but when I am on TS with you, Snow, etc. I can actually see that Snowlas could be a thing. You will deny it but you both seem to connect. But I am no love expert so I will stop!!! Just keep being a great mod and a great person in general!&nbsp;<br><br><b>Grape:&nbsp;</b>Like Porky, I don't get to talk to you much on TS but when I do, or even listen to you, you always seem to put a smile on my face. You have a great personality and your screams are the best to listen to! Keep being you and I hope that we can talk more soon!<br><br><b>Laggeh:&nbsp;</b>You PvPg0d. I love when we are on team speak and get to talk/play together. You make me look bad, mainly because I am, but you also have a great personality. Keep working on your YouTube because I know once you have your commentary set, you will go FAR.<br><br><b>The Cronus Team:&nbsp;</b>You are all an AMAZING bunch of people. I am so happy to have all of you in the team and I think that this team has potential. We all seem to mix well and I love that about us.<br><br><b>There is SO MANY more people I want to thank but I will gradually add them!</b><br><br><b>Now it's your turn to thank people...</b>

I'm going to keep mine very short for now and just expand it slowly.<br><br><b>Peachy:</b> Peachy and I never really talked much till about a month ago. I look up to him as an admin, but also as a friend. He is a great person and very nice dude. Has a really good sense of humor too. I look up to peachy a lot and have a lot of respect for him.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Cole:&nbsp;</b>Cole and I used to be really close till I broke away from him when my life went down in a spiral a lot. I started talking to cole a lot again in the last month and we've become pretty close again. He is someone I can always talk to about my problems and is always willing to listen to me and help me out. Cole is a really funny dude and one of the nicest most understanding guys I've met. I look up to him a lot as he is simply just an outstanding human.<br><br><b>Britney:&nbsp;</b>Britney and I have also just recently started getting closer, but britney is just there for me. She is a really nice person and is always willing to help me. She is really fun to play games with and a funny person too. I've definitely shared a lot of laughs with her and she is an overall amazing person.

<b>Tynvale:&nbsp;</b>Where can I start! I haven't known you for long, but in that short time, I've really enjoyed the time we have spent together. You are such a good role model to me, the way you act, how mature you are and how nice you are. You are a great leader of team Cronus, keep it up. Also the biggest fanboy over me q:D<br><br><b>EricV4:&nbsp;</b>Eric you squeaker, I love you so much. We talk a lot on teamspeak and Skype, and I want to keep on talking to you.

I'll add more when I think of more<br><br>_Cyanide: Ever since I met him the first time after testing one of his maps we just kept talking on skype and got to be really good friends like we are today. He's a really cool guy who can be serious when he needs to and funny when he needs to. He's helped me through some really tough times, including just yesterday, he'll know what I'm talking about, but yeah, he's really awesome and can't imagine him ever not being my friend anymore.<br><br>MLGPorkyFanGirl: Oh god where do I start? Ever since I first message him about staff apps we'very just become some of the best of friends in almost all ways, he helped me through some tough times as well. He's a really awesome guy and was a really awesome moderator and hope once things get cleared up in the staff team, he returns.<br><br>Newcleus: Honestly the funniest guy I've ever met, he plays the best songs on teamspeak andcan always make me laugh, even when I'm down and I can respect that about him. Even with how funny he is, I still think &nbsp;there's a little bit of maturity left in him :3<br><br>FIyHacks: One of the coolest guys I've met on teamspeak, although we didn't talk much, we're cool and I respect him alot especially for his legit ninja bridging skills x3<br><br>NuclearDucky/Excellence:Probably my one and only friend still remaining from Mczone lol. Me and him/her had some of the greatest times on elimination and I somehow still remember that. He/her was the coolest guy I knew back then, thanks for being awesome &lt;3

I've never made anything like this but I'll say some shit about my friends<br><br>Phyre: Although he rages alot and occasionally acts like a 2 year old &lt;33 (said with love) he's a super nice and funny guy who's really fun to play with.<br><br>Ques: One of my first really good friends on Avicus, always a funny and friendly person. I was sad when he left but now he is back with a vengance and that kinda turns me on.<br><br>Dynamo: Honestly, dynamo is an amazing guy. He's made some mistakes, just like everyone else, but he is probably the most chill, welcoming, friendly, (you name it) guy I've met on the internet.
