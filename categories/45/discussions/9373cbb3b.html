I realize hat this may have been done before...Buuut. I'm curious.&nbsp;<br><br>I play: <br>Clarinet (4 years)&nbsp;<br>Ocarina (2 years but never bothered to play it after first getting it until recently) Also It's a 6 hole sweet potato if you're curious.&nbsp;<br>Harmonica (6 months only played once)<br>Recorder (1 year, barely played it)<br><br>Wondering if anyone knows how to play a piano, because that must be the coolest thing to know how to play! Violins are cool too.
