Hey guys I am here with a new topic. Today I want to talk about an Avicus application, this is just an idea what came up in my head so please give feedback!! I can understand that its hard to make but still, would it not be awesome if we had an Avicus application (for Android and IOS). So all of the mobile website users can just click on the application, logg in and do, what they want to do. One thing that I would love to have in the app. Is a pop-up notification for your subscriptions and your own posts.<br>If you guys think this is a good idea or not please give me feedback!<br><br>Beyrdo (Budah)

Well, if you have an iPhone or an Apple product, you could just log into the forums from Safari. Otherwise, if you're on an Android, you can just go on Google and log into the forums.<br><br>I disagree with you for now unless you show up some good ideas for the app.<br>Also, about the pop-up thingy, there is already an alert in the forums, not really an alert but for example, if someone wrote something in your post, a number 1 and so on pops-up in the "My Discussions" section.<br><br>If you can add more info, I can give more feedback but that's all I can say for now.

I was just talking to Ivy/Kylo about this a while ago. It might be integrated later into development. We will have to see what the future brings :]

You mean like if you're somewhere else with internet but no computer, so we can inform ourselves about the server and what's going on more quick?<br>If this is faster, I'll agree with you, forget the forum/Safari/Apple/Android counter.<br>:P

I have an android device, and what I do is just go on the forums, click settings (for my browser), and "create bookmark".<br>This just makes a link directly to the forums, and it appears on my screen where I put all of my apps.<br>This, to me, is basically the same thing as an app. :)

Would be more of a possibility if the community were much larger. Getting apps onto the app store is a pain too.

Only if there is a larger community present, I think that having an Avicus app would be considered. Getting an Apple dev account is pretty expensive, so I think that would be one of the more major deciding factors on the implementation of said idea.
