<span><b></b>Hey guys! I was thinking that all of the best players on avicus have a 1v1 tourney so we can find out who is the best pvper in avicus. I am not asking for the players to sign up on this thread, but if enough people agree with this I will make a separate thread and I will host the tourney.<br><br>say +1 if you think this is a good idea and -1 if you think it is a bad idea.<br><br>4/5</span>

There is no best pvper. No matter how much you do a tourney there is going to be one problem to let 1 player win.

1v1 has a very specific environment, meaning that there is nothing just 2 players, no objective. But if you want to find the best "pvper" you have to look at how people behave in a normal for example nebula environment (map,objective,team) ;)

So let's say it was Hattowolf vs Apache, and hatto was getting lag spikes, and was unable to hit people at all, so does that mean apache is a better pvper because he beat hatto?

How does this prove your point? If people actually try to pot pvp, it gets you better. I started hcf kit on badlion, and honestly, I've gotten so much better than i used to be. If people actually take the time to get better at pvp by pots, then they may be actually half decent. I've been doing raw pvp on badlion for quite a while, and as of now do i have a high elo on uhc, and iron, it hasn't helped me at all in any pvp aspect.

I never said that practice was a tournament. I said that if people took the time to practice pot, they might actually be good at general pvp. Pot pvp helps by improving your health bar awareness, your debuffing skills, your hunger bar awareness, your sword pvp skill, your buff awareness and your surroundings. Raw probably somewhat helps in two categories
