I'm sure the Avicus Community knows I have a new skype account,which is princezzdubby. NOT riannaplaysmc, I had zaid skype that account because it's been online. The outcome of that was that my riannaplaysmc account got hacked by someone. Now if this account says anything bad towards anyone, please inform me! It's not me, I have a new account considering my old one has been hacked and that "hacker" is still on it. Please, please, please inform me if you get any information from this account. My new one is princezzdubby, for further information contact me through that account. I just wanted Avicus aware of this so called "hacker." Thanks guys!

No I haven't, It said my recovery email is wrong and I honestly have no possible way to get into my account with out re-hacking what they hacked. Like I said I don't know what they are capable of doing to the contacts, or worse hacking more people..

They basically set a recovery email for you because the got your password wrong, the password reset thingy came to their email and then all they did was change your password and email, it is easy but effective! just email skype to remove the account!
