I don't know where to get help anymore. My parents think I'm full of crap, because I always get bullied and I've already gotten 1 teacher removed from school for being abusive. My maths teacher today put me into tears. And I don't know who to speak to anymore.<br><br>I get picked by a student who sits by me, making fun of my size, and my emotional sensitivity. And my teacher tells me off for speaking. The student does it again and I tell him to stop. And then I get told off and I was told "one more time and I'm sending you out of this class". The student does it again. "That's it, get your book and your bag, and stand outside". And then that's when my class laughs at me, yells at me to get out, and I get humuliated. He takes my water bottle and puts it by the door. And I'm in tears already, trying to explain and he is trying to get me out. Everyone is calling me a baby, telling me to get out. And the reason I'm reluctant to get out is because I'm scared someone from the leadership team will see me, and I get into serious trouble, or worse he calls my mother, then I get into serious trouble and probably everything I have taken from me for a year. Then 5 minutes later, my teacher picks up the classroom phone, and sends the head of behavior. I ask for a tissue as my face is full of tears and I needed to blow my nose. As you know your nose gets drippy when you get upset. He gets the tissues, and puts it outside ON THE FLOOR. Like he wants me to stand up and get out just so I can blow my nose. It's horrible. My face was a mess. He thought I wanted sympathy. I didn't. He wouldn't listen. Then the Head of Behavior came and picked me up. He didn't do anything as he knows I'm not a bad person. But the rage I have with my maths teacher, is undefinable. I even told the teacher. "I DESPISE YOU AS A TEACHER" and everyone goes "OOOOOOH"<br><br>My dad never takes my side. I told him I wouldn't prefer to speak to him about what happened. And he thinks I'm treating him with disrespect, besides, if I told him anyway. He'd shout at me saying "everything the teacher does is right, you're doing this because you care about yourself, and is unsatisfied with him". He grabbed my shirt and yelled at me.<br><br>What do I do anymore. Do you guys ever had a teacher that humuliated you?

It's a really bad situation. I don't really know how to handle this certain situation, but I guess try to handle it with staff higher, if you're able to record it all I guess that would help to prove ur point for staff higher than ur teacher.

If the teacher actually thought that you were causing the trouble and that you were just being a pussy about it then it's not too unreasonable, it's harsh but not unnaceptable.

Do the following instantly:<br><br><b>1)</b> Contact the highest school authority (school studies director, general director, etc) and tell him the situation<br><br><b>2) </b>Put your parents into the game, they will sure defend you and fight for you. If your school is really going to fuck you up that way while being aware of it just send it to crap and go to another one.<br><br><b>3)</b> If 2 didn't end the chain yet, make sure whoever you contacted takes a severe decision (don't go like "yeah we'd like if you stopped being slightly rude..." but "Hey. (explain shortly and efficiently your situation, don't go into many many many detail) If you don't take a decision whether that be fire the teacher or severly warn him, or whatever you may wish to get this problem solved, we're going out of here. Bye."<br><br><b>4)</b> If nothing happens go back to 2 and do the last sentence ("If your school is really going to fuck you up that way while being aware of it just send it to crap and go to another one.")<br><br>Hope this helps you, bullying is not a joke, and thus you shouldn't cope on with it but end it immediately.

Do what javi&nbsp;said. If you can't do that due to reasons then that's just bad. Although you can probably get them to 'stop' they probably won't actually stop. Just don't let them properly get to you. I've been bullied before and although it is bad, you'll get out of it. Focus on the hopeful future and getting there rather than being &nbsp;stuck in the bullying.&nbsp;<br>gl man =)

im sorry but imo what others said isn't true<br>i used to get bullied in my last school and I would always get picked up as well. Just do not give any fucks. If u are stronger than the kid that annoys you take him in the break, hold him on the shirt so he can't move and tell him that if he does that one more time you will beat him. I mean, just scare him, better to do when his friends/other bullies are around too so they see, but don't actually beat him unless you have to, reminding, it's only in the situation you're stronger than him. If you're not and the teacher tells you to go out of class, right before you exit, don't cry, just say fuck off and the bully's name. Also teachers hate when they tell u to stop talking and u say it wasn't you,csgo literally shit up until the lessons finishes and in the break show the kid what you got. Sorry but in my opinions bully people are not nice and telling them nicely to stop won't get u anywhere, therefore follow step 1 if it helps, if not, do step 2. I wish you luck&lt;3.

If you really want to get out of this, listen to my words, young fella o/<br><br>If that teacher were to start bullying you again, don't even bother asking her for permission to get out of the class, just do it; even if she tells you to comeback. Right after that, try to get to your "higher-ups" inmediately and claim you've been bullied by her all this time.&nbsp;<br><br>I'm pretty sure they'll help you but they might ask for evidence as well. That's where you tell them you don't have any but since you're &nbsp;good student, apparently, tell'em you literally escaped from your class cause you were fed-up by her, you couldn't handle it anymore.<br><br>I'm 100% sure he'll trust on you and will either talk with her about the issue (Which will probably stop) or simply fire her.

If you really want to get out of this, listen to my words, young fella o/<br><br>If that teacher were to start bullying you again, don't even bother asking her for permission to get out of the class, just do it; even if she tells you to comeback. Right after that, try to get to your "higher-ups" inmediately and claim you've been bullied by her all this time.&nbsp;<br><br>I'm pretty sure they'll help you but they might ask for evidence as well.

First of all, Why the fuck do you let it get to you? Do you get beat up? If not, ignore it. Ignore it, they will get annoyed and move on. Teachers? Do they purposely give you bad grades? If not, give 0 fucks, just keep up with education. If she doesn't help you, your parents understand that you will need help with homework. If not, search online, same thing.&nbsp;<br>If you're not getting physically hurt, JUST STOP RESPONDING. I've been told some shit... and honestly, it still hurts. They only pick on you just because they don't have any power over anyone. They want you to be below them.&nbsp;<br>Best of luck! &lt;3<br>If you still feel down, take a look at Africa. Do you honestly think they even have good schools? Do you know what they need to do to get simple water or food? You get it, be happy. And you're still down? Listen to some music. To calm yourself down, listen to some emotional songs, then to something <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcyYFKeOT0o" rel="nofollow" title="Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcyYFKeOT0o">like this</a>.&nbsp;<br><br>Hope this helps &lt;3<br><br>EDIT: Now again, if it a severe situation like someone said before me (Forgot who xD) then yeah, follow their steps.

Perhaps you could talk to one of the other teachers? If you can't, if it happens again stick your hand up (assuming that's how you ask for the teacher's attention,) and ask them firmly if you could relocate yourself in the classroom.

Kick him in the nuts, and if the teacher isn't a guy, threaten to call the cops on him. He can get his license taken away easily. As for the bully, punch him in the face. He sounds like a real bitch.

From what I've been reading your parents aren't much help and the environment you live in is unhealthy for your growing up.<br><br>I'd suggest that as BmB suggested, ...be more assertive. Stop taking so much crap from everyone and don't let your emotions show through. If you've tried enough and the adults around you aren't much help as others have said, contact administrators.<br><br>Also, consider a guidance counselor and a social worker to work with your parents and have some one to talk to.<br><br>If that asshole ever puts his hands on you or tries to take your stuff, I see that as fair game to deck the living crap out of him. He is invading your space and constantly provoking you. If he tries to sue or press charges, just know that he was the one that started everything and that your parents and teachers let it linger.<br><br>Honestly, I'm ashamed of your parents. If this was my child... *Growls* It is their duty to protect you, I cannot believe this.<br><br>Just stand up for yourself more often, get stronger, stick to yourself if everyone is hostile towards you. (Of course do your school work as well and just stick to yourself)<br><br>If you've tried to talk to your parents about this already then try giving them the cold shoulder treatment (As in say "Hi" "Love you" "Bye" etc. Nothing more nothing less). This will perhaps get them to try to approach&nbsp;<i>you&nbsp;</i>and you guys can try to solve the problem. <br><br>Together, as a family.<br>----------------------------------------<br><br>The top part of this whole thing suggests that you call higher-ups. Not suggested as it will possibly lead to more problems.<br><br>The bottom part suggests that you handle things yourself and be more assertive. It's slower, yes. But it builds character, will lead to less devastating results and you will get better at handling situations like these in the future.<br><br>I'm glad if any of this helped you.

My friend had a similar problem a few years ago around your age. He brought a small recording device to school and kept it on throughout the day. That way he had all the proof he needed to file a complaint. You might like to try this :]<br><br>Also, as for dealing with the actual bullies, well... I was also bullied quite a bit as a kid, much younger than you when I was around 10. I told my parents of course, they complained to the school but nothing really happened. Right now barely anyone bullies me and it's almost impossible for them to offend me. This is for a few reasons.<br><br>&nbsp;First off, don't show them how you feel, bullies enjoy hurting people because it makes them feel better when they see someone in pain. So if &nbsp;you don't show them pain, they won't be so interested in doing it. Also, don't take these things personally. If you do, you're much more likely to get upset about it. Try shrug these things off. I understand that that's a hard thing to do and it can take time, but try your best to learn to ignore them. Or you could g&nbsp;or give them a comeback that makes them want to stop. For example if someone says something bad about you, agree to it, they'll have no idea how to reply to that :P<br><br>&nbsp;In the long run, all of this should pass in a few years anyway but I hope this helps :)<br><br>Good luck!
