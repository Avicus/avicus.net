so i've been to the waterpark a while ago and checking all the slides which will i go first. i chose their signature slide which is called "the twin cobra" and i decided to try it because of its extreme loops that make some people dizzy. so i try it and what happened is i really didn't expect it to happen to me. when i splashed already in the water, i can't move my legs and i was just swinging my arms that it feels like i'm in a deep water. i didn't realized i was unconscious. it's a good thing the lifeguard pulled me and i suddenly rose up and just walk out from the ladder and i was coughing because there's still water inside me. i'm still lucky that i was still able to get up and not ending up remaining unconscious.

This is just like that time you "got in a car crash" I highly doubt this actually happened to you. I'm sorry but anything you say automatically is bs in my mind. You can't blame me either because you have blatantly lied to this community 3 times to get attention.

Glad i am not the only cynical one here. But D00Z is right. This post seems another ridiculous attempt of grabbing attention. Its hard to take anything seriously that you say since you have lied before. Its like the boy who cried wolf, trust is a very important thing and if i were you i would work on regaining the communities trust. &nbsp;However if you are not lying  then i am truly sorry about what has happened to you. Drowning has always been something that disturbs me.

ok no objections too. so you think everything i say was a lie and tell me how do i get attention? explain to me as in how?! i'm so tired of you telling me "you're getting attention" tbh. i also have a life too you know. i dont want to start a flame war here and you basically think that i'm lying. if you'll comment to my post about negativity against me, just say it in your head rather than hurting the person more even though you're being honest. just please stop commenting things like these if you have nothing nice to say and you're being BS too.

I*<br><br>Also, I can state my opinion if I choose. You are getting attention by making a post that everybody can see, you are trying to get sympathy from everybody in this community. When you had a friend make that post about you getting in a car crash it had over 10 pages of "omg I'm so sorry or you!!!1!1!" And " get better Carrie &lt;3", then after people proved that you were a fake you came out and admitted it. If it were up to me you should have been punished for that.

Something like this happened to me when I rose my first roller coaster.<br><br>Badically I didn't know what I was getting myself into. I was in line for Apollos Chariot at Bucsh gardens. I got on the ride, and we were going up. I sudden got this weird feeling as I looked down (bad idea). As we were going down, my insides were all trying to come up. The only that held them down was all the air coming into me, which I almost passed out because of. The whole time after that, I was crying, except nothing came out because of all the air. When I got off, I was in so much shock that my whole body was shaking. I litterally was about to faint. I didn't ride another single ride the rest of the 7 hours we were there (this was a school trip).<br><br>And from that day on, I have sworn never to ride Apollos Chariot again.

Being at a waterpark doesn't prove you almost drowned on a slide. You still could easily of made the story up. And given your track record, I'm still very suspicious.
