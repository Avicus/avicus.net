I've seen a lot of threads being locked because of this:<br><i></i><br><br><br><i>Attention seeking status updates are prohibited. The Avicus Network 
forum is not designed to be a social network to keep others up to date 
with what is going on in your personal or online life, but rather an 
environment where all users are involved in discussions that pertain to 
larger and more relatable topics.</i><br><br>Posting prestige threads IS ATTENTION SEEKING, people do it for people to say gratz for them, it's also basically saying what's going on their online life.

I agree with the majority of that, and it is quite spammy when people make threads saying that they got prestige 4 (for example).<br><br>However, perhaps prestige 5 threads could still be made, because that is a great milestone.

Hopefully you purposely left out 4....<br><br>personally, I don't see what wrong with them. If you don't want to look at a thread don't click it, it's not like there is hundreds of threading for people to look at. Personally I'm not a fan of them either but I really don't give a shit about them being there.

Forum games is something that anyone can get into and don't die off so they are not useless. Congratulating someone for a higher rank will die off and crowd the forums for a while. So there is no real reason for having them

As TNT stated above, "Ask me Anything" threads have a category that's dedicated to them. AMA threads also don't give updates on a personal life as such.

Well, to be honest I don't see the problem with leaving or prestige threads. Leaving threads are so that people know that you're leaving and that you won't be online. It's different if the person is only leaving for a few days or weeks. With prestige/birthday threads, the players are expressing their happiness. If you don't care for the thread, don't click or post on it. This isn't directed at TNT, or any <b>specific&nbsp;</b>person&nbsp;.Just my 2 cents..

Getting Prestige on a Gamemode is showing that you got an achievement, and I think those threads should stay. Also with leaving threads, I don't see the point why those should be banned? Its not like it is Spamming the whole community, Nor It is a good Idea to show where you will be gone.<br>Prestige Threads should stay.

Although I have done one myself, I now sort of regret that I did it.&nbsp;<br>In my opinion, only prestige five should be allowed to showcase on the forums. Every other prestige should just be a big game event, not enough for a forum post.&nbsp;<br>Since there are very few people with prestige five in any gamemode, while there are hundreds with prestige 1-4, there's really no point saying you got prestige 1-4.

I think threads for prestige 1 &amp; 5 should be kept. Prestige 1 is your first stepping stone. While prestige 2-4 are just in between 1 &amp; 5. Prestige 5 is a long-term goal that should have a post if wanted. Overall, I think prestige 1 &amp; 5 you should be able to make a post, but prestige 2-4 you shouldn't.

Prestige threads are completely useless and only serve to draw attention to the person that prestiged. Sorry, but it's true.&nbsp;I'm not against people being happy about prestiging, but you can celebrate in game, or on Skype instead of making a topic about it. They just clutter up the forums.

People may be proud of what they got, ans stuff like that, but we don't need to know it now if we are going to find out later when we play with them. Here's the thing about threads. One starts by one person, more start doing it, and then it just keeps happening.

Dear doozie ,<br><br>about 20 mins ago u banned me.<br>i am here to appeal. I understand I was using caps and called a player a hacker. But you warned me twice then just randomly banned me for 1 week. &nbsp;If part of the ban were the warns and kicks from peachy, there was still no point to unban me. I abused /report ONCE and I reported a hacker who hit me 9 blocks away from me. I am not trying to be rude but if u can plz unban me that would be great summer is almost over and when I get unbanned that's my last week of it.&nbsp;<br><br>Thanks, cyrus_zide

Email support@avicus.net to appeal. There isn't a place to do it on the forums even though there should be. Also, with 3 pages of infractions you should be happy you weren't perm banned. Good luck with the appeal though.

Who actually gives a shit, if you don't want to see it don't click it and if you accidentally click it all you have to do is go back to the discussion, it wastes about 5 secs of your lyf which is nothing compared to the amount of time some of you addicts spend on Avicus.

Some people care (I don't care for prestige threads) and it's useful to know if a friend is leave e.g. Cedd got around 100 replies in his leaving post. Prestige threads are kinda meh though, I really don't care for them.

Taking away prestige threads because its annoying is like saying minecraft annoying so we should get rid of it. &nbsp;If it bugs you then simply ignore it. You may think of it as getting attention but for them it could mean boosting their self esteem that for all we know could be low. &nbsp;You shouldn't take rights away so it pleases you.

Ok look. To all those people saying that "ohhh if prestiege is deleted, its the end of the world and stuff" stop. Look i understand. It is an achievement for you personally and oyu would want to post it on the forums. I dont mind if you post a 1st prestiege and 5th prestiege because those are really important. However, it is a bit spammy that people make a thread that's saying "ohh i got a 2nd prestiege yayayyayay" then "ohhh i got another prestiege! 3rd prestiege!!!! yayayyay" and so on. IT is annoying isn't it? If your not conviced, let me put it this way. It's like oyur on instagram where You gotta post something jajajaj and you end up spamming. Just because it's an achievement, doesn't mean you have to blabber it all out in the forums for EVERY SINGLE PRESTIEGE. (1 and 5th prestiege is okay)

+1 I really don't like seeing those posts. But I think we can make an exception for milestones like the first prestige in Nexus or what not (Im aware its already been done) And I think that when people are leaving permanantly that's okay but they may only post one thread. If they leave then come back then decide to leave again I don't need to see another thread.

Prestiges are one of the main reasons why players come back to Avicus, they are an actual goal that you have to reach, and it is both fun and competitive between players. If prestiges are removed, I'm sure that Avicus will lose a lot of players. If they are removed, there is no goal, and we would just be playing the games without something to look forward to. Removing prestiges is a terrible idea, in my opinion.

So, I've kinda ignored this thread for a while. I really don't know why, but I feel it's time to make my mark on this.<br><br>I'm more in favor of staying in the middle of this, specifically just allowing Prestige 1 - 5 threads. Prestige 2 - 4 threads can go take a hike for all I care. But, as someone said before, Prestige 1 is a huge "stepping stone" into the Avicus community (especially for anyone that isn't a regular on TS or Skype, like myself). Not only that, but after the hours upon hours spent working towards that goal (or eight months in my case), it feels like a huge gratification to finally hit that point, at least for me, because I sure as all heck didn't spend twenty-four hours camping on Quintus (which still wouldn't get you Prestige anyways, unless you're a donor).<br><br>Also, I really, <b>really</b> doubt that <i>absolutely <b>no one</b></i> cares about prestige threads at all. You say it like it's fact, but I'm fairly sure that, while maybe 50% or more may not care about them, there will always be a minority that differs, and finds threads like that fun. It's not like the forums need a little more humor anyways, because all I tend to see nowadays are Map Submissions, Suggestions, the occasional game thread, and some discussion threads over irl events.

Sorry for bump, but since temp leaving threads are now banned, I want more of a discussion.

k.<br><br>I still believe that prestige 2,3, and 4 threads should be banned, but 1 and 5 are fine, because they ARE a huge milestone.<br><br>And since I don't see many prestige threads anymore, i don't see a reason for it to have a sub-topic. I think that it should be placed as a little addition for when you are making a post.<br><br>For example:<br><br>blahblahblahblahblah<br><br>side note: I got prestige 5 today :D

All prestige threads should be banned.<br><br>They are just spam on the community preventing the attention toward more important, problem solving topics.
