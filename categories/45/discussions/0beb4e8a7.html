<b><i></i></b><i></i><u>I know people have made a lot of apology threads latly but I think this is very needed both to make myself not feeling guilt and someone might want to hear it.<br></u><br>So... Where to start. First of I would like to say I'm really sorry for my actions the past weeks. I have been acting immature and rude to a lot of players. I didn't really realize this until MLGTino first came up with his apology a week ago or so, but at the time I thought it would look bad if I just out of no where would come with an apology right after his.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Staff</b><br>To be honest, I've never really enjoyed the staff from the start, I was never pleased with them and I always found the&nbsp;negative side I what they did. That kind of blocked out all of the positivte things they did. I see how hard a lot of people work and what really made me re-think is how much job Fluenza/Jozz put into this server. And ofcourse we got school and stuff like that. But in the day we live in today a lot of teenagers get depressed, just like me. Im not the happiest person ever, that's probably the reason I also went into my rude personality.<br><br>I've also brought up stupid and unnecessary topics. Started bad flamewars and so on. And in my opinion no one should act like this. The way I act I basically one of the many reasons this world will never be a good place. And I think we should all try to be a better human.<br><br>Big apologies too:<br>MLGPorky for accusing you of scamming.<br>Pizza334 for calling you blind and other stupid things.<br>JuanoMC for being rude, saying you take no kb and so on.<br>Calwhovian for, well I don't know if you realized it but I was kind of against you.<br><br>Well... That's basically it I guess...<br><br>I'm sorry for my behavior.

Personally, I'm against all of these threats, I don't think it looks good for Avicus when all of forums, is filled with apology threads (a week ago).<br><br>But, it is brave to do it, apology accepted

Yes you are right, this post would be up weeks ago but with the fact that Tino and some other guy recently posted a apology post I thought I would wait.

You seem like a really down to earth guy for admitting something like that, and I am very grateful you did that. Thanks for this!

When I met you on OCN, I knew you were an awesome indivudial. Sure, you made some mistakes, but don't we all? Put aside what happened, you're still that awesome all round indivudial, some one worth your time &lt;3.

Eyyy m8. You're still a friend of mine and it looks like you have realized some of your past mistakes and moved on, but in team chat and talking to each-other over Skype you've been really cool and humorous. So accepted, we have all been there m8

I agree with you, as I also disagree with you. I do think you should think before you act, as I also think you should <i>never</i> let anyone push/run you down (whatever you would like to call it), as easy as that. I do think this is an issue staff is closing their eyes to, no offense now, but it shouldn't go so far so <i>we</i> need to apologize because we do something when we are treated wrong by others. <br><br>You know I support you anytime, anyday, as you are my closest friend here :)
