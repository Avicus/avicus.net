So I don't know if a thread has already been made that's like this but whatever. The point is one person will take the diamond from the person above. This is how it works<br><br>Joe: I put the diamond in a chest and surround it in lava<br><br>Bob: I use fire resistance and open the chest and take the diamond and hide the diamond 256 blocks in the air covered in obsidian covers with regen walls.<br><br><br>So I'll start.&nbsp;<br><br>I take the diamond put it in the chest and splash the chest with a invis potion.<br><br>(it doesn't have to seem real use your imagination on how to get the diamond)

Ask Mojang to put diamonds back in the game :3 Become a developer at mojang. I put one diamond back in the game. I then kill all of Mojang, so there are only two diamonds left (the one I have and the one in the alternate universe.) I then take the diamond I have and wait until the next probe is about to be sent to mars, and then put it inside just before the probe is flung out into space.
