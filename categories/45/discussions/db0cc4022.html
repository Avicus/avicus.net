I'm interested in seeing how experienced some of us are with instrumental music. If you do play an instrument, share it here! Feel free to say stuff like how long you've been playing, your favorite composition/composer, artist, or anything else.<br><br>Personally, I've been playing the cello for seven years, and my favorite classical cello pieces would have to be the Bach Cello Suites.
