Ummm, Ive always done it, and always in "off topic" for a reason. I did it with my old channel as well and this one. And nobody has ever said anything.

Nice video, but like harry said, non avicus related content (unless the community was involved) is not allowed. I've pointed this out on other threads before (evwn on a mods thread), it ended up getting taken down.

Again, nobody has ever pointed this out...<br>My puppy video no mod/player has ever said that.<br>I did not know that the community hated this so much. I will just never post anymore.<br>Thanks

Sorry, let me be more specific, non related videos&nbsp;<b>are allowed</b> as long as they are not from&nbsp;<b>any other server</b>.<br>Your puppy video would be allowed, just not this video
