<u></u>This is basically a rant page where I state ^^^.<br><br><b>When A Person Calls Someone They Don't Know A "Kid."<br></b><b></b>Honestly, every time I see this happen, I always think of the person calling the other person a kid the real kid. Ok...that sounded weird.&nbsp;<br><br>Example:<br>Bob: dum kid<br>Me: ^ The real kid....<br><br><b>People Think Saying No Offense Won't Hurt People's Feelings.<br></b>This bothers me A LOT. Most of the time its just some jerk who is always angry.&nbsp;<br><br>Thats it for today.<br><br><b>People Who Think Swearing Makes Them "Cool."<br></b><b></b>I dont even need to explain this....I mean, so many people think if they say the f word &amp; the n word in every sentence, theyre "cool."

Omg, yes! I hate it when people say things like "Who is this kid?" I find it ridiculous because they have no idea how old they are. I don't normally say anything though, to stay calm.

When someone is being immature, I sometimes call them "son" or "child" just due to me viewing them like that. I have no idea how old they are but they seem to be in the age group that classifies as a child. If they get humiliated by that, which they seem to do, they deserve it. I'd never call someone "child" or something if they own me in a fight or something of the nature, only when someone is breaking the rules.

Say for instance you tell a joke, a swear word will instantly make it more funny due to the psychological fact that you're not meant to say it; and that's what people like :) (not a good thing, just human nature)
