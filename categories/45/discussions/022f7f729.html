Hi People!<br><br>Is it possible to see if he/she got a critical hit?<br>Maybe a texture pack?<br>Or a modification?

Yes, yes it is! You can see those particles without mods or texture packs.<br>You can see it in default.<br>You can also see sharpness particles, and you can make them more visible with texture packs ;)

If you use damage indicators and turn off the health bar, whenever you get Criticals it will say the word in red with an ! Mark at the end<br>EDIT- I don't know if this is allowed

Yes, they do. You can only get critical hits while your jumping, but, you must be falling down whilst hitting the player, remember that, you can't get Criticals when your hitting them while jumping and going up, the Criticals come when your going in the downward motion, this tactic is very well used and is efficient

Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it not allowed in any way to use a mod, texture pack or anything else that gives you an advantage over your opponent?

That is correct.<br><br>But having a texture pack that makes the particles, of whatever you're altering, bigger isn't considered an advantage. It's makes much less of an impact as something like 'low fire' which is completely legal.

Is it possible to change how particles are shown when you are attacking normal and when you are doing a critical hit? If it is possible, I think it is an advantages.

Almost all PvP oriented packs make critical hit particles and sharpness particles more visible. They also introduce things like a bow meter, custom GUI, clear underwater, and low fire.<br><br>Check here for some cool packs:&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://avicus.net/forums/12c295abc">http://avicus.net/forums/12c295abc</a>

Huahwi's 64x Defscape edit does add Critical AND Sharpness particle to be seen pretty well :)
