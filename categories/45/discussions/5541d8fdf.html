I think it's time for me to say sorry to all those people I've harassed among the past YEAR. I did somehow mean those comments in some weird way but that's not how I sound irl, at all, so I'd sincerely like to apologize to whoever I spread my toxicity to. Ya'll don't get how much I've thought about all the friends I lost due to this and I'm completely ashamed about myself now, that's why, I'd also like to ask for one last chance to all those people I've been a dick to, ya'll know who you are. I don't know where all this salt came from but I do know my personality in game changed ever since I got demoted so please, think about it. That's all from me, pce.

I've always had the feeling that you were hostile towards me, for some reason - but it's good to see that you realise it!

I see the salt and rudeness but never to me. I mean, I troll a bit online, but it doesn't mean I'm like that in real life. Way to apologize though.
