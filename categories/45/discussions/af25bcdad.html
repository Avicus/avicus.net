This is mainly a discussion about which youtubers are overrated at pvp.<br><br>I think BajanCanadian is exceptionally overrated. He couldn't fight at all if he didn't have BSM.&nbsp;<br><br>I can't think of anymore.

Pretty much all of the Youtubers aren't as good as most PVP'ers. &nbsp;The thing about it is that most people that die to them just want to be in the video. &nbsp;I'm not saying they're bad, I'm just saying that a lot of people are far better than them.

Not really. It's really sad to see fans call Antvenom and Bajan to be the king at pvp.&nbsp;<br>Like, come on, they're no more than average.&nbsp;<br>CaptainSparklez isn't overrated. He even admitted that he's bad. xD&nbsp;<br>While Antvenom is just posting videos about him destroying every single SG match and acting superior among everyone.&nbsp;<br>Bajan's kind of better because he at least posts losing videos, but he is overrated as well.

The thing that bothers me about Bajan, is that he's so cocky, and thinks he's better than everyone. And whenever he dies he makes up some bullshiz excuse, like he's trying to save face. I bet that's one of the reasons he doesn't play on OCN or Avicus or other PvP servers, because he'd get shrek'd by everyone.

I've just read through bajans comments and everyone is saying he's king of the hunger games. Bajan wouldn't stand a chance on mssg because there's no magic muttation pass. People like graser and huahwi and all the other small but good hunger games players would wreck BajanCanadian ez. Put bajan against leap_ or Matsuzen or Jehovahs_Witness and bajan would get ez pzd.

TBNRfrags is surprisingly good. I mean I fought him on a server and he had a ridiculously op kit and 3 shouted me if I didn't soup and he had like 12ms as well as no ncp on him and the server had ridiculous ncp.&nbsp;<br>I fought ASFjerome, TBNR, deadlox, goldsolace and Baj. ASF and Baj did nothing to me, gold and dead were rubbish, just straight up hit with no strafe or anything. TBNR was the only one who gave me a challenge. I'll find the vids of me fighting them.<br>Most of the FTP crew are good, I have fought them numerous times. Quite a lot of Spanish youtubers are good too.
