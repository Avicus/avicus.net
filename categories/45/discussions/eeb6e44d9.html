I usually vote everyday or if I vote at like 7:00, I will wait one day then vote the next day really early like 5:00... Recently I have been voting and realizing, it is not actually counting my vote or establishing it on the website... Why doesn't Avicus have a voting reward system... something good like tokens for kits or bonus exp for 5 hours or something like that..? Can anyone help or see my ideas as a good ones?

I believe that if you vote, you will be given an EXP kit wherein you can choose which game mode that you want this EXP to go to. Though, I'm not quite sure if it is gone already.

Yeah, it's broken. You used to be able to get 30xp for voting.

Lol that video. That's what I feel like doing when a time out. Anyway, I remember when there were voting packages. 30 xp per vote. I remember it stopped working, but I never really investigated. I think it's better that the xp can only be earned by playing, not just voting. But I guess 30 xp isn't really that much.
