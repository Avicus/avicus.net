My girl, elimination, I never seen her for a year.<br><br>Alright in all honesty that was the game that got me hooked on Mczone, I always played that game. But now that it's "gone" I can't play it anymore. And I think that a lot of other people want to play it aswell. I don't want it to die and I have a BUTT load of suggestions about the game but it's just way too much to list here. <br><br>Can you guys think of some ideas to add on the game for a better experience?

HELL YEAH SOMEONE AGREES WITH MEEE AGHHH 1111!!!111!!1111&nbsp;<br><br>But seriously i agree with this thread massively and para's suggestion is great. I think you should turn it into a more hardcore HG with soups and this is my idea. To stick to the theme of Hunger Games, why not everytime you get a kill you earn a "Sponsor Point". You are given an item similar to the Nebula shop however it is full of HG style items. These could be pickaxes, swords, bows, arrows, food, lava, water etc... Each item costs a certain amount of "Sponsor Points" and they would add a bit of variety to the game, stop those annoying campers because they will want to get kills for "Sponsor Points". In my opinion, this would make gameplay so much more interesting and enjoyable.

I feel like we should have an event where all the XP you gain on Elimination would be multiplied by, say, 2 or 3? Something like a<i><b> </b></i><b><i>Double/Triple XP Event</i></b><i></i>? It would (hopefully) attract people to play Elimination, and after the event the popularity of the minigame should be boosted. Just an idea though, not sure if the XP thing would be fair since donators would get MASSIVE amounts of XP.<b><i><b></b></i></b>

I think mix SG with HG would be cool. Like have abandon city and players have to gather supplies in that city. And specs can sponscer players with What BMB said.

Hunger games. The one thing that they lack are hunger games and factions. I don't think that they will ever add these games, but i think that they should sometime. I didn't really like elimination but i know some people were really good at it. I don't really want elimination back to avicus but i know u want it back so if enough people want i think they will bring it back. I will say that it would be nice to have it back, but it would bring a lot of lag.

MarkColtsfan [I hope the IGN is right this time ;(] had a really nice suggestion. The topic kinda trailed off the front page of the forums and was never really implemented.<br><br>But it was really awesome. If someone can find it I'll give you a scooby snack

Most of my xp is from Elimination, I always played it and I'm almost 2nd prestige on it. Elimination is my best minigame and I'm sad to see it "gone". Hopefully they don't remove it or else I will be really mad. Hours and hours of work for nothing. Peachy would be pretty mad too as he he is 5th prestige lol. Anyways we needto bring back Elimination because on previous Avicus when it was Sunday it was so full that I couldn't even find a game to play. Anyways please bring back Elimination and don't remove it. If you look at my xp wheel 3/4 of my distribution is Elimination lol. I also really liked MC Zone's HG I found it more fun than Elim because there would be less "Orc's" =_= but Elimination is good because you can have like over 20 kits lol. Anyways BRING BACK ELIMINATION.
