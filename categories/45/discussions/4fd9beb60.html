I hope you'll win.<br>And now to the server, If you win please don't fly up in the air and forget Avicus. If you win please make Videos about Avicus, we'll thank you for that very well.

If Gibbo doesn't believe in Mustard's cause, then so be it. Any member of the community should be able to express and contribute their thoughts to the topics on the forums, whether they be positive or negative--this case being the latter. Respect his opinion, and the same will be done in turn.

I read your profile already.<br>How did you know that I'm kid? Do you know how old I am? Maybe I'm 14? or I'm 21? Who knows. And btw being a kid is nothing bad, you can enjoy the life, you don't have to think about money and adult things. I'm not tring to bring up a flamewar, I want to stop it. And how the hell you think, I'm thinking you are a evil national socialist? Do you even know what they did? Do you know? I'm german, I know what this mean! That is not okay! You don't know how it feels if the half of the world thinks you are an nazi just because you come from germany. I already made this experience! And I grow up, if you ask my friends, my teachers, my parents, they will say I'm further than all of my classmates. Think of that! JUST THINK OF THAT. Actually this makes me really really sad.

At no point did I call everybody a kid. If you are seriously upset by any mention of nazis you should really get off the internet or deal with it and grow up. I was not rude at any point in this thread, it's really just how you view it though, I guess that says a lot about you.

They follow you because you are a mod, for some reason on Avicus that automaticaly makes you right 100% of the time. They don't even need to know you, they blindly follow what you say, without even listening to my side of the argument.

The internet isn't an excuse to be rude. The average person in the uk spends more time on the Internet per day than they do sleeping (8hours). So no, one does not simply remove themselves from the Internet.

Ok, everyone...<br><br>I have cleaned up this thread, and a warning to everyone; especially the players involved with the argument:<br><br>Negative comments are not allowed on threads which attempt to shed light onto their future.&nbsp;<br>Gibbo, this is mainly directed at you; as your comments are extremely disrespectful. I know it's not quite a flame war, however you have the intention in being rude towards the community. *(Not just this thread FYI)*. Therefore, I have come to a decision to forum ban you temporarily. Good luck on your entry, Mustard :)
