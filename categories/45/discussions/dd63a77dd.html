one third of it to charity, one third to friends and family, one third for me buying hella cool stuff<br><br>that's about&nbsp;3,333,333 each..<br><br>Edit:<br><br>Nah that's boring. I'd buy a huge house. Just a giant house. I'd invite all of my friends to live there. It'd have giant, themed pool. Probably Star Trek. There'd be super cool rooms, you could go on the roof and chill, it'd be like a five star hotel. But a house.<br><br>I would give the rest to my parents and friends.&nbsp;<br><h1><br></h1><h1><br></h1>
