Now, when I play on Avicus, I see on the chat that a lot of people accuse others of hacking, just because they got killed by them. Even I have done this, which is probably why I've just been banned for 2 months. However, this is very annoying to the person who killed them.&nbsp;<br><br>There are many different types of hacking, and this is how you can spot if they are:<br><br><b>1. Watching.</b> If a person is being accused of hacking, what you can do is /tp (name) to them, if you are spectating the match. This isn't my job as a normal user although I have before. Then, if they are hacking, you can report them. This is a more efficient way of finding out because in the middle of PvP you may mistake it for something else.<br><br><b>2. Attacking.&nbsp;</b>Another thing to do is to sneak up on the supposed hacker and start hitting them loads. Then, see at first if they don't die after the required number of hits (normally 4 or 5 in leather armor with an iron sword, 6 or 7 with Iron Armor.) This might be ForceField hacks or Invinsible hacks. Also try and see if they float around you at incredible speed - this is Fly hacks.&nbsp;<br><br><b>3. Testing.&nbsp;</b>Try a few different things with them and see if they can do it when they're not supposed to - for example, hiding behind a wall and see if they can still shoot you with an arrow. This will either be lag or X-ray hacks. I'm just saying this because I find it really annoying that people accuse others of hacking - it's stupid and pointless. Use the tips above to actually properly see if they are hacking, because it does annoy me when people chat spam about it. Thank you.

hmm. This seems ok. People call me a hacker just for being too good and they don't hit me cause they are too slow. They get very pissed off.

Please don't talk to me. You were insulting me over skype, so just stop. If you have an issue with me, bring it up with one of the staff members, but please leave me alone. You're just bringing this to the forums for attention, and it's really annoying.

Alright. Porky, why don't you show everyone what I told you on skype? Because first of all... I never even sent you anything on skype, so I would love to know what I said to you about Skype. Second of all.. You are calling Zeus, TheMasterCow, MLGTino, Steven, and Remy people with a brain of 0? Wow, you are absolutely stupid. You were hacking and end of. &nbsp;You can't be a Porky then suddenly become a Tino. The evidence the staff members have is enough. You are damn lucky to even have a temp ban, as this was your 2nd time hacking. Stop acting as the victim and accept it. This will not get you anywhere. If you really want to get unbanned then just appeal. I used to like you Porky, but now I lost all the respect for you.

First of all, I did not say that they have 0 brains. I'm saying that if someone were to hack one time, get banned, and then appeal to get unbanned hacks again, they have 0 brains, because they should have learned their lesson in the first place.&nbsp;<b>Read more carefully</b>. Secondly, I saw the evidence, and it doesn't even look like a hack. Third of all, I am not acting like a victim, because I was not hacking. If I did hack, I would tell everyone, because it would be obvious. I'm not trying to be rude to you, I'm just telling you my opinion. If you think I hack, I can't stop you from thinking that.<br><br>But please, there is no need to be rude.<br>"<b>Wow, you are absolutely stupid"</b>. I am trying to keep my temper calm and have a normal conversation, but you are just attacking me and insulting me. Please stop, because I don't want to talk to you anymore.<br><br>You got what you wanted, so just stop, it's annoying.
