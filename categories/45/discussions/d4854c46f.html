Why did Avicus change its name from MCZone to Avicus?<br>Just curious as I wasn't around when this change happened. <br>It seems to be brought up a lot in discussions.

MC Zone had lots of issues, it was starting to lose its momentum, from what I remember, Nexus and Sky Wars went down to 0 players near the end.<br><br>The staff team was terribly organized and the ranks were unbalanced, we needed to revamp.

I remember that in Mc Zone &nbsp;I saw only 1 admin in all the months I played there! One single "Admin" rank. I srated playing Nebula there when I change to 1.5.2 version and all starts lagging. Months later I saw the server description changed and I enter. Was Avicus Full renovated, Nebula don't lag and Skywars went down. In Avicus I can see the staff organized. I think is a change of face and was for a good reason. :)
