Watched a scary movie and I can't get any sleep because of it. If you guys want to know the movie I watched it's "The Fourth Kind". An alien movie that was "supposedly" true. They had like real life video recordings but it's just really edited. They made it look like someone was being levitated and controlled by the alien with distorted and demonic which is also creepy. Also hate the last fucking part because at the end the alien says "I AM......... GOD". Throughout the movie the alien was disguised as a Barn Owl and at exactly 3:33 it abducts a human. Ik it's silly but this is like the first scary movie in like 4 years I've watched so...<br><br><br>Any tips? (Look up " The Fourth Kind Video Footage for creepy stuff holy moly)

Just remember that it's all fake.<br>These movies thrive off trying to make something fake look real.<br><br>Once you get your head around the fact that it's all not real then you should be sweet.<br><br>If you really&nbsp;<b>are</b> having a hard time sleeping, read a book for 20 minutes before bed, <br>keep your phone or any other electronics away and drink a glass of warm milk. <br>This will help you brain realise that it's time to sleep and it'll help your body relax.<br><br>If it's a matter over the mind sort of thing then get a night light for a bit until you feel comfortable with going to sleep again. <br>There's no shame in it and it'll help you mentally.<br><br>Hope this helps :)

Alright, considering the fact that my book that I'm reading rn is apart of a alien apocalypse, not going to help. It's also the only book I have :(<br>But thanks! Don't wanna wake my parents up by getting milk so that's also a bummer but thanks for the suggestion!

Yea, try not reading anything that'll fuel the fear.<br>If you have anything else in your room that's quite engaging that isn't an electronic an doesn't have aliens in it, it'll be much better than what you're doing at the moment.

Try staying awake &nbsp;. without using any electronic devices. It's actually proven you'll fall asleep faster than trying to fall asleep on purpose. Welcome to logic folks.&nbsp;<br><br>But seriously try it , i do it sometimes it genuinely&nbsp;does work :P

This tip works well for me.<br><br>If I didn't see it, I wouldn't worry about it. It's true, if you never saw that movie you wouldn't be worrying about it.<br><br>Another tip is speaking to someone about your worries if this is reoccurring.<br><br>My last tip would be getting off electronics 1hr before bed and drinking warm milk before sleep.<br><br>Good luck!
