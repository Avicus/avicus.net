I don't think any people on Avicus follow the sport cricket, but I do and recently one of my favourite players was hit in the head by the cricket ball and was in a coma and failed to regain consciousness and died in the Sydney hospital... He was only 25 and was going to play for the Australian national team in 10 days.. His fate was 3 days shy of his birthday... I just want this post to be a little tribute and hopefully you can think of him.. As A cricket fan I was crying when I heard the news and I can't imagine what it must be like for his family. At least his death was doing something he loved..<br><br>R.I.P Philip Hughes...

This is a freak accident that will hopefully never happen again. I am sure cricket will come back and learn from such an accident. Rest in peace, Phillip.
