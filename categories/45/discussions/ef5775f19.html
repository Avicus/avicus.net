I heard about this game&nbsp;somewhere else, and I thought it would be fun to post it here! Anyway, here's how this game&nbsp;works...<br><br>I'll post a wish of mine (for this example I'll use <i>"I wish I had more money"</i>), then the next person to reply&nbsp;has to say something along the lines of <i>"Wish granted, but all the money you received was counterfeit and you got arrested"</i>. In the same post (underneath their response) that person will post another wish, and the game continues. <br><br>You may make them as ridiculous and humorous as you want, but please keep all wishes and responses appropriate.&nbsp;I hope that kind of makes sense, so to start it off I'll post one:<br><br><b>I wish I had more time to sleep.</b>
