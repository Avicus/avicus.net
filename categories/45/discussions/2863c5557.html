Yes this is quite late, but im really curious about what you guys have to think about this, What do you guys think happened to the Malaysia plane that went missing awhile ago, I personally think it went in the Bermuda Triangle. Excited to see what you guys have to say!

People just got quiet about it, and although no one is certain of it the minister and the airline staff declared the whole triputation to be dead, now, from what I heard the last signals the plane sent indicated that the plane had turned around and flew off course down south and was crossing the sea below Australia, far out in the middle of the ocean, so far away it is unlikely anyone would've been able to 'swim' back to shore or survive the shipwreck, I heard some wild conspiracy theories that I still have very present about a man on board that had split a patent with a very wealthy, powerful family of bankers called the Rotchschild &nbsp;who supposedly paid the airline and government to make the plane disappear or even get rid of everyone on board with him altogether

Listen, Listen, Listen, I think they are alive. Just cause they suddenly went "off radar" in the middle of the ocean, doesn't mean the plane stopped working. they could be on an unknown island. They could be kidnapped by terrorist and be somewhere in Asia far from the course it was going. There are thousands of theories of where they could have gone. I have thousands of theories/ways they could possibly be found. Now I think they are alive. I never give up that easy.

Most likely they might've crashed into the ocean and I do not think they would be alive because there was fuel for like 12 hours. It is very sad for those on the plane. I feel really bad for all the passengers' relatives in shock.

Probably something happened on board that let to it crashing, maybe the cabin pressure ran out and the captain decided to switch around. However the extra oxygen only lasts a while. It could have been possible that the plane was in auto - pilot, whilst the captain was trying to sort things out, he eventually probably went ununconscious &nbsp;and the plane due to the fact is was in auto pilot, &nbsp;kept on flying till full ran out...

The theory was that it was hijacked, if they were crashing they would have sent out a emergency signal but none was sent. They did find a small sender which is always running which sends a signal every 12 or something hours. So pretty much they think they are all dead, the plane was hijacked but crashed.

Not really. Surface tension is the tension that water has on it's surface. The faster something hits it, the "harder" is become. When a plane is flying, supposedly at it's cruising speed, which is a tad over 900 km/h for the type of place used on the MH370 flight route (Boeing 777), which is over 200 meters a second, the surface tension would have been immense.To put it simply, The plane crashed into what was essentially solid concrete.

The reason "everyone" has shut up about it, is because the "everyone" is only the media. Ans the media won't cover a story unless it pulls in money. And something that is a dead end story will not, so they won't bother talking about it.

We may never know, it could be years before we know. That particular aircraft had a very good safety record so it must have been the pilots.

Not really. Surface tension is the tension that water has on it's surface. The faster something hits it, the "harder" is become. When a plane is flying, supposedly at it's cruising speed, which is a tad over 900 km/h for the type of place used on the MH370 flight route (Boeing 777), which is over 200 meters a second, the surface tension would have been immense.To put it simply, The plane crashed into what was essentially solid concrete.

True, and here is a little bit of what I know...<br>If MH370 was to attempt a water landing, if it ran out of fuel per se.<br>it would have to attempt a water landing<br>the sharp U-Turn they took would have caused them to severely drop in altitude<br>and increase it speed.<br>With the speed it was going, and the low altitude, there was only the option of tthe<br>water landing.<br>When attempting water landings, planes like the DC9 have engines situated above the wings, the type of plane (Triple 7) has engines situated below the wings.<br>Upon hitting the water with frightening speed, the engines would have tried to scoop the water in a sense, while trying to go through it, this would ultimately tear the plane apart.<br>It has happened before though, but many people survived.<br>An Ethiopian plane was hijacked, and it ran &nbsp;out of fuel, it was forced to make<br>a water landing,&nbsp;<b></b><b>plus&nbsp;</b>it was a triple 7 aircraft, it had engines on the below of the plane.<br>It broke into three pieces in the water, and miraculously didn't cartwheel.<br>But, with no contact from it in almost 2 months, I highly doubt there were survivors.<br><br>I have always kind of thought this though..<br>once, two giant disks followed a plane, the pilots being scared s**tless didn't know what to do, so they just went with the flow, and they successfully landed, what if this happened, but they were abducted or something?<br><br>excuse my superstition XD
