Alright, I'm going to make this brief because I am using some hotel Internet and a iPod...<br><br>Yesterday, while we were starting our trip toSydney, we managed to hit a wombat. We had nearly made it to our motel, and had really bad luck to hit it 20 minutes away from finishing our initial drive (the whole trip was 4.5 hours so we were nearly done) The wombat smashed our car, took out the whole front grill, nearly broke the fog lights, and destroyed our radiator, we kept on driving, but after 5 minutesour car &nbsp; alerted us that the engine was over heating.... We pulled over and the car was stuffed. We had a look, and after realising what had happened, got out our phone and tried to call someone, except there was no cell coverage... Luckily, about 20 minutes later, someone drove by and managed to call a tow truck, so now, the next day we have had to hold up our trip while the parts get sent up to us from Melbourne. Dammit!<br><br>&nbsp;share &nbsp;any of your stories, or any crashes you know of, I can tell you, it was quite a fright! :o

I have quite a story back when I was little.<br><br>When I was young we were driving back from somewhere (can't remember where,) when suddenly the engine cuts out, we pull over with the remaining speed but the scary part is that we parked right next to a single grave which at my age was really scary. After 2 - 3 hours we finally got someone to tow us home.

We were going on a trip to Canada to see Niagra, etc.<br><br>We were pretty hyped about it too. Then, I cop hidden around a corner pulled us over. He said we were going at 101 mph (162.54 kph). Yeah it was fun ad scary at the same time.<br><br>im just saying...but 101 mph is fun to go at :P

We were driving up a mountain, and just turned around a corner, there were trees all around the road, and it was pitch black (late) We only managed to see it close to where it was because of the area car lights show, and the angle of the turn

Dude, you didn't even stop to bury it..<br>The lease you could do was carry the Wombat up a giant mountain that looks like<br>a thumbs up and sing some song about a woodpecker... if only

That's the least of our worries. We were nearly stuck on a road in the middle of nowhere, and it was becoming late....and we couldn't of got to the top of a giant Mountie.

Someone tried to break into our car so here is the story<br><br><br>I was 2 at the time. But we left from Montreal to go back to Toronto(6 hr drive) and we were using my grandpas car. It was Christmas at the time so everything was snowy and roads were slippery. Then this one guy got pretty pissed off cause we were going slow so he went in the opposite lane and started honking at us. My dad gave him the finger so he decided to get out of the car and try to get into ours. It was wierd cause my mom kept on opening the door while my dad kept on closing it and the final product was his arm getting hurt(cops found him too) and my grandpas<br>car had a broken window

Not really a car crash but we were driving home from Fresno. its a 4 hour drive and it was 3 am. My dad is super tired so slept and the cops pulled us over. He thought my dad was drunk because he kept skidding off to the side but my dad told the whole stroy on how he was sleepy. Luickly, we got no ticket and we got coffe
