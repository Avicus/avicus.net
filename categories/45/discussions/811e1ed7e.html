I have to say goodbye to the server in game I will still use the forums 
once in a while and I will still be active on Skype if you want to 
contact me my Skype is on my profile. I am quitting because the server 
and Minecraft in general is just not enjoyable for me anymore. The few 
days I haven't played my school grades are improving along with my 
social life so it is for the best. Spending 5 hours a day playing a 
video game was getting me no where in life. Wished I could have got the 
chance to be staff for a little while but it doesn't really matter now 
or in the future. So not really a goodbye to the community just saying I
 will not be active on the server again. I would like to thank the staff
 that have helped me a lot on Avicus Jozz, Peachy, Battle, Mountie, Iz, 
Docta, Evo, Para, Cina, Dubby, Roman, Pete, MidNight and Sli. Thank you 
to my friends which most of you I will still talk to on Skype. Thanks 
for the memories bye for now &lt;3 -99<br><br>Ps: I will do my best to keep Show Your Face To The World updated.
