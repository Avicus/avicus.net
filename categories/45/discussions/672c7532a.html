So yeah, i've basically gotten bored of the server, and pretty much Minecraft in general. I'm not saying that i'm never getting on, but it will be very rarely. The reasons that i've lost interest in the server are:<br><br>1.&nbsp;<i></i>They removed CTW from Nebula. I understand that it got removed since it was considered copying other servers, but so is allot of other things, and it's almost unavoidable. Plus i really enjoyed that aspect of Nebula.<br>2. The amount of players have decreased drastically, and i just don't find it as fun when there's not as many people.<br>3. Nebula hasn't really had any updates or anything to make it more interesting apart from new maps, so i've gotten bored of it.<br><br>I'm mainly playing League of Legends now, so if you play that and want to play with me, feel free to add me on Skype. I will probably keep making videos too, just not very often.<br><br>Goodbye!

@ParaSpider I don't know why you even bother trying to argue against my opinions, it's not exactly going to make me stay, although i doubt that's what you are trying to do. Also, i think i would know if the player count has dropped or not, since i've played this server longer than you, and i can tell you that it used to be in the thousands regularly. As for your first point, i mean leaving as in i will not play this server regularly, but i might be on every once in a while, but it's still basically leaving the community.<br><br>@Awarrior Yes, that will happen for everyone eventually

I thought that you already left because of your inactivity ._.<br>I guess now its official.<br><br>But I will agree that Nebula is a bit bland. I've been playing it for about a year now, and the best variety was CTW. Now we only have 3 TDM maps.

That's unique -_- Might as well bring back CTW.<br><br>Anyways, that's just my opinion. Cya man.

^^^ Exactly. <br><br>They say they don't want to copy other servers game modes? Well DTM, OiTC, Score boxes, TDM and kits isn't very "unique". I don't see why CTW is "copying" and the others are not…

bye sfk. I think the new maps were good but lacking many things. The shop sucks and now we lost one of the greatest rushers on avicus. They kept the badd maps with the new ones. You can't trust everyone to get 30 kills without spleefing and being punished. Messing with the shop means ruining the shop.
