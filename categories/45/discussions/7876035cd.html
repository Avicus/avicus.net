I think he just copied and pasted a comment from the video. If you look in the comments under the video, you'll see the same comment. But it is really rude.. and you're right c:

I don't get why anybody would hate on this guy. Come on, he must be 8 maximum, who cares if the song is terrible, it is cruel and unfair to say what some people have said. Just imagine how that kid probably feels now, he'd get bullied at school because somebody would have found out, he'd not want to go on the internet, the responses on that video probably ruined his life. Looking at his channel decscription it seems that he is blissfully unaware of the shit he gets, but imagine if he knew.

I´m not going to start an argument, but on the internet their will always be haters.. Even tho I didnt hate on his videos I might think it is bad.. We all have our own opinions. And I´m pretty sure he could remove those videos very easy, but yes.. He is probably getting hated because off how he looks 'n stuff, even tho he is a great editer!

The purpose of Youtube is Entertainment. There shouldn't be any rules bside from Nudity and that stuff.<br><br>He's like doing other Vids but they don't seem to surprise many people. It clearly shows people thought the parody was gonna be good which most Minecrafters like CS but then again...it was kinda weird. Probably he got hate on the lyrics. :L
