<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">So I have done a little bit of thinking and have come to the decision that my community membering needs a good bit of work. As a community member I should be able to work with the community more and learn what they would want from me as a community member (not sure if that's the best way to word this but I am running on no sleep as I type this)</span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">So the big question and main point of this post is: What do you guys think I can do to improve my community membering? This has been a thought for a while now but at this point I feel like I should ask.&nbsp;</span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">(Try to be serious with your answers, but it is fine if you have a small joke or something haha)<br><br><br><p>here is a secret message for cord:</p><p>

I know that, which is why I didn't lock the post myself. What I said earlier was an attempt to defend rilo, because I was aware of what went through his mind when he locked it (he probably saw it as prof making fun of Henry's thread about improving his moderation, and saw that it didn't contribute to anything useful so he locked it). The same reasoning went through my mind, but I didn't lock it for the same reasons you mentioned (I thought to myself that this was just some low quality post that should be left alone).

I’m going to lock this for going off topic.&nbsp;<br><br>Firstly, this is clearly making fun of the other thread, and isn’t made to get any real feedback.<br><br>Secondly, this has gone way off topic and the few replies that are on topic are jokes.
