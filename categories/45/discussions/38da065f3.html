Sorcerer was looking for a $800 PC. Buying a ~$450 CPU is the complete opposite of what you want to do.

My PC is $800 (saved up myself, with allowance :P) I mean my PC is pretty solid for that price range (built). If you want your PC mainly for gaming and Minecraft, what you want is a good processor, graphics card and good RAM. And ofc a good motherboard is vital. If you can buy a cheaper processor that you can over clock if you have that knowledge, use it to your advantage.&nbsp;<br><br>And for the love of everything, don't waste your damn money on a legit copy of Windows, just crack it, lol.

Most people don't pay attention to this, but a solid state drive actually makes a huge difference. I had around 70-80fps with an HDD, and it shot up to 200-300 with an SSD. You might go slightly over your budget though.

Big waste of money TBH (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://pcpartpicker.com/user/wrre/saved/DzZj4D">http://pcpartpicker.com/user/wrre/saved/DzZj4D</a>)<br>Pretty sure this build is better than your's<br>&nbsp;<br>1. You could have gotten the same if not better motherboard for WAY less money.<br>2. The Pentium, really cuts off the budget (If you had one), Could have gone with an AMD APU.<br>3. 8GB of ram for 91$? Terrible 8GB of G.SKILL Ram for 60$<br>4. Optical drive really isnt needed, Unless you're transfering files with 2GB of space or something...

Are you serious? $200 is a lot... Rich boy. Plus the i7 4930k or whatever, is not needed at all, stop bragging, doubt you even have one. And $1000 for a gaming PC, that will just run like ~500 fps? How about a PC that costs 700 or something, and can run MC at ~500 fps with SHADERS. Idk why you even would go for the i7 4930k, unless you're rendering.
