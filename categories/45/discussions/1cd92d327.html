Well, where to start. &nbsp;Lets start at the beginning. I joined two - three years ago on the Hunger Games server, there wasn't a hub and it was just a bunch of separate servers. Back then I was a noob and didn't realize that I had stumbled upon something special, an amazing group of people that would later change my life in ways that I couldn't have dreamed of.<br><br>I played Walls with my friend, and it was so fun! I remember it would be a pain to get on the same server and we would have strategies to get on the same team. "Okay cody join in, 3, 2, &nbsp;ohh dammit you missed it, quickly re-join". We had so much fun together, and around that time was when my true love for <b>Minecraft</b> it's self flourished, now I'm not talking about passionate love, "if you love it so much why don't you marry it".. no no no, not like that.<br><br>Later I remember all my friends going to Jonah's house, and they would be amazed,<b>&nbsp;</b>and I would show them, and we would download mini-game maps, and all play together. So later I invited my good friend Jonah to join MCZone and that was the day KooDaLord joined the community.<br><br>I played, played and played and finally got fairly known within the Avicus Community. I started making friends (<b>Howsie, Jozzy, Hannah, Andy, Yoav, Gabby, Oby, Nolan, Tino, etc.</b>) and I really felt like I fit in quite nicely. <i>(Now thats what I love about the Avicus Community, we are sooo accepting. Theres no oddball in the Avicus community, no extra puzzle piece.)</i>&nbsp;\<br><br>Now let me get back to my original point. I was having fun, but my additions became worst and worst, and I began to stay on my computer for hours and hours on end.&nbsp;<br><br>I would just like the thank everyone who has put there time into Avicus, as you have changed my life, and all of you have changed <u>me</u>. Thank you Keenan, I cannot believe how far you've got, but you deserve it!<br><br>Sooo... Tomorrow I will be leaving Avicus..<br><br><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/iMuQjXx.png" title="Image: http://i.imgur.com/iMuQjXx.png"><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>for 2 weeks! Then ill be back &lt;3<br><br>Scared yah didn't I?
