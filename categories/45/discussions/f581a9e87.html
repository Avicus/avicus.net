I doubt too about the scoring of the IQ test cause the average IQ is usually around 80. And also it depends if you are always skipping grades or often getting an A+.

Yeah, schools aren't the best way of seeing how smart someone is because teacher might take it easy and/or the difficulty of the school might differ from place to place. Before I moved, I was getting all A's with an occasional B+. Now since I moved, I've gotten 2 A's and 18 A+'s.&nbsp;<br>Anyways, it doesn't depend if you're getting A+'s or not on this test because it has no idea about your grades. If you're getting C's, you can still get a 100% on this test, although it's not probable. But yeah, I think this test is pretty inaccurate xD
