TBH what if his behavior in the campaign was just to attract voters and eventually winning the election.<br>Maybe he doesn't go after the goals he proposed. He just said what the people wanted to hear in order to win.<br>His actual goals may are still secret and he'll reveal them when he gets sworn in?

Mexico is not going to pay nor build for this wall, due to the circumstances in their country. Many people seek freedom and they go to the US for it.

I did. Clinton is a liar who can't be trusted with state secrets.&nbsp;<br><br>No, he's a businessman. He says what he knows the people want, with no plans on fulfilling it.

Just a heads-up for people saying that Trump won the majority of the votes, Hillary Clinton won 47.6% (59,092,337 ) of the national votes, whilst Donald Trump won 47.5% (58,967,470) as of the end of the vote counting.

The reason why Trump won is because of the First Past The Post system, which the American democratic system takes to a ridiculous degree. Trump won because the states he won were worth more points, not because he had more votes.

Ok, i'll just write down 2 arguments, but feel free to ask for more ;)<br><br>Even though Trump is a m(b?)illionaire now, he have experienced bankruptcy in his life.

Just a heads-up for people saying that Trump won the majority of the votes, Hillary Clinton won 47.6% (59,092,337 ) of the national votes, whilst Donald Trump won 47.5% (58,967,470) as of the end of the vote counting.

The reason why Trump won is because of the First Past The Post system, which the American democratic system takes to a ridiculous degree. Trump won because the states he won were worth more points, not because he had more votes.

I do not think states are done polling the votes yet. When he won PE, they kind of just dropped it because it didn't matter anymore. But honestly it doesn't matter anymore.

It's probably fake, even if it were true, I'd be great-full for that, and I know we wouldn't be paying for that wall.<br>Know who else would be great-full? The Americans who will be immigrating to Canada. Legit yesterday when Trump was announced that he won, the Canadian immigration website had been crashed due to too many people going on it at once.

Well Canada's economy relies quite a lot on the U.S. for exportation and importation as the States are our main source of importation and exportation .<br>So if something happens, it will probably affect Canada.&nbsp;<br>So Canadians get a say!!!

Trumps campaign was like the UKIP campaign during Brexit, it played to people's fears scaring them about immigration, the economy etc. that's why he won. He not once explained economically how he was going to fix the economy just that he would and then he spent the rest of the time making accusations against Clinton even tho he had way more against himself.
