When you think about organization like ESRB, you 
can’t but wonder why people find the greatest pleasure in their life in 
causing harm to other people’s business and doing everything to find 
ways of depriving other people of pleasure.

ESRB, or the Entertainment Software Rating Board, 
was founded in 1994, when the society considered that there was too much
 violence in a number of video games, such as Mortal Kombat, Doom, 
Lethal Enforcers(which wasn't even that violent) and others, and that the game industry needs to be regulated. Since then almost no game passes without being submitted to the ESRB
 (though it is voluntary, many retailers won’t sell games that haven’t 
passed the rating, as well as console producers won’t license such 
games), the content is being removed or suppressed in order to get more 
lenient attitude from the board, scandals are brought about, when yet 
another piece of adult content passes unnoticed into a “Teen” game and 
the publishers are forced to make cosmetic and not just cosmetic changes
 in their products in order to please the ESRB.
It is hard to say how many people feed on it while producing nothing but ESRB logos
 to be placed on the boxes with games, but I still can’t understand what
 it changes. Does the society really believe that children that are 
supposed to be protected from harmful content have never seen or heard 
anything about violence, sex, drugs and alcohol? Does it think that a 
child won’t find a way to get an “M” rated game if he wants to? The only
 thing that happens is that a number of people found themselves a 
sinecure and dictate their will to honest businessmen, who try to make 
money, and honest buyers, who want to get their share of joy.

Not if parents are ignorant enough to use XBL as a daycare. Not if people make fake IDs. Not if people are not going to "respect the ratings."

Whether or not it is rated or not people of young and old ages will still play the game. They believe that when young people play games like GTA or CoD it can make them really violent, I have played games like GTA since I was 7 or 8 and I am one of the last people you would see wanting a fight or even hurt someone. In my opinion it's how their raised, what environment they were in and how their parents explained to them how that it will ruin your life if you do things like killing people and doing drugs, my parents always told me that when I was little when I listened to most things they said and now I never even consider doing something like that.

Yeah my parents didn't give a sh*t if I was playing M or A games my dad bought me Leisure Suit Larry &nbsp;and its an A game back in 2005 when I was 9 years old. But still if I had a kid and he or she where to start playing M games yeah I wouldn't care but if he or her got hands on an A game yes I would be kind of pissed off. I do kind of see the point why&nbsp;ESRB is&nbsp;necessary but &nbsp;ESRB in reality is not needed.
