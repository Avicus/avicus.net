Lol, im not sure how you guys feel about this, but i think i spend WAY too much time on forums (No way im saying im leaving .-.) I mean look how much i'm doing throughout the Avicus forums... I just completely fill Up my Beautiful face in them!! So I was just wondering if any of you guys did something, Like non stop, then you just came out on top, like there was nobody but you... If you know what i mean<br><br>And mods: Yes you may lock this if you Desire :P Just a simple question i was wondering about the people could probably answer :P.<br><br>If you dont understand just tell me i can probably put it in better words :P.

I know what you mean. It's the same with me. I make too much for the avicus network, I'm always on, during the night and the day. The thing is I can do it now. I have holidays and nothing to do except being on the forums. It's raining outside... Well in sime weeks my holidays are gone and I'll have to concentrate on the school. Hope this will reduce my time here. Just take a little break for one or two weeks. It would help you... :D
