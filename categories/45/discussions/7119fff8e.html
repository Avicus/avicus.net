Hi there,&nbsp;<br>It's hard to believe that tomorrow Avicus will be three years old. I'm pretty sure I joined on the first day or second day the server opened back in 2013. Played for a little while on McZone, but was never really active until a year into the Avicus update. Enjoyed being staff and ref here for about 8 months or so (and winning the Omega Salt Championship with Berzerk). Recently started playing Minecraft again after a 3 1/2 month break from video games (im even more awful now). &nbsp;So i'd though I make an ama, i'll try to answer all the questions to the best of my ability.

Hi Micah! :p<br><br>Favorite Walls map? (removed or still in rotations): I really loved the original&nbsp;walls map or the Jungle one.

Hey Ben!&nbsp;<br><br>Usually pretty toxic from what I remember. You were pretty nice at times but at other times not so much xd don't know if thats changed now.&nbsp;<br><br>I try to change the name every month so I can keep both those names protected. For the most part it's because I have other gaming accounts registered as Numberz_ and some as 99250 so I like to keep both. I've probably switched around 15 times or so. I do the same with my alts as well, I have two names on each of them I just switch back and forth from.

Hey Cammy!<br><br>Oh yeah I remember that name. Used to play a lot of walls with you and your brother Lachy back in the old days. You seem to be a nice person all the times that I've talked to you, good staff member as well!&nbsp;<br><br>I like Australia, actually thinking about traveling there in the next few years. Some family members moved there a few years ago and I've always wanted to visit them. Not a big fan of all the deadly spiders though...

Hey Jess!&nbsp;<br><br>You're probably one of the nicest people I've ever met. But you have a really bad side (ik cause ive gotten on it a few times xd). I really enjoy talking to you and shipping you with random people xD<br><br>I think we met because of Thomas or Kat. Don't think I talked to you a whole lot until we we're Jr mods at the same time.<br><br>Yes lol. You're welcome xd

Hi Tyler!&nbsp;<br><br>I always kinda disliked you for cheating in the tournament and then sending all the salt towards Berzerk. But you really changed a whole lot since then and became a really nice person. Idk why you stepped down from mod because you were the only one that knew how to detect most kinds of hacks.

Hey Snow!&nbsp;<br><br>best part would be the forums/community. I like the interface and people here better than any other server.&nbsp;<br><br>worst would be the low player count and lack of variations in rotations and good maps.&nbsp;<br><br>I used to dislike you a lot when you were staff. Way too robotic back then. You seem to be very chill now.
