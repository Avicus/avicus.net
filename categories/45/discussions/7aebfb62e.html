As far as I know, only the staff members can obtain the plug.dj ranks (Resident DJ, Bouncer and Manager). Feel free to ask one of the admins for confirmation though.

Resident DJ was for active users on PlugDJ. But I don't think anyone has the power to give the ranks anymore.

Oh okay, my bad. In that case we'll be able to give out Resident DJ ranks to people who deserve it.
