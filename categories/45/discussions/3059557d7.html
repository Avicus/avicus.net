<p class="MsoNormal">I am just mad because my mom came into my room to bring me a
plate of chicken nuggets and I literally screamed at her and hit the plate of
chicken nuggets out of her hand.</p><p class="MsoNormal">She started yelling and swearing at me and I slammed the
door on her. I'm so distressed right now I don't know what to do. I didn't mean
to do that to my mom but I'm literally in shock from listening to this song tonight. I
feel like I'm going to explode. Why was this awful work in progress even made? This can't
be happening. I'm having a damn breakdown.</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.357143em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;  font-family: verdana, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(240, 243, 252);">



</p><p class="MsoNormal">I don't want to believe the world is so bad at music production. I want a
future to believe in. I want Apollo2OP to fix the mainstream music scene, but this released. I cannot deal with this right now. It wasn't supposed to be
like this, I thought drum &amp; bass was a defunct genre???? This is so scary.</p>
