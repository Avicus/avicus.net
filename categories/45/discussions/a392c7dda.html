Hey,<br><br>So i just updated my channel art, the one I had earlier was getting a little old. I put a lot of time into making this new one, and i would really appreciate some feedback - please be honest!<br><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/c/dryvegaming" title="Link: http://www.youtube.com/c/dryvegaming">www.youtube.com/c/dryvegaming</a><br>Thanks :D

Okay.. Not sure if you're serious about this or not, but I'll give you my professional feedback either way.<br><br>First off, the image of yourself is very inaccurate. It insinuates that you have no hands, or feet, which is a scam. People will think you're a special case and want to subscribe just for that.. Not cool dude. -.-<br><br>Secondly, the play button isn't very lifelike. Honestly, you don't even deserve 100 subs if you can't draw the real-size drawing of a play button on your channel art. Yes, it may not fit on a computer screen, so buy a fucking tv. Honestly very disappointing.&nbsp;<br><br>Finally, the scribble on the left of the play button is inappropriate. It looks like a gun. I'm not sure what you're trying to say by that, but if you support the use of guns ILLEGALLY (we are in Canada..) then I think your channel should be shut down.<br><br>Those are the main things that I absolutely despise about your new art.<br><br>Other than that, looks very good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br><br>LOL
