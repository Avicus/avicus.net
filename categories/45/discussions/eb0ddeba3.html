I masked stuff together and I edited the lighting and whatnot. What do you guys think, does it look like a believable movie poster or nah? :)<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/a3KFYT4.jpg" title="Image: http://i.imgur.com/a3KFYT4.jpg"><br><br>Made this for my Digital Imaging class. Took about 2-3 hours.

thats pretty nice but not good enough to be a believable movie poster.<br>the girl does not look like she &nbsp;fits into the rest of the picture, the fonts dont really fit in with the poster, the looks like its been erased around the edges which downgrades the quality of the video. if you looked at other posters for refference you could tell the placement of some of the things are a bit wrong.<br><br>just a couple of things to take into account, of course the poster is not gonna be perfect at first buts its a good start :P

Make all the bottom text WAAAY smaller and center it. Also perhaps darken the blue of the text a bit.

The red behind the text is too much contrast. For the theme it looks like you are going for stick with blues and whites.
