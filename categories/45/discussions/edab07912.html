I like how it says you're a group that reports hackers and what not but the thing is; everyone here is part of the staff but Zedther. Why don't you just do your regular/daily job and leave this?<br>I find it useless and pointless.

Well it's like having sectors under police forces...<br>It is not necessary, nor unnecessary, but may be just to have some fun; and maybe for some a small sense of belonging. It may also make the team work more efficiently, therefore increasing production and a smoother staff team outputs.&nbsp;<br>Also having non staff members (they will join) will help staff &amp; players alike maintain relationships.&nbsp;<br>Don't make it sound so trivial.

To those of you questioning the reasons behind it, first off, we are restarting it. Of course we're gonna have some staff members for organization. Also, there are only 4 staff members. More than double that in users put their skype name down, so once this gets back on track, it will not be mostly staff. Also, the staff aren't gonna quit their job, and go do this. Like I said, we're just there to help the organization along.
