Sorry, but I kinda need help with something. I'm thinking of donating for emerald but I'm only doing it if I can pretty much donate more from the $25. Like... I've already donated $25 so I'll have to only donate $25 to get it.&nbsp;<br><br>If I have to donate $50 then I'm not doing it because it's not worth donating $25 and $50.&nbsp;<br><br>Thanks :D

Yeah I know that, But when I went into paypal it said amount due: $50 and I was like well okay then... I entered my name as TheDiamondGecko so id expect that it would register my name as already been donated.

TheDiamondGecko, if it says pay $50, then just pay for another gold and the i will take that away and give you Emerald. however, send me the proof that you have bought the gold (receipt).

Did you hit the "Rank Upgrades" button? That may be your solution to your problem
