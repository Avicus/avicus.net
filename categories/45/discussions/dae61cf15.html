The number depends on how many people are accepted, there is no limit<br>Include whatever you think may benefit your application, but don't make it too long, follow <a href="http://avicus.net/forums/a96927be2" rel="nofollow">http://avicus.net/forums/a96927be2</a><br><br>However, I heard applications were going to be different this time ;o

There isn't a specific number of staff members we're looking for. It's mainly just however many do well on their interviews and applications. Of course if we get many more staff than we need at some point, we may start being more strict at accepting Junior Moderators. There will be a change with the applications as well. Your application isn't measured in length, but in quality. As long as your app fits our criteria, its length will not matter.

The Sr Staff will promote anybody how they think are able to become Jr Mod.&nbsp; There aren't a limit on how many people can be Jr Mod.&nbsp; The Jr Mods who passed their month test (Jr Mods are on their trial mods) will get promoted to Mod.&nbsp; Their isn't a limit on how big your app needs to be, but it can't be two sentences.&nbsp; Just put an effort into your app and do the best you can.

&nbsp; Hey will! <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There is no "limited" spots for Junior Mod. It all depends if the applicants pass the criteria and requirements listed (:
<br>&nbsp; Your Staff Application can be how ever long you'd like to make it. There is no certain length you have to meet. :)  Remember, quality over quantity (;
