Well New England Patriots vs Atlanta Falcons. Who you got? <br><br>As I live in Georgia and ABSOLUTELY HATE NEW ENGLAND I'm pulling for Atlanta. <br><br>I am also a Steelers fan so I just wanna say for those of you who watched it THEY SUCKED THEY CANT EVEN DO ZONE COVERAGE LEAVING HOGAN WIDE OPEN.

Bills fan here, disappointing season for us..<br><br>Atlanta's offense is basically unstoppable, but their defence is what they would lose on.&nbsp;<br>But i think, if Patriots would win it's because of Atlanta's defence.&nbsp;<br><br>My pick is, 27-23 to Atlanta.

He didn't, my point I said that you shouldn't assume he's a patriots fan, especially a bandwagon fan, just because he sort-of commended them.

Tom brady actually has a defense behind him this year. probably not enough to completely shut down julio though. 30-27 patriots.

Well I am really disappointed in how the falcons played that 2nd half. It's like they just played zone like the Steelers. And that Julian Edelman catch was pure luck, should have been intercepted by Robert Alford
