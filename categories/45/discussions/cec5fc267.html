<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Heyo!</span>&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal"><br></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>So many of
you know me as another moderator, but I am here to tell you all a little bit
about me and who I am. I will try and make this as short as I can but try and
stick around for the whole story.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><br></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span>So, I was
born in Eastern Australia on August 16th 2002, which makes me 13
years old now. However, disaster struck. When I was only 1-year-old, I got a
very bad flu and (according to my parents) I was about to die, but seeing as I
am alive now, I didn’t :) My parents got married literally days after my
miraculous recovery.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><br></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span>I ended up
moving from Sydney to Brisbane and went to a state school. Something I want to
get out of the way before I continue. I have a few allergies (6 to be exact)
which include allergies to grass (you heard me) cats, dogs, pollens, dust and
dust mites. These allergies mean I sneeze a lot, and I mean A LOT. I also get
constant headaches and runny noses. A lot of people find this ridiculous but
all that sneezing and headaches and stuff get’s me tired easily. I can sneeze
up to 200 times a day, as crazy as it sounds, every word is true.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><br></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span>Now where
was I, oh right, I moved to a state school and to be honest, I hated every
minute of it. Everyone thought I was sick as I was always sneezing and I never
got to tell anyone why I was like that. No one wanted to hang out with a sick
kid meaning I spend most lunch breaks alone. I was also the first kid to finish
my work. Anyone who wanted to be my friend was only in it to copy my work. I
always got the best mark in the class. People also bullied me because of this.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>I then
moved to a prestigious private school where there were some kids like me in
some ways. I managed to fit in well socially and also academically, which
challenged me unlike my previous school. Not much has happened after that, I
began playing Avicus and Minecraft in general and loved it. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>So that is
a bit about me and who I am as a person. The reason I made this is explaining a
bit about myself and tell people why I am always sneezing and stuff, it hurts
when people laugh and don’t take me seriously when I tell them about my
allergies and what it does to me. Well, I’ll see you all later, take care, cya
around.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span>- Cammy</p>

I'm sorry on what happend :(. If I were one of your peers, I would totally understand your situation, because I have a brother who shares the same issues. We grown up with a dog, so he doesn't sneeze as much as he did as a baby. He does sneeze around other animals, except reptiles and fish, and also around dusty things or when he is outside. I am glad things turned out good, because we wouldn't have an amazing moderator like you.
