I know this is longer than the essay portion of my english final, but please bear with me.<br><br>So my mom told me today that I play way too much video games, but I really don't think I do, compared to other people. I usually play for like an hour on weekdays and like 2-3 hours on the weekends. The majority of that would be Minecraft (mostly Avicus), though sometimes I play League of Legends. <br><br>Well, every time my mom sees me playing video games, she would stand behind me and annoy me every 10 seconds until I stop playing. That's primarily the reason why I often disconnect mid-game and come back online a few minutes later. At night, she often unplugs the router before she goes to bed, and she didn't hide it very well, so I could just plug it back in. But now its even worse. She hides it really well, and I end up wasting a lot of time looking for it.<br><br>Today, after I played a few rounds of Nebula with some friends (99250, lunax, netox, cynder, etc) she said she had to do something about this situation. She gave me 2 options: give her the computer forever (well probably a long time), or uninstall Minecraft and any other games that I might have. What should I do? I have a lot of friends on Avicus, and other servers/games. I spent $50 on Avicus, and also donated to a few other servers. I dedicated so much time, and I'm so freaking close to prestige 3. She says the money is worth nothing now, and she said the friends aren't real people. All the time I spent on gaming she says is wasted.<br><br>Please help me. I don't want to get into a huge fight or anything, &nbsp;but I don't want to lose the privilege to play video games, even if it's only once in a while.<br><br>Thank you for reading this.

You don't know her, she won't give it back for a really long time, possible a few months. I have a job as a programmer, so I need a computer. Option B won't work either, since I can't just give up everything, even if all of it is pointless.

Yeah, ik. I asked her why other kids got to play so much, and I didn't. She told me that I'm unlucky to have her as my mom. I honestly don't play so much for the sake of playing the game, but to play with friends. If I'm on avicus and none of my friends are on, I'll usually disconnect after a few minutes.

I already tried that. She said my hobby is pointless and I need to find something else to do. I brought up the "dictatorship" part a few times also, and she told me that as long as I'm under 18, I'm under her control.

What might, just might work (depending on how your mom reacted) would be to have people to sign an online petition to show how many people care about you and want to keep you here. If she wants proof that they are real people, show her these forums, and the show your face thread, ask for pics, show forum threads where each person expresses themselves and talk about something they have in common, something they all love, and maybe, if someone was willing, have her talk to a person, see that they are real, alive, and care about you.

That actually sounds like a great idea! I'll definitely try most, if not all, of those things. Hopefully it works. The only thing she doesn't understand is that people actually care about each other online in a community like this. She thinks we just discuss game stuff all day here. So yeah, I'll try it and tell you what happens

You have a mum like mine dude...<br>My mum basically yesterday for example was tapping me on the shoulder to annoy me when I had enough of it and that is when I threw down my temporary headset and I broke it. She said that she will break my computer after that but she couldn't do it of the "cost" of the computer. Then, to annoy me more, she disconnects the router by purpose so I can get off. My mum then complains to my dad and then my dad rants at me so much that I can't take it. Ahhhh... I feel you dude, but how to get over the problem, you have to like negotiate some kind of promise, like I will only play on weekends, this might be harsh but this is how I got over it until she went calmer....

Well, since she does know about you job tell her this: "Mom, if you make me get off the computer for ever I won't be able to make money. If I can't get money how will I be able to get my feet off the ground when I'm 18? Also if you make me delete my minecraft that could effect my job as a programmer. I could use minecraft to test the code that I make. Minecraft has a great community if people. They are real, we talk about interesting things. Not just game involved conflicts. See what happens if you take my computer away or make me delete my minecraft and all my games."

Alright, so she made me delete Minecraft. I chose that instead of giving her the computer. I did show her the forums, the show your face thread, and these posts, but she doesn't care.

Maybe you should take a small break from games, and prove to your mom you can handle without them for awhile. (So it's good to play once in awhile.) She'll have to understand that games is what you like to do as a hobby.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Hang out with your friends, go see movies w/ people. Do things to keep you occupied from playing games for awhile. I know that my parents don't really like that I play games because I'm a girl :p but they are okay with it, because I don't say games are my life because they're not. I just proved to my parents that I still keep up with my life, and get straight A's, and still manage to be very active with games. Tell your mom a propersition about how you feel with games, and show her you can do other things without games. She'll soon have to understand that you proved her wrong I hope. I remember my mom telling me "Rianna; I never thought you of all the girls would be playing games,and liking dubstep." I just keep up with my life, because I know games aren't life. Maybe she need to see that from you? I know moms and dad's don't really understand that we'll, but they have to accept the fact sometime. I hope this helps!:)

PRINCEZZ :D<br><br>Games aren't my life, no matter how much she thinks it is. I may spend a couple hours a day on Minecraft and League, but I do a lot more than that. I get good grades, play piano and cello, I swim and play golf, and I have a job. What more can she ask from me? In my opinion, she hates games and doesn't see them as a form of entertainment due to the fact that they weren't around when she was a teenager.<br><br>Every time there are shootings on the news or something, and it relates to the killer playing games, she has to point that out to me. I have to tell her every time that the games I play aren't violent. I don't play stuff like Counter Strike, COD, or worst of all, that school shooter game that Adam Lanza played. I play Minecraft. It's like LEGOs, where you're in a virtual world and build stuff with blocks. That's not that bad. There's not even guns in this game (vanilla minecraft).<br><br>I hang out with my friends a lot over the weekends, and during the summer. We go to movies, we bike, eat lunch together, all that stuff. People on Avicus aren't my only friends in this world. I think she needs to understand these things. I know very clearly games aren't my life at all. I have goals set for my future, where I want to go to college, what I want to do after I graduate, etc. So my mom needs to learn that.<br><br>The problem is, in some cases, she just won't listen. Unfortunately, this is one of them.&nbsp;Sorry for writing these essays, but I just wanted to get all these feelings out.

I'm sorry to hear this conundrum... Last thing I would have to say is, compromise. Explain your reasoning, and have her explain hers, and just compromise. I know you'll probably be like "I've tried it, I've done everything.", maybe you both just really need to explain how you feel about it. Moms and dad's both have a different perspective point and opinion of view on how they handle things. Sit down and talk with her, be strict on your point. (Don't give attitude .-. It never ends well...) Tell her how your very capable with your life, and you accomplishing achievements. Tell her that your very responsible, don't be pushy. Let her have time to think about it. I'm sorry to hear this, and I hope this helps you. :P GL

If you ever need to privately talk, you can skype me. I know my mom said the same about shootings, and how I play too much violent games on Xbox .-. My mom had to really accept the fact that this is what I love, and this is what I like. She legit was the same way as your mom, about shootins etc. Skype me if you ever need more in depth detail on this subject. I'd be more than happy to help out :)

Yeah, thanks for the tips. Unfortunately, I already tried all that. Believe me, I've tried everything. Its okay, because I just told her I dont have minecraft on my computer anymore, and I won't install it again. Which is true, because in a way, you don't install Minecraft. It's portable. Also, I'm keeping it on a separate hard drive, so technically its not "in my computer" :P I disguised it as Internet Explorer, changing the icon and name and everything. Hopefully she doesn't know that Internet Explorer isn't available for Mac xD<br><br>Hopefully my problems are solved for now. Thanks to all of you who helped. See you at the monument!

No offence, but your mom is a idiot to think video games promote violence.If video games promoted violence why the hell did world war 2 happen?Ask her that for me please.I'm sorry to hear of your predicament,as I have never been in a situation like this before.My parents are extremely reasonable people(thank god),so they let me play any game I want because I usually always put studies first.But you have a job and your mom still complains?Thats just idiotic and your mom had a personal agenda behind making you not playing games.Probably wants you to study harder or something else which is too stupid for us to speak about.Hopefully she will see reason and the error in her ways but i doubt it.GL<br><br>-Jasshan

Yeah, no offense taken :P<br>In my opinion video games rarely promote any violence. I think most of the violence in this world is caused by religion. Yeah, she just really hates video games for some reason. She does want me to study harder, even though I'm already doing pretty decent in school, but that's just because she's Asian

I can't stand it when parents do this shit. It's so god damn annoying. I'm sorry for swearing but this REALLY ticks me off. On average I'm on the computer for 10 hours a day. What are my grades? A's and B's. Except that one class that I failed but if the computer actually effected me, I would be failing every class. If I'm passing my classes what the hell is the problem?<br><br>Find a new hobby? My hobby is to go on the computer. Your hobby? Bitching about everyone else's "problems".

"<span>If video games promoted violence why the hell did world war 2 happen?"<br><br>Please, please tell me you were being ironic there, tell me that was sarcasm, satire, something! If you were serious that is literally the least logical thing i have ever heard. Video games DO glorify violence, thats a fact, its just not prove that it increases real life rates of violence, although there is fairly solid evidence that it causes a slight increase. Minecraft: gawd no. Books are actually shown to cause higher crime rates than games. But games DO, undeniably, glorify and promote violence. They also give you a place to take out that violence, so you dont go kill anyone. Trust me, if i didnt play games id be bored and act violent and more people would be dead by my hand than hitler and stalin's death counts combined. Thank god for games rite? But seriously, games promote violence, they dont spread it, the end, spread the word</span>
