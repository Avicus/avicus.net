So as you may now there is a new service out in the US and other places called YouTube Red.<br><br>What YouTube Red is, it's a service which allows subscribers to watch YouTube videos without Advertissments but it will cost you $9.99 a month..<br><br>So you must be thinking what does this have to do with you, well unless your a youtuber with 500+ subscribers and have decent amount of views on your video and get paid a bit for it, it will mean that you won't get paid if people are watching your content through YouTube Red instead of regular old Youtube.<br><br>Now I'm not Saying this is a problem at all it will just be pretty much the death of popular youtubers who do this as a job because if a lot of people by the subscription of 9.99$ a month for YT Red they can't get paid so they won't make money so that means they would have to stop YouTube.<br><br>Idk this is just what I think and have heard so give me your thoughts and leave me some comments so we can get a little discussion going :)

I just use Adblock which is free, never really thought the advertising was usually their pay.

The only time I have seen someone actually explain Youtube Red properly was CaptainSparklez. I would suggest looking at his video about it because it actually has some good research,
