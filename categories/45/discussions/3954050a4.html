So There are a lot of hackers on Avicus right? Yeah. What if, there was a DTM lobby reserved for hackers. So if a player was caught on regular DTM, they could be sent to HackerDTM.&nbsp;<br>This could also be a new way of fun and banter; just go to the HackerDTM, turn on Bhop, fly, etc., and play around.&nbsp;<br><br>Of of course the stats in the HackerDTM, won't be recorded onto the real leaderboards. But yeah.<br><br>-rattle

Here's an idea: tell everyone that there is a hackerdtm where you can hack, and ban anyone who goes there because they're filthy hackers!

If you want mapdevs, I'll try to get Geor0258 on, but he hasn't been on in over a year so it might be a while.

Um... I feel like HackerDTM would become more popular than normal DTM. Our server would just become known has the hacks one, because why okay clean when you can play with hacks... That's how knew users will see it. I see line of thought though
