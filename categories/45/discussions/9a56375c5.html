So for the past couple of days there has been a huge increase in block lag and lagging back. I really don't know what is going on, but this is happening to a couple a people. If this could please some how be fixed, do it!

It's probably the update to 1.8, fixes haven't been pushed yet, so it's still more screwed up than ever.

I hope some day there will just come an update for Avicus which fixes each lag, including spike lag, block lag, lag back, delayed damage lag, fasthitting bugs and etc.<br><br>If so it'd be the best day of my life :~3

I dont see why these issues are occuring. The devs tested 1.8 before, but did nothing about all the glitches before making the whole server 1.8

They said that the server only turned 1.8, the fixes however have yet to be pushed. That's what I know as of right now.

No, I mean they tested DTM01 and CTW01 in 1.8 a good few months before the whole server turned to 1.8. As far As I can tell now most glitches have been fixed, but that still doesnt explain why they weren't fixed before the server turned 1.8
