<b>Hello everyone!</b><br><br>My name is Koja and I will be restarting an SMP that was created during the summer. The SMP had few people so did not flourish. I will be hosting this SMP and will be accessible at all times. I encourage everyone to at least try the SMP as it is a great opportunity to collaborate with other players you may not have met before!&nbsp;<br><br><b>What is an SMP?&nbsp;<br></b><br><ul><li>SMP stands for Survival Multi Player, and is a server where players can interact and collaborate with other players.</li><li>Players are free to build whatever they want, wherever they want. Although there is a lot of freedom in an SMP, this particular one will have minimal structure to have the server be more organized. This will include community decisions and organized schedules to have as many players on at once!&nbsp;This will also hopefully include organized events.&nbsp;</li></ul><b>Who is organizing the SMP, and who will be involved?<br></b><br><ul><li>The SMP will be organized by myself, Dipperpines and EBGLegend, as well as others.&nbsp;</li><li>We will be collaborating with team HOME.&nbsp;</li></ul><b>How will I be contacted?<br><br></b><ul><li>If you decide to apply, I or one of the other organizers will contact you via Skype or discord. The SMP will have a discord server to keep things organized.&nbsp;</li></ul><b>How to participate:&nbsp;</b><b><br></b><br>If you would like to participate, please complete the following application. All serious applications will be accepted.&nbsp;<br><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdlpAZF8xkC-62q9SjfpiHMF70dugSr6QlFvCD77temcQtvpA/viewform" title="Link: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdlpAZF8xkC-62q9SjfpiHMF70dugSr6QlFvCD77temcQtvpA/viewform">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdlpAZF8xkC-62q9SjfpiHMF70dugSr6QlFvCD77temcQtvpA/viewform</a><br><br>I hope everyone at least tries the SMP because it will be a great way to meet new players, and have casual fun while building awesome creations. If you don't have much experience with building or survival like myself, this can be a great learning opportunity to learn how to build and get advice from others. I hope to see you all on the SMP! If you have any questions, please reply!&nbsp;<br><br>- Koja

I voted 1.8, but the most recent update would be the best IF you make it 1.8 pvp.

Hey! So I just have a quick question for whoever picked 1.8 for the version. Did you pick it for the Pvp or because you don't like the new features?
