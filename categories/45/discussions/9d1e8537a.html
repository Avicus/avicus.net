Well I can take a volunteer opportunity in Spain, teaching people my age English by just hanging around them and basically just doing activities with people from the country. One of our return flights would be through London, so if I wanted and got the time in April, I could maybe go, if I was interested :P&nbsp;<br><br>But that would be a pretty long trip and a lot of money.

Yes, you can buy capes off the internet. How it works with capes is that a few days before Minecon happens, they email you cape codes (URLs directed to minecraft.net with a page for adding your cape by logging in). Depending on how many tickets you bought is how many capes you get (1 ticket = 1 cape). You can get a really good profit off this for selling our extra capes like I did, but one warning, some people tend to sell them for a ridiculous amount of money on eBay and whatnot. However, there has been rumors that this year they aren't doing capes, something different, this has not been confirmed, as well as I do not believe that Mojang would stop doing the capes idea for each Minecon from this year to so on.
