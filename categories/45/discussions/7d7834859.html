I think you may have forgotten the Patriots dominated the Colts.<br><br>They didn't just win, it was a slaughter. The patriots have proven themselves as the best team in the NFL as of 2015. Whether you like them or not, you can't deny they are a successful team.

Best game Iv'e ever seen played in the history of the super bowl. I had those moments when my heart was racing, and those moments when I was jumping for joy. Overall my wish of the patriots winning, became a reality! Seattle fans, the bandwagon train is headed to new england! Don't want to miss your chance!

Honestly I'm tired of all the bandwagon stuff.. It's offensive.. At the end of the day, we might be mad and criticizing our own team, but for a good reason! They made mistakes! I guarantee 99.9% of Seahawks fans will still be Seahawks fans! It's one thing to want a team to win a super bowl (When your team isn't in contention) and it's another thing to have YOUR team in the super bowl. Honestly. I've yet to see anyone "jump off the bandwagon" yet, and I doubt I will. All I've seen is fans of the 31 other teams making fun..

All the teams that have won were the teams that weren't bandwagon'd. That is how I have correctly guess the winner for the last 5 years. And also why I have 5x my life savings. (Im just kidding about the last sentence)
