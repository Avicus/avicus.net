How are their so many people on the Avicus forums like 24/7 not talking about mods I'm talking about players but no one gives a shit about going on the damn server to play avicus is abused people just like to talk on the forums and use ts (not that much ts lately) why you have to do dis why can't you get on server and play if you so much time to talk on the forums???

We've got plans, BmB and Tazz seem to be helping us a lot, we're getting new staff members, people are getting on more during the unofficial tournaments.<br><br><br>Pretty sure it should stay up for now.
