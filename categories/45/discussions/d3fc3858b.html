So Idk if many of you know but the youtuber CreeperFarts released a video on Competitive Minecraft.<br><br>I would have put his video link but I'm on my phone (will put link later).<br><br>And I was wondering to see as everyone is creating teams, why not make an Avicus team.<br><br>Again this will take planning and isn't completely official yet.<br><br>If you think you would be interested msg me on Skype or reply here. I'm still thinking about a name for the team if this goes somewhere if you have any suggestions for a good team name please feel free to tell me.&nbsp;<br><br>Thanks and Peace Out :P

This is about Team Flux right?<br>I think it's pretty ignorant of them to claim that they're the first competitve Minecraft team.<br><br>Avicus has just finished their 2nd tournament.<br>Overcast is just starting their 11th tournament.<br><br>They're a bit late xD

@Rilo yes I mean players from this server to go against Team Flux and other big teams like that.<br><br>@Snow Yeah I get were your coming from but there having tournaments on different servers, and from teams from servers. Like there are already 2 big teams from the MCSG server, I've heard rumors of a Mineplex and Hypixel one forming so why not have an Avicus one form?

You have to wait out. You can only appeal if the ban was wrong/false.
