<div style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(131, 131, 131); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  ">Hello Everyone. In case you don't know me my name is Riley and I have played on the Avicus network for almost two years now. I have enjoyed seeing the players come and go and making many friends along the way. However, I only joined the forums last December and soon after that I became a mod in January's Staff Batch which many have come to know as the "rookie batch." I was absolutely loving my time as a mod and everyone said I was really nice and all that, and then I got demoted. However I don't want to talk about that, cause there isn't really a point to anyways. Now let's talk about the main point of this article.</div><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(131, 131, 131); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  "><br></div><br style="color: rgb(131, 131, 131); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  "><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(131, 131, 131); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  ">I'm leaving Avicus and Minecraft in general. Recently I was helping a friend with a project that was focused on virtual awareness. Now virtual awareness is defined as, raising awareness against people who are constantly on technology. This caused me to sit back and look at my life and see everything I was missing out on. I lost friends, trust from family, and lots of other things. I think that my friend, even though he didn't mean to, made the video for me. Within the last two weeks I have accomplished so many things in real life and I want to make sure I focus on things, that in the long term, will allow me to change who and I am and determine what I will become. Now this goodbye will be quite long so I split it up into sections. Here is an index of what is what.</div><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(131, 131, 131); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  "><br></div><br style="color: rgb(131, 131, 131); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  "><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(131, 131, 131); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  ">Section 1: Why I'm leaving</div><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(131, 131, 131); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  "><br></div><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(131, 131, 131); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  ">Section 2: Thank yous to certain individuals</div><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(131, 131, 131); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  "><br></div><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(131, 131, 131); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  ">Section 3: Thank you's to certain groups</div><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(131, 131, 131); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  "><br></div><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(131, 131, 131); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  ">Section 4: Final Words and your videos/help</div><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(131, 131, 131); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  "><br></div><br style="color: rgb(131, 131, 131); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  "><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(131, 131, 131); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  "><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pH-Ga1ch_zPiAtVgcv0TvqpSTK-j99J2ei2LtmK85pgJmd1CUqxfumjaA4Kd7tMvaWxdZ3sM4xaPkIGjmK96vIXOzJesNXUjUGV9LVhF2XD59iKU9XNM4962WE6Y7n-w9V3zguA" style="max-width: 90%; border: none; "></div><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(131, 131, 131); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  "><br></div><br style="color: rgb(131, 131, 131); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  "><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(131, 131, 131); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  ">Recently I meet a girl who I thought was everything to me.

We do so much stuff together that our parents also meet each other and now do things together every weekend.</div><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(131, 131, 131); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  "><br></div><br style="color: rgb(131, 131, 131); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  "><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(131, 131, 131); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  ">I also started a project about a month ago. This project was showcased a nearby convention where a lot of employers came to look at projects that they wanted their companies to pursue. And one of the big companies that was there was Twitter. Yes, the twitter. The man who talked to me seemed very interested in it, and now I am working as an intern for Twitter. I'm 18, and I'm working for one of the biggest companies in the world. Its a dream come true.</div><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(131, 131, 131); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  "><br></div><br style="color: rgb(131, 131, 131); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  "><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(131, 131, 131); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  ">Some of you may know that I am big into things like algorithms and that is also another thing that I am working on. I came across a site called squidboards that is based around an upcoming game called Splatoon. I am working with a good friend on an algorithm that allows evenly distributed ranks among teams to make sure that they are given the rank they deserve. I have also sought out a job in marketing for a home design service and I love the job so far.</div><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(131, 131, 131); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  "><br></div><br style="color: rgb(131, 131, 131); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  "><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(131, 131, 131); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  ">Now another thing that I want to work on is college.

I just wanted to say thank you to many of you for being some of my closest friends when I didn't have any. I know many of you might've not even thought of it, but you guys were my second family. And there are those people that I really need to say thank you to. I have a huge list that I want to thank, however I’ll be doing my four biggest thanks yous here. So lets get started.</div><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(131, 131, 131); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  "><br></div><br style="color: rgb(131, 131, 131); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  "><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(131, 131, 131); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  ">-Michael/Straightened/Sulorak: Alright so this is kind of a big one to me. He basically changed my life in person and managed to make me look at things with a whole different viewpoint. He was also the one who added a new song to my playlist after he sung my favorite song in the teamspeak. It is by far one of if not the best parody of Uptown Funk that I have ever heard of. I just wanted to say thanks, great friend.</div><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(131, 131, 131); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  "><br></div><br style="color: rgb(131, 131, 131); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  "><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(131, 131, 131); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  ">-MidnightBeats/Midnite: I can honestly say that if you want to talk about deep concepts that mess with the mind, space, and time all at the same time, this is the guy to go to. When I was a staff member I can remember all of the conversations that we had about Interstellar and Inception. We constantly showed and taught each other new things that allowed both of us to look at the movies from completely different viewpoints. He was also one of the persons who helped me get through the tough time of my father losing his job. I can’t thank you enough for the constant support of being there and also being able to talk about things only nerd would talk about. &lt;3</div><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(131, 131, 131); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  "><br></div><br style="color: rgb(131, 131, 131); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  "><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(131, 131, 131); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  ">-MajestysDream/CrafterPete1013: When a certain person was demoted from the staff team who also happened to be my best friend, I needed someone else to talk to. I had no-one to constantly just talk about my personal feelings and also the problems that are going on IRL. You helped me get through so many rough things including: My Fathers Job, a current friend situation, girl problems, and also many more things. I don’t know what I would do without you man! &lt;3</div><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(131, 131, 131); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  "><br></div><br style="color: rgb(131, 131, 131); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  "><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(131, 131, 131); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  ">- Cal/Lavish/Calwhovian: People say that you aren't supposed to trust strangers. Well if we didn't, how would we get anything done. If you look at it, the world is based around doing new things and meeting new people. Heck, if you don't talk to strangers, you will never get a job. Cal, when I first joined teamspeak as a randy, You were the first person person that I talked to. I didn't know anybody, never knew who I would meet, but in the sight of me being alone, you stepped up and actually talked to me. I remember the first conversation that we had together and what we talked about even to this day. We applied for staff together, we served as mods together, we got demoted (not at the same time but still together), we made a build team together, we had conversations on end with each other. I don't have a brother, and the closest thing I had since I meet you was a dog named Toby. I mean my dog is great company, but you helped me define who I want to become. I dont want to trade the last five months of minecraft for any other gaming experience, in the world, all because of one person, you. Ever since Day 1 we have been friends. We have always been together and I don't ever want to lose contact with you, and I want you to be the brother that I wish I could always have. You are, my Ravish Brother. I love you bro! &lt;3</div><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(131, 131, 131); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  "><br></div><br style="color: rgb(131, 131, 131); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  "><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(131, 131, 131); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  ">I would love to thank every single one of you for everything that you have given me, but I cannot do it due to the limited space in the Avicus Text Box.

Ladies and gentlemen I present to you, the most controversial Batch of Jr. Mods that ever came out of Avicus. No in all seriousness, this batch was so much fun to be around. Almost all of us worked so well together and we could do many great tasks when we put our minds to it. Sure we had our faults and maybe we made mistakes, but you guys were sure to make it seem like we were having fun.</div><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(131, 131, 131); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  "><br></div><br style="color: rgb(131, 131, 131); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  "><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(131, 131, 131); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  ">The Avicus Revolution Group: I'm guessing about only 15 People actually know about this group. However, it was super fun to do this. So back in the days of the last Staff Reassessment day, there formed a group. A group that decided to change the staff team for the better. We had roles, jobs, and other responsibilities to fulfill. We even had a document for the whole process and it turned out to seem pretty successful at the time. We gathered tons of information against some of the staff members and we put it all together. I was literally about to go to kylos door and have a chat with him about this. (He lives one hour away.) Here is a link to our main document if you would like to view it. (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/12MasevVPcri0AtktnruN3-KbYsEsdWh9eHHKrd-02f0/edit?usp=docslist_api">https://docs.google.com/document/d/12MasevVPcri0AtktnruN3-KbYsEsdWh9eHHKrd-02f0/edit?usp=docslist_ap...</a>) There were some things removed from the document due to confidentiality reasons, but most of it is still there. I was considered the mockingjay of the group, since I was the one no one though would be demoted. However I am not here to talk about that. I'm just here to remember all of the fun we had planning this attack and to some extent, even though we died off, it worked. It worked super successfully as well. The people in these groups I would trust them with my life and I will make sure to always remember this.</div><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(131, 131, 131); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  "><br></div><br style="color: rgb(131, 131, 131); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  "><div style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(131, 131, 131); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  ">Ravish Build Team: I will talk about this a lot more before I leave in chat, but thank you so much guys for always being there and being super fun to build with.

I will be building one more map with my bud cal. You can expect the map in the coming weeks, but if there is one thing that I want to leave here with, it is with your love and compassion.

Thanks man! I will miss a lot of people here but I have decided to move on for better reasons. I will still be here in spirit, but I will be doing a lot of background work. It was really nice to get to know you.

Though I'm sad about you leaving,&nbsp;I'm also absolutely happy for you, with all the success you've gained. To be given the chance to work at Twitter and get the girl that you love should be the greatest thing for you. I couldn't be happier for a friend like you.<br><br>This isn't a goodbye, but a see you later, cause I know I'm always going to be able to talk to you again sometime later in life.<br><br>So see you later buddy
