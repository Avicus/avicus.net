<ol><li>Yeah maniac is broken :(</li><li>Cowboy was kind of OP. I'd take a horse and armor over pretty much every other kit just because of speed bonus</li><li>IMO leech doesn't need a nerf. It's just as balanced as the other kits, if not a bit underpowered sometimes, due to the fact that you can eat a gapple for pretty much the same effect</li></ol>
