You always seem very eager to help in anything involving XML/YML. I haven't talked to you much, but you give to the community by helping tests maps on your server, and you're a pretty nice person in general. Sad that you're leaving though :(

I kinda met you a while ago but never really talked. I fought a few 1v1s with you and that's really all. I watch your videos and you seem to play good for Apollo. Also used to talk to Zero about you for some reason lol. You wanted to know me better through MCZoners, though that isn't going to happen. Now that you've come back, I hope to know you more. Also, I'm always scared of you in-game, I don't know why

You thought I was shit, immediate thumbs down. jk you're annoying af when you keep spamming "scrim" or "mega scrim", but besides that, you can be a great friend and funny sometimes. You're decent at the game and you're one of the people from OCN I respect. Also you need a mike noob, isn't Eric sending you one or something

When I first saw you in-game on Infernus after you got unbanned, I thought I saw a god, though you still are now xddd. You're a friendly and funny person who makes me laugh a lot. You like swearing a lot, though most of the time I'm able to tolerate. I don't really know if you consider me as a friend at all lol. You used to complain about Avicus kb, of course now you don't, gotten better at the game too

Though it was a while ago, I kinda get bothered when you ignore my hi. Of course now I don't really care anymore. I tried to know you better but I never really gotten the chance. All I know is that you were once a senior mod and that's pretty much all.

I don't actually know what Portugal is like, all I know is Ronaldo and that fire that's spreading. So I can't say anything about that<br><br>You can be pretty annoying, but you've became better at the sword and a pretty nice person. Other than that, I don't really know anything else, maybe your bodyboarding or something

You're another fellow Singaporean, which is cool. You're also an old guy and friend, though you randomly disappeared and I forgot about you for a while. Then I saw you on OCN and then you got unbanned and here we are. You're good at PvP for your ping too :)))))

You can be annoying sometimes, but when you're not, you can be really nice to talk to. You've improved a lot in your sword too, though it's sad you get rejected out of pretty much every team.

You like your pingu and cheesepuffs, ok at Pvp. You turned from a randy to a regular mod. You also do your mod job decently I guess. I see you mostly in slack and not in-game.<br><br>Yes, I like cheese things<br><br>Pancakes<br><br>I'm horrible at rating, I'm really inconsistent, so maybe a 5/10
