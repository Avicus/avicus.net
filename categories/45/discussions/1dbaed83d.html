Hello Avicus, if any of you have been wondering where I've been for the last 1-2 months well I have a few reasons, and if you're interested -&nbsp;<br><br>* My Internet is being a pain, but it should be fixed soon.<br><br>* My Desktop (Gaming Computer) Is currently messing up so it's kind of made me not really want to play Minecraft because I only have my old laptop which runs on about 30fps where my desktop runs on about 300-400.<br><br>* I've been really busy irl, I'm in the process of moving schools so I'm a busy person lols.<br><br>So that's for those of you who have been wondering... but in the time I've been busy I've gathered that Avicus has changed well the new website, and new hub is all I've gathered so far, I've also heard about Nexus opening but is there anything else I should know?<br><br>Also, have I missed the Staff Interviews because I spent a lot of time on my application and as far as my knowledge goes, I haven't been accepted nor denied so what's the deal with those (My Application isn't coming up in the "Staff Applications" tab) So yeah anyone who does know about the things that are going on, please leave them below! Thanks :D

The staff applications will become available when the old forums are.

I don't think they already did interviews yet. Either that, or I was a complete idiot and missed when I was supposed to interview.

When we changed the website, the old forums didn't transfer over, we are still working on recovering them.<br><br>Also, staff applications are still under review, don't worry.
