Aphelion, I understand Juanoh might have offended you, but please do not argue! :) Just move on please! Remember if someone disagrees with you you can just ignore them! Also, since you have gotten into arguments such as this many times in recent history, I would suggest you ease up before you land yourself in trouble!

I mean generally, you are the one that starts the argument dude! :/ I'm not picking on anyone in particular I just saw that your post instigated the argument between you and Juano. If Juano post's something like that you can just ignore it, and report it..... Overall Im seeing you argue with people a lot, which therefore led to that post.. I mean if you look at your posts, the first 4 (all that I looked at) are arguments..<br><br>I don't want to sound rude man! Please just acknowledge and move on :)

Next time you tell me off, you should also tell him off as he is as much involved in this as I am. I expect you to treat everybody the same, whether they are donors or not.

I'm not arguing, I asked a simple question, I should be entitled to at least one answer. When you can answer me, I will leave it be.

You are arguing though, arguing has a broad term and you are doing it by trying to appeal against a warning against you by protesting your innocence. Don't try to blanket it over, you are doing that.<br><br>To put it bluntly, get off your high horse. Juanoh made a joke, it was a clear joke, you chose to be sensitive and respond to try and fight for your ego because you felt that it had been attacked and your perception would be viewed negatively. Don't say 'that is a lie, I don't know what you think' etc. Because it is pretty blatant that is how you felt or why would you respond in such a childish manner, essentially stooping yourself below Juanoh?<br><br>Stop trying to victimise yourself, you carried on with the argument, you are still doing it now, the staff are being extremely patient. If I was them I would of put you in your place waaay before. Get over it, if you can't take that then you are not gonna have a good life at all, stop being sensitive. They also stated that they have seen you argue a lot before and the frequency is high, Juanoh clearly has at least a lot smaller frequency of your argumentative spree, they are saying you are doing it too much and are being too sensitive.<br><br>Your question is retarded, you are trying to make the staff seem bias, every human is bias but you took this way out of hand putting you in the wrong more than Juanoh, you are acting like a child, so you are being treat like one. There is no bias here. From your posts I have gathered that you are an extremely ignorant, egotistical person who is way to sensitive for their own good.

I could honestly not care less. Extremely ignorant and egotistical person? Yes. Sensitive? No. <br>I will only refer to my previous post. <i>"Tbh I don't really care or concern if people "hate me" on a pixelgame forum nor on the internet."</i><br><br>I'm waiting for an official post from a staff member until then I will just ignore you and the other people :) <br><br>If they feel so offended by my posts, why don't they ban me already? I even requested it when jozz was admin, I told him to ban me if I broke any rule, never happened because I haven't done it.<br><br>Goodjob anyways bud :)

Aphelion, the reason why you get "picked on." Is because you are always the catalyst in an argument. Also your last 10-12 pages of posts are all arguments. Furthermore, you have posted a lot more flame than Juanoh, therefore you would generally be the lead perpetrator in arguments. Also I will have you know, I talked to Juano privately.. There is no favoritism.<br><br>There ya goo man...&nbsp;<b>(</b><b>Official By Me)</b>

Well if you couldn't care less, then why are you arguing? You are being sensitive, your ego is making you blind to it. You can choose to ignore me but what I said previously apparently sums up how they feel about the situation, so yeah I did do a good job :)&nbsp;<br><br>Also, please stop playing the victim card. You aren't the victim here, stop trying to take the moral high ground in the situation. I am pretty sure you broke a rule, just not under the staffs radar but you won't admit that anyway. Although I doubt that jozz would permanently ban you for breaking a rule, you are not that special.&nbsp;<br><br>If you do reply, I will most likely continue the argument with you even though I shouldnt. It's an argument based off nothing and you are fighting a losing cause. Basically arguing with you can be put like this , arguing with you is like playing chess with a pigeon, you can checkmate it all you want but in the end it will always knock over all the pieces, shit on the board and walk around in victory.

I wouldn't be posting anything if I didn't know what I was talking about, don't you understand it yet? I even know who is removing my posts even though it is confidential information. You shouldn't think I know jackshit when I clearly know what happens "behind the scene".

you think the staff are being bias to Juano? Look how many fucking infractions he has, that is definitely not the right ingredients for mod bias.
