Spawnkilling Boundaries

Ok, so I recently got my first infraction for spawnkilling, which I do not agree with, but I'll get to that later.&nbsp;<br><br>So I was kicked, as someone who's generally careful about spawnkilling. The person I was "spawnkilling" on Nexus would repeatedly run away back to their spawn when they got to half health. I got tired of the running and so when they ran, I chased them down and would kill them quite&nbsp;<u><i>near<b></b></i></u> their spawn and 2-4 times I knocked them away from their spawn as they were about to enter to kill them. I only killed this person&nbsp;<b><u>inside</u></b><u></u> their spawn once. All their deaths were only&nbsp;<u><i>near</i></u><i></i> spawn, with the exception of 1 of my kills against this player. Needless to say, I was pretty surprised and no message came up that I had been kicked, and the fact that I had been kicked with no verbal warning, (or if there was one, a very vague one) seemed so far-fetched to me that I didn't even consider it, I only noticed when I checked my infractions page casually a couple days later.<br><br>Later when I was playing another match, one of the players in the game accused a different staff member of spawnkilling, this staff member stated that It was perfectly legal to follow people back into/near spawn when they run away.&nbsp;<br><br>So I see two completely opposite sides and I was wondering if there should be less "gray area" in-between legal and non-legal kills (spawnkill vs non-spawnkill). Even getting staff more on the same page would be helpful, It will never be perfect though, and I know that.<br><br>I feel like this is something that could be resolved, but hasn't yet. As I see so many different definitions of spawnkilling amongst staff, that it's very confusing for the players of the server imo.&nbsp;<br><br>I just want a little more clarity as to the boundaries of spawnkilling and what would be/not be considered so.&nbsp;<br><br>Note: Not hating on staff, just advice/curiosity (map was Canyon)<i></i>

When a player runs out of their spawn then you chase them back in to the spawn and kill them is not spawn killing as long as you don't attack anyone else.

Yea. In the rules it says you have to let the player be aware of their surroundings. They obviously are aware so it should be ok. But then, why can you get kicked if spawnkilling is impossible in many maps?

It is legal to chase a player into their spawn&nbsp;<b><b>AS LONG AS&nbsp;</b></b>you kill the player and immediately run out.&nbsp; You also can't harm anyone else in the spawn.

I dont think you shouldve been kicked ._.<br><br><br>Also, on Halcyon i see this happen a lot but its worse. Halcyon has it so if they run intyo the spawn, you actually CANT hit them. You get a message saying you arent allowed to, yet they can kill you. So i can relate, sorta.

If you just chased somebody back into spawn who had already hit you it shouldn't result in an infraction. I have confirmed with many mods that that is legal. This also could have just been bad timing, as in the mod only saw you chase the player into spawn and kill him, but not him hitting you first. Seeing as I wasn't there at the time, I can't really make any&nbsp;accusations.

Practically impossible unless they send an email to support.<br><br><b>@OP</b> Rather than complaining on the Forums, just email support... This is not how you get official responses from senior staff, depending on the topic of course.<br><br>Besides, I believe the map devs were working on adding redstone around "out of bounds" regions to alert players that there is a potential of being <i>called out</i> for spawnkilling.

You got kicked for spawn killing. M3h! I got temp-banned for it. No warning, no kick, just temp ban right there. Anyway, the mod in question did their job so I had nothing to complain about in the end.

Unfortunatly there is nothing in the rules to say whether chasing after a person into the spawn counts as spawn killing, which obviously means that it is up to the mods descision.&nbsp;<br><br>Just appeal it if you disagree with their descision.

What does appealing an Kick achieve. Not like it changes anything on the persons infraction page.

I agree with you man, where they have the fine line/ strict rules on spawn killing, and i hate it when you get close to a kill and the person just flees repeatedly, so I'm with you on this one, but i guess the dude who you were killing FELT LIKE he was being spawn killed and was getting annoyed as well, but yeah, i know what you mean, +1 :)

It makes your reputation better and it also helps when staff are deciding another punishment for you, they take into account your other infractions. So if you appeal it the staff would be more lenient.

This was only to get clarity as to what the boundaries were for spawnkilling, as I've seen so many different definitions of it.

I did<u></u>&nbsp;<u>not</u> harm anyone else in the spawn, and if I did, I only hit them once or twice by mistake when they got in the way while I was going for the other person who was running into spawn, but left them alone and killed no one else and backed off to let them out.<br><br>Feel free to lock

Spawn killing IMO is going into the spawn and hitting players or shooting into the spawn.

My point exactly. There are so many different views on what is considered "spawnkilling" and what isn't, and I think it would be beneficial to get staff a little more on the same page with this and things like this in the future. There will always be grey area, but trying to at least get rid of some of it would make the staff team's job easier imo.<br><br>No hate.

as far as I know, running back into spawn and then getting killed is nothing wrogn about it. But then, what is with maps like Travincal 1, where players cant even go into spawn? I have often seen people abusing that spawn protection to shoot out of safety/kill someone after regening. same for venomous TDM. Of course you shouldn't be able to get killed as soon as you spawn one hit, but still there is no need for you to have infinity protection in your spawn, as that also gets abused again.
