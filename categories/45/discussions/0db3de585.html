These threads are usually marked as spam, but Im just making one to prevent the infinite number of threads to come after (give it an hour or two).<br><br>But yeah, I quit. I'm not retiring, I'm quitting. I might go into more detail later. Don't ask me why, it's for reasons that I find quite bullcrap in a sense, but you know, that's how it works.<br><br>Not quitting Avicus, not re-applying again. I'll be on Teamspeak occasionally in case you would like to discuss anything. But yeah, I quit with my head up high and without the stress of moderator I can enjoy other servers and toast life.<br><br>~JP

Yeah, being a mod really seems boring.. ._.<br>All you want to do is play the game and then some hacker comes on and you have to see if (s)he's really hacking or not, then ban him/her..<br>I don't know about you, but I'd rather just play and have fun, which is the point of me being on this server.<br>You made a good choice :3

I don't know what goes on in the staff break room, so I won't say much... .-.<br>I guess being moderator is quite stressful. I understand, just wanting to play the game without having to deal with duties and small annoyances. If your choice makes you happy, I'm perfectly fine with it.
