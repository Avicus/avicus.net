Hey guys, today was 9/11, and it is a very emotional day for the U.S., feel free to share on how you or anyone you know has been affected&nbsp;by 9/11.<br><br>Personally, my mom had an old friend who worked where the hit zone was in the South Tower of the WTC. Anything else, I don't want to specify.<br><br>-Perhaps

With the growing age of this generation (including me) I found that my class took it more of a joke. Although I am from Australia and didn't effect me (I am only 13, so I wasn't born when the bombings happened) I still feel like it is a very serious topic and shouldn't be a joke. All my respects go towards to people who died on that day.
