So basically like other people, I have school/homework/other stuff to worry about. This game was my favorite and&nbsp;<b>no&nbsp;</b>this is NOT a leaving post. I hate to leave this position, but a lot of stuff made me realize that this game should be the least of my concerns. I don't know if ill come back in the future, and yes I'm still deciding on whether this is just temporary (hopefully if it is ill get accepted back). I'm also done with staff getting shat on just because they had to do their job. Yes some of us make mistakes because we're f****** humans, and we don't deserve to have it pointed out. I'm also sick and tired of moderators getting no voice in some staff decisions, we try our best everyday to request for new donation perks, or new rules, and new tools that may help us do our jobs easier, but as always we never get an answer OR it gets shot down. I will not point any fingers but you know who you are. These are some people i would like to thank during my position as a moderator.&nbsp;<br><br><b>ColdCraft</b>: I can honestly write pages about this kid, we have alottotttttt in common and he was the first player i met. Without him, i could've never gotten to where i was on this server.<br><br><b>Tynvale:&nbsp;</b>This kid, omg. He's been there for me through the toughest times, and his videos are great! When i first saw Tyn's videos i thought "This kids a natural". If you guys haven't met him yet, then you're missing out. Hes like a big brother to me. Never change buddy.&nbsp;<br><br><b>MLGPorky:&nbsp;</b>Even though he left, this sac of pork has taught me everything i know of when i was a mod. Hes like a brother to me and hes the only kid on the block that's not scared to voice out his talents. Really hope you come back<br><br><b>Britney:&nbsp;</b>You're the nicest senior mod I've ever encountered. You make sure that both parties are happy when making tough decisions. You sacrifice alot for this team, and its shown people that without a doubt you deserve Senior Mod.<br><br><b>GrapeSmoothie:&nbsp;</b>This kid is honestly the most relatable,funny, and most optimistic kid I've ever met. Hes been there for the staff team, and hes allays on to help out the community. If you don't laugh to his jokes, then you need help and some jesus. Stay sassy Greg.<br><br><b>Flo:&nbsp;</b>This dude is just fun to be with (not to mention his cool accent) he also has a habit of targeting me and getting karma at the same time. He's a great mod and hes a great friend. STAY ON CTH PLES.&nbsp;<br><br><b></b><b>Steven:&nbsp;</b>Sad to see him go too, but this kid is a great mapdev. Hes fun to be with on team speak, and hes weird (in a good way). Hes not affrain to stand up for himself, and he sure as hell doesn't take crap from salty people. *AIRHORN NNOISES*<br><b><br></b><b>Merlin:&nbsp;</b>This dude is like a brother to me, we've helped each other through tough times, and i can always trust him when it comes to talking about grilz. He also comes up with the funniest videos and music. Stay crazy my friend xD<br><br><b>Sessp &amp; Snowruuuu:&nbsp;</b>AHHhahh my ranting buddies, you guys rock! And if it weren't for you guys, then avicus would've went into chaos while we were asleep. Even though we have screwed up time-zones, you guys are great to hangout with, and i hope we can continue to rant on team speak. &nbsp;You guys are honestly the best.<br><br><b>Pop:&nbsp;</b>This dude has the best music in the world, hes full of jokes, and hes also full of creativity. He also doesnt take crap from salty people. Without him, teamspeak and avicus would be boring. *Guitar solo*<br><br><b>Peachy:&nbsp;</b>Without this fruit, Avicus would've went to crap. This player without a doubt stuck through when times got tough, and without him i could've never experienced the pleasure of being a moderator.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><b>Avicus Moderators:&nbsp;</b>You guys will still stay with me, even though i left. I want to talk and laugh and rant with you guys everyday. Keep avicus in balance, and fight for what you deserve. I love you guys sooo much, and hopefully if thievery gets better, Ill be back. STAY STRONG MODS, AND DONT TAKE JACK SHIT FROM HATERS.<br><br><b>Avicus MapDevs:&nbsp;</b>Without you guys avicus would be lame, boring, and it would be in black and white. You guys are the life source of avicus. Stay creative and crazy, and i hope that you guys will get more tools to help you out in the future.&nbsp;<br><br><br><br><b>Avicus Community:&nbsp;</b>Where do i start. If it wasnt for you guys i wouldve never applied for staff, or wouldve stayed on avicus. You guys are needed here to help and enjoy your time. Some salt my be passed around, but you guys are the only reason why i havent completely quit minecraft. Hopefully new perks and plugins will make their way to make you gaming experience better. YOU GUYS ARE AWSOME, TALENTED, AND GREAT. Never forget that....<br><br><b>Mods who were demoted at an unfair situation:</b> You guys need to come back stronger than ever. I hate it that you guys got removed for stuff that weren't even on the expectations sheet. Ily all&nbsp;<br><br>If i didnt mention you, dont feel bad, and dont think youre not important. Everyone i met that played or still play this server have a special place in my heart, you guys are the reason avicus is still alive. Never change aswell.<br><br>o/

We always had the same mindset when it came to everything that was right and wrong with any situation.<br><br>Enjoy retirement, put your feet up and relax.<br>You've definitely deserved it!
