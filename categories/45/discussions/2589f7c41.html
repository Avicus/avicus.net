So recently, I've been seeing lots of staff saying "Please don't bump old topics". I think I know what a bump is, but correct me if I'm wrong. Isn't it when you bring an old topic back up? I don't understand why we can't do that. As long as it's on topic of the thread, why can't we talk about it?

Well you can, what you bump with has to be on topic and not just some random thing like the user Blueish showed everyone. If you see an old topic read the post then reply but really you don't HAVE to reply on old topics. Some topics just don't need anymore replys.

A bump is usually a post on a very old topic that is either irrelevant/spammy or better suited for another topic/place.<br><br>Most of the time either the thread is irrelevant or the posts do not contribute much to the thread.

You didn't have to bump dawson's topic. Seriously, you know he's back and you don't need to say welcome back 2 months later on a thread.

Bumps are only allowed if the comment in question is on topic.<br>If a bump is completely off topic<i> that</i> is when the topic gets locked.<br>As long as the comment is relevant to the OP, it's completely fine.<br><br>The staff need to be more specific when locking topics to avoid this type of confusion.<br>This wasn't a problem a while ago...staff used to be quite specific when locking threads.

In theory yes.<br>But it's very unlikely that such a popular thread will be dormant for such a long time.<br><br>Also, considering it's one of Avicus' main threads, I would assume that the off-topic post would just be archived, with the player getting warned and everything going back to normal.<br>I doubt the staff are that ignorant to just straight up lock it..like, why lock the face thread because of one person's off-topic bump? Just archive the post.

I guess not.<br><br>Generally threads with a higher view count are less likely to encounter idle periods, meaning that something like is won't happen often.<br><br>This was simply my assumption, if I were the staff member I would just archive the post and leave it as that.<br>Considering players only get verbal warnings for first-time offenses it should be fine,<br><br>But you're right, all threads should be treated equally when Moderating, just like how all players should be treated equally when Moderating.

People bump their video hubs just in case people miss it. Bumps that are irrelevant, useless or are supposed to be funny are just no. Like bumping someone's returning AMA post although knowing that person has been back for like 2 months.

What I did was an accident and I didn't know. If he wants to talk about what I did he can go somewhere else. I wasn't assuming that he was trying to insult me, just that he brought an unnecessary example. There's no need for that. There is no "respectful disagreeing" because a bump has a meaning, and it's not up for discussion.

Maybe if you were mature enough to read what I said the first time and not arguing for the sake of it, you would understand that what I meant was a mistake. He made his point, and he's bringing up the mistake I did. We shouldn't be having this conversation either way because this is explaining what a bump is, not telling me about the mistakes I did. Stop with calling out the mistakes, and if you don't have reference for me or other players about a bump, don't post on this thread.

He was staying on topic. He used it as an example to prove a point, not to insult you. Nobody is calling out your mistake and is just using it as an example to explain it to others. Noone here is judging you for bumping that topic. Can we please stay on topic now ? Thank you

I didn't say who it was, I didn't mention any names. You're the one fueling this.

</div>
Because everyone knows who it is, there's no reason to mention it. I'm not fueling it by telling you to stop. Now I'm sorry but can you read English? I said I was sorry already, there's no reason to say that in a topic where I was trying to see if I had the right idea of it. Now enough with this discussion, find a different example
