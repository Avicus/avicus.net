<center><b>What is this game and what is it for?</b><br>I am really curious to find out people's opinions on me. So for fun I am making a little game for it!<br><br><b>How to play:<br></b><span style="text-align: start;">So first of all give your full opinion on the person above you.<br>This is optional, but you can give your full opinion on me<br></span><br><b>PLEASE DON'T BE RUDE OR START A FLAME WAR! THIS IS FOR FUN!<br></b><b><br>I'll start, I guess I have to give my opinions on myself...</b></center><b><br>Tynvale:&nbsp;</b>From what I have seen you're an absolute g0d. Some even call you a Future Savage and I agree, I really like your great looks and I love talking to you on TS! I am big sub on your Youtube and I see you getting to 10 subs any day now, I am still quite emotional about the restart but I understand &lt;3<b><br></b>

I hope I don't get ninjad when writing this reply..<br>Tynvale, like in stories, there is a perfect person which is a great friend, one of those you can actually trust, one of those that you can be sure that won't talk trash about you and do stuff behind your back. I can fully trust you in anything, I enjoy talking to you in ts, sharing stuff with you and playing with you. also ur nan xddd &lt;3333<br><br><br>Edit: ninjad ;-; so will write opinion on zac.<br>scrub. Too fun. Needs seriousness. John cena. Snack bar.<br>but in a serious note. You taught me to enjoy stuff that I do and take minecraft easily and not super seriously, that actually helped me a lot, I also enjoyed leading with you. &lt;3

For the rare times we are both online at the same time, either on teamspeak or ingame you seem and are a really nice and fun person to be around. You like to mess around but when it's needed you can become serious. Just keep being you :)

I see you on the forums a lot but my opinion for you is little. I barely know you so you are just known as 'That person." I would be able to say I know you if someone asked but if they asked what team, position, any other questions I wouldn't know. You also come off as a know-at-all sometimes

I'll have you know that daniel here is a very educated young fellow with a booming voice, he slays pussy left, right and center. Could he get your nan? You better believe it. He was once in sent from heavens, what were you in? Cronus, that's right, is he spanish? No but he was such a lad that they let him in anyway. One day he will rule his parents basement and own a neckbeard, pussy will still come but in the shape of a hole in the wall. But could he knock you out? Damn right he could.
