Hey everyone,<br><br>Today, I'm going to be talking about something a bit glum. But I encourage everyone to read this. Please note that this is NOT an attention seeking post.<br><br>Lately, I've noticed an increase of inappropriate jokes (rape jokes). I'd like to point out that this can be a <b>very</b> sensitive topic for some people, me included. Many of the players that make these jokes probably do not realise the damage these 'jokes' can do. I've gotten them alot, from multiple people, and I would like to state that I was almost raped a couple of years back. These comments stir up memories that I do not need. Mods do a great job at keeping these people at bay, but they can't be on 24/7. I'd just like to make this known, if it isn't already.<br><br>So, think before you type. "Is this really what I want to do? Why do I want to say this?"<br><br>Thanks for reading,<br><br>-Sky

Sorry about your past, I don't use them, but I don't think this thread is gonna make any difference to the amount of rape jokes on avicus. (I don't see much anyway.)<br>Its like calling things cancer and ebola. Yes, its very offensive, but people still do it.

Yea it's right from what I know xD And yes sky you are right. I never saw someone making these kind of jokes and I never made such a joke, but if I see someone doing it I'll report them.

I think the same, Sky.<br>I feel you for your past, and I'm very sorry about it.<br>I think the people have to read it, and stop saying that type of stupid jokes, they are very inappropriate and totally unnecessary for what a pvp server is. I'd love these guys who do it think about it and how can one of that jokes makes the day of someone unhappy and that they're wasting time on it. <br>But also, thank you sky for be very strong and tell it to us, you are a great person for write it and post it. This surely will help the world to be a better place. :)

Yeah. It is really inappropriate and I'm sorry about what happened. I know someone in my school last year got raped once and almost again (not her fault whatsoever), and it really tears you apart as a person. This is nothing to joke about and I cringe at the thought of such jokes being made. I feel like this is a sensitive topic and should be taken seriously and punishments handed out accordingly. I have no experience with such, but I know what those experiences can do do a person and I really wish the best for you and hope that such jokes are not used in the future. Thanks for alerting staff this is happening on my behalf and the community's. It really is bothersome that this is happening.&nbsp;<br><br>Thanks for coming out and saying such, not to be cheesy, but that's pretty damn brave of you for coming out and saying that. Even if it is over a screen. Much respect.&nbsp;<br><br>-ShadowSlayerZ7

Did they attack you in-game? Do you have screenshots of it or do you remember their name? If you do, you shouldn't hesitate to report them, every player who attacked you with these stupid jokes.

It's enough for me to quote you.<br><br>"I'll personally stop using them". <br><br>I'll is a contraction of I will. Why will you stop "using rape jokes" when you "never" joke about it? It doesn't make any sense to me.

That's still bringing up the memories of that bad time. I'm sure everyone's opinion would change a little if they were a victim (I'm not a victim. Just to clarify). A lot of people are seriously changed after. At a mention of it, depending on the person and situation, etc. could have a complete emotional breakdown because of the upbringing of such memories. So it does matter when someone says it, regardless of age, intelligence or maturity, because it's a super touchey topic and something that seriously affects you as a person.

Yeah, well. Like Shadow said, you can't really escape memories. I understand that this stuff happens online. Even in the real world people poke fun at me because of this. I'm just like "wtf it wasn't even my fault." So, I learned to deal with it. But I can't get over memories, not many people can.<br>I guess it might be hard to understand, but trust me, it is not easy to "get over it", no matter who the comment is coming from.

You know,&nbsp;it isn't&nbsp;just 9 year old kids who joke about it, just take a look at ************. I have&nbsp;seen well known players on Avicus who joke about it and they sure are not 9 year old, I would say at least 15 - 16. I'm also surprised how they are allowed to joke about it, then again, of course they are as they are well known.

It's more of a general topic for the public.<br>To shed some light on the issue.

You're putting "well known" into the wrong context.<br>Not punishing people due to popularity is a common form of bias, and biased Moderators get demoted.

I'm sorry to say it, but yes, well known players are not punished just because they are well known.

Please refrain from posting if your post are not contributing to the topic. Thomas_Shoe too, you shouldn't post if you haven't even read the first post.

I doubt it.<br>You don't know the full situation when a player does or does not get punished.<br><br>Moderators have reasons when deciding to punish somebody or not.

I just want to say that I am only 10 years old and I have been seeing this a lot lately so I think you did the right thing sky, and the only thing I can do to get the ones doing this to stop is to say stop. Besides it's not like we can show our emotions through the computer.

This is true. I mean if you banned all the regs the server would have an issue, but still...&nbsp;<br><br>Anyways, this is kinda off topic and I would like to keep the spam on a post like this to the minimum, as I really feel that this is an important topic :)
