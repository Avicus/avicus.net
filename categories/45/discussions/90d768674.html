The long awaited movie based on the game World of Warcraft by Blizzard Entertainment was finally released today. Is anyone planning on seeing it or if you have what were your opinions of the movie. Let's try to keep the as spoiler free as possible for anyone still waiting to go see it. Trailer:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Rxoz13Bthc" title="Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Rxoz13Bthc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Rxoz13Bthc</a><br><br>I personally thought it was a great movie. For a movie based on a game it was phenomenal. If I had to rate it out of 10 I would rate about a 8/10. There were some parts that didn't quite fit what was going on.

I find it odd that even Nobbel gave it a 7/10 while other reviewers gave it 4-5/10 lol. I hope to see it some point this weekend or just wait until the directors cut comes out on DVD.

Fans of the game or people who have heard the lore before rate the movie much higher than&nbsp;critics, it seems.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="  font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial;   background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">I enjoyed the film. I know
some crazy lore nerds are angry about how the story was different from the
game, book, etc. though when seeing this film I went in knowing it was going to
be different and I was ok with that, but I thought they did a good job at
trying to keep it somewhat simple and close to the original story. Though I do
feel if you didn't know what was going on you were kinda loss with what happens
with&nbsp;medivh and how fel came into the universe and why it gives the orcs
strength, etc... I will say the CGI was fucking amazing and it felt realistic.
I thought there were some cheesy lines though what do you expect. I also think
if they explained the corrupted of the fel energy/blood it would have tied
somethings together then again it was a two hour movie and even then there was
a lot of things going on and we didn't get enough of a background of the main
characters and overall things were rushed. I also thought the ending was a bit
dumb but I thought the overall scene was done well.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="  font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial;   background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">I personally enjoyed the
movie a lot though it is a bit bias since I have played "WoW" for so
long and enjoyed it. 8/10 for me.&nbsp;</span></p>

Why was my post removed? I was just expressing my opinions on the irrelevance of this thread.
