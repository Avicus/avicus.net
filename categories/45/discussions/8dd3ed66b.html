Hey all!&nbsp;<br>As I'm writing this I still have my Moderating tag but that will soon go.&nbsp;<br>Its been an absolute pleasure, I've met so many of you and had some amazing times but as we all have to do someday is leave and for me that time is now.&nbsp;<br>Lets be honest here some of you will be ecstatic :P <br>I didn't want to leave without a notice so here it is. <br>I'm sure the staff team will continue on, good luck to all of you including the new future staff members.<br>Hopefully I've influenced you all in one way or another, to tell you the truth I can't believe I've gotten this far and stayed this long.&nbsp;<br>This server means a bunch to me, thankyou again &lt;3<br>Just remember there is more out in the world for all of us and don't get stuck on the little things.
