These are some donator rank suggestions...<br><br><br>1. Given an amount of credits, when the rank is bought. What I mean by this, is that once you buy the rank, you will be given a certain amount of credits<br>Gold - 1000<br>Emerald - 3000<br>Diamond - 5000<br>2. Maybe certain kits on nexus, walls and cth, you have to be a donator to use.<br>3. In the hub, make things only able for donators....<br><br><br>this may actually make users want a donation rank...

There were actually many suggestions already made before, it's just that they were never put into place.

I think the kits thing won't work as Avicus likes to follow the EULA. Maybe if the kits could be boght with credits, it would work out since everyone gets the oppurtunity to get that kit they desire. The donatos would be able to get credits faster given the credits booster.

Rilo I see your attempt in trying but, keep in mind, the advantages that donors already have is not helping. If anything, no one wants to buy the rank. Like no one wants to have the advantage to join full teams when this server can't even hold one. The unlimited and extra slots in enderchest is stupidity because you probably won't be able to hold a lot before the next "big" update.

Personally I think the server needs to grow much bigger before people start thinking donator ranks are worth it

It's not fair to assume that the developers haven't got their act together when you have no idea how much work they're actually doing.

Considering that its been 2-3 months since the last major donator rank suggestion (it was even made by the staff, and brought up in meetings&nbsp;<i>with kylo</i>), the devs aren't really doing anything donor-wise<br><br>And they have a list of things their doing at the moment <a href="https://avicus.net/forums/f936db328">https://avicus.net/forums/f936db328</a><br>Nothing about donor ranks
