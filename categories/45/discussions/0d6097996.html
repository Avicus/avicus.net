@kycrafft @voltdrive This has nothing to do with Avicus' servers or network. I'm sorry but I find it very annoying when people make statements like this. It's inaccurate and just leads to more confusion as to what lag is. Any lag you experience is client side if other users are not experiencing the same lag.

The server crashed 4 times within a couple of hours not to long ago, no it wasn't just me because there would be a long list of people joining after I joined and all the games would be empty. Second It's not client lag because I pressed f3 a few times during lag and found that I was holding at 40 fps (normal fps.) I am not out to make Funky angry I am just questioning why this is happening.

A server crash is not the result of lag and lag is not result of a server crash. Lag by its definition is just a symptom of a poor server or network and cannot. If you are referring to the issues we had earlier this week, I addressed them in the Admin Blog category. The issues we faced then was unique and certainly not recurring as we haven't had any similar issues with server crashes since nor had we had many before.

But ivy a while ago there's a major lag happening earlier which is around 6pm here and most people are affected that they raged and they coudn't move or what but after an hour, the lag lessened and some are even lag free. Is it the server lag again or the minecraft itself?

I was connected to the server nearly all day and never encountered such issues. I'm not sure what to say... If there is server lag, it will be universal, affecting all players (at least all players in the same match, more commonly the entire server).

I'm still wondering why cause franken said that the other mini games like nexus are lag free at that time exept nebula. I think nebula is the only one who got this problem at that time which is weird. Oh btw, please fix the lag on rendezvous 3 which is there's an area there that is laggy which is it's either the screen froze or lagged out

Ah yeah there needs to be clarification on the lag issue. &nbsp;I know for me it is just our internet server, when all of my brothers and I plus any friends and additional family members get in our wireless WiFi it slows down and causes lag, each of our laptops are different and will have different levels of lag. &nbsp;When our neighbors are on who happen to use the same line it slows down even more. &nbsp;The lag is not Avicus issue, it will be your internet provider, and also if minecraft is even working. &nbsp; Even if you were to get an additional wireless modem and bridge it to the existing line it may help a little but not that much in the sense it is still using that internet provider, meaning you have Netgear but still feeding it from Comcast internet services. &nbsp;Does that make sense what I wrote o_o? &nbsp;Hope this helps (^_^)v or if it is wrong please explain better ktxbai.

For me, I will either get 0 fps for a solid 5 seconds intermittently during an entire match, or I will get a solid 30 fps the entire game. When the first scenario occurred once I noticed that there was 100 chunk updates when I would have 0 fps and 0-5 chunk updates when my fps evened back out. I don't know if this is the cause or just something only on my side but I hope this helped.

Yeah, it's been pretty bad for me lately (worse than usual). I find that every time I log onto the server I seem to freeze for a while in the hub too. &nbsp;<br><br>The same thing's been happening to me on other servers though, even private ones with only a couple of people online at a time. I'm not sure whether it's the fact that my internet is quite slow or if it's something to do with Mojang's servers.

Oh, sorry for the other post; I feel like this has nothing to do with bmbrock's comment, so I didn't put it in there. I heard there was a solar flare a couple days ago, which messed up all the electromagnetic waves (WIFI and other wireless things like that), so that might be a likely cause of why the ISPs are so slow. I have no idea if the disturbances continue for a few days or it's only for a few hours; I'm just saying what I know.
