Why is Minecraft so popular?

So I am<b> very</b> addicted to Minecraft. I just can't stop. And I don't know why. My dad says Minecraft is a very useless game (obviously I disagree) and that I should quit playing it altogether. So I kept on trying and trying without success. That was awhile ago.<br><br>Now the whole world is playing it with more than 16,000,000 players on PC/MAC playing on single player and on servers (Avicus included) and I still don't really know why it's so popular.<br><br>My thereon is that Minecraft is:<br><ul><li>fun building stuff</li><li>fun killing stuff</li><li>fun playing with friends</li><li>Blowing stuff up</li><li>DIAMONDS!!!</li><li>And... Ya</li></ul><br>Think you got a reason? Let's see it down below!<br><br>Thanks for reading!

I wouldn't recommend saying that to your dad as he might not get it. And after 3 million blocks minecraft doesn't work as it should do so in fact it is limited.

Survival can get boring easily, I like MC a lot because of how easily modifiable it is and how minigames change the entire game for the player.

It's simple. The game is simple. Everybody can play it. It's also useless. Your dad has right. But due the uselessly and simpleness it's soo addicted. It's like watching TV. Watching TV is also useless and simple and everybody does it. People want uselessly and simpleness in their live.

Its fantastic for children (or adults) that have learning disabilities like Autism with even communities dedicated for children with these issues. This in itself really says all about the magic and value that can be gained from minecraft. There are even systems in place to get minecraft into schools for teaching purposes!&nbsp;<br><br>It also caters to people who want to play alone, multiplayer, use guns, play minigames, role play, etc etc etc the list goes on and thats all without using mods which are another kettle of fish.

Minecraft really shouldn't be this popular... it gets very repetitive and there are other games that are more entertaining, but it's so addicting because people like coming back amd adding on what they've already fun, and it really hooks you.

Minecraft is a way for me to relax, when I come home from a 12 hour shift at work and just need to relax a bit, I take my coffee and just join Avicus, sometimes I just watch others play but most often I play too. I heard about Avicus and thought I might join just to see if I would find something interesting, I didn't expect I would get to know some amazing people, especially not after all the harassment I'm forced to deal with every day. I don't play single-player, I just play multi-player with other people, it's because of you guys I play. #EmotionalSpeech

I think Minecraft has grown because of the community - it saw how Minecraft could be used to create amazing things, and this is what happens. From servers to texture packs to adventure maps to mods, and even going into servers and a whole convention! Not to mention how Minecraft is easily recordable because it (I think?) is less intensive than most PC games, so many people can record their gameplay and provide entertainment through YouTube, reddit, etc.<br><br>So in the end, I guess it was because of how Minecraft was simple and easy to use, but it provided (and sitll does) virtually endless possibilities that anyone and everyone could explore.
