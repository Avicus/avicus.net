Because the old skin sorta represented BC so changed it with the team switch plus LG had his dick up my arse, hmm listen to so much but atm fave artist has to be Brockhampton, I'm 16, has to be classic Nexus from way back in the day, Dota 2 atm, yea at sixth form, hmm never really considered it fully dying out, moshpit lil barnacle, Nights - Frank Ocean is my most listened so I guess I go with that, you always seemed down to earth and chilled never really knew ya tho.
