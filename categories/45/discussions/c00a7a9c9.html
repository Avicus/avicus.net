There are a lot of overrated PvPers. TNTTurtles named a few - people like ASFJerome, AntVenom, etc. etc. are very overrated and praised too much.<br>Looking at Turtle's list, I agree with most of them. Huahwi isn't as good as many people think, but he at least gives somewhat viable tips and is more "humble" than the others. I've heard gayzmcgee is actually really good but I've never seen his videos.. if he has any .-.

I can easily beat BajanCanadian in SG, because I did, he barely got 2 hearts on me. He sucks. Too easy. I suck at PvP, yet I beat him easily, yet he's the YouTuber who can get 1,000,000+ views while I'm lucky to get 30. This is what's fucked up in the world.

I absolutely love this thread<br><br>Best pvpers are youtubers? Suck my dick please. They don't know how to pvp, they don't know what a sword is. I bet the worst avicus regular can pull a 2v1 on them, and they'll hackusate. I doubt they know what the fuck is a strafe. All they do is RUN STRAIGHT and hope they get a kill. Imma ask for a 1v1, and they'll be like, what the fuck is a 1v1. Yes, this list includes stimpay. All those horrible ass licking youtubers that believe they are the god of pvp, they should go eat a whole plate of wasabi and die to it.

Rant on racism -&nbsp;<br><br>There'e going to be a lot of confusion with this, but let's begin.<br><br>Racism is a common trend on the internet. It absolutely pisses me off when some kid says "that's racist". What the actual fuck are you saying. If I'm saying the american race is too god damn fucking fat, It's basically a message to tell those fatass americans to stop eating at fattening fast food restuarants. If I say mexicans are retards, it's constructive criticism. When mexicans see that people called them a retard, they want to improve. Racism is a retarded topic, it's silly, and it's only considered racism when it's severe such as: what are those teo beaners playing outside? Juan on Juan basketball. Racism is a shitass topic to be complaining about kids.

Painting a whole race with the same paintbrush, I.e calling all Mexicans "retards", is racist...<br>Not to mentioning calling all Americans fat which they are not as I have cousins over there who are skinny as heck. So I recommend you re-educate yourself on what being a racist means before you get yourself into trouble.

cels you technically said that Mexicans are retarded and anyone who isn't is smarter. &nbsp;Pinning someone in a group because of stereotypical opinions IS racist.
