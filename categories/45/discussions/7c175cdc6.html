^ .... That you wrote in the OP explains that you haven't tolerance, but I tell you the world isn't fine and never its humans will be nice persons, but at least in this server is the more dedicated staff, they all are nice persons, if you believe that someone is abusing his powers please contact Sr. Staff via email with support@avicus.net .<br>I'm sure only a few people on here knew you, but is hard to hear that you are leaving. I wish I could know you more, bye.<br>Have good luck in life. :c

Yeah, no. I caught you abusing a glitch in walls and camping out underneath the bedrock, and you try to turn this on me (by leaving and calling me out). I have plenty of witnesses, and I only came on walls to attend the report. You then continued to abuse report and provoke players.
