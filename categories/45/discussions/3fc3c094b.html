Posts are not Allowed, I believe that I stayed a long time for this, and I may
never come back, please don’t lock nor argue.<br><br>&nbsp;I have to leave, why? Due to
exams this year. These are very important exams that could and will determine
my entire life. It is really important. Avicus has been a wonderful journey,
even if it has some ups and downs. My journey started off when me and Billy
(April) were looking for a server to play the Walls, that is when we found a
suitable server with less lag called McZone. Our Journey occurred then. But
then I heard that Billy got Jr Mod and I wanted to be a Mod as well. That is
when I met all of you brilliant people who have brilliant independent qualities
of your own. I met so many people who I made friends with, you lot who are
brilliant people. I did my Staff Application and I got accepted and I got into
my interview. That was one of my terrifying moments in Avicus, Detty, Howsie
and Jozzy seemed like Gods compared to me (These guys interviewed me), it
seemed like they were a dark shadow overlooking over my shoulder. But after the
interview, I realised that these guys are like me, they weren’t terrifying people
judging your every move. I thank you, the community for an amazing journey
across the amazing land of Avicus, once known as McZone.

<br><br>Here are some people I must thank.<br><br>&nbsp; April aka. Billy: Do I really have to explain about this
dude, this guy will always stick up for me, he is one of the greatest friends. Nothing
more, nothing less. Thanks Mate!

<br><br>NesaFairy: This Lass helped me through Avicus and taught me
how to navigate through Avicus and through her, I made a lot of pretty good
friends. Actually, she was the first Avicus friend I made through Avicus.

<br><br>Tel6331: The first time I met him, this guy tempbanned me, I
thought that he was literally the devil, laughing in his underground chamber,
rambling about his power but when I provided my proof of that I shouldn’t be
banned, I realised that this d00d is one of the nicest mods ever in Avicus. Also,
this guy made me an objective to reach to in PvP Skills, I thank him for that. <br><br>Musician131Nay: My First Girlfriend &lt;3<br><br>&nbsp; Avumbaca: This Lass is in Cacalmarin, a clan that I was in
for the last 6 months, and that journey was amazing. I thank her for improving
my PvP. This gurl is one of the greatest friend I made in Avicus, and one of
the first, a great person. Thou she might hate me now, I still value her as a
friend.

<br><br>StormzInvader: This guy always, always made me laugh, he is
one of the funniest guys I met. He is also inspirational and a guy to look up
to. Btw, he sounds like Markplier xD.

<br><br>Jozzy and Yoav: These guys are soooooooooo nice to me, even
if Yoav is quite sarcastic to me xD Jozzy taught me how to PvP and Yoav wrecked
me in PvP to show that I have to learn more xD. Jozzy has always helped me through
my problems and vice versa for him.

<br><span><br>BUSTY: Hannah, always kind to me and she makes me laugh. She
was like the first friend I made through Teamspeak and then it somehow went to KaraokeParty
in Teamspeak with a whole lot of people with Vlad (He recorded it and I think
he has the recording xD)&nbsp; Do Not Change
if I come back. #BustyLove&lt;3<br></span><br>&nbsp; AwesomeGirl, peaches_lovebirds, carrie_may, LMN: I can have
some random conversions with these people :P Thanks for that<br><br>&nbsp; Cacalmarin: Thanks for everything everyone in the clan, I
thank you! You made me see that there are good people in this world.<br><br>&nbsp; Para: A guy who sticks up for his own opinions and he values
his opinions, somehow in everything he says, he has stability in those words.
Look up to you dude!<br><br>&nbsp; DaGoldBrick and TheTrail: This might sound weird but I want
to thank these guys for teaching me a lesson which got me demoted. These guys,
harassed me and I always lost my temper, I became rude to them which got me demoted
for these reasons. They taught me to hold my temper, to just ignore people like
them. Now, I am a better person, Thank you.

<br><br>The Staff: I think, at this time, that this is one of the
best Staff Teams ever in the lifetime in Avicus, the teamwork and communication
is just getting better, and better, and better. Thank you for keeping Avicus
standing up. Without you lot, Avicus would have fallen over like crumbling
ruins.

<br><br>Sorry if I didn’t include everybody, if I did, it would fit
8 pages of thanking people. &lt;3<br><br>&nbsp;I may come on Avicus from time to time (Holidays) but I will
conceal myself. I may check the forums once a week. And I may not return to
Avicus. I may will. If Avicus is still standing on July 2015.<br><br>&nbsp;Bai all of you amazing people! It was nice knowing you!
&lt;/3

<span>&nbsp;<br>Oh Yeah, I heard you wanted an image of April :D, here it is, also of me looking sad! D:<br><img alt="" src="http://i.gyazo.com/e849a081562ca91c9dfacaf3ab8bcb38.png"><br><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/Her3A8N.jpg"><br><br><br></span>

I will give you an apology, I am very sorry for the harm I have caused you through the period of when I was Junior Moderator. I don't know if I falsely kicked you but people agreed with that judgement so I went with it. I am sorry, very sorry. Btw, I can't speak English properly because I am Sri Lankan xD So don't blame me :D
