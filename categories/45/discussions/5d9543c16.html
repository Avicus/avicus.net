I'm keeping this short,<br><br>Goodbye Avicus, it's been fun getting to know everyone! I'm leaving for personal reasons, and also that i'm just tired of the server being bored AF on this server, and getting bullied, and yelled at. Thanks for the good times everyone. Cheers.<br><br>AeroHart/Canuck_pro/AeroScape<br><br>If you'd like to talk to me about my leave, contact my skype at beastgaming_<br><br>I'd like to thank the following people for making my experiences memorable:&nbsp;<br><br>MidnightBeats, Trilogi, iLavaTiger, Zaccc, MapDev, and as well as Peachy (even though he's not here anymore)<br><br>Good luck to everyone on their future endeavors!

I feel you, I spent many months away from Avicus to achieve my Mineplex SG addiction (wanted to hit 10 thousand wins). I gradually realized I made a sucky decision, and now I am back, (with 5 thousand wins). I hope you come back, and the same happens to you!

@Enzo_<br>Well, the thing is I will only come back, if Avicus gets its act together, and make a more healthy environment. So far the end of my summer sucked on Avicus, and I got bullied a lot. I wish that avicus would become more intolerant with jerks on the server, and just perm ban them. No appeals. The whole appeal system is stupid, especially when people that get banned for rudeness, get appealed. Just god dang it, they got banned, there's no coming back. Iv'e grown just to stick to other servers, that actually care about their players, not throwing shit in their faces. (at least that's what I've had to deal with recently) And yeah, I got addicted to a new server XD So I feel you about the Mine plex thingy XD
