I can't do it very well but I know the basics. Basically you're going to want to click around 3-5 times a second and repeatedly tap a and d. But you have to time it so when you are right at the edge of the block ( left or right) you click a or d to go to the other side while holding down s. you also have to place the block (as long as you tap left and right at least once) right at the edge of the block and basically continue repeating that. You go left and right since it slows your backstep slightly which allows you to place the block and build a bridge.im not very good at explaining and I haven't mastered the technique either so you should probably ask someone like Splade or Strafes_<br><br>EDIT : This was explained to me by a friend who could do roughly 25 blocks

I've done 15 blocks straight. It's more about timing your clicks and keeping your body steady on the block, I believe.<br><br>Splades is pretty amazing at it, so you could go ask him :P

Speedbridging is pretty much the same speed as Breezily bridging if you're good at timing it.

If you've mastered both, Breezily Bridging is much faster, when I couldn't Breezily I used to Ninja Bridge all the time, and I got really damn good at it as well after so much practice. But then I learned to Breezily Bridge, even when I started it was a decent amount faster than Ninja Bridging. When you get good at Breezily Bridging, it's much faster than Ninja Bridging.&nbsp;<br><br>The small stop delays and shift slow-downs every block really add up after like 10-blocks, plus the angle you'd need to Ninja Bridge at that speed doesn't keep you going in a straight line, you drift off to the edge a bit and the time to re-adjust also comes into affect.
