I'm pretty interested in sport and i know that with this many people from all over the world there must be a ton of people who do sport or some sort of physical activity.<br><br>I used to be very into competitive sports and play tons but it got quite boring and unrewarding after a while so i whittled it down to just basketball which i played fanatically for a year, which definitely paid off. But now alas i'm a gym lad and i still play basketball only twice a week now, my main source of fitness is bodybuilding and overall fitness.I've been going to the gym for about 5 months now and ya know some gains are getting through. ;P<br><br>I just wanted to share this and ask if anyone else in the community did sport and to what level, so share your sporting life, if there are any gym lads or lasses out there please do share, feel free to post pics, workout routines whatever if you're confident enough. Also any questions are welcome.

Soccer, fullback, Left or Right, it doesn't matter. Sometimes I play Goalie, I'm muxh better than the avg person who tries in net, but I pale in comparison to the ppl who play net ss their main position.<br><br>Basketball, usually SF or PF, since I have good acceleration,can drive hard and make good layups. I'm slightly taller than most ppl my age, but not too special. I don't play that often though.
