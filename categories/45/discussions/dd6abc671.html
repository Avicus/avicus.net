Apparently ViceWatercolour has been demoted from admin due to abuse, as far as I know he's been a responsible and considerate Admin so why don't we get him back up there?<br><br>+1 if you would like to sign the petition

"As far as I know, he's been a responsible and considerate administrator..." Unfortunately, the extent of your comprehension of the circumstances are, as you implied — "as far as I know" — limited. The official justification for his demotion, disclosed in its own post, is rather vague, meaning that even us moderators may not be aware of the full story. Nonetheless, as is typical of controversial courses of action like these, it is stated that the "entire senior staff team" came to a definite agreement on their decision.<br><br>This verdict is almost certainly not to be reversed by anyone or anything except for perhaps the "entire senior staff team" itself, and a petition crusaded by the (relatively uninformed) public community will most likely not precipitate a change of heart. I'm sorry.

It's up to Para's discretion about whether he wants the details revealed.<br><br>Although I do agree that the decision itself has been described to both staff and players very vaguely. I don't blame you for wanting at least a bit of reasoning as to why he got demoted (officially) :P

You are being so dramatic... He is only a senior moderator. It's not like he was demoted to just a default user. He is still in the senior staff team, therefore he is on the same page as admins.

If he was demoted entirely, yes, I would be pretty appalled. However, as Blizzem said, staff policy forbids that, anyway, so that makes me able to handle it a little better. Aside from being a little shady on the details of why, it's nothing to get TOO riled up over...

According to the situations I'm aware of, it was all handled and understood. I never got an official PM of a demotion, nor anything specific of me doing wrong (It's me guessing what happened), nor any evidence, nor any policies I may have broken, and the community (and I) are left in the dark about what happened. It would have been nice for me to know in advance at the least so I could have wrapped up all my projects.<br><br>If I was demoting an admin, though, I certainly would've staff warned. Not just completely remove their rank.

According to the situations I'm aware of, it was all handled and understood. I never got an official PM of a demotion, nor anything specific of me doing wrong (It's me guessing what happened), nor any evidence, nor any policies I may have broken, and the community (and I) are left in the dark about what happened. It would have been nice for me to know in advance at the least so I could have wrapped up all my projects.<br><br>If I was demoting an admin, though, I certainly would've staff warned. Not just completely remove their rank.

This reminds me of a time when I was admin...<br>EDIT: Yeah well you certainly didn't warn me;-<br><br>Anyways, I am not surprised that this happened - that is - an admin being demoted poorly (not specifically para). When I was admin, the majority of the staff team came together behind my back and voted to have me demoted and actually; I remember a meeting where I was asked to step down because my methods weren't appreciated, I was "too powerful" and I "didn't get anything done". (That was exactly the reason/s) This became a shock to me because the week earlier, I hosted an admin feedback form... Funny thing is, it was nothing but positive responses. Also I literally had no idea this was occuring, but rather was told to get on Teamspeak ASAP. The staff team told me all these testimonials which half of which were inaccurate and rather dismissive and not to mention it was all one-sided. Fortunately, I kindly requested that I was given one chance, provided that I was literally unaware of my 'wrong-doings', since no evidence was present, no one discussed it with me about it prior and how disorganised and unfair it was. &nbsp;<br><br>Essentially the staff team at the moment is two faced. I can related to para on this one, and I feel like he needed one more chance - just like I did - because at the end of the day, improvements will always need to be made.&nbsp;<br><br>edit: it will only be a matter of time before the media team can demote admins<br><br>&lt;/rant&gt;

I've seen literally almost a dozen people get demoted without warning during my time as staff.<br>It's funny because no matter who is on the Senior Staff team, communication is always something that needs improvement. <br>It's never exactly been a strength of theirs.

I guess we'll never know [stares off into the sunset]<br><br>If Para decides to come back he'll have to come back as a Jr Mod because he's already returned from retirement once - oh wait, the seniors might just make yet another exception to the rule <i>once again&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;and let him back into the senior staff team should he decide to return never mind.

That rule is no longer in place afaik :V<br><br>and the rule is that you cant come back at all after retiring more than once if it's still a thing.

Alright,<br><br>I completely understand the frustration that has come out of this thread, as yes I agree, ViceWatercolour was an outstanding administrator as he lead the team in an excellent way, and further developed many aspects of the team. Although this situation is relatable to the situation Jozz explained to us, certain circumstances are very different. You have received a public thread explaining what happened with Para's demotion, and Para was also chatted with us&nbsp;on TeamSpeak, and he understands our reasoning. Furthermore, Para has decided to fully retire from the senior staff team, which is an action that was completely his decision. As for the iffy staff policy currently, myself, and a couple senior moderators are working on updating and revising it to be more suitable with circumstances today. <br><br>I am going to proceed to lock this thread to prevent further unneeded controversy on the forums. If you wish to say farewell to ViceWatercolour, I'm sure he would love that very much, and it can be done here -- &nbsp;(<a title="Link: https://avicus.net/forums/671c6e2b2" href="https://avicus.net/forums/671c6e2b2">https://avicus.net/forums/671c6e2b2</a>). If you have ANY further concerns about his demotion, can I ask you to contact me on the community slack or Skype (thehoopsman) or you may contact MidnightBeats on his Skype (midnightaurorus). <br><br>Thank you for understanding.
