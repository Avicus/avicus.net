So, I'm going to be leaving avicus, minecraft, and probably gaming altogether! &nbsp;This is because for the past week or so, I've been wondering why I play minecraft. I found that the answer is simply to get my levels up and I'm finding it less enjoyable. I used to just free build on creative on sp :p then I discovered avicus. And spent hours on mczone. When avicus came out, I was less active because I played skyward a lot and was annoyed to have it taken away. Then, I found nebula and played that hours a day, leveling up and enjoying myself. However, recently all I've been doing is stressing over my levels, KDR and objectives. And its getting in the way of my life so, I will either, limit my time to like, one hour a day or, quit altogether. Thank you for making the past year of my life so enjoyable and good luck in the future!

Goodbye, my friend. It's been a pleasure.<br>If you're leaving because you were stressed over the gameplay, I think you should come back occasionally. Just play for an hour and say hello the community :)
