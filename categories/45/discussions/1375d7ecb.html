It's because he was punished for the same thing multiple times. If he gathers several infractions over time as shown on his page, he is able to be punished for having too many punishments on record known as "Excessive Infractions". The staff are instructed to report it when they see someone with a lot of infractions, in this case a lot were chat-related so the decision was made to ban him. If he has a problem with it, he can appeal at support@avicus.net.
