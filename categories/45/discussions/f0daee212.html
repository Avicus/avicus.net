Hello there everyone. You guys like when I make some stories about <br>myself and what happens. This time I am going to tell you a shocking story. This is actually very real. So most of you know I am American Indian and in Indian News I found something very cool. This guy is a hospital and his heart stopped. If he didn't get a well working heart in a hour he will sadly pass away. At another hospital far away there's a poor guy who's brain was literally dead but he had a well working heart. That heart can save the other guys life! But wait! They have to go all the way to the other hospital which would take 45 minutes with all the indian traffic. The shocking thing is that they took 15 minutes to take the heart out and in that fifteen minutes the indian traffic cleared! :0! All the dang traffic was gone! The ambulance went very fast and it was only a 12 minute drive. They did a transplant in another 15 minutes and he started breathing again. Then ten minutes later, he woke up. This was an astonishing moment for the traffic to clear very fast. I do also feel bad for the guy who died but he was a hero.
