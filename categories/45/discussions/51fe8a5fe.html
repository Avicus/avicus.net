I haven't seen any cape giveaways for ages :/ and most capes are blocked by EULA, I believe the only way to get a cape is to go to minecon (not sure tho)

A Minecon cape? The only way you can get one is to go to Minecon and that is not cheap, I would recommend you save up and trust your self to buy one online or go there your self next time.

No they won't be taken away. They don't affect gameplay and therefore the EULA will allow it.

Pretty sure they're going to be taken away.<br>In the EULA they said "except capes, we want them to be special."<br>And I don't think you're going to get your money back as it's a DONATION.

I still have my Optifine cape.<br><br>Also, Mojang isn't banning capes because they give a player an advantage (they don't), but because they want capes to only be able to be receivable from Minecon, they want to keep capes special.

We just have to face it. Mojang is being a money&nbsp;w̶h̶o̶r̶e̶&nbsp;and want more people to go to minecon to get a cape and give the company more money.<br><br>"Greed is a bottomless pit which exhausts the person in an endless effort to satisfy the need without ever reaching satisfaction." -&nbsp;<b>Erich Fromm</b>

It doesn't really make sense, Minecon tickets sell out almost instantly anyways, and the price on them is extreme as is.

Plus the minecon capes are ugly, the only cool one was the first one they gave out, and it's not even possible to get it if you don't have it already.

Not exactly, Minecon tickets sell out super quick (43 seconds last year), so there really isn't a reason why they would do that.
