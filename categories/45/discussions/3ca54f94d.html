Hello, everyone.<br><br>I know by now, you've probably completely forgotten about me, but anyways, I think it's about time I made this considering this is one of the only times when I've had enough time to type out what I want to. xD<br><br>Let me start off with an apology. Ever since my demotion, I started acting like a total dick (for lack of a better word). I was discouraging, argumentative, and didn't even once think about what I was doing. I did nothing but set a negative connotation upon myself and towards the whole community, and I deeply apologize for that. And although this may not be necessary, I'd also like to apologize to the staff team for disgracing you with my presence. I had no leadership skills, was a depressed mess, and I don't know why I didn't recognize that earlier. So, sorry if I did nothing but screw you all up.<br><br>I'm also here to say that since school started and the crew season is still going on, I've stopped playing Avicus, and Minecraft as a whole. I may still pop on every once in a great while, and I'll still try to be on the forums, but I'll be extremely busy every day up until Summer. I know I made a fake leaving post back when I was an attention-seeking moron, but rest assured, this one is real. So, goodbye, Avicus! I'll miss you and the great community you have.<br><br>Some special thanks:<br><br><b>MLGPorky</b> - My first friend ever on the server. Ever since, he's been a really funny guy, and a good guy to go to for some good advice.<br><br><b>Vobaseball12</b> - One of my best friends in my time on the staff team, more than likely. He's responsible, and has always been supportive in times of need. I could definitely see you becoming Sr. Mod soon :)<br><br><b>FriendlyModOscar</b> - Quite frankly, I think Oscar is possibly the best Avicadian friend I currently have that hasn't left yet. We've had some nice conversations together, and I was overjoyed to see you get Jr. Mod. Keep up the good work, my friend! :D<br><br><b>TheTNTPotato</b> - 1 word: trustworthy. TNT has to be THE most trustworthy person I've ever come across on the network. Like, I felt as though I could say anything to TNT and I wouldn't need to worry about it getting out, unlike a certain someone else I know... anyways, you rock, TNT! :)<br><br><b>Petlas</b> - I can still remember that one hour-long Skype conversation we had like it was yesterday. It pretty much transformed us from complete strangers into good friends, and ever since, she's always been someone I know I can talk to and I've always held her in high respects because of this. Anyways, have a nice life with Snow! &lt;3<br><br><b>MidnightBeats</b> - Although we never really talked too much, the times that we did were awesome. It's great to know that there's someone else I can talk about Pok√©mon to after years of searching! :P<br><br><b>Seuth</b> - You're #1 on my list of the most fun people to talk to ingame. Being on the same server as you was always fun, and you're a really cool guy! :)<br><br><b>DaBaderMC/Snoozin/Whatever the hell your name is now&nbsp;</b>- If I needed help with a report or something on the staff team, I'd always wonder, "Where's Bader?" Seriously, I think we worked together really well. Like Vobaseball, I can see you getting Sr. Mod soon :)<br><br><b>et477&nbsp;</b>- I still remember back when you helped me find that fly hacker a long time ago. You probably forgot, but that was very helpful of you. If you become staff, I know you'll do great. Keep up the good work! :D<br><br><b>timaeusTestified</b> - You're a really great map maker and an awesome person to talk to, especially when it comes to certain projects I'm trying to do (I could let you know about those on Skype. I'm cynergy14).<br><br><b>Zeusy&nbsp;</b>- If you're still here, I want you to remember back when I got frustrated and did something stupid. Although the following conversation between us was very serious, I also realized how understanding and amiable you are. Wish you had stayed an Admin for longer :(<br><br>Real sorry if I forgot to mention you in the special thanks, but I'm going off the top of my head for right now.<br><br>Thanks everyone, Cynnamon/Cynderblock/Cyneric_

I'll probably try to get on during Christmas break a few times, (because no school, woot) but otherwise, I can't make any promises. Sorry :(<br><br>Btw, I should still be around occasionally on the forums and I'm still on Skype.
