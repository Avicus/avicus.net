If it is considered spam, then fine. My old topics haven't gotten many views so i was hoping to get some useful topics but the only thing i receive is someone telling me this is spam. That's fine.<br><br>If a moderator locks it, idc.&nbsp;<br><br>I just want to apologize. I'm sorry.

Mojang/Minecraft said there would be UUIDs, so every player has a UUID and then the bans and so on aren't messed up. The UUID is 16 letters and numbers long. They also said, the name change would cost so much, that you can buy a new account for the money.

Midnight was asking for a name change till you and someone else started chatting about why its a dukb feature.... You went offtopic. Ontopic would be givng him names or telling him to keep it. Offtopic is saying changing names is a dumb feature.
