Um I don't want to straight up join, but rather be kind of like a contributor. I can msg one of the team members over Skype (Croc) and help give legitimately good songs. I always get very high marks in music, have been part of school bands and extracurricular bands as well. I like pretty much every single genre of music and can suggest lots of great music, especially EDM.&nbsp;<br>I'm not really a super organized person, nor do I really want a full-on commitment. Just if you guys need music you can come to me for a bit of help :)

I'm going to be exceptionally busy this week, and I've really only had half an hour to discuss all the applications with Hoops. I'm opening up more spots, however. I'm discussing your idea with Hoops soon.&nbsp;<br><br>To all the people who haven't had their application answered; no, I did not skip yours. What me and Hoops have done is gently go over all the applications and denied the applications that weren't up to standards. We accepted the people who were accepted because we know they have had lots of experience with Plug.DJ. Don't worry, that doesn't mean we've denied your application. We're reviewing it, and we're not going to be accepting any more applications till yours are answered first. Please don't feel like I am expressing any favouritism towards anyone, I'm not. I really apologize, but I haven't had much time to sit down with Hoops and discuss this lately.
