Possibly falsely banned?

Hello all, TheKeyCrafter here. I know where I should place my ban appeal. However, I think I have been falsely banned. I just got banned, I think by 1Theodore1.<br><br>Eariler in Nebula, I met him. I admitted to him that something was wrong, I had no knockback. He said it was a glitch. I find it strange because after the server restarted and we move on to senex 2. After about 10 minutes of play time there, I was banned. Reason, Anti-Knockback and forcefield. This makes me really sad. <br><br>Is there any evidence to my ban

Yes, I actually have video edivence of you hacking.<br>And with this glitch you do get some knockback, just sometimes you dont take. You would take 0% knockback and you were using blatant aimbot / forcefield. I will render and upload the video and I'll show you.

If he said it was a glitch he shouldn't be banning you o.e unless there is a secret code that only staff know to find out hackers... my last option is he invited another mod and they checked it together and they both decided that you were hacking.<br>until then mssg a manager or above on skype or appeal to the email

I already explained that with the specified glitch, in some hits you take no knockback, and in some hits you get knockback. I spectated him for about 10-15 minutes and he did not take knockback, at all. I did not record all the time while I was spectating, though.

I'll post it on public if that's OK with key, although he had to go now so it will most likely be posted tomorrow.

..... You were hacking and then posted a topic that said you were falsely banned? Then on top of that you posted the link and said it's true... Well I'm kinda disapointed but you can always try to appeal at support@avicus.net

He said he was falsely banned because he wanted a tiny chance, even though it might be none, of being un-banned. I'm personally happy that he admitted to hacking because that's the nicest thing to do. Although he lied, when he knew it was over, he admitted he was doing something wrong instead of refusing to admit it due to their pride. You're the best hacker ever, Key &lt;3

The video clearly shows that you were breaking the rules by using illegal modifications on the server.<br><br>Appeal by sending an email at <i>support@avicus.net.&nbsp;</i><br><b>Good luck.</b>
