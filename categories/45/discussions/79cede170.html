mmk so i was thinking: Well, this prestige thing is cool, but i dont really see a point to it, other than you get your name on the top 10.. So i was thinking, what if we gave people more motivation to play other than a sticker by your name saying you did it. how about We give out special rewards to people who achieve a certain prestige, and you claim it at the end of the season. Yes you are probably thinking mi copying Hypickle, but really, thats like blaming someone for wearing pants bc you wore them first.&nbsp;<i>The following below is a chart, of which I think could be typical and good Prestige exclusives.<br><br><br></i>Comment what effects, cries and other cool stuff could go under these categories.&nbsp;<br><br>Kill effects<br>-<br>-<br>Mon break effects<br>-<br>-<br>Wool placement effects<br>-<br>-<br>Win celebrations<br>-<br>-<br>Game start war cries<br>-<br>-<br>Also, comment other ideas of Prestige exclusives.<br>EDIT:&nbsp;<br>I think the rewards should be given out to people who get a certain prestige, not a specefuc place Example:<br>Prestige one - Kill sound<br>Prestige two - kill effect<br>ETC<br><br>from rattLe<br><br><br><br><br><br><b></b><br><b></b><br><i></i>

im kinda asking what types of kill sounds, and things you cant buy in the shoppe<br>maybe rewards are given out as of what prestige you are.<br>xample:<br>p1 - kill sound<br>p2 - exclu morph<br>etc<br>p12 - EXPLOSiON KILL EFFECT<br><br>u see?

also note you're the best on the server so ofc 5k coins is nothing, but i see your point, people want more than credits

Yes and no. Hypixel leveling rewards do not contain anything other than MVP+ badges and coins and xp, nothing ingame. But in Hypixel Ranked rewards, thats where you get blood effects and stuff.<br><br>This is alike hypixel very much; the season ends, and people claim their rewards, which can only be claimed by leveling
