Hey guys. cold here.<br><br>I recently got suspended from school, and am going to be inactive, because i'm grounded. I'm lucky i have the chance to write this. I got suspended for fighting (obviously) So i'm just gonna take this chance to say, don't get suspended. Even if its for a illegitimate reason, just don't get suspended. I will be completely inactive for just a few days and i have a few things to say<br><br>- Fluffles, i can get your credits to you sometime this week, sorry :c<br><br>- Getting suspended if probably the worst thing you can do, other than expelled<br><br>- Thanks for reading and/or understanding<br><br>See you guys soon,<br><br>-Cold

Never get suspended guys. Here's a story. This kid in my grade and like 50 other kids all got suspended for trading the explicit photos of female classmates they'd all collected. If you're going to get suspended, don't be that stupid? Please. One kid was registered a sex offender and was suspended for three months. That stupid stuff he did, now it's on his record.<br><br>Just please, watch yourself guys!

My school is a private school.<br>The teachers respect the students more than we respect the teachers. Our class took a vote to get a teacher fired, and it worked. The teachers are almost like the students. We are aloud to go on our phones during class, anything. We are one of the schools with the highest ranking students.<br><br>&nbsp;I don't think were getting suspended any time soon. x3 ^-^

honestly bro just dont sweat it too much. i know it seems like a big deal now, but trust me its not. I've been suspended and gotten in trouble more times than I can count and everything is going great. its hard and this will sound like total bull but if you can laugh about it, it makes it easier. just know that you will most likely look back and laugh about it in the future. if ur worries about colleges, they probably won't care about one suspension when you were younger. if you go to a traditional school the colleges probably care more about your gpa. and if ur in middle school or lower than high school it is doubtful that it'll matter at all. you can also apply to get it off your record if you really care that much. its good to try that but in the long run this one thing is a tiny moment. don't sweat it.

Make u feel any better, There's this kid who got suspended because they went on the school roof, and took a dump. Not a pleasant picture, but it'll make fighting look like a better way to get suspended.

I go to one of the best private schools in England and there's no way in hell I could see this ever happening here.

wait wut. Wasn't this topic locked? I was sure it got locked and a bunch of people got mad about it...<br>Oh well...<br>My experience?<br>Well... I'm friends with a guy who told some fat chick on the school bus to go back to mcdonalds to her big macs. Reason he said it was because she ripped one of her friends bag in half... <br>Guess who got suspended? Spoiler... Not the one who got his bagged ripped in half nor the chick who ripped the bag.<br>so um... That's my experience &lt;3

I've never been suspended, my parents would kill me. I was close to suspension in 5th grade because I said, "f**k" to a student and he told, snitch xD . The worst I've ever gotten was detention, twice :p
