I've been having a chat with one of my friends, and we were just talking about life, and how this game is effecting it. We're going through the same sort of thing, where we just realise, holy crap, I've spent literally months of elapsed time, just staring at a screen. All day. Nothing better to do, and life comes to fast. I fell like things in the game just aren't feeling as fun, and they've lost their appeal. I think I'm leaving, hopefully not permanently, because there are a lot of people I don't want to leave or let down. I know it seems like it came out of no where, but I've been thinking about it a lot lately, and I've noticed how negatively this game has been affecting my life, I've been lashing out at family, and just having a worse and worse time every time I play. Some people have been involved in&nbsp;the issue, but I don't want any names thrown out there. So, for now this is a goodbye, I'm taking a break, maybe forever, but I highly doubt it. Goodbye for&nbsp;a while to everyone, and I mean everyone here, that I've played with, and that I've spoken with. I'm staying in touch with many, and I'll be having games with close friends often, but just not as much. I hope I come back, because I think things can get better, and I can manage my live better, but for now, this is a see ya later.<br>-rot

I know the feeling, rot.


After playing Minecraft for almost 5 months straight, I realized something:

College is coming.

As I type now, I'm able to say confidently that I am prepared for life ahead and can comfortably fit Minecraft into that picture.

So, to you, I say good luck!
