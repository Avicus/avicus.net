Damn, what goes on through these people's heads when they decide to do these things... holy crap.<br><br>Like, seriously - what success would this possibly bring? Striking civilians like a bunch of cowards.

The civilian thing doesn't work for Americans. We dropped nuclear bombs on Japanese civilians. Terrorists consider themselves as much at war with us as we were with Japan. Civilian mass loss of life has been a fear tactic for centuries and will continue to be used by those who feel that it is effective.

Correct me if I'm wrong but from what I've learnt in History lessons the US dropped bombs on Japan just to stop the Japanese Occupations in Singapore a long time ago.

actually the United States tried to avoid as many civilian casualties as possible when dropping the atomic bombs. they aimed specifically for factories, but the blast range and radiation cause most of the near by cities to be destroyed anyway.<br><br>@op: this is horrible. France was still in a state of heightened security since the last attacks... just awful

no, not at all. look at a map of where they were dropped, right in city centers. Not to mention factories aren't unpopulated... by no means were we trying to "avoid as many civilian casualties as possible" or even going after a target of military importance. If we were we would have hit an airfield.

Singapore wasn't really the strong motivation behind it but yes it was a decently long time ago.

The atomic bomb was dropped to severely cripple Japan to prevent a possible invasion of the United States by the Japanese and other things. Basically trying to make them surrender. Singapore was never really like a priority
