There are 3 main types of viruses. Spyware, malware, and adware. I will show you a few legit and great anti-virus systems.<br><br>Adw-cleaner<br>Malwarebytes (one of the best)<br>Avast (one of the best)<br>Kapersky<br>Avira<br><br>Extra tips: Avoid AVG and McAfee. Get chrome. .exe files are despicable (not all of them). This is because .exe files are program installing programs. Therefore they could be installing lots of viruses.<br><br>Conclusion: I'm not the best expert, so correct me if I'm wrong. Hope this helps! :)

Yeah, but you really have to tread carefully.<br><br>One great scanner is MacScan. I'll go into that in full depth when I hop onto my computer though :)

Kaspersky is a great program from my experience. For Mac, my advice is to stay away from MacKeeper.

I use Microsoft Security Essentials and a few others, but MSE is amazing and does a great job, and you get it for the decent price of free.

ZoneAlarm is my personal favourite. I don't use it now, since I factory reset my computer and CBF downloading it again.&nbsp;<br><br>I highly recommend it.

Used to be the best ever, but now it's just bloatware that comes with computer and just keeps nagging at you to buy their yearly subscription.

I don't believe you should exclude AVG and McAfee out of the question solely because they are .exe files, the ones you have recommended are all executable files anyways, since every application you run starts off with an executable program.<br><br><img src="http://imgur.com/jKAaWLD.png" alt=""> <img src="http://i.imgur.com/0VYyAsQ.png" alt=""><br><br>Personally, I use AVG combined with Malwarebytes. Amazing pieces of software, really gets the job done, and has saved myself a few times :)<br><br>Now regarding AV software for Mac, I'd just use AVG for Mac.
