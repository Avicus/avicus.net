<span>So, I had an idea (for once) to ask you guys this: "If you could make anything in the world, what would it be?". It can be<u> ANYTHING</u> you don't need physics or logic.</span><br>What I would make: I would solve world hunger, meaning I would make all food re-spawn. So when you bite pizza it would re-generate.<span><b><u>MIND = BLOWN!</u></b><u></u></span>Comment below &lt;3

I would make something that could go into your mind, pick out a cool song you made, and put it onto your computer, where you can make up more beats or other sounds and put them together with nothing but your imagination :o

I'd make a cure for all diseases, end all racism around the world, make everyone happy :3 AND give out 100% free Tacos everyday. I would also create a device that allows people to teleport using their memories. This would work by being able to teleport to a memorable location in the past, and you could re live those moments again.

Imagine this.<br><br>A&nbsp;sandbox&nbsp;independent video game&nbsp;originally created by Swedish programmer&nbsp;Markus "STRAIGHTENED" Persson&nbsp;and later developed and published by the Swedish company&nbsp;"d". The creative and building aspects of&nbsp;<i>this game</i>&nbsp;allow players to build constructions out of textured cubes in a&nbsp;3D&nbsp;procedurally generated&nbsp;world. Other activities in the game include exploration, gathering resources, crafting, and combat. Multiple gameplay modes are available, including&nbsp;survival modes&nbsp;where the player must acquire resources to build the world and maintain health, a&nbsp;creative mode&nbsp;where players have unlimited resources to build with and the ability to fly, and an&nbsp;adventure mode&nbsp;where players play custom&nbsp;maps&nbsp;created by other players.<br><br>Wouldn't that be cool?
