Yep, I'll be starting story...errr...fanfiction whatever you call it soon. I generated characters cuz....why not. Don't blame me if it sucks c:<br><h1><b><i><u></u></i><u>Prologue</u></b> <br></h1><span>It was a dark gloomy day. No one in city borders were happy that day. It was to be the day of who will battle in a 4-team walls match. There was no benefit of it but staying alive, the city was overpopulated like hell, making them forced to live off of these matches every couple years. Forty people enter these games and only one team will survive, the rest either go to heaven or hell, where they will either burn or live. Everybody was in their houses, not one single person was outside. Everybody inside was crouched inside the living room waiting to hear the announcement of the government. People who were not picked should be shouting in enjoyment, as not having to go through the risk of death. The rest will not. Their families and themselves shall cry, as having the risk of death itself clamped through them. The decision was tedious for everybody. Everybody's heart was pumping with blood throughout their system. Everybody was vulnerable and endangered of this.<br></span><br><span>The government was ready to announce the picks. Everybody's heart was beating, there was nobody in city limits who was not. The first team, the red team, was announced. The victims were Linda R. Cabrales, Vincent P. Villalta, Catherine M. Joseph, Ryan L. Voigt, Theresa D. Lamb, Jane J. Austin, Gary H. Riley, Vicki J. Burrow, Anthony J. Smith, and Megan R. Spicer. Ten minutes of ecstasy, grief, and misery later it was time to announce the next team, the blue team. The blue team's representatives were Hillary M. Jones, Billy N. Keith, Stephen D. Smith, Anne C. Jackson, Frances K. Mallett, Bradon P. Kirkpatrick, Margaret L. Young, Robert M. Vasser, Marie N. Horne, and Calvin P. Conley. This system will go on until the final lineup was announced.&nbsp; The green team was Rhode E. Ochoa, Maria J. Neely, Brenda T. Davidson, Rosa J. Woodall, George R. Bulger, Susan R. Berning, Judy R. Orr, Lois A. Seward, Sandra J. Pearson, and Yolanda T. Cummings. The yellow team was Joseph D. Johnson, Mark B. Sargent, Cheryl J. Dean, Steven T. Weber, Megan L. Richards, Ursula. D Summers, David A. Triplett, Willena L. Angulo, Roseanna A. Blance, and James M. Hogan. To prevent tumult, the government was hires an experienced person to keep order. His name was William V. Skinner. Nobody out of all these people were kins, not even acquaintances.<br><br></span>
