It was an okay game I am a steelers fan but I was voting for the Broncos. I fell asleep in the last 4 minutes so I don't really know what happened but I know they won! Glad to see Peyton win one last game! (Maybe)

I know the feeling, Andrew luck was out or unhealthy all season, so I cannot wait for a healthy Andrew Luck lead colts team.<br><br>But WOOHOO I'm so happy for Peyton, he deserved another ring, it wasn't his doing, but he deserved another one and how about that defense, phenomenal

Surprised he wasn't really showed as the "star" of the team. I think Von Miller was the real star.
