In case it isn't obvious enough I've quit this server and for the most part minecraft in general. Honestly I just don't see time for anything, not even games I enjoy for that matter, while I have extra curricular school activities (specifically sports) conflicting alongside work. I mean I could rant about why I quit ages ago, mostly salt from the tourney, but overall I've come to realize that I'm not particularly popular among this community anymore, not to mention the amount of shit that's been happening lately involving staff and the community being disgusting not only towards one another but in a general manner in which I can't comprehend whatsoever. I might come on team speak, I might come back next tourney if it looks somewhat promising, but I'm done with the lag and the community, just to summarize.&nbsp;<br><br>Staff and players don't fucking bash me for whatever I said that offended you. Ban me I could care less if I come back by some miracle, but this is it, 2 1/2 has been long enough.

good luck with life tino, youre one of the only ppl i remember when i first joined this server.<br>When i first joined you were one of those ppl that all new little kids followed around to see what you did, and tried to grow up to be as good as tino, and if i couldve at the time i probs would have wanted a tino poster in my room.<br>You were one of the ppl that got me in to the server and kept my attention long enough so i could learn more about this server.<br><br>Best wishes in the future man
