If you had one day left for your life, what would you do?<br>I would spend my time with friends and family and play soccer/football.

hah! just kidding. i'd probably eat a lot of amazing food since it wouldn't matter, and i'd probably chill with my friends. steal some stuff from a store. go massively in debt on a ton of cool things to use on my last day, cause why would it matter. (although the debt would be passed to my family)
