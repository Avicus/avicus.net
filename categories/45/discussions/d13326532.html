Shooting yourself in the void when you get shot/knocked off to prevent that person from getting the kill. One source tells me that is it not allowed, the other source tells me that it is allowed. Can I get an official confirmation on this?

How is it not allowed? It might happen but who cares tbh. I've never heard of that rule myself and I'm sure no one will rage over a block game for not getting a kill :P

Mate, it's cheating. If you do it then there team will get a point. It's basically like if you had a game and your team was racking up points and others didn't know what the hell was going on, they would think that you were hacking. It just goes to show that it's wrong. Also i boost's your KD up, trust me, if it's under 1, then your KD will go up...

Not an official answer but in my opinion this is abusing a glitch. Its like void logging you knocked the player into the void you should get the kill but if they logged or shoot them selves you get nothing. I already punish if I see people doing it.

It's allowed. It's just a dick move.<br><br>This is the same as running into the void when getting chased by someone. <br>Technically it's allowed but it shows poor sportsmanship.

It's the same thing as when you pvp someone, you run away, and you jump into the void, "stealing" the enemy kill. Shooting yourself is "stealing" the enemy kill. Plus it's hard to do.

That's the thing, it has been aroblem for a long time now, and no one really know how to "fix" it. It's has something to do with the yml or XML or whatever they use, but they can't just fix it with a snap of a finger

Probably to raise KD or to prevent the other person to get the kill. I mean, there is a 5 second delay when you jump in the void ON PURPOSE. Like if you get hit and you run away and jump in the void, they'll still get the kill. But if you shoot yourself off, then it will count as you kill, if I'm making any sense?

The only problem I have on this is TDM where people can shoot themselves instead of being killed by the other team, and it steals the point. On other gamemodes it really doesn't matter in my opinion.

I understand that, but in his post, his concern was the other team getting the armor, not about his KD. In that situation, it's much easier to jump.

You can answer your question using the math to Kill/Death ratios.<br><br>Say you have<br>20k kills<br>23k deaths<br><br>20/23 = 0.86956522<br><br>Say you get 23.1k deaths from killing yourself with a bow.<br><br>20/23.1 = 0.86580087 which is lower than the 20/23 result.<br><br>To see it in a bigger scale, compare 20/23 to 20k kills to 30k deaths which you gained from killing yourself in the void.<br><br>20/30 = 0.66666667 (wayless than the target 20/23).<br><br>It would never raise your KD as you don't get the kill (you would gain credits of You actually did) but you still gain the death.

Not an official answer but in my opinion this is abusing a glitch. Its like void logging you knocked the player into the void you should get the kill but if they logged or shoot them selves you get nothing. I already punish if I see people doing it.

My opinion: If there is a bug where you can shoot yourself, you should also be able to shoot yourself into the void to prevent getting killed from person x. It's an <i>Avicus</i> bug, and it's <i>Avicus'</i> fault, if people use this.

Oh I know it's punishable, but people are being told it's been fixed, and I know I have a habit of shooting myself anyway even if it doesn't work (I always do it on OCN). Knowing it's not fixed means that people will actually try to not shoot themselves, if it's told it's fixed then if people make a habit like I did, and is told that it's been fixed with no one being told in a place where everyone will look saying it's no longer fixed or it never was fixed, then is getting punished for the screw-ups of others

Oh I know it's punishable, but people are being told it's been fixed, and I know I have a habit of shooting myself anyway even if it doesn't work (I always do it on OCN). Knowing it's not fixed means that people will actually try to not shoot themselves, if it's told it's fixed then if people make a habit like I did, and is told that it's been fixed with no one being told in a place where everyone will look saying it's no longer fixed or it never was fixed, then is getting punished for the screw-ups of others

I know, I even told ALM himself that it wasn't fixed :L, but you can't even do it in Atlas, (I tried it in the beta testing).
