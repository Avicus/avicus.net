I believe something is wrong with your folder, because I had the same problem but my friend fixed it for me. I can ask him for help if you want!<br><br>Also, can you send me a screenshot of your mods folder on skype, so I can take a look.

Ok, so when I installed forge, it was kind of like optifine. A thing game up I set the settings and it then loaded. I had created a seprate mods folder, which I then out forge, and any mods that were comepatable with Forge.

By looking into your issue it seems that Forge is failing to download some of your files. I found a YouTube video which should solve your problem <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6sRfWeOj3M" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

Delete .minecraft and reinstall maybe?<br><br>Just put your mods and packs in a folder and do it.
