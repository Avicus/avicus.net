The whole point is for it to be simple, but there is content when you click the "Know me better", try that :)

It looks very nice :D<br><br>Maybe add a bit where when you scroll down it shows some projects you've worked, or some highlights of your skills. You always want to have a website serve a purpose ;)

Cool! It's a common trend these days.<br><br>And that's all css, I believe I did use typed.js.

I love your website, especially how you got the Github symbol to sort of... bob about when you first enter your site.<br><br>One question, I'm 16 years old (Turning 17 in September) and I've always wanted to learn how to code. Where exactly did you get to learn how?

I learned java by watching "PogoStick29Dev" tutorials (it's all bukkit, but it's also pure java) and playing around with my knowledge editing a clone of OCN's main plugin, PGM (the clone was called SporkPGM). Then for concept-based questions I go into stack overflow, it's great.<br><br>For the few c++ I know, my father teached me, didn't really like it tbh, made a calculator and still play a little bit with it sporadically.<br><br>For front-end stuff I just started looking at plain html, things like &lt;b&gt;, &lt;i&gt; &lt;div&gt; and all that. It looked ugly, but hey, I had made it. It's all about playing with it and see what happens when you change stuff. Then looking into CTRL+U mode on webpages I knew how worked and looking at its code helped a lot too. Then I discovered css and that was kinda easier because it made sense from the very start. Let me expain that better, in html you see &lt;b&gt; and you don't really know what could it mean, sure it could mean bold, but also baked, bind, vobaseball, etc; in css it was something like width: number here;, then box-shadow: n n npx&nbsp;n;, you know, they were words I actually knew and understood. But if you really want to know lots before starting (that is what I'd recommend) go onto w3schools.com and play around with every element may it be html, css or js.&nbsp;<br><br>If you need any advise, ping me on slack and I'll be all up for you zin :)

Of course, it's an animation of the code, and then it fades out and the output of the code slides in.<br><br>Just a cool geek touch :)

I would make it so that "avicus.net" and "me@javipepe.pw" is clickable/a hyperlink. (<a href="http://prntscr.com/88tn0k">http://prntscr.com/88tn0k</a>)<br>Other than that, hot website

I doubt it's possible because the string goes inside typed.js string list and it's delimited by comills ("") and to define the a hyperlink I'd need to do &lt;a href="" &nbsp;&lt;- and those comills would break the string.&nbsp;<br><br>Actually it may be possible to define it using it single comills (''), will look into it :)
