I tried taking you serious and really get into what you really want regarding your life around youtube, and I do understand you want to win this prize. But then I saw a video of yours where you asked a <b>11 year old boy</b> multiple times if he ever <b>masturbated</b> and how he <b>masturbates</b>. It really made me sick, if you think you will win anything with those kind of videos you are way over your head.

Yes I did say it, I can't see anything wrong about my opinions either, you should tell me what's wrong? Did you think it was fun when he asked those questions to an 11 year old boy or when he "prankcalled" another boy and called him a nigger. Do you seriously think Fousey will choose someone who does that? <br><br>Don't get offensive now either, I am right to have my own opinions as much as you are right to have yours.

If&nbsp;you want to&nbsp;"do youtube" and become bigger than you are now, you&nbsp;should be able to handle constructive criticism. You&nbsp;should also man up and stand for your actions, both me and you know you did ask him those questions and we both know you said "nigga" in that "racist staff" video, when you&nbsp;thought you&nbsp;could sound "black". <br><br>I don't have any problems with you or your youtube, I'm giving you constructive criticism, you can't expect to get bigger if you do videos like that. You need to start a LP or series, something your subscribers can follow everyday, not a video once in a week where you call others nigga or nigger.<br><br>Next time I expect you to talk for yourself, not your friends to attack me.

Thanks for the suggestions.<br>I will remain appropriate in my videos, and I appreciate that you gave me constructive criticism, everyone needs it!<br><br>What type of Let's Play were you thinking of having me start? Do you have any suggestions?<br><br>I've already done a Survival LP a few months ago, so I might do a modded one. Any ideas?

Do you like building?&nbsp;Start series where you build something that will take time, like a city? Not just one or two houses, but a city, with all sorts of different builds!<br><br>Do you like building maps?&nbsp;Start series where the viewer can follow you while you are&nbsp;building your&nbsp;map. It doesn't matter if you are new or if you never did it before, try it out!

I've seen way too many threads on this. This whole idea is built over false promises, how can some douchebag in a stupid shirt suddenly make thousands of subscribers appear out of nowhere, and why would he do so to somebody who makes low quality prank videos with a bad sense of humor?

FouseyTUBE states that you must talk from the heart.<br>Also, I never say "FouseyTUBE give me the items now, I want the items so give them to me".<br>That's all I have to say to you, other than I am not begging, I am trying to give a message.<br>Think again before you post something like that.
