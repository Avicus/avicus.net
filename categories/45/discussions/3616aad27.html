I don't want this to start over again, I already tried, and I got denied (hehe Dr.Suess right there). That's off topic. Please read the title and description please.

1. I don't have Skype. 2. I can't give other servers here without being forum banned for advertising. Stop asking why I'm banned. The staff are gonna say I made this for attention again. I just want to know how I can play with my friends again.

1. easy way to fix = make an account<br>2. You can't get banned for advertising... if you get unbanned and want 2 play on another server tell your friends the name of the server (not ip) and tell them to search ip...

Unless you are willing to make a Skype or Email than you can't. You could use Steam Chat :P

Personally I think it's possible to get unbanned.<br><br>Join the forums community a bit, be nice, and get a good forum rep.<br><br>Then, rewrite your appeal well and hope to be unbanned.

You need to make a Skype then, add your friends from Avicus and start chatting.

Nolan is saying if you have a great attitude, help out on the forums, and be generally a nice person you can resubmit an appeal with a greater chance of being accepted.<br><br>Just because you were denied once doesn't mean you can never play again.
