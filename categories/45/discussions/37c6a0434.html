I mean, he's not 100% wrong...&nbsp;<br><br>More like 75%.<br><br>While yes, Obama is not the ACTUAL founder, the US gave rebels in the Middle East weapons to fight terrorism.<br><br>Which led to the creation of ISIS.<br><br>The president before Obama (brainfart oops) was the one who helped make ISIS. Obama just let them continue.

The political system in the USA is such a mess. The Democratic Party is slowly being eaten from the inside out by extremely radical leftists and the Republican Party is a fucking train wreck. I'm glad I'm not voting this year, it would kill me.

I might follow your example in not voting this year, I'd rather prefer 4 more years of Obamacare than this...&nbsp;<i>mess.<br></i><br><i></i>There are two more candidates than Hillary or Trump though like Jill Stein or that other guy who is a Libertarian.<br><br>I don't know... I'll have to look into their policies before I make my judgement.

I'm not blaming it on him. I'm blaming it on Bush (thanjs SevHoe). I'm not some crazy Trump supported, but he is partially right, even though his EXACT words were 100% wrong. Dig a little deeper and you'll see more.

You've probably heard of it but there are lots of people who agree with you and there are conspiracie theories saying that Bush did 9/11.
