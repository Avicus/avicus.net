well then I don't get it xD<br>If you mean the Teleport thing, he was in the respawnscreen and didn't push the respawn button, so he wasn't at the spawn and he stayed at his death point.<br>Or if you mean the speed and fly thing, yes he was hacking !

But the speed &nbsp;and flying are hacks. No doubt about that.
