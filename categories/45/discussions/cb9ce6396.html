Hello, I've joined the Avicus network not so long ago and when I wanted to get more active I got banned for a unfair reason. I got banned because me and my old team "Infinity" messed around in a scrimmage and I also got banned in the servers. I've appealed this ban for the first time January 10 and the second time I appeal it was Feb 5.&nbsp;<img alt="" src="http://prntscr.com/64ms6l">&nbsp;(&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://prntscr.com/64ms6l">http://prntscr.com/64ms6l</a>&nbsp;) This is very frustrating as it shows that the staff clearly do not give a crap about who gets banned. It was such a fair unban. I pmed Fluenza_ on skype and he had unbanned me, I logged on the servers 10 minutes later I get banned again. This is very frustrating and since no one answers my appeals or my sky messages I'm leaving it out here for anyone to see how bad you guys have been treeating me. I planned on taking this server seriously and bringing a different community of people since I have many contacts but if this keeps happening, I wont even be able to play on the server. Please answer my appeal or fix this issue. Thank you.

Yes, but you don't know the whole story. He got banned for something he did on a scrimmage server, which shouldn't have happened in the first place. He got banned for Forum Behavior but he just behaved badly in a scrim. And plus the person who banned him started the flame war on purpose just so he could get him banned. <b>Think before you tell someone they're banned for a reason.</b>

Yes, I don't know the whole story, but he used another account to play on this server. So he ban evaded. And ban evading results in a ban on all accounts, even if the first ban was false.

I don't want to start a flame wars!<br>So the forums aren't a place to appeal your infraction. The only purpose of this post is, to lower your chances of getting appealed. If you want to appeal then send an email to support@avicus.net.
