We don't need more mods and there isn't a big enough player count to consider using prestiges anymore though Avicus put this upon itself by removing them and this destroyed the player count anyway. <br><br>Stats for 1 game should also be back like why did that get taken away?

here's a thought:<br><br><p>PRESTIGES DO NOT HAVE TO BE INFINITE </p><br><br>the devs/staff just need to stop screwing about with 1.7 and bring back prestiges, which are basically guaranteed to bring back people and keep them playing, which will boost player counts which will lead to even higher player counts. yet every time, "oh owner said no cause he didnt want to keep making prestiges". just make a set amount, and tell the &gt;1% no-lifers who reach max prestige to fuck off if they ask for more. it just makes no sense that avicus staff will go so far to pander to those people who get stupid high prestiges that they just won't do them at all. in fact, it's almost as if they&nbsp;<i>want</i> avicus to die...<br><br><br><br>...oh<i> shit</i>

Bye /vanish, i mean like /nick. so the Mod changes their name temporarily like /disguise bobby and they loose the "MOD" prefix by their name. Example:<br><br>Urpleglurp: /report Hacker fly bhop fly ka antikb<br>*Mod logs on<br>*Hacker toggles turning off all hacks<br>MOD: /nick mary<br>*Hacker (thinking) Ayy the mods gone.&nbsp;<br>*turns hacks on<br>MOD: /ban Hacker fly ka anti kb bhop<br>&nbsp;<br>I dont mean they actually disapear&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Also the blood effect will be togglable.

As long as staff doesn't care what community says, this server keep getting worse. People say 'Prestiges was the only reason I was playing.' And staff keeps 'We will not bring it back!" You want people to join and play on your server, but you don't fucking care what they need, or how &nbsp;they would enjoy more. Then they just bring shit game modes and no one even plays it.

We do listen to the community, but there are some things we cannot do. If we were to implement everything suggested Avicus would be in a much worse state than it currently is in. Also, keep in mind that when we do implement suggestions, such as new game modes or bringing them back... No one plays them. Everyone wanted skywars and nexus back, but it is empty 99% of its uptime. Do you understand what perspective we are coming from?

Aight can I please ask why isn't prestiges gonna be back?

I stated why in the comment above your original one! :P I said that it will conflict with the current badge system we have in place. I don't necessarily believe it's a bad idea to bring it back, but in terms of logistics and development force I do not think it is possible.

We do listen to the community, but there are some things we cannot do. If we were to implement everything suggested Avicus would be in a much worse state than it currently is in. Also, keep in mind that when we do implement suggestions, such as new game modes or bringing them back... No one plays them. Everyone wanted skywars and nexus back, but it is empty 99% of its uptime. Do you understand what perspective we are coming from?

When Nexus got added back people played it, but the neglect for Nexus and CTH and not fixing the glitch that was there for well over 2 years(may be less) is why people stopped playing it. Deathmatch is pretty much Nexus but missing a lot of maps and with shitty kits and it gets played &nbsp;still, obviously not as much as Nebula. A lot of the Nexus/CTH players have left since the glitch(not necessarily the reason people left but a factor). Skywars was a cool idea but didn't work rip. Another thing (instead of replying again I'll just add this) is that I'm sure there's ways to add prestiges and badges, there have been countless suggestions, one being to use a number instead of a symbol and that wouldn't conflict(I wouldn't think atleast), I mean re adding the separate XP would be something that would take a while maybe but still. Also I never understood why he removed prestiges because of not being able to keep adding more, like who says you have to? He could have left it as it was, i mean everything has an end yakno

here's a thought:<br><br><p>PRESTIGES DO NOT HAVE TO BE INFINITE </p><br><br>the devs/staff just need to stop screwing about with 1.7 and bring back prestiges, which are basically guaranteed to bring back people and keep them playing, which will boost player counts which will lead to even higher player counts. yet every time, "oh owner said no cause he didnt want to keep making prestiges". just make a set amount, and tell the &gt;1% no-lifers who reach max prestige to fuck off if they ask for more. it just makes no sense that avicus staff will go so far to pander to those people who get stupid high prestiges that they just won't do them at all. in fact, it's almost as if they&nbsp;<i>want</i> avicus to die...<br><br><br><br>...oh<i> shit</i>
