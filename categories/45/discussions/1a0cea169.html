I saw this last night. It's a great video, however I wish every homeless person was like this :/ i was in London at the start of this year, and walked past someone who was sitting down on the pavement begging, and as soon as i'd walked past I did feel a bit bad for him. Then we walked back down the street a while later and he was standing in the exact same spot holding a pack of cigarettes and smoking one of them with this woman standing next to him, and i was really glad I hadn't given him anything then -.- i think they should have done this experiment on more than one person tbh, there are at least as many selfish people out there as there are good ones like this person.

There are people who pretend to be homeless, but are really just "working" as homeless people who know the best places to beg can make as much as the average working person. ez money. And those kind of people make me sick.

I gave some pocket change to some college students, like 89 cents (all I had :p) then this guy behind me's tryna impress us cos he's an immature little boy and he wanted our approval and he gave them 20$. We start walking, and by the time we come back they have straws in their hands and bags of cocaine or meth (I didn't look, but probs meth, cant get too much cocaine for $20) Now, who could've financed that? Ye, there are those ppl out there.

That's so messed up :( i give to people who are playing the guitar in the metro station or something like that since they actually work for the money. If someones just sitting there and looks shaven or wearing decent clothes thats when i dont trust them. But people who make an effort, I like.

Now you wish a lot more people would give to other people, they don't know, what they need/want, no matter what it is. Whether it's a game like cs:go or a simple $5. Hell, I just recently bought someone cs:go that I don't even know well. Something small can change people.

If he gave up on life he'd've killed himself... but he's out there trying to make a living. He can't get a job cos he has no way to pay for a car or anything of the sort, so this is the only way he can feed himself, other than like being a prostitute or a pusher or something...<br>If you're telling me that it's better for him to start doing illegal things to make money than asking for goodwill from passerbys, GTFO.
