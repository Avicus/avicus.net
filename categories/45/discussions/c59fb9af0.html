is this considered advertising though? When you read the vid discription there&nbsp;is an ip for a dif server&nbsp;and in the actual video it shows a dif server ip. Nothing to do with avicus. :/ just wondering in case

Exactly. Why play with some famous YouTuber that barely talks to his own fans instead of&nbsp;play on Avicus with a bunch of amazing people.<br><br><b><i></i>EDIT:&nbsp;</b>Though I am happy you met him. :)<br>

That is exactly why I haven't watched tbnrfrags and all those famous YouTubers for a really like time. It is better to have friends who talk to you than people who don't talk to you.

He is just stating that he met a guy he looks up for, I don't see why you have to be mean steven, and everyone else saying 'fanboy' stuff. You should respect him.<br><br>Note: That if you don't like him because he is a fanboy, that is considered discrimination, and discrimination is against rules... so please stop.

Are you serious gabe? -_-<br>Since when did I say I didn't like him....?<br>I actually think he's a cool guy tbh.<br><br>I was just saying it was fanboyish to post a topic about a youtuber who has nothing to do with this server on this forum. -_-

Don't be so harsh on him just because the video isn't avicus related. If he wants to share it, let him.&nbsp;

Look, sorry if I was being mean but, he finds a youtuber on a server, good for you and gratz, but you don't need to post it on a different server's forum.

Exatcly. And i sorta agree that some famous youtubers barely talk to their fans and steven, it's like your comment of "fanboys" it's pretty annoying and hurtful tbh. We need to respect to whom the person likes or looks up on.

edit: nvm about what i said steven since u apologized
