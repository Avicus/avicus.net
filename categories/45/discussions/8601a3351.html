<b><u><b>First of all, let me say that this is becoming a problem on many servers, especially Hypixel and Pot Pvp related servers.<br></b></u></b><u><b></b></u><br>Ever been in a game of SkyWars (Hypixel) and you kill this really geared guy when you have no armour. Yeah, we've all been there. If you've been watching chat at that point, you'll probably see he's said "ez" or "L" or something like that. That's called Toxicity, or being toxic.<br>You probably just write it off, but to some weird people it sticks. I guess the saying "Stick and Stones may break my bones, but names will never hurt me" comes into effect here. Personally I'm not one of these people, but recently, the toxicity has gotten way worse, and it's time someone did something to stop it.<br><br><i><u></u></i><b><b>Why toxicity is stupid and unneeded?</b></b> I will be 100% honest here, and say that I am very toxic myself, but I never say it in public chat. The only place where it's allowed to be said really is in party chat, where you and your friends can understand that it's probably just a bit of banter. It's also unneeded because little children play Minecraft, and if they see a "fuck you", "You're shit" or something related to this, not only will they be turned off playing what can be a great and awesome game, they can take pretty large offense to this, because of their young age.<br><br><b><b>But toxicity is just saltiness?</b></b> Duh, what else would it be? It's still unneeded none the less. If most people can control their fingers typing those unneeded words, you can too (if you're prone to it).<br><br><b><b>Should I be offended by toxicity?</b></b> As much as we'd all like toxicity to be stopped, we can all not get offended by it. They are just words after all.<br><br><b><b>What can we do to stop toxicity?</b></b> Think about this. How many of your friends and idols do you know would get worked up by a fucking block game? <b><b>********</b></b> Now that you've had a little think, how many was it? I counted none for me. You should as well. <br><br><b><b>How Avicus relates to toxicity? </b></b>You'd probably expect me to go on about how Avicus players are really toxic and it needs to stop, but in fact it's the complete opposite. Avicus is one of the only servers I know right now that everyone says "gg", "Good Game!" or related words constantly.<br><br><b><u><b>SO TO THAT, I CONGRATULATE EVERYONE ON AVICUS!</b></u></b><br><br><b></b>

This is maybe a little "too much" but if the saltiness continue to a big problem, maybe a chat-filter plugin would suit good? Maybe replace toxic words to better ones?<br><br><b><i>Examples:</i></b><br>ez = good game<br>idiot = smartass<br>noob = pro<br>shit = excelent<br><br><b>It would create very funny sentences:</b><br>You're such a <i>smartass</i>.<br>You're <i>excelent</i>.<br><br>Please don't take this too serious, but it's still a cool idea, isn't it?
