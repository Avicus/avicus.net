&nbsp;As you can see the sword he is holding and the face he is pulling means that he want to kill someone so bad. Therefore rendering this art not suitable, we have to take into consideration that this is a&nbsp;<u><b>Minecraft</b></u><b></b> server's forum and you can be bothered to make a stupid post like that, literally no one cares about that. You really have the time to circle a&nbsp;<b><u>Minecraft</u></b> art on the side of the page. This is just so so sad and&nbsp;<b><u>autistic</u><i></i></b> SO I REALLY HOPE YOU WERE JOKING WITH THE POST !

This post was over-excessive and unnecessary.<br><br>The OPs post may be somewhat in this category but calling his actions sad and autistic... really?<br><br><b>@OP:</b> Anyway, I somewhat agree with kiwi here Crimson.

I hope you get a life soon, and start to leave me alone. Because you seem to hate me so much, yet you keep getting involved with things I do. There a reason for you to get involved? Probably not, you just like to cause salt don't ya?

Mate, don't tell me to stop being salty on the forums when you're the one constantly posting useless stuff and telling people to f*ck off. And maybe you should get a life as well? You're banned here and never in a million years are you getting appealed so stop evading and move on. Not trying to sound harsh but your unnecessary drama posts aren't needed. I've toned down my forums toxicity now you should do the same. :D<br><br>I'll apologise if my past posts made you think I hated you, but I don't. Removed my previous comments, as they were unnecessary as well.
