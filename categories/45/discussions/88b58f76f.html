Hi guys. I've been playing for about 2 years (on this server).  I do admit I can get a little bit raged quite a lot and do sometimes say not kind things. I'm trying to change from this behavior because i realized that it put a bad rep on the staff and the server overall. Another reason i'm trying to stop is that I DON'T WANT TO EVER GET BANNED. I love playing on this server it is great and and really fun. There are really nice people and Mods help if you have anything to ask.

                                                                                    Thanks for reading.

Just try and remember it's just a game. I completely lost interest in my KD and stats. It lets you focus more on enjoying the game instead of making your profile look good.<br><br>Nice of you to try and change your attitude.

I dont try to make my profile look good. &nbsp;But I stopped it was ruining my fun trying to make my profile look good. &nbsp;Also, its just a game, there is no need to get mad if someone kills you C: &nbsp;it normally just means they either have an advantage, or better skills, thats all

It's good that you're admitting and apologizing. Not a lot of people on the internet do that, unfortunately. Avicus and Minecraft in whole is just a game, so there's no need to rage, even though we really want to sometimes :)
