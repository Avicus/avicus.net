Theolucy are you having a joke...&nbsp;<br><br>Luis Suarez is violent and cocky, he just got a two year international ban for biting!&nbsp;<br><br>Miley Cyrus has to get naked on camera and attempt to be seductive to make her music sell. She is also destroying feminism and she can't sing. She only got famous because of her rich dad. &nbsp;<br><br>My role models, well i don't really have one. However on Avicus it would be Jozzmcozz but in the world i think it would be either Chris Paul or Nelson Mandela.&nbsp;<br><br><br>EDIT: Wow, you can tell i made this before school. Sorry Theo, i fell really stupid now....&nbsp;<br>My on topic reply.&nbsp;<br><br>Well, cedd and rot because they know the testicle techniques better than anyone.
