<p>For the Avicus Spotify account it will be 1 account for all the players on Avicus to use. (Listen to music, listen to peoples favorited music throughout the server).</p><p><br></p><p>I know Avicus has a TeamSpeak account with a music bot. But the Spotify account would be able to play many more songs, ones you know of, some you stumble upon and end up liking, or just a free way to listen to good music. </p><p>The issue I'm having right now is, an E-mail. Unless a staff wants to be nice and let me use the Avicus email because it is for the server. Or if someone can make an E-mail or give me an E-mail to use that would be much appreciated.</p><p><br></p><p>Let me know down below (Dr.&nbsp;Sues)&nbsp;if you think you would use&nbsp;it, or if its a waste of time.&nbsp;</p><p>Ill make a post in the future with the E-mail, Password,&nbsp;&amp; username if many people want to use it.</p><p><br></p><p>-Neb&nbsp;</p>

Having an account so open isn't a good idea, because I can only see people trolling, and it'd need some form of regulation... If you want the Music Bot to play some songs, you can request them instead. <br><br>I personally have access to the account, so add 'miaeeno' on Skype if you want me to add them.

%100 percent have thought about the trolling. But. If enough people are interested (15-20ish) I will probably still make one because the accounts are free and if it gets destroyed no ones really losing anything.
