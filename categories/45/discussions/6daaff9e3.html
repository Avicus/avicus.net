Howdy,<br><br>The top three records out of group B were<br>Labradoodles 4-0-1 (4th win assumed because Labradoodles wasn't allowed to play HOME but HOME went win-less otherwise)<br>Cennet 4-1-0<br>Team Allah 3-1-1<br><br>After the match a member of Labradoodles was told in chat not to log off by Tazz. The player was not frozen. Tazz then moved our player into the screensharing room and was having him download join.me. Tazz at this point said "Ok thanks bye" and our player logged off minecraft. Here's the issue. Our player was being screenshared for an autoclicker and was told he was. Tazz also said "Ok thanks bye" to make it seem like the screensharing was over. Autoclickers can be deleted without closing minecraft so the fact that he closed minecraft is inconsequential to our DQ. <br><br>However Tazz justified it anyways claiming that the autoclicker detector had registered him at 31 cps (surprisingly not regularly considering it was an "autoclicker"). Tazz then demanded that our player prove that he could click at 31 cps. When our player only managed 15 cps Tazz took this as him autoclicking. However, as confirmed by ALM former developer the clicks a player has can be packeted due to lag and therefore register as much higher than they actually are and without other proof or a ridiculously high cps on a lagless suspect it does not qualify as evidence.&nbsp;<br><br>When this was brought to their attention, conveniently the officials many of whom are on Team Allah (including Tazz) decided that it was illegal for us to have players who were sharing accounts. We however had asked the refs and officials earlier if we were allowed to do this and were given this response.&nbsp;<a href="https://cdn.pbrd.co/images/5tBab5ZhA.png" title="Link: https://cdn.pbrd.co/images/5tBab5ZhA.png">https://cdn.pbrd.co/images/5tBab5ZhA.png</a>&nbsp;The Officials are just allowing Team Allah through due to bias. If you want to win the tourney try winning group stages Allah.<br><br>Note: Some officials, refs and other various staff members have been useful and fair in this process I appreciate these ones and would like to commend them on their efforts to maintain a sense of fairness in these tournaments.<br><a href="https://gyazo.com/dcc2a4bc97513e2488bee6a0da6ee6b4" title="Link: https://gyazo.com/dcc2a4bc97513e2488bee6a0da6ee6b4">https://gyazo.com/dcc2a4bc97513e2488bee6a0da6ee6b4</a>

A member of my team sent it to me, PieZ does not deny that he said it, but he claims that the ref who asked the question messed up the question so that it said something else. However both PieZ and the ref confirm that it was their mistake not ours that led to this confusion.

You're right, I wasn't there. But luckily you were, someone who has nothing to gain from us being DQ'd and is completely trustworthy right? Lol the fact that someone who gets into invitationals if we get DQ'd did the ss in the first place should be enough to reverse this decision. The only reason we're DQ'd is because you can't win a tourney without cheating.

No, you're DQed for 3 reasons actually. 1 is a mistake on our behalf, correct, but the rule set still has your answer.

Its common sense. Why should players who aren't on the roster be allowed to play? If these tournaments were at some public place, you wouldn't be able to switch accounts or any of that crap. You would play with whoever you had available and is on the roster. It's like two teams switching accounts so they can win one match which benefits.

That is undeniable. However, the event staff gave the Labradoodles an answer that strongly implied that such actions are allowed, so the team cannot be fully held responsible.

Even Tazz admits the account thing was a mistake of theirs, so idk why you're arguing that point. Anyways, its common sense that the account must be pre-registered not the actual person. It is a reasonable rule but when we're told its allowed by tourney staff it is also reasonable that we wouldn't follow it.

Map making and knowing how to play it are very different things. A map maker usually will only have a basic idea of how the map will be played and one that everyone else can match by simply viewing the map.

I'm not totally sure where you got bias from... He was asked to ss and left. The only thing that I kind of understand is when Tazz says "bye" you can probably take that as "Okay, you're clean.", but in all honesty, if you know that if you leave in the middle of the ss, before they have even looked at anything... I would have at least asked. At least say something like "We're done?" then wait for a response. The fact that he just left almost is enough to say that he wanted to leave because he had a client somewhere, or that he was nervous. It's not normal for someone to ask to ss you then just say "Okay, you're good, thanks." That doesn't make much sense at all...

Not replying to anyone in specific, this is going to be general. <br><br>The standard (in terms of rules) for competitive PvP servers is if you log out of Minecraft when asked to ss, you get banned. The fact is that though (if I got the person right, this is off the small amount of posts I've read) I doubt Sosa cheats, clients with built-in autoclickers are a reality as well. Closing MC = instant ban on ANY server that supports screensharing, everyone knows that. You can't blame anyone else but the player who didn't think before acting. I won't speculate about whether the given player was in fact cheating or not, but still breaking the rules should deserve punishment. The match the player left in should've been replayed saying that. There is no solid evidence of that player cheating at all. ALM saying the autoclicker detector was wrong sometimes renders the little evidence that was there useless. Moving on, last tournament account sharing was also illegal and led to UbeR being DQ'd. I don't know about the grey area here because I don't think Axhal would have even played on that account during the tournament, but I could be wrong. I mean, if no one outside the registered players were playing in that match given the circumstances I explained, just either replay the match or let it go.&nbsp;<br><br>When I have nothing better to do in class ^^^

Lol. The 'ok thanks bye' is literally irrelevant. We were in the room for probably 9 minutes. Around the 5th, someone poked me saying that Axhal had logged off. At this stage I checked, and I msged PieZ telling him to ban him. I asked Axhal why he logged off. He said he had to so he could download join.me - which is complete bullshit by the way lmao. I said he'd be getting banned, piez banned him, I said 'ok thanks bye'. He still wasn't on join.me, about 9 minutes after I sent him the link, which is fishy in itself lmao.

Can be made but it would make no sense since officials take decisions about what they think and you can analyse the map and get strats exactly like i can, you get the map on scrim servers before the tourney so you could analyze it and do whatever and break every single block if you think were hiding some shit lolo

Yes, the issue I have is not with Sosa being banned for leaving. The problem I have is that the screenshare was botched purposely by an official who directly stands to benefit from us being DQed. As far as the account sharing goes, we were told by event staff we were allowed to do it and therefore that is not our fault.

I can agree i don't like the idea of an official who was playing conducting the screen share.<br><br>Even if you want to trust and believe and officials are not bias it's still abit controversial and general and should be a no-go.<br><br>Officials decision at the end of the day but they should 100% learn from this even if they themselves think they can justify it.

This is true but if someone leaves a ss it's an automatic ban and their team gets DQ'd. That's what happened. There's no bias. I don't understand what everyone is talking about...

This is true but if someone leaves a ss it's an automatic ban and their team gets DQ'd. That's what happened. There's no bias. I don't understand what everyone is talking about...

He botched the SS though... You just appear to be content at ignoring this for whatever reason though and over simplifying it to: player leaves ss so ban

No, you're biased for: <br>-taking the SS in the first place<br>-botching it and banning anyways<br>-trying to come up with an alternate reason to DQ us<br>-being official and playing in a tourney that you continue to work on<br>-Screensharing Sosa after he disconnected from minecraft and then declaring that since he can't click 31 cps he was using an autoclicker<br>:)
