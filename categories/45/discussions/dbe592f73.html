Each punishment for "Fake leaving posts" are all different scenarios and cannot be compared to others easily. I agree that some people are punished differently to others, but if you are deeply concerned email&nbsp;<i>support@avicus.net&nbsp;</i>to resolve this. I advise you to take evidence and dates from both leaving posts and explain the situation in detail so there is little confusion.

Dude who cares. Turn off your computer or something, don't worry about it. Vinh has made 1 leaving post, as you've made 10 and can't stick to it for a day. I was also told that you made a deal with Para saying if you got 1 more punishment, you would be banned.<br><br>Also, you were banned for being rude. Calling someone a "bean" won't help.

Normally, we do not punish straight away for false leaving posts. Normally, we simply lock the post and give a simple warning. However, in your case there were many posts which led to a more extensive punishment. Alas, it appears your infraction was appealed. So I don't see the cause for concern. However, I must admit I did not see _Vinh's post so I did not issue any sort of message.<br><br><br>If you need further reference:&nbsp;<br><ol style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 12px 25px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; "><li>Discussions surrounding personal updates, accomplishments or events is frowned upon as they are meant to be inclusive rather than oriented around a single person. Punishments for this will only be distributed in the event that a user continuously uses the forums for this purpose alone.</li></ol>

Exactly. If it's not a leaving post, but it's a personal post, then it should be punished/locked.

The difference between you are other people, is that you've made multiple leaving posts... Yes, this is punishable, but it's also something that was mostly meant so that people don't just say they're leaving over and over and never do.<br><br>Also, you're lucky you weren't banned earlier, you made a deal with Para saying that if you broke any rules you would be banned. You got 3 infractions before you were banned, and one of them was exactly what you were banned for the first time. I don't mean to be rude, but you kinda dug yourself into this hole, and there's no way out...

There should be a separate section for people to post personal updates as it is the players' own choice whether they want to share what's happening or if they have an update (leaving or returning). Perhaps if it is fake, then a punishment should be handed out (reasonable punishment). But it would have to be fair and other players shouldn't be treated unfairly.

See? Exactly what I mean. If nothing goes your way you get mad over it. Like I said, maturity goes a long way. You were banned for those innapropriate outbursts, which is still happening.

You have a point. But again, you see how many people keep posting "going away" posts and coming back? It's baisically a spam section. Some people stick to it, while others do it for attention and emotion.
