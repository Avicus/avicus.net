I have a couple questions about these ''XML'' Files:<br><br><i>What are they?<br></i><br><i>What do you use them for?<br></i><br><i>Why do you use them?<br></i><br><i>How do you use them?<br></i><br>If some map developer could clear this up i would be very thankful.&nbsp;<br><br>-Kevin

XML is like a code with regions, team-sizes, gamrules etc which is for maps

The way I've kinda learned XML, or at least what each part does, is by looking at a map you know fairly well and looking at each part and what they do.<br><br>So take a look at Clay War's XML -&nbsp;<a href="https://maps.avicus.net/atlas/DTM/ClayWars/map.xml" title="Link: https://maps.avicus.net/atlas/DTM/ClayWars/map.xml">https://maps.avicus.net/atlas/DTM/ClayWars/map.xml</a><br>Right at the top, you can see there's the map name, and map author. A little below that, the teams are defined, then the spawn points &amp; observer spawn. And so on with the other components of the map.<br><br><a href="https://docs.avicus.net/en/">https://docs.avicus.net/en/</a>&nbsp;of course is another great tool, you get to look at each module, and look at what extent you can use your XML to do things with. Some XMLs can be basic, and others can be 3000 lines worth of a beast.

The documentation does not have every feature; there are certain things you can do that have no mention on that page. If there is something that you would like to do, and are unsure of how to do it, feel free to ask a map developer about it.

why don't the mapdevs add those features to the documentation? would probably save them some time answering questions that they could be using for removing maps.

even if you do, good luck trying to get any maps past the "staff". when was the last time somebody actually made a map that was added to the legit rotation. good luck, you have a better chance of having a mega walls map being added too hypixle.

I guess if somebody had enough free time, they could add it. It's not really part of the map developers' job, though.

I agree that this is a problem. Once I am back from my leave, I will make an effort to do something about it.
