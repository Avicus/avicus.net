Ok, so I don't know if many of you what the Deep Web is but lets look at it like this.<br><br><br>The Clear web is: <br>-FireFox<br>-GoogleChrome<br>-InternetExplorer<br><br><br>So your probably wondering ok so what.. Well the reason for the Deep web being a thing is.. You can visit sites that you wouldn't be able to access on the Clear Web.<br><br>(Will make a video on how to get it if some of you want to know)<br><br>(WARNING) If you do decide to use the Deep Web or take a look at it do not and I mean DO NOT put the Browser in full screen well you're accessing the sites because it will give access for hackers to see your screen and they'll have the power to access your computer files etc...<br><br>So I wanna know what your opinions or thoughts about the deep web.

No the deep web itself is not illegal...<br><br>Just the 'bad' websites are illegal. However, you can use it to download torrents and stuff or whatever

The deep web is very good if you want to remain completely private, or just enhance your browsing experience.<br><br>The deep web is also known as "The Dark Net", and contains about 500 times the amount of information as the "Surface Net". It can be accessed through the "Tor" browser, as a normal browser such as chrome or Firefox will not work. Tor was actually created as a military project to communicate in enemy territories using encrypted data to stay safe. I find the Darknet quite intriguing, however I'd heavily advise being cautious. Most of the sites on the deep web finish in .onion urls, instead of .com or something similar. Many of these sites are illegal and horde criminal activites such as drug markets, sex slavery, illegal porn, hitmen for hire etc. The beauty of the darknet is that no one can track it, which makes your online experience more secure if you use it correctly. On the other hand if you make simple mistakes, such as log into an email or facebook account, or set the browser size to your screen resolution it gives the ability for people to track you. No, setting the browser to fullscreen won't let hackers directly control your computer, although it will make it a heck of a lot easier to find out who you are.&nbsp;<br><br>Overall, some amazing things have been created by people worldwide through the darknet, however a lot of terrible things have been done there too.<br><br><i>I hope this helped :)</i>

It doesn't let people find out who you are directly and instantly, although it narrows it down a lot. If you set the browser to your screen resolution it let's the website know what resolution you're using and the size/location of your toolbar etc. I'm not sure how exactly, but this is apparently a fairly sufficient amount of information to help track down a person.
