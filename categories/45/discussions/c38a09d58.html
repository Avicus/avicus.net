Hey guys,<br>I know some of you guys play basketball so I want to know some things so we can compare.<br><br>PPG (Points per game) - We don't have a stat board but I would say maybe like 8 points per game, which for my team is good.<br><br>Team W/L ratio - I think we went 5 for 32 or something<br><br>What position are you? - I'm Point guard and shooting guard.<br><br>For fun have you had any ankle breakers? - I did :P and I even made the shot right after and I have it on video but It has some personal things so...

PPG - 5 points on average<br>W/L - We play in seasons (winter + summer) and so the teams can switch up. With my current team we're going 9 wins to 3 losses, and every loss have been without a full squad.<br>Position - Point guard and sweeper (team made-up role) where I receive the rebounds from the tall, and then penetrate the ball movement past their defense<br><br>I don't really have shooting skills so I am responsible for setting up plays; I have the most assists.
