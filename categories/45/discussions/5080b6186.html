I watch anime and this summer i started watching bleach. I have completed Naruto and One piece and watch the new episodes when they come out. I have also watch the first season of Attack on Titan. I have watched Death Note (probably the best ever!!! SO INTENSE) &nbsp;and i have watched fullmetal alchemist (first series) also watched Yugioh (completed) &nbsp;Dragon ball (all the series such as dragon ball z, dragon ball gt, dragon ball, dragon ball z kai) and Avatar the last airbender<br><br>Which anime do you watch? which is your favorite? do you watch anime? if not you should! :D

Fairy Tail hands down.<br>Attack on Titan is really cool as well!<br>Naruto Shippuden is okay haha I used to watch it a lot but I gained more interest in Fairy Tail.<br>I never really found One Piece interesting, but I might give it a try someday ^_^

I'm sorry to say that fairy tail, in my opinion is absolute crap. The story line progresses WAY too quickly, and natsu beat sting with this frikin Nakama bullshit which has been overused and is extremely cliche in anime. (Although I do admit alot of the girls are extremely hot. &lt;3 That's one of the reasons why I keep watching it.)<br>One piece is pretty nice, I like it imo.<br>Naruto SHIPPUDEN is much better, part I was quite boring. But honestly part II is pretty sweet.<br>But favorite anime of all-time, has got to be FMA brotherhood. It's so beatifully crafted, it's more than just an anime. Everything is planned out perfectly and is the best anime I have ever watched. I wouldn't mind a new series, but I feel it would be just repetitive. I have a few other anime that are my favorite but I can't really say it here...

lunax ive watched really only shonen so far. But i like something that has a some action but a really deep plot line.

Erm comedy i would say Baka and Test it is a romantic comedy, but like barely ANY romance its more of a comedy in my opinion. You might not like it though :P<br>And i dont know that many other comedies that i truthfully enjoyed i might look back on my watch list though.

ALL OF YOU NEED to watch Code Geass<br><br>If you liked Death Note (very similar concept, where the protagonist gets a power that challenges God) , you'll LOVE Code Geass.<br><br>If you liked Breaking Bad (Not anime but somewhat similar concept), you'll love Code Geass.<br><br>It's rated as one of the best animes of all time, right up there with Cowboy Bebop, Death Note, Sword Art Online, etc.

xD nice warbry :D ye the fights in One piece are really good, but some of the bleach fights can compare to the intensity. I kind of wish luffy had more modes that he could use. Im not gonna say anything else because i dont want to spoil anything xD
