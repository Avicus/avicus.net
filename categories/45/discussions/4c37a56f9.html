Inappropriate names: I don't understand why.

I'm going to be completely honest here, I've looked at the network's infraction history many times, and I don't understand why so many people have such profane and/or sexually-oriented usernames in Minecraft. If you're someone like me who's real dedicated to keeping this network a clean place, then I immediately /report them, and these people have all been tempbanned, so for that I give a loud applause to the staff :)<br><br>Still, why is this even an issue in the first place? On a well-organized network like this one, if there's an inappropriate name in the death messages/chat messages, then you're gonna get tempbanned: no questions asked, and given that incentive, I still saw someone yesterday with a racist username and skin. If anyone wants to even try to give me a reason, I don't want to hear it, because it's NOT a good reason, whatever it may be. Thanks for reading, I really hope this issue becomes clear to everyone working to make this community as good as it gets.<br><br>P.S.<br>To those who think those kinds of things are funny, let me tell you as a fact set in stone that it will cause more provocation and less amusement.

I know that there's a plugin that allows optional usernames. I've seen it on a different server before.

There is freedom for the individual to choose whatever username they decide on. Ultimately, if they choose a username of inappropriate characteristics, then they will be punished.It is up for the person's jurisdiction to decide on what they want, however they just need to be sensical while selecting.

What I think is:<br>- Some people pick those kind of usernames because they might not care about this server but they do care about Hypixel for example, so they don't care if they're banned or not and yes, "Because it's funny" would be a good answer in these kind of situations because most of them might not be racist at all.<br>- Now, if certain people actually do it because they're racist, then I highly agree with the opinion you stated above.<br><br>P.S: Some people actually choose these kind of names because they think they're OG but I find this dumb.

@Dinlas I understand exactly what you're saying, and as you said, that freedom still doesn't give them freedom from any repercussions that come. But still, I would expect more people to think ahead about what kind of trouble that kind of name could get themselves into.<br><br>@Juanoh If they don't really care about this server, then that's they're loss, since this is the best community I know of. And, tbh, I think "because it's funny" is more of an excuse than a reason, but that's the way I see it.

mojang has a username filter, but it doesn't catch everything. imo they need to fix that, but people shouldn't be namin themselves that shit in the first place. one guy added swear words to his name and mojang changed it to something else, but they're not gonna do that to everyone. just have the maturity and respect to choose a good name.

Well, there's good attention and then there's bad attention. Obviously by doing the actions stated above, they're gaining more negative attention, or at least on this network they are.

I felt it necessary to bring this up for a bit of a personalized reason, and it's that I've had to use /report for inappropriate names 4 times in the past 2 days. I apologize if you think this thread is unnecessary, but I still thought that it was a (somewhat problematic) topic to bring up on the forums for the reason stated above.

@Notal and @Cyneric_<br><br>OK then, let me ask you a question.&nbsp; Why don't you guys use hacked clients?&nbsp;&nbsp; Your answer might me something like this: I don't want to cheat.&nbsp; I hate hackers, so why would I be one?&nbsp; <u>I don't want to be banned.</u>&nbsp; Then I might ask you, What would get you banned?&nbsp; Your answer might me: breaking the rules.&nbsp; If you don't care about breaking the rules, or you feel like you can do whatever you want, you would break the rules.&nbsp; You would swear, be mean, or even hack.&nbsp; But the fact that you care about the rules tells everyone that you won't do anything to get in trouble.&nbsp; Same about changing your name to something inappropriate.&nbsp; Obviously you don't give a flying fuck.&nbsp; If you did, you would have changed your name to something nice and appropriate.&nbsp; So my post was dumb and it did make sense.&nbsp; You just have to look at it at a different angle.
