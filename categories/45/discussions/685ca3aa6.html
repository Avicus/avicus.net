<i>Well ofcourse it can happen because it just did but what if it was even further developed?</i><br><br><br>Virtual Reality is been a dream for many people. Actually its been here for quite some time. In case people haven't heard, there is a virtual reality headset called the Oculus Rift. The price range i think is like $300-$400. &nbsp;I saw some gameplays and its not bad considering the games. I mean, they look real and graphics are not bad considering it to be new but it is not as great. I have seen a guy playing Battlefield 3 or 4? idk and it looked sweet. The problem is its a bit hard to control.<br><br>Virtual Reality seems possible now. Ever since watching SAO, i want Virtual reality to come true and it may be so. Of course, i am not going to buy an Oculus Rift because the games and quality still need to be developed. Virtual Reality has potential in the nearer future. So my question is, would you consider being in virtual reality in the future? It has so much potential in it. What games would you play? What would you do in VR? Would it be fun an exciting to you?<br><br>there are some other Virtual Reality headsets like Project Morpheous but it did not say the price.<br><br>Discuss and would you buy an Oculus Rift? I think you can buy one. IT said to be available this year.&nbsp;<br><br>So um ya, discuss about Virtual Reality and all its posibblities<br><img alt="" src="https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/oculus-rift-dk2.jpg?w=400"><br><br><img alt=""><br><img alt="">

I personally wouldn't buy one right now, but I have high hopes for Oculus( and VR in general) as they released Cresent Bay at CES. Razer also launched OSVR at CES, which is open source which means anyone can edit it.

Although I'll probably not get one, I'm always supportive of technology improving and the innovation behind it, and I assume it would definitely be worth it. Everyone that I've seen using one has been shown to be blown away.

We will <b>never</b> get as close to SAO.&nbsp;<br><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rND6lpHF1M">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rND6lpHF1M</a>

Imo it's impossible for our time to get as close to SAO but who knows, polymers can do a lot of amazing things. Afaik, there are actual hentai sinulators which simulate... you know, when you put it on.

I got to try out&nbsp;Oculus Rift when I went to a gaming expo. I can't say the quality was great, but I'm sure it's been improved in the time since I last tried it out.&nbsp;Feels pretty weird using it, it is quite bulky, but I'm sure you'd adjust.<br><br>Looking forward to seeing future advancements in virtual reality and computer engineering.
