So I know this isn't the place to talk about this but I recently left a team called Apollo now known as Animal Kingdom and people I'm not going to mention who have poked me in ts and other things saying that if I join another a team that I want to join I will "spy" on them. I left Apollo ok I am not at the moment going to join back so please may you stop saying that I am going to steal tactics and ideas from different teams to put them back into an ex team. Apollo members if you are reading this, whoever in there said I'm going to "spy" you should be ashamed. I don't care if it is a joke but so many people have come to me by saying I am a spy. So stop it please :)

Nobody in Apollo said anything. We have nothing against you. It was your decision to leave.<br><br>But saying "Apollo members if you are reading this, whoever in there said I'm going to spy you should be ashamed" is not fair, because nobody in their right mind in Apollo would say that, and you know it.

Dude that's harsh, if i were in his position i would presume it to be an old team mate too, it just so happens that it isn't and i told raging who i had heard it was on skype, i think he forwarded it onto zegita.
