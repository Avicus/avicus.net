I guess my journey here is coming to an abrupt end. Didn't really see this coming.<br><br>Playing competitively and being in Apollo was the main reason why I stayed playing the server. After making some mistakes that I can no longer fix and possibly losing a few friends, I'm out of Apollo and it doesn't seem that I'm able to join back.<br><br>Refereeing is no longer fun anymore, and now that I have no other reason to stay playing, I've decided to leave. Maybe I'll be that guy who comes back in a month or two who knows, but this is it for now.<br><br>Thanks for a long 3 years, it was filled with fun and joy and I've met great people that I won't forget. I'll probably be still on the forums because of habit, but in terms of server activity not much. Maybe on alts.<br><br>If you want to contact me, there's still skype and discord, I'll be on.<br><br>But for now, cya

So basically, you are going to leave because of some pathetic people arent your friends. Makes you more of a idiot than them.<br><br>It's just the fact that you are leaving because some people made you sad. How stupid and foolish is that?
