Of course it isn't 3000 people dying daily, I never said that. I think it's good that we acknowledge the events of this day, but I also think it should be a day to acknowledge not only the 3 plane crashes, but overall any attack that has hurt any country severely. It should be a day where we take time to remember any event that hurt a country so terribly.

My dad was lucky not to be working on a project in the city that day. He actually had one about a block away from the World Trade Center. Living in New York, I know a lot of people who were affected by what happened those 15 years ago, and it really saddens me to see what they had/have to go through.<br><br>Being in the fire service as well, I know many firefighters and police officers who were affected both mentally and physically, and even killed by the sad event.<br><br>Never forget.

Again, living in NYC, I have heard lots of stories relating to the incident. I would like to also point out that the firefighters, police and any other rescue workers who lost their lives gave a huge sacrifice, which we all need to recognize and appreciate. Without their sacrifices, a whole lot more of innocent lives would have been lost.<br><br>Never forget....

As someone who studied history no.&nbsp;<br>The bombings happened because of the bad blood between the nations. This problem between the areas could be traced back to 50 years ago. Even more depending on what you decide in.

Media coverage is strongest in the U.S as of now. It is the same on how a lot of countries know about the American elections and such. The Nuclear testing from North Korea does affect America in a way so that will be posted. Children being slaughtered in Africa and in Syria. It does not affect Americans. This allows news that came out of America to be over dramatized over certain issues. Go back to the American election. There are news stories out there calling both Trump and Clinton the worst possible people to ever get into office and other stuff like that. Now I don't care who you support, but having Clinton or Trump in the White House is not the worst possible choice in the world. America will not crumble and the same stupid cycle will happen in 4 years.&nbsp;<br>To put it this in smaller words. America writes the history through their media. It is easier for other countries to jump on to the media and soon enough it becomes as big as it is. &nbsp;<br>I am also not bashing Americans on my post. This is the truth on 3 studies I have read. College level studies ;)

Killings in Syria don't affect America, but terrorist attacks in Paris do? The media tends to favor one side, which is the West. Anyways, sorry if any of them seemed rude; lets get back on topic.

It does. France is a huge ally to America. America's biggest allies are in Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and Canada. Anything that happens in there will be in American mainstream news. I would say maybe to Russia as well because of the power they still have in the world and America is constantly watching them.

I agree, but this is also the 2nd of 2 attacks on American soil. First being a Pearl Harbor. Not that that should change the way we look at it, but if nothing else it changed the way America defends itself, it changed some laws, airline security, security for almost everything. if 9/11 had never happened a t of America would still be different, there would be much less security for everything. I mean, sure all of the other terrorist attacks/ any attacks or deaths&nbsp;should be comemorated but 9/11 is fairly recent and changed a lot about America. Lots of people still remember it and it's something they are never going to forget.&nbsp;<br><br>-on topic: Rest In Peace :( Praying for those who lost loved ones during this.

Unneeded :/ Everyday people die in africa just because they have nothing to eat or to drink, and in our countries, we spend money to remember those 3k people who died 15 years ago.<br><br>Why not just spend this money the african children who die each day? This makes way more sense. Stupid moralizers these days. (Nothing against the victims and or their families and friends.)
