I think the following features should be added or brought back!<br><ul><li>Everytime you get a kill streak it pops up in chat like three kill streak,</li><li>Bring back /m but also it says how many monuments you have broken,</li><li>When you go on your profile add the charts at the bottom so you can see how much XP you have earned last monuth etc.</li><li>Add a command like /k and it tells you how long you have been connected to the server .</li></ul><div>The kill streak would be good on TDM so you can see your progress and see who can get ty highest kill streak! Hope these are taken into consideration, thanks ElementProHD.</div>

If the killstreak messages only show on your screen, then maybe. Not if it would show up on everyone's screen though; the chat would be spammed with them in maps like Quintus and Venomous TDM. I'm pretty sure Kylo's planning to add back /match. Also, you can already see your weekly, monthly, and all-time credit count on your profile. I think the charts were what made the profiles take longer to load; don't quote me on that though. If it wasn't, then I agree, they should be added back.

Yea, you are right. Kylo removed the charts, because they took longer to load and took too much space in the databases or whatever.

I agree Element<br><br>Your Ideas are great and I wish they were all here.<br><br>An Idea is, instead of Every three kills it shows up, you could do something like /s ElementProHD &nbsp;and itv will show their streak atm
