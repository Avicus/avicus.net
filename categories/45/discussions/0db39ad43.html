I'm a little confused how you don't know the song you put on your own video. Frankly I wouldn't have clicked on it otherwise. Rake in that revenue gurl

It's not that he is bad, it's just that he is cocky and oblivious as all hell.

rly doe, Stimpy can't do ANYTHING when people get close to him, he relies on comboing as his opponent approaches to win fights. If you get 3-blocks or closer to him he's done for. He has no combos that he can use reliably when people get close in. Not saying he's bad, but he doesn't fight close in well. Most top PvPers can fights efficiently from 4 blocks or 3 blocks or less away, while he can only really dominate at the 3.5-4 block range.
