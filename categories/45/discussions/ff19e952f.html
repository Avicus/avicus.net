Ask me about anything; Avicus related when I was admin, life, random stuff or whatever tickles your fancy.<br>I'll answer with honesty since this server will be closing soon.

Overwatch and GTA V mostly.<br>The highest would be when I first was given the opportunity to administrate the server(skipping manager rank), and then influencing how the staff ran at the time; just interacting with the staff was awesome. The lowest would be the second time I was admin, where I came back to a lot of distrust between senior staff members - nothing was working because the damage was done, the only solution was to demote everyone and start again but we all know how everyone would have reacted.&nbsp;<br>I can understand why ALM was given owner, he has done some pretty neat stuff with the server but when I left Avicus, it was mostly full of ALM abusing his developer permissions and then being hypocritical. All in all I think ALM had good intentions, and is a nice bloke but yeah.

Junr the legend, how's Overwatch going?&nbsp;<br><br>When I first met you, you came off as immature which is why I think you struggled getting staff in the first place - but as time went on you became a small leader for younger staff members, so you always stay in the good books; haven't heard anything negative about you at all!
