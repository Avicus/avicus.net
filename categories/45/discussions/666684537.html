Once again my <u>LeaderBoard</u> ranks don't change... I was just wondering why this might happen. It happened once then went away, but now its back...

If you don't wish to contribute, do not answer. People have fun in different ways.

Thank you Detonator, and would you possibly have any information on why this might keep happening?

This might happened because of various reasons really, it may be the new update corrupting the communication with Minecraft, if that can happen, or just the possibility, since the leaderboards are somewhat "live" in a way, meaning they refresh every so often, that it may have something to do with that.

Yep, the leaderboards froze again, it happens from time to time, hopefully it will get fixed/unfrozen

I can say with certainty that that is not the issue. Probably just a communication error between the website and the server
