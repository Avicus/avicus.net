Hey guys!<br><br>I was wondering what all the talk is about this thing called&nbsp;<i>team-speak.</i><b><i></i></b><i></i> So, what is this team speak thing? Is it something like skype? Or is it some sort of messaging site? I was just wondering, because I heard a lot of people could talk to each other, during gameplay. Thought it sounded pretty cool!<br><br>Thanks guys<br><br>Peace

Google it? xd<br>But as for your question, it's like mumble or ventrilo if that helps. Basically it's a program that allows you to talk to other people on a certain server once you connect to it.<br>It's has voice chat and IM, it's pretty cool.&nbsp;<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.teamspeak.com/">http://www.teamspeak.com/</a>&nbsp;is the official site.

Teamspeak is an application used to talk with other people who are normally on a team with you. Most of the time, you talk rather than type in chat like IRC.<br><br>It's sort of like a large Skype call.

Is there a certain version I should get? On&nbsp;<i>products</i>, it says there are like 2 or 3 different "team speak's." Oh and does it take up a lot of data???

Ah, well it's a computer application primarily.<br>If you want it for mobile it'll cost money; I personally don't think that's worth it.

Teamspeak isn't similar to Skype, it's actually a program that as long as you introduce an IP, in this case, ts.avicus.net, it'll take you to a couple of rooms where you can talk with the people from this awesome community.
