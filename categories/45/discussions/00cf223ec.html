Make a new trailer for avicus, cause the old one is from avicore update! And new players may think: "Oh, avicus media is living under a rock" :D<br>Only five videos?

The YouTube channel. It doesn't seem to get enough support and the content is too different. I've noticed the original videos on the players channels get more views than the ones on the Avicus one. Also I think it only has like 30ish subs? Which isn't enough to make any sort of an impact IMO.<br><br>Edit: it would be nice if YouTubers on Avicus like yourself, Vlad, Tyn, Porkey and even Nova were able to get together to do some kind of advertisement for the AV channel.
