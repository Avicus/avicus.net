Conflict of Interests

</h1>
Hi there,<br><br>I was looking through the forums and came across <a href="https://avicus.net/forums/discussions/6daaff9e3" rel="nofollow">Zac's post.</a>&nbsp;Which actually brings up a topic I've been meaning to start a discussion about for a while now... <b><u>conflict of interest</u></b>. What is that? It basically means that if you have an interest (part of something ex. staff or team) you cannot take part in the discussions that directly give your interest a better advantage.&nbsp;That being said, this happens a lot on Avicus. Too often.&nbsp;<br><br>Majority of maps for this tournament - made by one team that is competing in the same tournament.<br><br>Officials impacting the outcome of maps they play in.&nbsp;<br><br>Staff that are in the same team as another player not being punished.&nbsp;<br><br>These are just a few examples I can think of off the top of my head but there are probably a lot more. I know that humans cannot fix the bias behaviours towards friends, teammates and fellow staff members, but they can take steps to cut back the amount it happens.&nbsp;<br><br><b><u>Simple steps I think could work:&nbsp;</u></b><br>Having official decisions in tournament's made by another official that isn't playing in that match. &nbsp;And not allowing the official that is playing in said match have any say on the outcome one-soever (same with refs).&nbsp;<br>Picking a wider variety of maps for tournaments, not maps all made by a specific group (actually ask for map submissions in advance...).&nbsp;<br><br><br>I would love to hear what you guys think.

I'm not saying you guys make the maps "perfect". It just gives you guys a slight advantage when all the maps are made by the same group when nothing was mentioned on the forums about looking for submissions. &nbsp;The builders and other players in your team are going to have a rough idea before hand which maps are being used and how to play them more effectively before the rest of the teams.

Yeah, that would eliminate it completely. But it could work that some would be allowed to play for their teams as long as someone else looks after decision making in the matches other officials play.

I will bring up what I told officials. Officials run the tournies and if there are no refs or officials who are not in a position to make unbiased decisions it is the fault of the officials. Go train or recruit better.

No submissions were accepted because we had a week to prepare maps, I found out when the tourney was at the time of everyone else so we had to prepare maps quickly

I agree. You never see management participate in their own event, not because they don't have the skill or mindset to, but because they are in a position of power.

The Officials and the referees shouldn´t participate in the tournaments, mostly the Officials because they mannage ALL the tournamet, the referees just spect the match and guard that nobody use cheats / broke any rule but the Officials are who decide if the user must be banned or not / the team must be DQ´d or not.&nbsp;<br><br>5 Officials are in a team: 3 (<b>Cyclops-Tazz and PieZ</b>) are in Team Allah 1 (<b>Fouled</b>) in ApoLLo &amp; 1 (<b>Nathy</b>) is in Cacalmarin. I am not saying that they are biased with their team but if you have the power to control a tournament you shouldn´t play because you will recive a lot of complaints of others players saying that you are being biased to your team.

That is true however i cant imagine a tournament with the current playerbase without apollo making maps or tazz not being an official etc, the playerbase is just too small for that<br><br>Also i partly agree on the mapmaking topic since it could be used for the favor of a team, however i think its just being an excuse to teams to say since we are active and practice all the maps shitton. also how is it our fault if the members of our team make good maps that the officials want to consider?

Exactly my point. I don't think you guys had an advantage. You make great maps, you are a great team, you put time into practicing them. Not many people make maps anymore.

About maps: there weren't public request for building TE maps. Staff has just announced T4. Of course, those, who are in staff and map devs team, got such request, i think.

I havent said, that you know about that before forum post. I said, that tournament organizators didn't ask community to release their maps for T4, but they could, even it is one week left (actually two because of postponement).<br>Personally, I don't mind the fact that only map devs build map for tournaments. Yes, it is not cool, when it is always the same person. But again, it is a consequence of some fundamental problems, which server got not today. And in the present situation it is is impossible to solve them. So ggwp.
