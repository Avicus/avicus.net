yo guys,<br>I wanted to know if some of you guys have ever used Unity and you're thoughts behind it.<br>Im a beginner at coding (c++) and liked that Unity supported C#. &nbsp;But one of my major concerns is that people online must have the Unity web plugin, I think that would kill the games popularity because I kinda wanted to make a 2d online game. &nbsp;Chrome doesn't even support the plugin rip.<br>I now am looking at Unreal Engine and a couple others. &nbsp;Please comment you're experiences and what you would do,&nbsp;<br>thanks,<br>birdy

Unreal and Unity are both pretty good, tho I aint done much with them in the terms of a browser-based game. Still, they got really good communities and support, in my experience, and they're pretty easy to use for the most part.&nbsp;<br>If you're just starting out tho, either one's a good place to start, tho Unity might be a bit easier, up to personal preference tho i would think.

I've decided to start a downloadable game, But if anybody has a clue on how to upload Unity or Unreal games to a browser and being able to play them without the unity plugin that would be great!
