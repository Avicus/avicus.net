Hello everyone! I think this is the only option I have, as I tried everything. I recently got perm banned for calling a person a "Pedo" it has been classed in the "Cyber-Bulling" category, I am deeply sorry to the person, but I didn't call him a "Pedo" for no reason. There has been some misunderstanding over skype which unfortunately is not avicus's property. I tried everything to come back. But as far as I know, Cyber-Bulling is a way of harassing a person in a repeated manner, I only called him a "Pedo" once in game. And the reason I called him a "Pedo" was because he kept on following in game trying to get me angry. And if the person was so hurt in the in side, why did he report me 2 days ago when the incident happened 5 weeks ago.<br><br>Anyways, I spoke with some people, and unfortunately they cannot help me. <br><br>So, this is my last goodbye to the wonderfull community, and hopefully someday I can come back!<br><br>MrExecutive_

Jozz as far as I know MrExecutive was being followed into different games and was trying to ignore him, but he was also saying hurtful things and for that reason he was frustrated and he said that... So What would You Do if that happened to you Jozz? You wouldn't like it, would You?

Even tho he said a lot more things, its still not cyber bullying, if I'm not wrong. One can call the same guy "pedo" once, twice, three times etc. and its still not bullying. Cyberbullying is when you harm or harass people in a repeated and hostile manner, like he said. Bullying itself happens over a LONG time. One day is nothing. Two days is nothing. One week is nothing. It happens over a very long time before it can be seen as cyber bullying. Bullying itself happens over a long time. If a guy calls the same guy "pedo" everyday for three months, THEN its bullying. Over one day, nah… Its okay if he is rude and stuff, but its&nbsp;<u>not</u> cyberbullying if it only happened today.<br>Theres a BIG difference between being rude and bullying. Call a guy "pedo" everyday in one week, and you're rude. Do the same thing over three months, and you're bullying. Bullying is so much worse than saying "pedo" once. I highly doubt he was cyber bullying.

That's what I said.. but '<i>apparently</i>&nbsp;' some Moderators (Not naming) think its when you say it once! :/ And If I get banned for saying anything against moderators... well I don't mind because He's a good friend of mine and I know what actually happened there.

No moderators think this? Jozz already stated that he said more than just "pedo." If he's repeatedly saying offensive things to one player it really isn't okay.

Mooch I have some posts on skype which he said to him, which is apparently not 'avicus related', however when someone says something to a Moderator they have the Right to go and say Oh, this is avicus related... <b><i>YOUR BANNED!&nbsp;</i></b><i></i>And Mooch, I have some messages where moderators think this.

Jozz, you didn't care about what I said on skype. And the evidence you have only shows that I called him a "PEDO" once. You also said that the person was crying and really hurt... The funny thing is, this happened 5 weeks ago. If he was really hurt at that time, why didn't he report me then?

I don't care.. I rather would be banned than him, as this has happened for no reason. Mooch, you don't know whats been happening to him, what messages he's been sent by him. He took the photo 5 weeks ago and now reported him, he then says his friend posted it, but he lied and we were given proof which said he had given it. They got angry at each other a few days ago and he posted it faulty.

<span>Jozz, how did I lie to your face? I can show the world what you told me over skype. You are favoring the person. Everyone on this post knows that it isn't Cyber-Bulling. You could of at least gave me a temp ban. And about your example about that situation. Well my answer is "I didn't run away, so how could have you track me down?" You always had the evidence?<br></span>

That is not the point. Swearing is a temp ban (1 day or so). He did not bully.

Don't you see it? He was banned for cyber bullying when the only thing he did was being rude.. Like, its not ok to be rude, but it doesn't deserve a perm ban for "cyber bullying"…

I don't understand what you people think you are going to accomplish by throwing a tantrum on the forums and then refusing to take any ideas that contradict yours. He was banned for cyberbullying and he can make an appeal if he wishes. You can rant all day, but it's only going to make you look silly.<br>Best of luck to you.

Im not refusing ideas that "contradict mine". I'm just saying, theres a HUGE difference between being rude and cyber bullying. If he is banned for bullying, he must have been bullying. A screenshot of a guy saying "pedo" is nothing. Its basically like banning a player for hacking when he doesn't hack. .-.

More evidence? Enough to call it cyber bullying? Don't think so. He can have a 100 screenshots of him saying "pedo" or "retard" or "ugly ass fatty" whatever, its still not cyber bullying, which is WHAT HE IS BANNED FOR. ffs, i don't care about the evidence.

I didn't say i have all the evidence, did I? And why would you bring up ban evading and stuff, thats not what I'm talking about. .-.

I would happily like to see the evidence to see if it even can be called anything bully related.
