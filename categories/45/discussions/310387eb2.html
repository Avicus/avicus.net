Hello, fellow Avicus forum user!<br>This post will be quite deep, so if you're not into that, run away x3<br>Anyways, before I go to bed, I start to think very deeply about something and this time I thought about death.<br>I found it really interesting, so I'd like to share it with you (:<br>This defies lots of religious matters and I know how well that goes on the Internet, so if this seems like it's turning into a flame-war, I'll try to resolve the issue or delete it ASAP.<br>Anyways, let's begin..<br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>The world is something we of through our consciousness.&nbsp;<br>When we die, we have no consciousness.&nbsp;<br>When we die, we will forget all the memories-- all the events-- the world has given us to make yourself you.<br>When we die, all those memories and events will become nothing, for they are part of our consciousness.&nbsp;<br>Since all of us will die and loose our consciousness, we will have no idea the world existed or ever did.. which means that it never existed.<br>When we think about something, we are aware of it. If you are not aware of something, it does not exist.<br>Think about it this way: if you can not see, taste, smell, feel, or hear (I hope you can't hear this.. xD), or think about a cookie lying infront of you, you are not aware of it.&nbsp;<br>Since you are not aware of it, you will not think about it and from what you understand, that cookie never existed and never will until you gain the senses to understand it.&nbsp;<br>Now think of the Universe as a cookie. You've lost all memories of interacting with it and you never will be able to interact with it.<br>That means you can not think about the Universe or understand anything that ever has or ever will happen. <br>The Universe doesn't even exist.<br>You make actions based on what you feel and understand.&nbsp;<br>Even though your human brain wants you to think life matters in order for motivation and for your species to thrive, it does not.&nbsp;<br>People make beliefs in order to have motivation to get through your day and to comfort the fear of death. A lot of them want to think that they will never die, so they feel confident about the future, not terrified, even though they know that they will be consumed by the nothingness.<br>Once you die, everything will be and was always nothing.<br>Time is relative. From what we understand, it may seem different, but I assure you, once you're dying, you'll notice life went by like a flash. &nbsp;<br>Right now, every second, the Universe is nothing.<br>No matter how much you disagree, nothing matters.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Most likely the deepest thing on any Minecraft forum ever.. xD<br>I hope you enjoyed reading all of this!&nbsp;<br>I don't know about other people, but I love to over-think things and stretch my mind with things humans aren't meant to understand :3<br>Anyways, thank you for reading if you've gotten this far x3<br>Have a good day! c:<br><br>-Love, Goldie

So the Universe is nothing but a figment of our imagination? How are we capable of conciving such ideas if the universe is nothing? And how are you sure that when we die, we are no longer aware?

1. Yeah, pretty much :P<br>2. How are we cable of thinking of cookies? We use our senses and thinking processes to be aware of the cookie. We do the same to think about the Universe. Also, the Universe is nothing, but everything at the same time.. I guess you could think about it this way<br><br>First memory<br>|<br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt; ________________________________________________________________<br>&lt;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;|<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Death<br><br>So bootiful :o<br>Think of the solid line as a time-line. <br>Your first memory is part of your consciousness and you understand it you will remember that memory until you die. It affects what you do and think even if it's in minuscule ways. That memory is there and will be there along with your consciousness until the end of your life.&nbsp;<br>Death will then destroy your consciousness, so for you, nothing ever happened. You don't remember anything and you never will. That means that once you get to a certain point in time, your past will be erased.&nbsp;<br>Honestly, I have a hard time explaining it.. Hope you understand a little..<br>3. I don't, these are just my thoughts. Not very polished or anything, I just thought of how interesting it was and I wanted to post it here :3

Yup, that's why they're created. Humans like to know things and are generally very bad at understanding how the Universe works, so they make beliefs called "religions" that help them think they understand. A lot of times they make happy endings that revolve away from death and the unknown, too. It's pretty much facts/what will happen vs. beliefs/what you want to happen. I guess what my post is about is a belief, but at least it's supported by science x3
