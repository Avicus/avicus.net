Hey, I recently made a sword pack and I thought I'd share it with you guys &lt;3<br><br>NOTE this is NOT &nbsp;a resource pack, this is a sword pack which means you put the swords into whatever resource pack you want. :)<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhmQgHvuIDA&amp;feature=gp-n-y&amp;google_comment_id=z12ustazon24izxlu23zvpfazxjvdtrfe">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhmQgHvuIDA&amp;feature=gp-n-y&amp;google_comment_id=z12ustazon24izxlu23zvpf...</a><br>Download Link in description of video<br>If I get 20 likes ill be releasing the tools, bow, lighter &amp; rod! :D Enjoy &lt;3

Holy crap, those are some sick swords. I love the little material in the base of the blade that tells you what the sword was made of. You made these yourself, right? You deserve a lot more views!<br><br>I'd love to see more textures from you. Liked and subscribed C:

Personally, it doesn't faze me. I'm not really much a PvP kinda person I'm more of a creator. But everyone has their own styles and opinions of what they like. This is definetly not my last sword pack so maybe in my next one ill make one a little like that?

Yeah, but what I'm saying is that I honestly love all types of swords. Your style is like pointy swords, and my style is creating all different styles. I'm obviously going to make swords a lot different to this, so maybe check them out when I make more. I don't really have a style of sword I like, as long as they aren't really short haha

I don't really know what you mean by revolution, I'm going to assume you mean resolution and the answer to that is they are 512x512 to ensure they have a really clean, smooth look.<br><br>Don't worry if your not using a resource pack that big, it will still work fine :)
