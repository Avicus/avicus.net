Hey Avicus, Im here on a serious note to explain my behavior lately.<br><br>As most of you have noticed, Ive become more and more inactive for the past couple of months, and here are the reasons why.<br><br>1- Ive been playing lots of Call of Duty black ops 2 lately, even though I suck its very fun. Ive become addicted to that game and as a result Im playing a lot less Minecraft in general.<br><br>2- My computer is starting to bluescreen and that stuff, so my PC is almost unplayable now (20 fps) and I really hate bad FPS. Im going to get a new PC anyways when summer starts, so expect to see lots of me eating people and making the void eat them! lol<br><br>3- Exam time is starting, so I need to study hard. I hate school too mates but good grades have always been a priority for me =l.<br><br>4- Ive been losing interest in Minecraft in general, but Ik its because of me not playing much cuz I still watch the vids xD.<br><br>Lastly, Im going to underline the&nbsp;<u>horrible</u> sportsmanship Ive had over the past 6 MONTHS. I have excuses for every death, and when Its fair I rage A LOT. Ive came to a conclusion that Im overall not a good person and that I want to be a better sport. So please, when you see me rage or whatnot, refer to this topic, and hopefully ill stop harassing you guys :3.<br><br>Thanks for reading, heres a puppy :3 with a cookie.<a href="https://www.google.ca/search?q=puppy+with+cookie&amp;rlz=1C1NWPB_en&amp;es_sm=122&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IWBJVZjRO8O3yATntoGwDQ&amp;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=643#imgrc=MtYAAQ9nGgImsM%253A%3BMROiTmW22wMs6M%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fterriblycute.com%252Ffiles%252F2012%252F02%252Fpuppy-cookie.jpg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fterriblycute.com%252Fmine%252Fpuppy-cookie%252F%3B1920%3B1080" title="Link: https://www.google.ca/search?q=puppy+with+cookie&amp;rlz=1C1NWPB_en&amp;es_sm=122&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IWBJVZjRO8O3yATntoGwDQ&amp;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=643#imgrc=MtYAAQ9nGgImsM%253A%3BMROiTmW22wMs6M%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fterriblycute.com%252Ffiles%252F2012%252F02%252Fpuppy-cookie.jpg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fterriblycute.com%252Fmine%252Fpuppy-cookie%252F%3B1920%3B1080">https://www.google.ca/search?q=puppy+with+cookie&amp;rlz=1C1NWPB_en&amp;es_sm=122&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;...</a>
