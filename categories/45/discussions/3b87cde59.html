(i was like 6 k? idk wut was happening) so anyways my ring finger became double jointed, then a few years later all my fingers (besides my right thumb) became double jointed oh, both my knees too :P so i tried to make my right thumb double jointed and i ended up kinda just dislocating it... but now it's double jointed too yey ^-^

I play hockey and I haven't broken a bone or been hurt badly... But the most recent would be yesterday when I was playing soccer for P.E and I stood on the ball and fell backwards, hard. Opened my eyes with people looking down at me saying "..... are you all right?" Yep I blacked out for apparntly 5 - 10 seconds, had a really bad headache for a while after.
