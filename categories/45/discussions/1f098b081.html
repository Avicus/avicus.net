1. I don't have team speak nor do I intend on getting it, I don't want to add a bunch of randy mods on Skype... Kind of bull shit.<br><br>2. Your saying we will be perm banned why wasn't Rilo? (I, not saying he should be banned just asking why)<br><br>3. Why can't you just watch people in spec...?

I agree that this thing is silly... Basically what it's saying is 'Oh we can't tell if this person is hacking so we need to see their screen!'. It's a problem with detecting hacks from what I see, so maybe that's what some of the staff should work on. I don't know if you hacked or not, I'm just saying this in general.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Screen-sharing is immensely useful for people who actually know how to HIDE their hacks. Especially useful for tournaments and competitive scenarios. You have to be 100% sure if someone is hacking before you ban a competitive player. Sometimes a simple spec will not detect the full range of hacks/they might hide it very well.&nbsp;<br><br>As far as Im concerned, Rilo was Temp banned because we had not established a proper system. Now that we have learnt from that mistake, it won't be repeated.&nbsp;<br><br>Finally, If you don't have Teamspeak you can work out the situation over skype. I am not sure if Skype can be used as a supplement for Teamspeak.<br><br>There ya go! :)

I don't agree with screensharing but there's no excuse not to get teamspeak. It's free and compatible with pretty much anything, you don't even need to talk. And if your parents won't let you use it, just use it once and uninstall it.

People may have private things they don't want you to see, I don't believe they should have to show you their files to prove they don't hack. I like the idea of screen sharing but I believe it's invading the privacy of the person who is being screen shared just a bit.

1) It's free and easy to get. You don't even have to talk. I don't think any of the staff can be considered "randys" when they've all been here for at least a year, have over 100 pages of forum posts, and are active on all platforms.&nbsp;<br><br>2) I didn't take part in that jazz, so I don't know.<br><br>3) Ghost clients aren't exactly easy to detect in spectator view.

I have no idea how screen share works, but if your telling someone else to download something, there's a problem.<br>I don't know about you, but if i'm playing and a staff tells me to download something or im banned, i aint downloading, your not supposed to just trust people online and download what they tell you. &nbsp;Thats not right.<br><br>I don't know how ghost clients work, but there has to be another way to detect them.<br><br>EDIT: I dont have anything against teamspeak, but im saying this from the viewpoint of someone who doesnt have it. &nbsp;I like teamspeak and get on it whenever im online.

With how ghost clients are now, you have to screenshare to detect them. Even the best anticheats (AntiSkid and GCheat) don't detect every single client because that's impossible.

Timing out whilst being screenshared is very unlikely, yet depends on the player. If you know the player that is being screenshared has never timed out in their lives, but has now made an exception after being called out, you'll know he is hidding something and I know it may not be so accurate but it could still help.

People may have private things they don't want you to see, I don't believe they should have to show you their files to prove they don't hack. I like the idea of screen sharing but I believe it's invading the privacy of the person who is being screen shared just a bit.

I agree that this thing is silly... Basically what it's saying is 'Oh we can't tell if this person is hacking so we need to see their screen!'. It's a problem with detecting hacks from what I see, so maybe that's what some of the staff should work on. I don't know if you hacked or not, I'm just saying this in general.

Not really, just provides more proof. How's making bans more certain and efficient bad? Especially with ghost clients some people can lie their ways out of bans, which is rather annoying to see. Would you rather have a server with better gameplay and more legit players, or a server with tons of hackers?

Firstly,&nbsp;<br><br>If you don't have teamspeak then as a last resort you can use skype. Teamspeak is just easier to use.&nbsp;<br><br>Secondly, Only a small percentage of players are actually going to be screenshared and even though myself and tazz have taught all the moderators how to perform a screenshare, tazz or myself would most likely be conducting it, as we are more experienced.&nbsp;<br><br>Thirdly, if events happen where you have to leave the screenshare midway that is fine, but you need to provide evidence.

There are special cases, sure. But in tournaments I imagine people know a lot of the players, and if they do have a Skype/TS. In those cases, I think it's fair to ask. Better than banning them before you're sure they were or weren't cheating. It's pretty shady if they decline even then.<br><br>But for people who you don't know I suppose it would be a bit difficult. Still, then it's only if they believe you are hacking. Unless you're pretty darn good, it's unlikely you would even be questioned.<br><br>I think it's just something they should use when necessary, in the cases where it makes sense. No reason not to. But not something they should&nbsp;<i>always</i> use. Nothing has to be used NEVER or ALWAYS. There are varying situations, you have to remember.

Exactly. May as well use it when you know you can. If some person you know has TS/Skype seems a bit suspicious, what are you supposed to say? "Oh, well some people here might not have TS/Skype.

I don't think they let anyone go... if someone is hacking, they'll gain the proper evidence and ban with or without a screenshare. The whole point of a screenshare is to gain evidence, and it helps save from controversies, etc. It also helps to make the staff absolutely sure of a punishment. I don't think I agree with banning for not screensharing, but it makes quite a bit of sense.

I was just making a bit of a point, I only meant that you shouldn't not even use screensharing, which seems to be more telling than other evidence may be, on the people you know you can use it on just because some other people might not have Skype/TS. What you said was aside from that point, I just kinda threw it in. I agree with what you said here haha.<br><br>Though in my opinion, whether or not they ban for it would really vary. Not every case is the same, some person's behavior may be extremely suspicious, some person may have a perfectly valid excuse.<br><br>I think they should ban when they feel it's necessary. They definitely shouldn't just say "If you ever decline a screenshare you're automatically banned. No matter what.", but that banning is a possibility.

I think that you guys have to understand the chances of you being screenshared is almost 0. It's only for more well known users who know how to hide and toggle their client well.

I mean the mistake that you guys chose to issue a tempban instead of a ban. Now we all know, we should ban k?

As Iron said, I think we have only screenshared less than 5 people in the 3 months that screensharing has been available to us. I'm sure that 95% of people that read this will never get screenshared on Avicus.

I agree that this thing is silly... Basically what it's saying is 'Oh we can't tell if this person is hacking so we need to see their screen!'. It's a problem with detecting hacks from what I see, so maybe that's what some of the staff should work on. I don't know if you hacked or not, I'm just saying this in general.

I think that regs should still be screenshared even if the evidence of them backing is 'really solid'. &nbsp;(I know some people reading this still think I hack so don't waste your time reading this) when I was banned for AntiKB I asked if they would screenshare me as soon&nbsp;as I got banned, since I knew the screen share would prove them wrong. My request was denied as my 'hacks' were described by a mod as 'More obvious than [not gonna mention who this mod thinks toggles, so just insert any players' name here] toggling'. It turns out that I wasn't hacking (who would've guessed). If the senior moderator who appealed me was blind, I wouldve stayed falsely banned. If what happened to me, happens to anyone else, I think they should still be screenshared <b>NO MATTER HOW SOLID YOU THINK YOUR EVDIENCE IS...</b>

They screen share to see if your hacking..... How did u not understand that -.-
</blockquote>

Well, to avoid being screen shared, just don't hack in the first place, which means they will not suspect you of hacking, so they will not screen share. I understood it all :)
