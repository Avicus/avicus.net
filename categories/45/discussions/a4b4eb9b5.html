So, I have been banned for fly hacking, I made a Ban Appeal, but They rejected it, Is there any way I could Pay to get unbanned? I really liked the community, and the server its self, so I wan't to be able to play again, but the only way I see is by paying money, And I will do that if that is what it takes, I just want to know how much?

You can't pay to be unbanned, unfortunately. You can get evidence to prove you were hacking or wait around 5 months to be appealed. :)

Why should people with more money have more chances to play on the server than people with a minor purchasing power?

The topic isn't about whether payable unbans should be a thing, it was a simple question/answer thread.<br>Considering the question has been answered there's no need for the thread to continue.<br><br>Gurk, don't encourage ban evading..
