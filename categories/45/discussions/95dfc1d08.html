I, as an Asian, have kept my grades since freshmen year to A's only, and am pressured by my parents to go to a good school (not necessarily Ivy, as Caltech, Stanford, MIT aren't Ivy but still insanely good).&nbsp;<br><br>If you're not in high school (or even middle school) yet, then I guess just say what you wanna be when you grow up.&nbsp;<br><br>Me: Stanford University in California<br>Career: Aeronautical Engineer

You asked me what I want to be when I get older, my answer is happy. I want to be happy when I grow up, but as jobs go, I want to be a medical scientist when I grow up, like come up with cures for diseases etc etc.

It's all a matter of how much college costs at that point. &nbsp;If it's the same as it is now, I'd go to whatever school I want, likely something such as&nbsp;Carnegie, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or Stanford.&nbsp;<br><br>If it's gotten higher or worse, I'd just go to Oklahoma State University in my home town.

Yup, I went to Stanford's and they said the same thing: "Need-based aid". But the lady said that if your parents have a salary of more than about 100K, then there's less of a chance (unless you have multiple children in college and need aid to pay for all of them).
