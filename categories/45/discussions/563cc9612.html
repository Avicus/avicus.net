</h1>
This was supposed to happen a long time ago, I had a little but of hope that some people would understand and get it right, I guess I was wrong, Thank you for all of Necromancy, Cronus, Mars for all the good times special thanks to armoredpotato, Koja, Mucky,ElementalAssasin, &nbsp;Googs(left long time ago) , Junr, CQUE and alot of other people that know who they re but I forgot to name, I hope you guys have an awesome time, I also hope that the rest of the community won't get exposed to what I did, it would be terrible for the server... &nbsp;I wish you all a good time, I eventually lost hope, maybe some people just can't accept that they aren't the best, maybe they spend their time wasting other people's time, I'm not going to name anyone.... &nbsp;But the abuse and patheticness is just giving me a headache, I had a good time with the 2 months that some butthurt peopleater took away from me, I guess I can't have everything right?&nbsp;<br><br>For those of you who know the situationbprovided all I could and did my best to convince them, but it doesn't seem like it's enough&nbsp;<br><br>I'll be on ts occasionally, I'll sub for some teams.&nbsp;<br>Goodbye everyone

While you do have a lot of infractions, I recommend appealing this ban, and put some compassion and a good damn description why you should be unbanned. If you want to play again, show remorse and hope you'll get a second chance, but you're gonna have to try hard to prove you will not hack again, and you want to start again. These are my tips to you. Good luck!

I've offered ss, offered log file check, sent 2 gameplay videos showing my controls and snooper settings, sent Handcam of me getting 13 cps, have stated tons of reasons why their points aren't valid (the staff I've asked say it all looks legit except for one fight, which I have to agree with because it rlly did look like I was headsnappimg, it was a moshpit fight and I was taking kb from behind so I turned around and hit with frrst swing, I'm Sorry for having good aim? but again thus is why I offered all the things above, I appealed yesterday again asking them what else I can do, still waiting for response)
