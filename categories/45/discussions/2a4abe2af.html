You have 17 previous infractions. I think you should be happy its a tempban and not a perm ban.

It should be the other way around.&nbsp;<br>Us Avicus Mods, are almost done with you. You have 2 pages of infractions and you say you're done with us?&nbsp;<br>You should be thankful enough that you got temp-banned instead of banned permanently.&nbsp;<br>Make sure that you know what you're doing before you post it on the forums with this attitude.

You were temp banned again because right after your ban ended you came back on and broke the rules, we aren't just going to give you another page of free infractions until you are given another temp ban.
