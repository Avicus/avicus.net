<p>"Don't be sad because&nbsp;you're saying Goodbye, You should be happy, Because you'll have memories with them that you'll cherish forever." Hey everybody. Today I made a hard&nbsp;but easy decision. &gt;&gt;&nbsp;I might not be on Avicus or Minecraft for a long time soon. The game is just getting really boring and so is the server. I had a lot of good things go on the game and such but I think its time for me to move on to other things. I have school and big tests and projects coming up. I also haven't getting a proper sleep time. Instead of 8 hours I would now usually get 6-7 which isn't good. Plus everyone I know stopped playing it. I'm better at other games as well like CoD, Just Cause, and others. On the weekends when I have nothing to do I just play Minecraft all day and have no fun. I hope you guys understand. I'm not sure when I'm going to leave but, its soon, probably in 2-3 days. I want to thank everyone on Avicus for letting me play and have fun for the past 3 years. Some people I want to thank personally are;&nbsp;Danii,&nbsp;armoredpotato,&nbsp;Nebbsy, Nemo, GBeanzy, IzikW, maxweberh, Tigger_the_bear,&nbsp;Nanoo, DeliciousShoesHD, SirCyaniide, SoccerMaster, FutbolHunter, Clijmart and&nbsp;Kojapan17. You all have been loyal friends to me&nbsp;through the ride. There are many more but&nbsp;I couldn't list everyone. I will miss everyone on the server. Minecraft was good but it's for the best if I move on.</p><p>Cya</p><p>-Parker</p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Honestly, without you in Avicus it won't be the same. It's funny how most of the time i'll be picking on you xP and you would just tease me back. I'll sure miss you and good luck with life. Also again thanks for making me cry. If you need any help you can just message me on Skype anytime. Cya Parker :)
