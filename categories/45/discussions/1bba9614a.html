Hey, im looking at hdd's and for $50, i could either get a 1 tb 7200 RPM hard drive or a 2 tb 5400 rpm hard drive, from what it looks like it seems that it doesnt matter that much, just the harddrive will be more active the slower the rpm. &nbsp;But I am getting a whole nother tb!<br><br>So do any of you have or have seen differences or own a 5400 rpm hdd?<br><br>edit: i found a 2tb 7200rpm hdd for $6 more!&nbsp;<br><b>Does anyone use a Hitachi hdd and can you tell me its reliability?</b>

please don't get a 5400 rpm... when building a gaming pc you really need an SSD... it is essential, you can survive without a HDD but honestly if you can get at least a 250 gb SSD then get it, or you can get a 120 gb ssd and then a 1tb 7200 rpm HDD

240$ for a gaming rig with an SSD seems too cheap, tho the processor is quite old (and so would the motherboard), so make sure you're not getting scammed.<br><br><br>What's your current PC specs?<br><br>I would recommend trying to get a 240gb SSD and then a cheap HDD, diff between RPM isn't very great (as you would only be using it for files.) If youre getting a SSD check if your motherboard has a SATA 3.0 6GB/s port, mine only has a 3GB/s port and so the SSD is slowed than it could be, however it is still a big performance boost.<br><br>You can move your documents/ pics etc to the HDD, and install Windows + games on the SSD.
