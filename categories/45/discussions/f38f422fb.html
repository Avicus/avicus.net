Hola!<br><br>So for a lot of you, Summer vacation has just come to a close and school has started up again. On that note, many retired Avicus veterans, or even just some players in general have decided to take some time off of the game and focus more on their grades in school. I've seen plenty of those kinds of posts in the past, and they are still being made as of now. But I've come to notice something. We haven't really gotten much of an update, as to how their decision to take time off of Avicus; or computer games in general, has affected their life. <br><br>So I'm making this post to hear from all of you, whether you took time off or not, to see how everyone's doing in school. Just remember that your education in school <i>will</i>&nbsp;guide you through the rest of your life, so make the most of it now.&nbsp;<br><br>Straying from that, school started for me last week. And in all honesty, it hasn't been as bad as I thought. Classes are tough, but they're a lot more engaging than the required classes I had to take last year. So I think that kind of makes up for it.<br><br>What about you?<br><br>-Jake

First year of high school? Gotta fear it :P<br><br>Surprisingly, high school is 4647472x better than Primary, plus I have a life now! Kinda.
