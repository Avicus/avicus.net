It's been a while since I've gotten on, and in my opinion I'm nowhere close to being the staff member I was and or should be. A lot has changed in the system and I'm not fitting in.&nbsp;<br><br><br>I'm open for suggestions, and comments regarding my trial, and my performance. This is so I can get a glimpse of what the community is looking for as a junior moderato/staff member. I wanna see what you guys think :]<br><br><br>I hope this'll help

I haven't seen you in action ever since you came back, but I don't think much has changed. Just try to be what you used to be?

Be the awesome person you always were. And don't ignore reports, because that isn't good. Be active in particularly the staff chat, and otherwise, just make sure everyone's getting along OK and be on the lookout for hackers. Most of the changes going on (that I'm seeing) are revolving around the Sr. Staff, aside from one or two offense/infraction updates (correct me if I'm wrong).

It's just a game :P You're a Mod to keep the server safe and keep gameplay stable and fun, NOT to ruin the fun and farm infractions, you're doing this for the server, not to only get promoted. Just keep that in mind, and you'll be fine&nbsp;<br><br><br>@Aura We have rant sessions?!
