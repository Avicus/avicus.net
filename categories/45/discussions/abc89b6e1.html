1.) Actually, no I didn't. When my brother first showed me it I thought it was just some stupid game, but when I actually tried the demo of it, I loved it.&nbsp;<br>2.) None, anymore. I sorta grew out of video games. I used to play a lot of NBA 2K14 though.<br>3.) I found MCZone when I was looking for a good HG server on the minecraft server list. I had tried out some other servers, but for some reason, I stuck with MCZone. (This was back when they had that lobby where you were the only player in it, and when there was only Nebula, Walls, and HG)
