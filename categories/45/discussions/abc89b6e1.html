1.) Actually, no I didn't. When my brother first showed me it I thought it was just some stupid game, but when I actually tried the demo of it, I loved it.&nbsp;<br>2.) None, anymore. I sorta grew out of video games. I used to play a lot of NBA 2K14 though.<br>3.) I found MCZone when I was looking for a good HG server on the minecraft server list. I had tried out some other servers, but for some reason, I stuck with MCZone. (This was back when they had that lobby where you were the only player in it, and when there was only Nebula, Walls, and HG)

Oh wait, I'm dumb x3<br><br>When you first saw Minecraft, did you like it?<br><b><i></i>No actually, I thought it was a very pointless game and (lol) a ripoff of Roblox.<br><b>Then I decided to play it and the addiction settled in. Oh well :P</b><br></b><br>What other games do you play?<br><b>Pokemon, Mario<b> (including spin-offs,) Legend of Zelda, Super Smash Bros (64, Brawl, Project M,) Team Fortress 2, Dark Souls (and 2,) etc.</b></b><br><br>How did you find out about Avicus?<br><b>My friend showed it to me while it was still Mc<b>Zone, and the first thing I played was Skywars. It will be forever missed &lt;3</b></b>
