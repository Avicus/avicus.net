Please move to another category if it suits.<br><br>Now, as we all know, there have been the staff applications recently, and many people became Jr Mods, and have gone on to be full time Moderators, and I am very happy for all of them, and sad for the ones that didn't make it. What I am going to do is make a list of all the staff below (this is off the top of my head so sorry if I miss you out, especially with the Mods):<br><br><u>Jr Moderators:<br></u><br>Sethskye<br>pelpelajax<br><br><u>Moderators:</u><br>sunrise728<br>Slicorn<br>battleship811<br>cole1crc<br>SweetMango<br>avumbaca<br>itzdylan115<br>cinammoncroc000<br>StormzInvader<br>CrafterPete1013<br>Princezz_Dubstep<br>TheSolux<br>Ducksfanwaterloo<br>RCMP_Mountie<br>Evocal<br>RefuseToSink<br>D00ZiE<br>Cupcake1241<br>Sulorak<br>TheRomanTrident<br>ParaSpider<br>Lieutenantpants<br>Upsoar<br>Arachadonic<br>MidnightBeats<br><br><br><br><br><u>Sr Moderators:<br></u>PeachyYas<br>Jake41901<br>NolanDalton<br>zeus449<br>Shirokamii<br>glitchy1<u><br></u><u>Managers:<br></u><br>izjust4fun<br>tel6331<br>DoctaPop<br><u>Directors:<br></u>IvyCode (Owner)<br>AviGill<br>Fluenza_<br><u><br>Owner:<br><br></u>IvyCode and funkystudios (1 guy)&nbsp;<br><u><br></u>Now, I'm not being biased or anything like that, as I said I am happy for all the moderators, but this adds up to around 30 people that are staff, no matter what rank. In my opinion, I actually think this is too much. Because the Avicus community consists of around 200-250 people now, and having 30 staff, I feel, is too many. I totally respect everyone that applied for Jr Mod so I understand that this is why we have so many, but I feel this is too much. Especially with the Moderators, as there are over 20 of them. I am not pointing out any particular people as I have my utmost respect for what they do, but I do feel as if it is too many.<br><u><br></u>Thanks for reading, and please state your opinion below on this.<br><u><br>iBiZa_MiNeCrAfT :)<br><br></u>

The 30 or 40 staff members are Never all on at the same time so it really isn't bad at all. Hardly anyone fights for reports and everything goes smoothly. Having this amount is perfect imo as we have many timezones covered which means there is likely to always be at least one staff member on (not for definite but usually).

Well... I think that the more the better. Either way, not every staff member is online at every given moment. They live in different time zones, and I think that maybe only a few of them would be moderating at a certain time. So I feel that it is fine :D Also with more staff members, more ideas will reach their way to senior staff and will hopefully help in the development of the server, and as a chain effect, more people may start to play on Avicus. Well that's my opinion, please don't take any offence... I didn't intend it to be that way :D Cya 'round!

The funny things is that they promised at the beginning of avicus we are going to have 50 moderator which are IMO too many. I think the amount of mods,Sr. mods ... is the sweet spot.

Everybody was saying that there wasn't many moderators before<br>Now there is too much?<br>In my Opinion, it is not too much, in fact we need&nbsp;more mods varied across time zones, that is why we have 40 moderators. These 40 mods are spread across the time zones which means we actually need more moderators, 80 should be good.<br>Also, I have been hearing rumours that the SG is going to be introduced which means there would be a wave of people coming onto the server to check it out, the staff needs to be prepared for this, actually if any new minigames come out, there will be a wave of people.

I think he just means more staff means the more likelihood that your idea would catch the staffs attention and get a discussion between seniors about it :p

To be honest, Avicus needs more moderators if what Ingigo said is true. I'd say 80 should be good. Especially since at times I still see the server with 0 staff. A lot less since the promotions but still...

40 is mostly fine, most of the time there are about 1-5 moderators on. However, there are some times when there are zero D: But then their are times when there are 10 or so^-^

If those 10 decent mods end up screwing up all their infractions the staff team would have to clean up the mess. Therefore, creating more work to do.
