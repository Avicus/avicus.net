For the streamig websites I'd recommend Kissanime and Crunchyroll. For the anime I'd recommend that you would watch some "easy to watch" anime to understand it (Note: This is not a must, it might just help you out in the beginning, it helped me out at least).&nbsp;For that I'd recommend Sword Art Online, Fairy Tail, Black Butler or Fullmetal alchemist. After you've gotten into anime you should start watching more complicated ones like Mekakucity actors or No Game No Life.

I vouch for Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, why? It has a great storyline and each episode actually builds on the story whereas in other animes, most of it is filler episodes. This anime brings up pretty much every part of human emotion possible. The pace throughout the anime is good, the story is not rushed, nor long, 64 episodes is a nice number of episodes. All of the characters are developed throughout the series which is great as well. One of the best animes ever, I would rate it a 10 out of 10!

No but I mean that he died remember? The whole scene was his particles dramatically flying out as if he had just died. Then the next thing you know, he's reformed again, and then just kills Kayaba.<br><br>I have a theory that Klein used the Revival thing on him. Kirito's words to him were "If anyone dies in front of your eyes one day, use it" I'm pretty sure Klein heeded his advice and used it when he saw Kirito get killed by Kayaba

cinammon, there are different websites for different anime. If you want a really huge list of anime to see what you might like, go to Animefreak.com also if you are gonna watch bleach, naruto, fairytail or one piece you can find an official (maybe) website for bleach its: Bleachget.com for naruto, its Narutoget.com, for One Piece its Watchop.com, i dont know the website for fairytail, but there is a link to all of them on each of the websites. :D have fun choosing, and if you want halp, we can talk on avicus :D

lol I watched so much anime yesterday :P<br><br><b><i><u>Sword Art Online Season ll Episode 5<br></u></i></b>I loved&nbsp;<i>how&nbsp;</i>Sinon learned that Kirito was actually a guy. They arent friends anymore, but I think they will be in later episodes because their friendship only lasted a day. And as shown in the intro, Sinon is a pretty big character in the whole plot. She might appear later.<br><br><i><u><b>Angel Beats!<br></b></u></i>Basically, I watched the whole series yesterday. It makes sense since there are only 13 episodes. That's what I thought the problem was. The whole story was mushed into just 13 episodes. The anime really never explained how everyone died; only Yuri, Iwasawa, Otanashi, and we can assume how Yui died. What I would love is if they made some sort of movie that explained how each member of the Battlefront died.<br><br>Alright, so I'm not the type of person that cries a lot. In fact, I haven't cried in years. But when I saw the end of Angel Beats!, I just had to. The whole thing had just touched me, thinking that all of them were just people who weren't able to accomplish something in their real life and died with regrets. The part that made me cry was the graduation part. I did have a sad feeling when Iwasawa and Yui both passed on. And I felt soooo bad when Kanade left Otanashi. Thats the part that totally ripped me apart. Otanashi's heart was donated to Kanade! It made me feel so sad that when Kanade left because her whole purpose in that world was to thank Otanashi. When she did leave, Otanashi screamed out because she left.<br><br>I heard Clannad was sadder, so I know it will be good. Now I have something to look forward to.<br><br><b><u><i>Death Note Episode 1<br></i></u></b>I had a first bad impression on this anime, mostly on the intro. I just thought it was freaking creepy. I did like the idea of the story though.

I stopped watching it because the story isn't interesting enough, it doesn't really have twists to keep you interested.&nbsp;<br>I used to watch it so much though.&nbsp;<br><br>I LOVE One Piece. The characters are amazing and very lovable. The storyline has twists and interesting parts. Epic fights. Blends a mix of Comedy and Seriousness beautifully. Not a single complaint about the series other than certain arcs in the story lasting too long.&nbsp;<br><br>Bleach is the same except more Badass and dark. I was really sad it was temp cancelled for the manga to get ahead and it's been canceled for like a year now. Still&nbsp;waiting. Plz make manga faster.

Shippuden or Original?<br><br>I find Shippuden to have a better plot/storyline, and is more dramatic. Original is better for comic relief. I think I've watched Shippuden over 3 times, original twice, and the whole thing from beginning to end 3 times..

Wanna bring this back up because i am gonna give my ratings over the completed anime series i watched over 2014 :3<br><br><i><b>=!=!=!=SPOILERS AHEAD=!=!=!= </b></i><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><br><i><b>=!=!=!=SPOILERS AHEAD=!=!=!=&nbsp;<br></b></i><br><br><i>You have been warned</i><br><br><br><br><b>Sword Art Online: 7/10 -</b> Let me just say that it was a good anime. I t had potential with a suckish plot. I mean, when i read the sypnosis, i was like &nbsp;"wow i wanna watch this" but i didnt like it towards the end due to ALO and the plot is going all over the place. First its about Kirito, then Asuna, and now Yukki? I thought Asuna was cool. I wanted her to be that typical tsudere girl but she broke character which i don like :(. Shes so girly now and ya. I would give this a 8.7/10 if&nbsp;<br><br>They used the 50 episodes to actually go more indepth in the Aincrad Saga, skip AlO, add GGO and Sinion, Sinion dates Kirito, and then ALO with out Yukki in the end. Like i thought it was pretty unneccsary. (Btw, i did not have any feels in the last episode when Yukki died becuz i was pretty mad when Yukki was the best swordsman) So ya, could have been better.<br><br>#KiritoxSinon<br><br><b>Akame Ga Kill: 7.8/10-</b> Again, this anime had potential.

Wanna bring this back up because i am gonna give my ratings over the completed anime series i watched over 2014 :3<br><br><i><b>=!=!=!=SPOILERS AHEAD=!=!=!= </b></i><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><br><i><b>=!=!=!=SPOILERS AHEAD=!=!=!=&nbsp;<br></b></i><br><br><i>You have been warned</i><br><br><br><br><b>Sword Art Online: 7/10 -</b> Let me just say that it was a good anime. I t had potential with a suckish plot. I mean, when i read the sypnosis, i was like &nbsp;"wow i wanna watch this" but i didnt like it towards the end due to ALO and the plot is going all over the place. First its about Kirito, then Asuna, and now Yukki? I thought Asuna was cool. I wanted her to be that typical tsudere girl but she broke character which i don like :(. Shes so girly now and ya. I would give this a 8.7/10 if&nbsp;<br><br>They used the 50 episodes to actually go more indepth in the Aincrad Saga, skip AlO, add GGO and Sinion, Sinion dates Kirito, and then ALO with out Yukki in the end. Like i thought it was pretty unneccsary. (Btw, i did not have any feels in the last episode when Yukki died becuz i was pretty mad when Yukki was the best swordsman) So ya, could have been better.<br><br>#KiritoxSinon<br><br><b>Akame Ga Kill: 7.8/10-</b> Again, this anime had potential.

Wait was that episode where Yukki dies the last one? I'd really hope not because they still need to wrap things up....they can't leave us hanging with Kayaba creating the Medicuboid and thats it. I....Must....Know....!!

I haven't been the anime/manga guy. However, I've been really immersed in Toriko. It's a manga about hunting monsters for food. Pretty cool and enjoyable to read! <br><br>Warning: Don't read before going to bed. It'll make you hungry.

xD that was hilarious how everyone thought he was girl.<br>That would makes things so much more funny and people would actually like a third season, when normally, when it gets to 3 seasons, the plot becomes crap. But that actually could be a good starting point on how to hook viewers xD

Just finished Jinsei. Interesting storyline, hard to follow though. The ending isn't too good... Well, it looks like there could be a season 2 or another episode though...

Jinsei is very good. People can learn and enjoy too. Its something everyone should watch. Although you already spoiled it for me ;-;

OH MY so much i haz to tell.<br><br>1st: in Nisekoi manga, there is actually plot progression?!?! for da first time, it gets intresting<br><br>2nd. After all these weeks, they realesed a new Attack on titan chapter. I was so hyped up and i read and let me just say, its getting good and the chapter itself was like a good cliff-hanger to me (please read all of the manga to understand)<br><br>Other notes: I read my manga usually from kissmanga.com. its free, none of that bogus lisence or whatever and its pretty kewl. No really big animes for 2015 so still hopin and waiting in the mean time. Anyone going to anime expo by any chance :o?

So many highlights for 2015<br><br>Fairy Tail (2014)- I guess the new season is ok but I dont have as much feels as the first season. Still pretty great though. I have also been reading the manga of Fairy Tail and man you gotta read that. (However, If you haven't read the manga and keep watching Fairy Tail 2014, your gonna have feels and going to be VERY SHOCKED)<br><br>Nisekoi Season 2: I guess its ok. I Read the manga already so Not really surprising<br><br>Attack on Titan (manga)- ITs intresting but still many plot holes to fill up. (Fav character atm is Krista Lenz) <br><br>High School DxD- obviously<br><br>My Team Romantic Comedy SNAFU Season 2: Great anime series so far and i suggest people should watch it because some people can relate to the main character. It is also in a way, similar to Watemote (main character wise)

Thought I'd bump this;<br><br>Just finished Amagi Brilliant Park. I personally loved it, definitely a change of pace (was watching a lot of action based anime). If you are into the ideas of hope, determination and faith... this anime is for you. It is about a theme park, filled with magical beings, starting from the bottom (desserted and boring) to a very popular, successful and lively place.

<p>SAO S1 was great, tho only thing which they could've toned down was the Kirito-Asuna 24/7 ever since episode 10</p><p>as for S2 I actually found it great also, atleast the 1st half (Phantom Bullet Arc) and having that sexy bae Sinon around made it even better and idk if im the only here but&nbsp;I think Kirito-Sinon make a better OTP/couple cuz not only Sinon is one of those girls who actually have that childhood nightmare thing going but shes also a gamer and shes actually 16/17 yrs old&nbsp;and Kirito is also 17&nbsp;(obviously but in a sense like since Kirito became a gamer ever since he was young, same goes for Sinon) and the fact that Kirito was actually hitting on her even tho he had Asuna (but eh, Sinon all the way ;3) and even upto ALO and IRL they constantly tease each other much to the jealousy of the other girls (even Asuna xP), and if you notice they actually have feelings for each other especially Sinon, that's why I was hoping that there would be a chance that in S3 Sinon would actually express her feelings to Kirito and maybe end up dating atleast once and even possibly Kiss (sorry had to say it even tho it might sound weird x3) or Kirito gets saved by Sinon at some point in S3 or vice versa in those situations</p>

+1<br><br>Even though SAO was enjoyable, its pretty Overrated. The plot isn't as good compared to other animes like No Game No Life, Log Horizon, and Fullmetal. SAO had a great concept but the plot wasn't executed to well and the characters especially .-.

Just finished "The World God Only Knows".<br>It is one of the best Romance/Comedy animes I have seen so far.<br>All three seasons were great, the ending was unexpected, and a great twist was added to season 3.<br>Greatly recommended, sad it had to end with 36 episodes :c NEED MORE

I'm watching Kurtei Kyoshi Hitman Reborn!<br><br>If you like comedy, its pretty good, if you want action, bear with it, it gets good, then it goes back to comedy, then it gets good again and then it goes back to comedy, then i don't know because that's where i am, the character development is massive though, i like it, i'm not much of a comedy person when i'm watching anime, i prefer action :3
