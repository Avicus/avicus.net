Today at 11AM I get a knock at my door. I open the door to see only my neighbor on the floor asking me to call 911. He was showing symptoms of a mild heart attack, this man helped me through tough times and was there every minute of my life. He helped us settle in, he came to every birthday party we had just so he wasn't making us feel alone in this world. The ambulance drove away, he looked healthy, smiling and telling my mom and I that he was going to be fine....<br><br><br>Around 2pm we get a call from his daughter saying he passed away due to heart complications.&nbsp;<br><br>This post isn't so I can get views or replies, nor is it meant to bring sadness. This post is for people who are struggling in their life. Whether it's from loosing a loved one, being bullied, or anything else. Know that there's always that one person who will sacrifice their time just so they can see if you're ok. You may or may not have met this person yet. But if you have, grab them give them a big hug, and tell them how thankful you are.&nbsp;<br><br>Comment down what you are thankful for. I need a distraction from my life right now.&nbsp;<br><br>RIP Rob Bayer 4/27/15

Almost anyone I've ever met, especially my friends and my family. But most of all my parents because of all they have done for me, and also deciding to move here to the U.S. instead of living in India.

I'm thankful for agency that we have in our lives. It gives us a chance to show that we can decern right from wrong in our lives. This is what I'm thankful for.

I'm thankful I moved home. Right now I've got friends and people respect me because my new school is fabulous. But before then my life wasn't so good. When I got up to year 5 in primary school, all my friends has left. I started to get bullied. I was called gay as an insult and was picked on because of my size. Then up to secondary it got worse. I was thinking about suicide. Then BAM! My parents got a new job, we moved to another place another school. If we hadn't moved... I don't know .-. I also am thankful for avicus and the amazing community it has. Sadly I struggle to emphasise and therefore I often forget how lucky I am- how bad it could be.&nbsp;<br><br>I also am thankful to chocolate digestives. Those buggers taste good.

Sometimes people scream 'f**k my life, i got 60 on a test', and they don't even understand the meaning of life.&nbsp;<br>If you have life, be thankful for it. One of 4 breedings dies in the middle or when he borns, then if you live now and have a life, be thankful for it.<br>R.I.P Rob Bayer.
