Alright, so I've been really into making resource packs lately, so i thought why not make some for people who dont have a 'Custom' one for them so to say... (If you already have one, I can make you a new one &gt;=))<br><br>Since it is hard for me to think what you want for the resource pack, fill out this:<br><br><b>Edit: 16, 32, 64, 128.<br>What pack do you want it to form from (Give download link plz):<br></b><b>Private?:&nbsp;</b><i>If you want to receive a resource pack privately give me your skype or a provate social media that I can send it to you.<br></i><b>Orientation:&nbsp;</b><i>Do you want it for PVP, or just regular minecraft days? (Also for UHC's)<br></i><b>Detail:&nbsp;</b><i>PLEASE BE PRECISE in what you want for your pack, I cannot read minds. Such as: +Low fire, +Short sword/vise versa, FPS, or anything else, just be specific in what you want<br></i><b></b>(and just for curiosity)&nbsp;<b>What are you using your resource pack for?:&nbsp;<i></i></b><i>Pretty self explanatory.<br></i><br>Im not sure how popular this thread is going to get, as far as i've seen no-body has posted a 'Public' so to speak, resource pack thread.&nbsp;<br><br><b>NOTE:&nbsp;</b>Depending on the Resource pack, it may vary the time. Since school is around and such i might not be able to do a whole lot, The estimated time for me to be done is 1-4 weeks.<br><br>Thank you! ^~^

I know this isn't specific but could you make a "realistic" pack? Like the shaders mod but in a<br>resource pack. Is that possible?

</div>
Probably not.<br><br>1) Shades are really hard to make like in shader packs<br>2) Mcmeta is a pain<br>3) I can't really make realistic packs, I'm kinda only into making small kind of packs, not like full blown out. But i think i can try make some things realistic :)

I got simple request, could you make a faithful pack (Using the faithful texture pack obviously), and change a few minor things. I would like a it as 128 x 128 so that you can make JUST handheld items (Swords, tools, food) as HD as possible, however I would like the 64 x 64 textures on all the blocks. And just for the sandstone, could you use the 32 x 32 texture for it? Thanks! (In theory I'm asking for a combination of different texture resolutions) Oh and one last thing, so that the bow can show when its going to be a critical hit. Thanks!

GL with this, mah resource pack awesome as is. Although I would appreciate a spawn egg and overlay in 32x that looks like the disco zoo elephant .-. (Just look it up, the outlined, lighter images are nicer, and no i dont like the game, my little sister is obsessed with it) it would also be k3wl if you could make the mushroom stew as an upside down obey hat with stew in it :P (if you have spare time, its not needed)

Edit: 64/much details as possible (128 would be awesome!)<br><br>I like the pack that is called... Natural Beauty Pack? IDK, something like that.<br><br>Not Private<br><br>I would like it to make Minecraft look beautiful &amp; detailed, but also work in the PvP atmosphere of Avicus.<br><br>I would like a different look of blocks. Please make blocks like Obsidian &amp; Emerald/Diamond/Gold/Iron blocks super detailed. I would also like armor super detailed too.

I Currently dont make 512x512 packs, however if you want one with your name in the inventory or anything, i can do that.<br><br>1) Really big res, i'm even having a hard time making a 128x128<br>2) Im not an EXPERT with photoshop (enough to get the job done)<br>3) If you do want one, as i said i can probably just put your name in the Inv and that will be solved.<br><br>If you want me to atempt it, im pretty sure i'm going to put it last on my to-do list :P

I hate people who find a nice thread where peopling are doing something to help the community and believe they are important enough to make some nice guy spending loads of his own time to make someone an ultra HD pack when they arent even bothered to fill in the requesting bit properly. There are also so many just 512x packs, why cant you just go and download one of them, there are so many items in an minecraft resource pack (number after i look it up :P).

Yes indeed, If you want the original one:<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/resource-packs/1241290-r3d-craft-default-realism-smooth-realism-v0-2-0">http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/resource-packs/1241290-r3d-craft-default-re...</a>&nbsp;&lt;--- This is the undedited pack, there are 4 or 5 versions of it (Resolutions) and if you just want to original and unedited download this, I recommend Default realism over smooth<br>But yes i can edit to be seans pack :D<br>&nbsp;<br>Should be done (with other requests) in about 3-7 weeks if not 1-4 :P

Hey, could you make me one themed like The Walking Dead? I'm obsessed with that show and I'd love to see a pack like that. Could you make zombies look like real zombies, and bows to look like a crossbow? And anything else you think would make the pack look like the walking dead, also in 32x32? &lt;3 Thank you!

So... Don't get mad at me, but I just realized that my computer most likely won't be able to handle 128x128... so could you make it a 32x32?

Sorry! I really am. I know how much effort you were putting into the 128x128, but I think it would be worse if you kept doing that, and then I had to trash it cause my computer couldn't handle it.<br><br>Sorry!
