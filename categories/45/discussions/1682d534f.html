I haven't been active on avicus, or the forums, for around 5 months. Why? Ping and FPS issues made it completely unfair and there was a pretty low player count. Anyways, it turned out that I had this tab open, in internet explorer, for about 5 months due to windows 8 not correctly shutting down tabs so I thought I would say hi to the people I spent around 20 days of playtime with (as well as goodbye, I never said that). Hopefully Avicus is still going strong as it was always full of great people and loads of originality. This will probably get counted as spam and most of you either disliked me or don't know who I am.I was kinda a whining bitch at the end of my time on Avicus although they were all legitimate problems. Hello and goodbye.<br>-build_high
