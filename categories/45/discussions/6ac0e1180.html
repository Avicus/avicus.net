Hi all. I just want to share with you, my oppinion about: <b>"Avicus is now dead"</b>. I recognize the vision that had the avicus's staff members with the <i>Atlas updat</i>e. I know that the update itselft, has a lot of issues related to glitches that appeared in the new "game modes" or the lag, that have the servers that cotains the maps. But people, lets be real, I think that is not necesary calling the<i> Altlas</i> as the update that killed avicus. The update just <u>came out yesterday</u> and I think that is normal, see "Glitches" and "Lag" in the server. Also I think that is <b></b><b></b>not <b></b>necesary leaving the server just for the errors that appeared with the update. Lets wait until the staff members fix these problems, and we most recognize that they were trying to do with avicus a better place to play and share with others.<br><br>Have a Nice Day<br><br>- PolarFist<br><img src="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/avicus-network/images/c/c8/Logo-large-7ac8d92613b99a3d0bbe3d91b31ffa64.png/revision/latest?cb=20140729012749" title="Image: http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/avicus-network/images/c/c8/Logo-large-7ac8d92613b99a3d0bbe3d91b31ffa64.png/revision/latest?cb=20140729012749">

Yeah most players don't realize that it has been out for not even a day and people are raging, and I am too, but give devs some time to fix stuff, then If its not fix start a riot!

We do need an update though. Avicus wasn't 'bad' if you've been playing on it constantly since Avicore, but the knockback was messed up, the maps were starting to get old and most maps were played the same or very similar every game, it was just getting old. With the new update we can do more with maps, add things much, much easier, updates are easier to push out, and possibly even fix knockback. Maybe a update wasn't needed, but Atlas will bring updates faster, better, and more efficiently then with the old system. Yes, there are lots of glitches and things that need to be fixed, but honestly, if you asked most people if they would rather have something perfect that takes a week to fix or have something messed up and never get fixed. They would say they would rather wait a week. It might suck for now, but in the long run Atlas is bringing us a lot better stuff then Avicore could, and it's easier to do.<br><br>Now can we be thankful and think about the fact that it's been out about 24 hours now, and realize that&nbsp;<b>there are glitches and bugs in&nbsp;<i>every</i> update.</b> The complaining about stuff that devs know about and are trying to fix is really getting annoying. I get it, there are issues, and they suck, but Atlas has been out about 24 hours... Get over it and be patient.<b></b>

Avicus isn't dead. It may have lost players over the months/years, but it's not dead. Even if the player count stays around 30-40 every day, this doesn't mean it's dead. I'm repeating myself quite a bit here, but considering a new update recently came out, we hope this can help attract new players to the server. Avicus will die one day, but how I see it right now, not for a very long time.

Yes, because a server that just updated is dying because of the temporary lag.&nbsp;<br><br><br><br><br><br>What the fuck.

As mentioned before, Avicus is not dead. Bugs always occur after updates, therefore they should be expected. Once they're fixed, Avicus will be fine and the player base should rise back up. People claiming that they will 'quit' is foolish because they know that it'll be fixed. Expect lower player counts until more of the major bugs are resolved.

Have faith in the devs! Avicus is not dead. I repeat, Avicus is NOT dead. This is just the begining. The admins/ devs arent stupid, they know what they are doing. There is no reason to panic thinking avicus is dying. The update has only been up for a day... You cant expect the update to be perfect the next day. Avicus was due for an update and we all know it. I dont understand why so many people are resisting change. This update is for the better. When first playing on it I was a little shocked by the amount of change, but after a while I could see past the lag and the others complaining... and I saw a change for avicus, a good change.. Anyway thats enough of my rambling. Avicus is not dead. Even with the change the same community will be there. We need to support each other and not panic.

I believe it is now, the hit detection sucks, no sounds when u get a kill? So many new maps that aren't the best in my opinion. I would like to see the classic maps back like the throwback rotation.&nbsp;<br><br>And PolarFist I played you on BadLion yesterday on combo, it was a great fight even though you lost.

To be honest with you, I think that the best idea to keep the project ares community alive, we don't need 2 seperate servers Avic.us and OCN. The best would be if those 2 servers combined into a whole new server and it would be better becuase: more admins, more players, more and/better maps/gamemodes and everything related to that.

There's that part of the OCN community that thinks we're really bad anyway, merging is a horrible idea.
