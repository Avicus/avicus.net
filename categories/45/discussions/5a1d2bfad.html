I am making the only worth while thread while the staff and players run spears into each other's heads.<br>Pokemon is a video game and you do stuff in it. So what do you do in the game?<br>Make competitive teams<br>Play Nuzlockes<br>Play through the story<br>Wondertrade<br>Speedrun<br>Play the old games.<br><br>For older players what do you do? Do you do any of the things I mentioned before?<br>What are the pokemon you use in competition. Do you make theme teams? Do you just not like competition and play for fun? What is your favorite Pokemon. Discuss things here. If people want I will make a Skype group. Also to the people that think this is childish. You are playing a block game most likely flaming at a kid on the forums. Gg

Maybe replace Hidden Power with Lava Plume, it's a better Fire move to have when your Camerupt's HP is low. Eruption's damage decreases with HP.<br><br>As for the EV's.. if you're running 252-attack, you should at least have EQ, unless the attack stat isn't worth giving it EQ. The Speed isn't necessary, since Camerupt doesn't outspeed much lol. Maybe replace the EV with Special Defense?<br><br>Everything seems good for now though, I like the Rock Polish usage in there.

Pokemon Showdown is boring to meet. Everyone uses the same pokemon and the same sets. Predicting their sets isn't even fun. I play free battles or battle random people because I will more likely see a pokemon that isn't predictable and those are the moments I battle for

Never use Eruption on Set up Camerupt, it's probably gonna take a hit before setting up, especially without maxing speed EVs. Yeah like Midnight said, use Lava Plume. Reliable, good damage and chance of burn.

Never had Camurupt go under 50% on a battle I needed him in. I use my Mawhile to tank it up and after I kill stuff. Hidden Power is an amazement because it is grass. Eruption is also only used to clean up. I rely on Hidden Power and Earth Power

If you go to OU tier, you will pretty much always find Choice Scarfed Landorus-T and Huge Power Azumarill.

Tiers are boring to me. I am a heavy strategist and playing OU,NU and all that has become predictable. That is why I use Eruption. It may look idiotic but I use it at the right times. Trust me I have a physical Gardivour set and everyone expects it to be special attack...or it has a psychic move

Physical Gardevoir isn't worth running. Even with Choice Band, it only has a little more Attack than Gallade.

Been 1700 once in my glory days but got bored and I used a Mothem. Got bored because it was predictable. Also it was OU. I bet I can run the physical Gardivour set and still win at the game. Not trying to be cocky but people who use smogon are extremely easy. People who make the unexpected can thrive and the physical Gardivour set is unexpected and will throw the players off.

I guess I should explain.<br><br>Gardevoir has such a weak Attack stat that it's not worth using, and if you're going to use a physical Pokemon that is similar to Gardevoir, you should use Gallade.

Tell me this. Did you think Pachirisu was a good spot before 3 years ago? The physical Gardivour is still unknown to you and you believe it is a waste of time. I am someone who got bored of the main meta and decided to bend some stuff. Also it sadly wasn't even my idea. A friend of mine is amazing at the game but doesn't take it seriously so he tries out stuff. He showed his Gardivour in battle and I also thought he was an idiot. When he almost wiped my team with it I had to know how to use it and what its move set was. I am now like him. I don't take the game extremely seriously and I try what others call stupid.

Ok I am up for it. Any requests? I really don't care for the format all too much but it would be nice to battle. FYI I might use a joke team to calm your fangs of what ever you have.

Looking at my DS pokemon they are mainly joke sets or they are just not meant for full OU. We could battle on the DS but fair warning. I make people forfeit, even if I am losing a match. They are not good just mentally painful
