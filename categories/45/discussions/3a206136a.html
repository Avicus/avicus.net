Budget? Which type of MX switch? Do you want media keys, extra gaming keys, a wrist rest? Do you want backlighting? If so, what colour? Do you need thumbster keys? (Keys under the space bar, most keyboards with this come at about 150-200$)<br><br>It all matters on preference. If your confused about what MX switches are, they are basically the norm switch company that make the actual mechanical switch. Look into the different kinds of switches. I recommend JayzTwoCents's video, that will help :)

If you need help with picking switches:<br><br>Red: 45g, Linear. Mostly for gaming as it's very easy to double and triple tap with Reds.<br>Browns: 45g, Tactile. Good for a mix between gaming and typing. There are complaints about the tactile feedback being weak, though.<br>Blues: 50g, Clicky. Good for typing, TERRIBLE IF PEOPLE AROUND YOU HATE NOISE. Blues are extremely noisy.<br>Black (less common, as it was invented in the 1980s or so): 60g, Linear. Some budget companies still use Blacks since they're cheap, but generally they're harder to use.<br>Green (even less common): 80g, Clicky. Blues, but much harder. Most people don't like this switch because it's so heavy.<br>Whites: (really rare): 55g, Tactile. People generally use this for the stronger tactile feedback.<br><br>There's also Grey, but that's getting into the realm of basically nonexistent switches.<br><br>Here's what I would pick for Cherry MX (assuming you have that type of money):<br>Budget: CM Storm Quickfire Rapid. Reds and Blues are $70-80, and Browns are $80-90.<br>Tenkeyless (no numpad): Corsair K65 for Reds ($90), and CM Storm Quickfire Rapid for Browns and Blues.<br>Full size: This is where the debate gets heated. I'd pick Corsair K70 ($120) or Corsair Strafe ($110) if you want good quality at the cheapest rate for full size keyboards.<br>Best keyboard (at a big price): Ducky Shine 4, as of right now ($150-160). However, I'd wait for the Ducky Shine 5 to come out first, and then decide.<br>MMOs: Corsair K95 ($130? I haven't checked this one that much), probably, or maybe even K70.<br>Browns at the best price: Logitech G710+ ($80-90). Good keyboard, and goes on sale every once a while at least. The reason browns have their own category is simply because lots of people like browns, so they're really expensive generally.<br><br>If you need more help on this, don't be afraid to ask!<br>-Milki

What keyboard do you have? Btw, check this keyboard out, I honestly think this is the best gaming keyboard out there, apart from the software.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s9HizT2soY" title="Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s9HizT2soY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s9HizT2soY</a><br><br>Its basically the Razer BlackWidow Chroma combined ith the almighty Corsair K70 RGB with a couple of cool features. Its less money too!<br><br>The mouse and headset suck imo

@Sevo It appears to be more expensive than the K70 RGB.<br><br>@Emmaye Agrees with you in which category?<br><br>@ImRaging Only use Das if you're limited on USBs, need it for work, or really love that volume knob. It's more expensive than other keyboards that are decently similar.

Ew, mac?

You probably use either a laptop kind of keyboard, or a keyboard with big keys. Those kind of keyboards basically have a rubber dome and a stick kind of thing on the key caps to push it ll the way down, and then the key will register. Mechanical keys are a seperate mechanism for every single key, with different features. The most common type of mechanical and arguably the best are the ones from Cherry.&nbsp;<br><br>Mechanical keys actuate at about half the key press, so you dont have to push it all the way down. They are heavier though, which is why a little minority of the world doesent like mechanical keys, but about 99% of people do.&nbsp;<br><br>There are 3 types of mechanical keys:<br><br>-Linear- This is a smooth keypress, so its ideal for gaming<br><br>-Tactile bump- this has a bump to let you know where the key is registered<br><br>-Click AND tactile bump- the click is when the key is registered as well, along with a tactile bump.<br><br>Mechanical keyboards are A LOT more expensive too. But the feeling is very worth it if you have the money. These make you faster in gaming, typing, and deliver an overall incredible typing experience.&nbsp;<br><br>Here are the different keys<br><br>Mx Blues- Clicky, tactile bump, 50g of actuation force (best for typing)<br><br>Mx Browns- Tactile bump, 45g of actuation force (best for typing and gaming<br><br>Mx reds- Linear, 45g of actuation force (best for gaming)<br><br>Mx blacks- Linear, 60g of actuation force (most people dont like this xD)<br><br>It all matters of preference, I like blues because of the tactile bump and the click. But I cant get it since 1 its too expensive and 2 it will make my family want to KILL me from the noise =P. Mechanical keys also make A LOT more noise.

You're forgetting a lot.<br><br>#1. Topre; switch that is arguably better than MX; however, this happens to run in the $200 range or so.<br><br>#2.

This may seem weird, but I like the feel of high end membrane xP like the Corsair Raptor K40, or the CM Storm Devestator, which I bought, and love. That's why Romer-Gs are perfect for me, because the feel is membrane but it acts as mechanical. I don't like the key caps though, but for gaming and gaming only they are INCREDIBLE. I know this because they have one in my local Canada Computers xD that place is like heaven for me lol

That's why Romer-Gs are perfect for me, because the feel is membrane but it acts as mechanical. I don't like the key caps though, but for gaming and gaming only they are INCREDIBLE. I know this because they have one in my local Canada Computers xD that place is like heaven for me lol

oh right, i forgot you were canadian<br><br>ncix might help you get good deals on keyboards<br><br>(however for us 'muricans they tend to be terrible)<br><br>personally, i prefer the glorious clicking, so once i get money to build a pc, i'll get a mech<br><br>also i forgot another option @OP: because of your large budget, you could even go with a custom keyboard from WASD or Max keyboards, if you really want

I have the CM Storm Quickfire Rapid Cherry MX Blues. Recommended if you like clickyness and if you are relatively reserved from others (in case they don't like the noise).

Notice his budget, which is about 150 to 160 euros.<br><br>I'd agree that the CM Storm Quickfire Rapid is a good keyboard; however, it's only really good for people who have about half the budget.<br><br>OP can definitely afford a Ducky, without a doubt.

You probably use either a laptop kind of keyboard, or a keyboard with big keys. Those kind of keyboards basically have a rubber dome and a stick kind of thing on the key caps to push it ll the way down, and then the key will register. Mechanical keys are a seperate mechanism for every single key, with different features. The most common type of mechanical and arguably the best are the ones from Cherry.&nbsp;<br><br>Mechanical keys actuate at about half the key press, so you dont have to push it all the way down. They are heavier though, which is why a little minority of the world doesent like mechanical keys, but about 99% of people do.&nbsp;<br><br>There are 3 types of mechanical keys:<br><br>-Linear- This is a smooth keypress, so its ideal for gaming<br><br>-Tactile bump- this has a bump to let you know where the key is registered<br><br>-Click AND tactile bump- the click is when the key is registered as well, along with a tactile bump.<br><br>Mechanical keyboards are A LOT more expensive too. But the feeling is very worth it if you have the money. These make you faster in gaming, typing, and deliver an overall incredible typing experience.&nbsp;<br><br>Here are the different keys<br><br>Mx Blues- Clicky, tactile bump, 50g of actuation force (best for typing)<br><br>Mx Browns- Tactile bump, 45g of actuation force (best for typing and gaming<br><br>Mx reds- Linear, 45g of actuation force (best for gaming)<br><br>Mx blacks- Linear, 60g of actuation force (most people dont like this xD)<br><br>It all matters of preference, I like blues because of the tactile bump and the click. But I cant get it since 1 its too expensive and 2 it will make my family want to KILL me from the noise =P. Mechanical keys also make A LOT more noise.

At the end it really matters what you are willing to sacrifice on a keyboard. You have to choose what kind of person you are. A gamer (which type?) or something else (like an accountant). Just tell me what you are and I'll keep suggestions going. It's&nbsp;<br>the long road to take, but at the end, looking at your options is the best way to go.

My first choice as a gamer would be the G. Skill Ripjaws KM70 RGB or non-RGB version (RGB means individual backlighting with 16.8 million colors). Unless you're a MMO player, this keyboard is incredible. It comes in at about 160-170$ CAD. The non-RGB version (with red backlighting) comes at about 120$.<br><br>My second choice is the Logitech G710+ or normal G710. Look at a review of it as well! The difference between the G710+ and G710 is just the type of key. If you want this keyboard, tell me if you want a loud, colicky keyboard with LOTS of feedback, or a less loud, non clicky (but still loud) with a little less feedback? Both of these choices are among the keyboards eSports players use.<br><br>My third choice, and this isn't because it's the worst, is the Corsair K70 RGB (or non RGB) or the newly released Corsair Strafe RGB (or non RGB). They come at a variety of switches, including the Strafes new MX Silent switch exclusive to corsair (this switch is less noisy when it come to bottoming out the key). There aren't many differences between the two, but most people like one or the other. Take note that these is the only keyboards on these list with no macro keys (the keyboards still are fully programmable). If you want the exact same thing as the K70 RGB or non RGB, go for the Corsair K95 RGB or non RGB. The K95 has 18 extra macro keys, if you really need them.<br><br>The K70 RGB goes at around 160$ CAD, and the non RGB around 130$.<br><br>The Strafe RGB is around 140$, then non RGB around 120$.<br><br>The K95 RGB goes at about 170-180$, and the non RGB around 150$.<br><br>Take note, I just gave you all the expensive options. Tell me if these are too much money, I'll be happy to do some research. You too, look at reviews of each keyboard If you have time.
