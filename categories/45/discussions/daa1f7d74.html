<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Well, 3 and a half years since I joined, with over 500 friends and long life
memories to remember, Avicus has always been a great server for me. But one thing
is for sure. I was someday going to quit Minecraft. Me getting banned, ban
evading with my sisters account and then getting perm banned on both accounts
and on TeamSpeak was the confirmation. Before I leave this post and the forums
where they are, I would like to thank a few people.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><u>Minor Thanks: </u><br>
<br>
</b><br>
InfiniteLunacy: Your internet is, as you say, the equivalent to a ton of horse
shit. But other than that, you one of the most skilled Avicus players I have
ever seen. Interesting playing with you.<br>
<br>
MapDev/Eric: Eric, I will never stop talking. Never, Never, Never. Other than
that, you are an awesome pvper/player who is really funny.<br>
<br>
Alexanderjoe10: You have helped me play Avicus for a bit now, and it was really
good getting to know you a bit better. Cool personality.<br>
<br>
Cole: Dem Strafes. You were an amazing staff member who did their job well and
knew how to strafe me to death...<br>
<br>
Merlin: Well, all those TeamSpeak times we and others had.<br>
<br>
Jozz/Administrafer: I'll 8 block you some day. Thanks for Banning Me.
Definitely the most swaggy staff member. Go Richmond!<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><u>Normal Thanks:</u></b></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><u><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"><span style="text-decoration:
 none">&nbsp;</span></span></u></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Pelpelajax/JustBudah:
Both of you are conbined because you made my ever lasting nickname ‘Benny Boy’…
which stuck somehow.<br>
<br>
<br>
SnowSX3: In my opinion, as much as I played along with the 'Stop Tryharding'
stuff, you always were my favourite mod. You always took your job seriously and
never stepped down in terms of quality.<br>
<br>
FrozenSolstice: I'll beat your 213 clicks in ten seconds some day. You were a
fantastic person to play alongside.<br>
<br>
Petlas: Petals? Snowlas? Saltep? You were the second person to really become friends with
me on TeamSpeak.<br>
<br>
Sesspee/Poseidon: It was really nice to have another long time Australian Staff
member apart from Jozz. Australian's rule and you rule. You were without a
doubt my second favourite mod.<br>
<br>
Pizza334/PizzaThePanda: The times where you defended and I rushed. That was
awesome. It was amazing to attack against someone who I knew had some
experience in defending especially since I would win the occasional monument
here and there.<br>
<br>
Mango_: The second shortest Jr Mod to Admin from my recollection. Good luck in
college to you and everyone else who is attending.<br>
<br>
99250/Numberz_: Not much except a wonderful player to play against. Have fun
with all your name changes!<br>
<br>
Tynvale/Lachy: I don't believe it, a youtuber which I actually watch and stay
tuned for videos to. You are and were such a fun and dedicated player to play
with. My best wishes with the YouTube channel.<br>
<br>
Awesomerp: You are the funniest player I have ever seen. Not to mention
probably the most skilled. All those 600+ shots we did.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><u>Big Thanks:</u></b></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Papur/Billizzle/Billy:
You were so friendly to me when I just joined. Somehow, even though I like had
just joined, you knew I was there, and you always said Hi. Somehow you are
magic. Have fun jittering because I can now too.<br>
<br>
ItzRilo: You were probably my best friend on Avicus in the last month or so.
Sorry I couldn't attend any scrims. Best of luck in the Tournament.<br>
<br>
JrMapDev/Harry: Well, the person who got me introduced to TeamSpeak in the
first place. You were a great friend for a long time.<br>
<br>
PixelCat11: Another really, really good friend. I miss playing Skywars and TNT
Run with you.<br>
<br>
Emilizzle/Popemily945/Milye: I finally got Skype... the day I got banned/quit.
It was amazing knowing you.<br>
<br>
Lokigh: Back when badges just came out, the only thing I would wish for every
day I logged onto Avicus was your skin, your voice (via TeamSpeak) and just
playing against and with your jitters.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><u>Biggest Mention:</u></b><br>
<br>
<br>
AppleZz/TheCampingRushe/Trimaz5/Tubs2: Harrison, you won't be seeing this,
because I don't know if you even logged into the forums in the first place. You
are both my only real life friend on this and the person who got me onto Avicus
and Minecraft in the first place. When I went to your house 3 years ago and you
were playing Venomous DTM and Dust Devils (I don't even know how I remember),
you suddenly got me into Minecraft. It could not have been done without you.
Thanks so much!</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><br></p><p class="MsoNormal">Last ever edit (for anyone who wants to see my face):&nbsp;<a href="http://imgur.com/OPHQGod">http://imgur.com/OPHQGod</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal"><br>
<span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Well, our journey ends
here!</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Good Luck in Life Everyone!</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;">Have a great day!<br>
