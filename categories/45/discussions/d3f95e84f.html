Hey there,<br><br>ParaSpider sent me a server IP of a server that ripped off Nebula and Nexus this morning and I figured I'd check it out. Shortly after joining I was greeted with tigerman20, and his alt, CaptainTigerman2.<br><br>We had a little bit of a bash while he assumed he was the greatest known power on planet earth (which I pretty soon smashed him down against, because duh, he's like the lowest). He claims to be creating an empire to "defeat the avi f*gs!". Yeah, he said that.<br><br>He also mentioned that he has the power to win wars, just by saying he won.<br><br>It all boiled down after he said he's going to DDoS and spam the Avicus forums (watch out, his 0.1kbit botnet or even ping of death is going to get you!). He soon after walked away, claiming he "won this war". Which was total rubbish considering every single one of his pathetic little claims were easily mocked by my statements :3<br><br>I just figured I'd share this fun little moment I had today, because I can't say I didn't enjoy it...
