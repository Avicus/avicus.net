Thank you, Iowa High Schools, for only having really basic classes for freshmen / sophomores...<br><br>Home Maintenance: 90% (A-)<br>PE: 99% (A+)<br>Spanish II: 93% (A)<br>Geometry: 94% (A)<br>English: 74% (C)<br><br>Home Maintenance is the worst class I've ever taken, which is only exacerbated by the teacher's incompetence. It's, quite seriously, impossible to fail the class, which I like to call Construction 001, and I'm only getting a 90% because I'm terrible at hands-on work.<br><br>PE is easy, as long as you do the work.<br><br>Spanish II is awesome, and the teacher is amazing and philosophical and ermahgerd. Always hope for a philosophical teacher, so that you can waste half the class talking about really interesting life things that aren't related to Spanish at all.<br><br>Geometry is my "sleep-class." Gotten 100% on 4 out of 5 of the tests, with a 91% on the remainder test.<br><br>I'm only struggling in English, because I'm a complete perfectionist with my serious works, so I take way too long. Not to mention that I usually have my papers 20% longer than they need to be.

<b>Honors Precalculus</b> &nbsp;— &nbsp;A+ (98%). Practically a joke. I haven't listened to any lectures in weeks; it's all in the textbook...<br><b>Honors Chemistry</b> &nbsp;— &nbsp;A+ (96%). I only ever use this period to study and do homework. Pretty basic material.<br><b>AP U.S. History</b> &nbsp;— &nbsp;A (we're never given our percentages). Easily my least favorite, most technically difficult class.<br><b>Advanced Orchestra</b> &nbsp;— &nbsp;A+ (100%). Our grade is based off how well we play during <a href="https://youtu.be/tmDEuFaoSC0?t=1m32s" rel="nofollow">fifteen-second excerpt testing</a>.<br><b>AP English Language and Composition</b> &nbsp;— &nbsp;A (94%). I have the highest grade between all three classes, how sad.<br><b>Ceramics</b> &nbsp;— &nbsp;A (93%). Either my teacher's gone blind since last semester, or I've gotten slightly less godawful.<br><br>That moment when you realize your grades were better when you would always play Nebula until four in the morning...

Nahh, favorite subject right here.<br>Spanish: C- (73%) - Yeah, I'm BAD at spanish... Too many distractions in this non-accelerated class.

Pretty damn fun.<br>English: A (96%) - My most boring class, don't do much in here, and she makes us write 5 page essays due next class... (block schedule).

Basically Merits with around 5B - 5A's in my tests / assignments. Most New Zealanders will understand this but it's pretty much just above average.

2's 3's and little 4's. My school dropped the letter/percent system, and instead uses a set of 10 outcomes per class, that a rubric is based out of. Every assignment/projects based off of different outcomes such as speech. vocabulary and more. It's more dependent on trying than actual unfair marking of specific answer and A to B simplicity.&nbsp;<br>1 = proficient&nbsp;<br>2= basic<br>3 = intermediate<br>4 = above and beyond usual expectation.
