Man I never thought I would be writing one of these.&nbsp; But, here we are.&nbsp; It's time for me to move on.&nbsp; I have lost interest in Minecraft and have started taking my tennis more seriously.&nbsp; Minecraft has become a major obstacle and has been in the way of my schooling and tennis.&nbsp; All I thought about was getting done with my school work and my tennis to get on the computer faster and that has to stop.&nbsp; <br><br>I would like to thank everyone I have come to know during my Minecraft days.&nbsp; There are so many and this leaving post would be way too long.&nbsp; Without you guys, I wouldn't have stayed as long as I have.&nbsp; I will never forget you guys!<br><br>I would also like to thank the Sr Staff team for allowing me to serve as a Junior Moderator for this server.&nbsp; You guys gave me an experience like no other.&nbsp; Keep doing what you have been doing.&nbsp; Also would like to thank the entire staff team in general.&nbsp; You guys are amazing and don't let anyone tell you differently. <br><br>I am handing over my account to my siblings so if you see them on this server, it's not me.&nbsp; Who knows what they will do ( goodby KD D: ).&nbsp; Well this is it.&nbsp; Goodbye everyone!<br><br><img title="Image: http://orig15.deviantart.net/aaac/f/2009/327/d/a/da80032ca004a538bc9a23f043f91656.jpg" style="margin-top: 0px;" src="http://orig15.deviantart.net/aaac/f/2009/327/d/a/da80032ca004a538bc9a23f043f91656.jpg"><br>I have learned how to fly!
