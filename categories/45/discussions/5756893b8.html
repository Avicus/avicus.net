Opinions on me in-game? bloody annoying. tryhard mod and you just need to relax and give players more chances. We are all trying to have fun and play the same server, let things slide every once in a while if its not severe. Mods like you don't make the server fun.. As a ref, you are nice, except for when you threatened to give my team a warn when we asked for a new ref T5.<br><br>Opinions on me as an irl friend? Very chill and fun to talk to outside the server, seem like someone who people like to be around. I would chose the irl friend over in-game though. Two sides of you.<br><br>Excited for Summer of 2018? Yeah I'm pretty HYPE. I will be able to drive myself places and I'm planning some personal vacations to meet some friends and stuff. Maybe even a mc LAN tournament.<br><br>We're inviting liz right? always!

Opinions on me? GREAT guy! One of my favorite players/staff on avicus and close friends who I admire. Your skills on handling the media team last tournament weren't the best, but I like your professionalism, and your friendliness towards people.<br><br>Opinions on my coaching with Rocket? 100% honest, without you we probably wouldn't of done anywhere as good as we did in T5, With you, we only lost on draxel once, (we beat bulldogs tf) and after the first of matches, we didn't lose a game on alpine after you switched our strat. You really are a huge help and a great shot caller. T6 went a bit inactive because we scrimmed at times you weren't on, but the one-two times you were there we got useful information out of you to help us. You deserve the tournament third place rank, honestly.<br><br>Why is the Caribbean island of Antigua a meme? Seth and I are in the same AP English course, and we had to answer a prompt on a story that's setting was there.

Am I still a coach? I don't know man, I feel a slight disconnection&nbsp;<br><br>Opinons? Okay, ALM. Back in the day I could sit for HOURS talking to you in teamspeak and playing around with tnt minecarts (YOU DONT UNDERSTAND) and making jokes with you. As a developer which you are extremely talented at, you are the best. You deserve to get paid for what you do. Now, as an admin, its hard to see it like that. I didn't feel safe on the staff team anywhere saying anything without a threat or being demoted. I don't think you appreciate your staff teams work enough, which leads to demotions/retirements. I could still talk to you in teamspeak and stuff, but I don't think you being an Administrator is great. You being owner and leaving everything except development to the admins/seniors would actually be a good idea, and possibly bring back some players. In my opinion, you just have too much power and have used it poorly.<br><br>AGT? Now that puddles is out, I think I will root for Darci Lynn, In the Stairwell, Mike Young, and Eve clair.

Opinions? One thing I really enjoy about being friends with you is I can go to you and ask for help with strats. Your team is probably the closest friend team with mine, and I really like playing with your boys sometimes when you sub.

Opinion? Okay, lets start with the positives. I really enjoy playing with you on hypixel and hanging when the old boys get in teamspeak to chat, its a fun time. I really liked you as a senior I thought you handled things great so major props. I disliked how you handled the pathetic situation. You didn't know anything about the situation and continued to argue against the victim and were not open to the other side of the argument.&nbsp; Besides that one event, I'd consider you a friend.

Opinion (as a person and as a staff) ? Both, great person. You have the ability to be much more than what you are right now, and I love your commitment to the competitive scene and doing your job. Good friend to chat with overall.<br>Favorite car? Yellow Lamborghini&nbsp;<br>What are your life ambitions ?&nbsp; I would like to become an actor and star on broadway. After that, I have many little plans but I would like to teach&nbsp; middle school theatre.<br>Favorite song? Right now, kind of in love with the old "Not a bad thing to fall in love" by Justin Timberlake.

Opinion as player? T6 qualifier= 0&nbsp; T6 Invitational= 1 You are such a better player when giving coms and talking to us. I find you a very strong player who came clutch and flew into the wool when we needed to (don't take me seriously people its a joke) Looking forward to more tournaments with you!

Opinions? (If you don't feel you know me well enough to give one, that's okay.) Don't know you that well, but you understand the avicus staff conspiracy so good for you.<br><br>What do you think this server will look like in the future? Sadly. I see it going down more than up.&nbsp;<br><br>Obviously, there's more to life than Minecraft, so what else do you do for fun? I coach U8 girls soccer, I play myself as a goalie, and I do theatre.<br><br>If you were the owner of Avicus, what would you do? I would put my main focus on reviving what avicus used to be. Letting the seniors/admins deal with the staff/server stuff they were able to. While I work on the "owner" work which is getting people to donate, voting system, reasons to play on avicus, and would promote some people I know who can help me with this.
