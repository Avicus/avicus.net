Ok I am sick and tired of this. It ruins the game and therefore it should he punishable. Or if it stays there should be some classes that can counter it. That's my view on it.<br><br><br>Thanks, CreeperJoe62

+1.<br>It gives ninja's an advantage that is way too overpowered.<br><br>If you guys don't know what he's talking about, he is referring to the issue where ninja's are able to take their boots off.

I've tried to punish players for it. I've been &nbsp;told it's not allowed but it's not punishable. I don't agree with that rule... If players know it's not punishable they're not going to listen.

Wha..then that just denies the name of it being called Ninja. LOL. Ninjas are meant to be super stealth. They should be allowed to take of boots. I mean why call it "Ninja" when you can be seen.<br><br>I mean that's so lame. The point of the kit being able to do something like that is for it to be fun. It's also very easy killing people who are invisible.<br><br>A tip would be to just look for sprint Particles

I think it's where you can take off armor as a Ninja, and since it has invis potion effect on, you can get sneaky kills and it's apparently OP :-/

I agree that the ninja kit should not be able to have this but the upgrade of ninja (shadow) should be able to do this! That would balance gameplay because ATM shadow is useless!
