I don't know where to begin really...<br><br>I first joined Mczone when I was 11 - looking for a Walls server. I then gained jr mod at the age of 12, I remember being so proud of myself at the time, I had found myself a community to call 'home.' To come to when I wanted to just say 'fuck it' and have a timeout from real-world stress, &amp; issues. That turned out to be, heh... quite a lot. Over the years it's been amazing to meet so many amazing people from a such a wide-range of backgrounds. And now that I just stop and think, it really is astounding... I've talked to people 1000's of miles away at any one time but yet we're all here for the same purpose, fun. Where we can put all our differences aside and enjoy everyone for who they are. It's quite amazing to think about, to me personally at least.&nbsp; I am now 16 and approaching my final exams, guess I should probably get to work huh...<br><br>There are hundreds of people I would want to thank and I could be here forever trying to remember and write about every single one. So instead. I'll just sum you all of.<br><b><i>Thank you.<br></i></b><br>I sound sad as fuck but avicus will forever be apart of my childhood memories. You've all been part of that. Hey, even if I wanted to forget - those 2000 hours ain't going anywhere!<br>And I don't regret a single minute of it...<br><br><br>Okay well maybe a few<br><br>My first team, Storm Chasers. Who started of as a team of meme and friends went sweaty and then&nbsp; -- oh -- would you look at that. We're back to shitty memes all over again.<br><br>My 3 years of staff on this server have taught me a lot of myself as an individual and really shown me people's utter dedication to&nbsp;others. I want to thank all former staff for everything they ever did. &lt;3<br><br><br>Thank you for the memes.<br>Thank you for the memories.<br>Thank you for the Armour Crafting<br>Thank you for the Ear raping<br>Thank you for the rage&nbsp;<br>and thank you for the journey...<br><br>But most importantly...<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>ProffesorUtonium has destroyed cave.</b><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/2UIMngV.jpg" title="Image: https://i.imgur.com/2UIMngV.jpg"><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/I70GdRf.jpg?1" title="Image: https://i.imgur.com/I70GdRf.jpg?1"><br><br><br>Peace out everyone, I hope you all achieve where you want to go in life; I love every single one of you.<br>&lt;3
