</h1>
On Friday, something happened in my school bus that prompt me to write this.<br><br>Sitting Down closest to the window seat with my friends, I was relieved because our bus came late. (its hot in Florida). Not soon later, A kid behind me asked me to open my bus window, as he was hot. I promptly refused, since the school law states that windows should not be open for safety reasons (plus the annoying noise while the bus is at full speed). Make long story short, the events escalated to a point where he was cussing at me and referring to racist/inappropriate topics. He kicked my legs.<br>He recorded me. He punched me when I tried to cover his phone.<br><br>Over the weekend, I emailed the assistant principal and hoped for a answer. Guess what?<br>He didn't do anything.<br><br>My very good parents are emailing the prinipal now so everything will be resolved.<br><br>My point: Being bullied or harassed isn't what it seems. You turn into someone else when the bully starts harassing you. Don't be that, no matter what , stand up to yourself.<br><br>Thank you,

Tbh I learned not to give an f after a while. Let idiot a be idiots just don't be as stupid as they or let them push you around. One thing that sucks about being a kid is no one respects your opinion. In Highschool people take your word more seriously which I love. I hated being right or have something happen and have my views disregarded.

When I was in school, a guy once&nbsp;acted like he had balls of steel and pushed me around, so I punched him right in the face, really hard,&nbsp;and I&nbsp;maybe (yes I did) broke his nose and there was no balls of steel anymore. I'm not saying you should hit anyone, but you should never be pushed around like that, if they think they are better than you, prove them wrong.

Here's what i'd do from past experience.<br><br>If he pulls out phone, knock it out of his hand. If he punches you, stand up. Promptly turn aggressive towards him and grab his shoulder for leverage. Then deck him straight in the temple and watch him tumble.&nbsp;<br><br>If he is not knocked out, then wrassle him and overpower him. Choke hold him and force him to give up. Wait for teachers to notice and lay off him. Explain what happened and then tell your parents.<br><br>If the school doesn't do anything do whatever you can to&nbsp;<i>make&nbsp;</i>them notice. Next time he punches you, do not walk away. Give it real good to him even if you lose. Do not back down.<br><br>I'm in highschool and many children try not to fight me because:<br><br>#1: I try to be nice and lenient.<br><br>#2: I am a very big person at average 5'9 feet. And many people notice that i lift weights at gym so they generally try not to fight me.<br><br>#3: I am assertive when needed and do not back down from fights.<br><br>Just remember, try to be assertive and do not always trust teachers as 50% of the time (Depending on the school and teachers) they won't do anything. Alright? Don't let them bully you and tell the teachers to do their jobs correctly if they do not do anything.&nbsp;<br><br>If your parents are called for this reason, then tell the parents exactly why you said that and they will agree with you.

I kind of agree but not with the physical contact. Despite the fact that he is bullying you, if you do things like choke him, he can press charges against you I believe.

Yo, im a junior in high school, and ima just tell you right here right now dont get yo shit mixed up in a fight. It will not turn out good, and you will lose all credibility. It's a lot better tho if you had just moved seats or you went up to the bus driver. I know lik you was pissed that that guy was being such a bitch, but honestly you dont never needa fight him. If you can't move seats or the bus driver dont give a shit then just open the fucking window. You woulda been uncomfortable, but look at the shit it's caused. I know ppl be sayin not to let people push you around, but honestly if it's not that big a deal then just let that shit go man. There's a difference between selling out and not carin enough to get into fighting. Of course, shit gets worse after that seek help, but usually it doesnt.

Oh yeah, I was on the same bus and I reported the bully too. We both got called to the principle, along with the bully and I think the bully got kicked off the bus or something because I haven't seen him on the bus. Either way, he won't be hurting us again from that experience.

Please, Try talk more in "Chile" and no in all south america countries. In my school teh bullying is constant and incredible, we can't stand it. Every time, I can't study be cause always any guy is saying "Fool, ha, fat, ha" or punching ALL the time, it is impossible. In my school you can be kicked for being with "Too many cursing" or something, but the bullying is a thing that isn't considered by law and/or our teachers.

Yeah,<br>But there is a difference between "Joking" or "Playing"<br>And, insult, punch and kick (Not saying other things I've seen) to another indefensible people is bully, like, break the phone and trap him in the toilet and lock it, it is bully.&nbsp;<br>I suffered this when I was 7 years old, I was some "fat" and the people said me it all the time. I was locked in the toilet and I had to shout and a professor unlock the door.<br>In my school it is happening and I want stop it, the people who do it never are kicked.

They still might get in trouble with the law later on or later in life. That's how criminals are created. In school, bullies reign the schools with no limits and when they grow up, they become terrorists,robbers, or hackers.
