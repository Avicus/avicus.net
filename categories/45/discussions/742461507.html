Since my walls post was locked due to those silly walls kids, I have decided to make a new post about a game mode I believe has a lot of potential.&nbsp;<br>CTH has very nice maps in my opinion, but it wouldn't hurt to get some new ones in. Maybe like this?<br><a href="http://www.welcomenri.com/Tourism/south_hill_img/devikulam_ban3.jpg" title="Link: http://www.welcomenri.com/Tourism/south_hill_img/devikulam_ban3.jpg">http://www.welcomenri.com/Tourism/south_hill_img/devikulam_ban3.jpg</a><br>Also, the kits and messed up just like walls ;[ please fix. Please and thanks

I do not know what you were talking about. I have a couple of points to bring up.<br>1. I do not consider myself a "walls kid" I started out with DTM<br>2. I was attempting to give legitimate feedback and constructive criticism, but was distracted trying to sort others who I will not name out.<br><br>Dearest WhatLiesBeneath, you should try yourself to make some new maps! You have a creative and thoughtful enough mind to make posts regarding how you believe Avicus should change, you should try to use it to make maps of your own! Put your ideas into action! You should also use it to make kit recommendations or fixes of your own! &nbsp;<br><br>But besides saying this, I care about CTH about as much as the rest of avicus, so I don't have anything else really to say. please and thanks
