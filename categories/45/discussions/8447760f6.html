So I recently got permission to make a PC from my parents, in condition of me doing to research and the parts not being expensive.<br><br>Could anyone give me a guide? I want the PC being good enough to hold a steady 60 FPS on most games, and good enough for everyday stuff (Internet browsing, watching vids in HD, word, etc)<br><br>My budget is about 500-600$<br><br>My skype: SevoMC

I'm sure this is a good idea, but one of my tech-savvy friends told me that SSD's break fairly often (about once a year), making them a bit unstable. Don't quote me on this, but it's something to do some research on before getting one :p

This is a good build however, I think a 4th Gen Intel Core i3 with Hyperthreading will outperform a 2nd Gen i5. Also, Sevo needs a monitor, OS, WiFi adapter and DVD drive therefore making his budget a bit hard to work with. The GTX 750 I chose for him is EVGA so he can use the Step-Up Program to upgrade it easily instead of having to pay full price for a new one. Also, I would not recommend AMD, specially CPUs.

His pick is alright. I would definately go for more than 4GB of RAM though. Also your processor should not be i3 as it cannot overclock when you need it to.

aaah, I thought $500-600 was just the PC itself xD<br>Although despite that i5 being 2nd gen, it just manages to outperform the i3, although the i3 is a lot cheaper, so it's a better choice :P

Absolutely horrible. CPU can't be overclocked, no need for a water cooler with a locked CPU or even an unlocked one most of the time. Motherboard is overpriced. Way more RAM than what is needed. Overpriced laptop drive. The GPU and case just cost too much for what you get.

I can't tell if you're being serious and if you really need help. If you do, a $400 difference in budget is too much. You need something more specific.

There are a lot of good guides out there, when I was in the process of researching I watched a lot of videos so by the time I had the parts to build my PC, I knew what to do. However, I did still &nbsp;follow a video (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsyxM_j3Y4U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsyxM_j3Y4U</a>) to make sure I was doing things correctly.

Overclocking is basically increasing the speed of your CPU and/or GPU. It's pretty much free extra performance, however, overclocking results in higher temperatures and TDP so you'll need to have good enough cooling and a Power Supply that can handle it. The build I put together for you does not have an overclockable processor, the cheapest overclockable Quad-Core CPU from Intel is the i5 which is like $200 more. There is also a $70 Pentium but that is a Dual-Core so I wouldn't recommend it, especially since you said you wanted to record. The i3 is also a Dual-Core but it has Hyperthreading so it acts as a Quad-Core.

1. Everything you need to plug in comes with the parts.<br>2. Yes, your case will most likely have 2, one rear fan and one front fan.

Not bad, but I strongly suggest more ram. With 4gb you can only allocate minecraft a maximum of 2gb to stay safe. With 8gb of systemram you can give minecraft at least 4gbs. This will improve performance for all games, not jsut minecraft. You can also handle 512x512+ resource packs with lots of ram

Yup, especially if he wants to play some newer games, GTAV for example. I have a friend who was getting stuttering on GTAV with 4GB of RAM and he upgraded to 8GB and it improved a lot. 4GB is standard for most gaming needs but 8GB is ideal.

From my experience, when I edit simple videos, it doesn't use more than 8GB of ram (Which i have) Around 4.2 - 5GB is used and it renders a 10 minute video (1080p) in about 15-25 minutes, but that includes the fact I had a 4790K, but still.<br><br>But for CPU based games, yes 4GB won't really stand up, but for the money, it works.

If you don't want to spend as much, you should get the first 750 from EVGA and then use their Step-Up Program to upgrade. The way it works is you send them your old card and you pay the price difference between yours and the one you wanna get and they ship it to you. I think you can only do it for the first three months but that's plenty of time to get enough money for a 2GB 750 or even a 760/960.<br><br>Only EVGA had this type of program and you should definitely take advantage of it :)

Not bad, but I strongly suggest more ram. With 4gb you can only allocate minecraft a maximum of 2gb to stay safe. With 8gb of systemram you can give minecraft at least 4gbs. This will improve performance for all games, not jsut minecraft. You can also handle 512x512+ resource packs with lots of ram

4gb of RAM is more than enough. You absolutely do not need more than a gigabyte assigned to the game.

4gb of ram is <i><b>enough</b></i>, but <i><b>not more </b></i>than enough. And I doubt Sevo will only want to play Minecraft. Therefore 8gb is a lot mroe futureproof. Also ram is quite cheap, so he's not really losing anything.

For gaming the 260x is only just better than a 750, but worse than a 750ti. There are some models of the 260x which obviosly perform better, but then there are 750ti models which also perform better.&nbsp;<br>As for benchmarks, the 260x is way behind both the 750 and 750ti.

Tbh, your logic makes no sense whatsoever.<br>Why does minecraft use your RAM for&nbsp;<u>graphics</u>? VRAM is needed. There is no point in getting 8GB of RAM and a 1GB GB Card... As well, GTA runs of Graphics memory. While yes, Games use regular memory, but how does it make sense you get a 1GB card if he's going to play other games. The 260X and the 750Ti is basically the same. They perform the same in games, SURE there is a couple FPS difference but I don't see a difference, (My friend has a 260X) and it performs fine...

well, minecraft is a strange game. It appears to load its textures into ram, because higher textures do require more ram. I've tested it with 256x, 512x and 1024x textures, and the higher you get, the more ram you need to stop minecraft from crashing. e.g when I played 512x textures on 1gb of ram, minecraft crashed after a few min, with the error log reading "ran out of system memory". With 2gb's of ram, the same thing happened after about 10 min. etc. As for vram, I never said 1gb was good and that he should get it, I was arguing for system ram. Although there are games that use over 4gb's of system ram and less than a gb of system ram however, like bf4.<br>And the 260x and 750ti are very similar. If Sevo wants to save money, he may like to get the 260x, I was simply stating that the 750ti slightly outperforms the 260x. If I was him, I'd get a 270.

As I stated before, 2gb is enough to run minecraft, but not enough for a &nbsp;512x512 pack. 4gb is the bare minimum nowadays. If you want to stay moderately future proof, don't go with 4gb. And as I also said before, I doubt Sevo is only gonna play minecraft. And for a smooth experience, it's best to have more than 4gb.

Yes, it's not so much that EVGA is NVIDIA, it's more that certain cards are NVIDIA. In today's market, all cards that &nbsp;start with "GT" or "GTX" are NVIDIA. All cards that start with "R7" or "R9" are AMD. NVIDIA and AMD are the only graphics cards developers. Then they pass on their cards to companies like EVGA, ASUS, MSI, etc so they can install their own coolers, overclock and design it to their liking.

I am not shooting down anyone, or saying that everything on here is incorrect. I was only arguing my point that 8gb of ram is a lot mroe useful than 4gb. Please don't be so rude.<br><br>Edit. Sevo has listed his needs, if not on the OP, he did so in the comments.

By the time the time he chooses to upgrade will be obsolete to get a 4th generation i7, since Intel is moving away from 1150 to 2011, There is just no point, in a couple months, yea, He can, but later on he will need to upgrade to a 2011 socket or else the build is useless for gaming (At least for modern games at that time)

I understand but, if money is tight in the future, he can get a much better upgrade using the same motherboard than using an AMD socket. Of course he's gonna have to upgrade motherboard as well if he really wants something new when he decides to upgrade. Also, there are people that still have 1st-Gen i7s and Q6600s and are doing just fine.

intel isn't really moving away from the 1150 to 2011 socket. They are still going to continue having a consuemr and an enthusiast platform. Asrock even showed of the first Z170 motherboards (they are so sexy O_O) with the new 1151 sockel for skylake which is the consumer variant of the 2011-3 plattform.

Basically, if you stick with the Intel processor, you have better upgrade options.

Hey guys. So recently I found out that my cousin's bf builds PCs, and he told me if I knew if the processor can fit in the socket, you know, if they are the same generation socket and processor. He also told me the video card is amazing, so no worries on that. Can anyone tell me if it fits in the socket? thanks

Yes, the socket is compatible (pcpartpicker has a compatibility checker so it only shows parts that are compatible). The only incompatibility it doesn't help with is stuff fitting in cases but after looking at your case, it has enough space for everything and a little more. Good luck and enjoy your build :)

Ok now, sorry for the bump. Im building my PC in the next 2-4 weeks, and I have just been given permission to pay with my own money, so I can knock myself out. Either way, I dont wanna spend too much money, so I bumped my budget to 800-850$. I have done a lot of upgrades myself, and I only need one thing from you guys, and its very simple. Find me a MAX 100$ SSD with at least 80GB in it. Thanks!
