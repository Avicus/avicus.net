You brought me up when I was feeling down and gave me hope when I had none. You told me to keep going cause you'll never know what will happen if yo don't try. I'll miss you man, in the long run, good luck with life, you always have my skype so, yeah.<br><br><br>Jozzmcozz/FluenZa/Whatever his name is now (I'm pretty lost with the name changing):<br><br>Thanks for teaching me how to play this game properly :P I still suck compared to you at every game, it was fun, when I kept getting destroyed by you in CoD/kohi, and me always begging for a re-match, MR PLANE MAN PLEASE STOP THE BOMBING RUNS!1!!!!1!one!!111eleven1!!!!!11!!!<br><br><br>Much more but eh, don't have time right now.<br><br>BYE

Neil, I always looked up to you when you ran the Predators. You were the hardest working team leader I have ever seen. It's sad to see you go. I will always remember the times in Predators.<br><br>I will still talk to you on Skype :p
