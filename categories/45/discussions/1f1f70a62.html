And I may still leave, I recently watched the "Look up from your phone" video, and I find it very correct.<br><br>The link is here:&nbsp;<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7dLU6fk9QY">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7dLU6fk9QY</a><br><br><br><br><br><br>There is more to life than looking at a screen, some of us worry about getting down the leaderboard, or getting staff. But that doesn't mean anything.&nbsp;<br>There are kids who would think of a soccer ball as gold.<br><br><br>Playing this game, doesn't get me far.<br>the community is beautiful.<br>But the game has no point.<br>It will not help me in the future.<br>It won't get me a job.<br>It won't get me into my dream university, MIT.<br>If I had stopped playing, I could do what I was born to do.<br>I'm really good at math, swimming, science.<br>I need to prove, I'm not just a random guy in the backround.<br><br><br><br><br><br>But, I also remember a saying from my father.<br>"Do whatever makes you happy, it doesn't matter if you're rich or poor, If you're rich but you do something you don't enjoy, stress will come."<br>And I enjoy playing on here.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Ahki, AKA PokerFace_Legend sent me this in skype, it's tingling with my mind to decide.<br><br><br><br><br><span>Plz don't quit.&nbsp;<br>If you quit, the clan will be missing everything that you have worked hard to achieve. In fact on a resume, it would look good showing how you are a good leader and how you worked well with people across the globe. The website is a major thing as well, who would expect a middle school student? Like you to be able to create a official website with contact information and everything.(i kinda helped though) what you have achieved at a young age is far beyond anything i could have ever done. I admire you for that. You have created a nice group of people who all enjoy playing nebula. To be honest, i look up to you a lot, &nbsp;when i grow up, i would like to meet u in person because that is how much i admire what u have achieved. This may seem a bit odd but, let minecraft allow you to show your qualities to help you with later situations in life.</span>

Some people need to find the line between whats fine to do and whats over doing or addiction. Think of MC more as your free time entertainment and you'll be satisfied. &nbsp;<br><br>Good luck m8 :)

Man listen, i understand where you're coming from , but being on the computer doesn't mean it will take over your life and has the same characteristics as a virus, playing on avicus can be a background leisure part of your life, not a brainwashing, life-draining tool :/<br>Games can actually help your sense of humour, give you great memories and opens up your brains creativity, BUT i agree with the fact that it isn't the most important thing in the world and you shouldn't spend ALL your time on it.<br>Anyway, it's just my opinion, please don't hate :)<br><br>I wish you the very best in life and make the decisions YOU want :)

Believe me, if you play Minecraft as a kid it's not going to affect you attending MIT.<br><br>It's all about time management. If you focus on school work and then use leftover time to relax and play Minecraft you'll be fine.

I'd recommend enjoying your years in your childhood. If you want to chill out and play video games then do so. If you want to swing on a swing then go for it.&nbsp;<br><br>It's all your choice and everything you do should make you happy and the people that care for you happy. You don't need to live every second to the fullest like the trending quotes tell you to do. You should do what makes&nbsp;<i>you</i> happy. If that's being relaxed and playing some video games with your buds then go ahead and do that.

Yes time management, when I see all these posts about leaving because of school or grades or whatever that isn't the reason why they are leaving, they are leaving because they can't manage there time.<br><br>it actually annoys me kinda because they are leaving for a stupid reason which can easily be fixed.

I agree with this, but sometimes people may have other circumstances besides school that they would rather be kept private. That's what happened in my case, and it may have happened with others as well.

See what I do during school to where I don't&nbsp;get distracted with MC or WOW. Is that I only play on weekends (Family rule) I at first hated it then I started to respect it. If not for that rule I would not doing as well in school because instead of doing homework I could play MC. So you can try that

If you're not leaving, then there is not reason to keep this thread alive. With new rules put into action, (Section E, rule 7 &amp; 8), we will be banning threads like these.
