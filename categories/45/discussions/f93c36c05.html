</h1>
wut es up, guise!<br><br>It's been a while since I decided to write stories or that sorta stuff! I thought about making the second season of that one silly story I wrote last time called 'The Last Man Standing' ( I never finished it! haha, got close to the end but meeeh xD ). Well, this time I'll be making it... kinda different. But I'll be keeping the same idea: a bunch of people sign up for the story and one by one they all are eliminated, until there's only one last man standing, and that's about it. Will be fun to write it!<br><br>Chapter Guide:<br>01:&nbsp;<br><br>List of Signed Up Characters:<br>01: Eric<br>02: Flo<br>03: Evan<br>04: Michael&nbsp;<br>05: Axel<br>06: Fatniss<br>07: Richard<br>08: Ella<br>09: Drew<br>10: Cookies<br>11: Merlin<br>12: Prisoner<br>13: Elsa<br>14: Badge<br>15: Strafes<br>16: Justin<br>17: Slicorn<br>18: Victor<br>19: Rev<br>20: Serra<br>21: Jessica<br>22: Anna<br>23: Zacharie<br>24: Chan<br>25: Tyler<br>26: Heat<br>27: Greg<br>28: Jonny<br>29: Cobalt<br>30: Chloe
