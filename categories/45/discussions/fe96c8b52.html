The Samsung S6 seems more efficient, but if you're hoping for the option with simpler functions, it'd be the iPhone 6.

I have to agree with you on how poor iCloud's security is. In terms of how good it feels when you hold it in your hand, that's more of an opinion, and there are factors such as the size of the phone and the case that you're using. Jailbreaking voids warranty, sure, but it can easily be reverted, and Apple employees can't be bothered to check. You can also connect an iPhone to the computer and record the device's screen from there.

Define what is better in your opinion.&nbsp;<br><br>The iPhone is far superior for user friendly interface. People also typically notice faster web browsing on iPhones compared to androids.<br><br>The S6 however, is far more powerful. It has a higher resolution screen (1440p) while the iphone 6 is only 750p. The s6 will perform faster for just about everything, except maybe web browsing. The s6 also has a much higher resolution camera capability at 16mp, compare to the iphones 8mp. The s6 also has a better secondary camera at 5mp compared to the iphones 1.2mp. The s6 has a better processor and 3 times the amount of ram. The s6 is much, much more powerfu than an iphone, and android also offers more freedom and modding options.<br><br>So, if you want an easy to use phone, get the iphone 6.&nbsp;<br>If you want a phone to perform well, work very fast, take good photos and videos, and be able to mod the software, take an s6.<br><br>You get <b><u>A </u><u>LOT</u></b><i> </i>more performance from the s6 for the price.
