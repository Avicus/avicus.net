</h1>
I'll start off; I voted for Hillary because we had no other choice besides the other parties. The other parties had no chance of getting a chance of being POTUS because they don't know how to advertise whatsoever.<br><br>So it was in a case of a lesser of two evils for me.<br><br>Now, I'm not particularly happy about Trump being elected President and I have many reasons why I am worried, why I have friends who are horrified and why my College will protect undocumented immigrants.<br><br>But. He won the Electoral College. So be it.<br><br>---------<br><br>I know each of you Trump supporters had your own reservations for voting for Trump. Whether you're a person who is an adult and has suffered from machines taking away your jobs, or you're a guy who is an evangelist and wants the Separation of Church and State to not be viable anymore, you're a dude who wants to be able to say anything you want no matter how much trouble it can cause or you're secretly a member of the Ku Klux Klan... you had your reasons.<br><br><b>However, if you're one of the retards who wrote-in Harambe or Superman. I hope you realize the amount of trouble you put on yourself IF you are among the demographic who will be the most effected.</b><br><br>So I can understand why anyone would listen to a demagogue. After all, I voted for Bernie Sanders.<br><br>But what I don't get is why you guys would believe he would fix corruption in Washington?<br><br>Why did you guys believe he wasn't part of the Establishment when he is a billionaire who has scammed many people before?<br><br>This isn't a salt topic or anything. I just want to know your reasons - if you voted for him?<br><br>Plz no lock :c

Aggressive much?<br><br>First of all, I DID take my midterms for college for multiple classes. I had to annotate an essay and define various vocabulary words that you probably don't even know yourself.<br><br>I had to do an art project with Vector graphics software called Adobe Illustrator and I had to do a midterm on Art History.<br><br>50% of the grade was remembering images' names and using formal vocabulary words to define their characteristics like Representational, Abstract or Hierarchical Scale.<br><br>And no, I was not crying. I'm just worried and balking how anyone who wanted POSITIVE change could vote for this guy?&nbsp;<br><br>I have my reservations about Donald Trump and I'm respecting anyone who voted for their candidate.&nbsp;<br><br>I don't call Donald Trump voters racist and my friends who voted for Trump don't call me racists - please respect me the same way I do to you.

I personally don't like either of them nor can I vote, but wouldn't it be a good thing if undocumented immigrants are being deported? They are not here legally and aren't paying taxes. They're just taking up jobs and homes that could belong to people that are here legally.

I agree with this, but the moral outcome is too great. It would be better if we made the immigration system much less of a hassle, ended the War on Drugs&nbsp;<b>(Which directly caused all of this mess),&nbsp;</b>and make sure companies do not ignore American citizens who are qualified over Illegals who may be qualified as well.<br><br>Outright deportation is just... ugh. Bad. I'd better recommend keeping a close eye on illegals and making sure citizens and legals are put first over illegals.

Hitler pumped propaganda into Germany's ears. For the majority of them, when Hitler first got elected, they saw it as a good thing because they had no idea what was to follow.<br><br>We're also not in a time where you would get whipped for not voting.&nbsp;<br><br>And I'm not saying that if massive groups of people were not to vote that no consequences would come of it.<br><br>I'm just saying if you chose not to vote, that it's ok.

i dunno, it just seemed like you two were arguing about whether or not people should vote. i suppose you'd probably prefer to call it something a little gentler like a debate, but either way there's no "debating" that you were involved in a discourse involving two opposing viewpoints.&nbsp;<br><br>your whole "analogy" is also pretty bizarre and ill-fitting for the situation, and frankly doesn't make much sense. hitler and mussolini were both fascists, so no matter who anyone voted for a "...<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;a dictator comes along and does what he basically does." in fact, now that i look at it, what you said may in fact support snow's point because whether you vote or not, a fascist dictator is going to get into office, so why vote? also, in what election would two candidates from the same party be running against each other? was it an 1860 us presidential election deal-io?</span><br><br>anyhow, all this leads me to believe that you only used the "analogy" so you could say trump is hitler, in which case i feel perfectly justified bring up godwin's law because it was created to combat ludicrous comparisons such as the one you made.

I voted for Bernie Sanders in the primary, but he lost, so I voted for Hillary in the main election. For me, this wasn't even a choice. I vote for party (Democrat) because their politics align closer to my values. &nbsp;I wish our country could get on board with a true multi-party system (more than 2 dominating), but that seems unlikely in the near future. I am more left-leaning by nature and would have voted for a different party/candidate if that seemed viable. Both Jill Stein and Gary Johnson were not viable candidates in my opinion.<br><br>Moving forward, this presidency could really put the 'checks and balances' of our legislative, judicial, and executive branches to the test. The topics that I am concerned personally about are education, health care, gun policy, treatment of minorities (non-white male), foreign policy, and supreme court appointments. I know that 'actions speak louder than words', but some of his words were really un-American and nothing that I believe in.

I feel that Hilary Clinton was very discrete and i felt due to emails etc she would break certain rules maybe or just be slightly corrupt.

Donald Trump isn't honest in his opinions at all and you cannot really prepare and expect for what he said.<br>Here is a list of the Campaign promises he made that Americans would have had to prepare and expect that Trump backed away from:<br><br><a href="http://globalnews.ca/news/3083926/donald-trump-broken-campaign-promises-so-far/">http://globalnews.ca/news/3083926/donald-trump-broken-campaign-promises-so-far/</a><br>&nbsp;<br>Don't forget that full wall on the Mexican border is now going majority double fence, minority wall in certain areas.
