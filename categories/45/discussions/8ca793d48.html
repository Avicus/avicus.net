Hey everyone, this post is in Off Topic, not media, because it is not really about Avicus and is only dedicated to my subscribers on YouTube, so i don't want to hear hate about my channel or whether its related to Avicus, etc. because I've broken no rules.<br><br>Some mods may think otherwise, so lock this if you must, but this is just a post to say:<br><br>OPTOBAT's Weekend Skits - Episode 2! will be out by the end of this weekend :)<br>This one, is not quite as funky and odd as the first episode, as it is more of a short movie style clip of a short, short holiday i am having in the outskirts of my home city near the beach.<br><br>Thats the other thing, i will not be active as much on Avicus or YouTube this weekend, so sorry about that, but ill be having a great time and filming a brand new skit for you :D<br><br>Thanks for reading guys!<br><br>Channel:&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6qZ9vdryr7m-4sS0i9kL3Q">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6qZ9vdryr7m-4sS0i9kL3Q</a>

if this is only for your subs then you should get a twitter or a facebook, as there is a rule for this site to not me used as social media, which is what you just did.

This post bothers me, &nbsp;you ask for no hate and say u have broken no rules, &nbsp;well you'll probably get hate, &nbsp;there is no rule in Avicus saying we cant give our options, &nbsp;but other wise I didn't get to watch the video cause I don't have my account.&nbsp;<br><br>Ps: try not to spam the forums with almost every video, &nbsp;if people actually want to watch it they can go on YouTube themselves, &nbsp;<br><br>-Ezbirdy
