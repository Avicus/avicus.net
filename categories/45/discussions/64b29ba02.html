Title says it all.<br>Goodbye.<br>Thanks for all the support and all my friends.<br>I'm done with not just Avicus, but with Minecraft in general.<br>People I would like to thank the most:<br><br><b>SnowSX3:<br></b><b></b>Snow, Thanks for everything mate. I don't know how much I could thank you. You motivated me to achieve being a staff member. Even though I didn't succeed, Thanks.<br><br><b>Petlas:<br></b><b></b>Even though we weren't the closest friends, we still had fun in game. Thanks for that.<br><br><b>FrozenSolstice/Elsa:<br></b>We had so much fun in game. I was the only one in Avicus to open up to you tbh :P<br><br><b>Assley:<br></b>You are the funniest person on the planet! Don;t stop being funny either. Please make everyone laugh everyday like you did to me.<br><br><b>FrostedCupcakez:<br></b>Even though you had mixed feelings about me such as thinking I was cool to hating me, Thanks for the humorous moderating you did :P.<br><br><b>_xToebeanII:<br></b>Iv'e known you for the longest time. You were the funniest walls player I knew. You wouldn't kill people you would have fun in Walls. Thanks for being such a great friend.<br><br><b>Assassins:<br></b>Thanks for everything. All of you teammates have been great to me! Even though I couldn't scrim with you guys, the team chat in Skype was hilarious. Great Team!<br><b><br>And anyone else, I love you too.<br>Goodbye Avicus.<br><br><br>R.I.P<br>Aidan</b>

So because a lot of people were affected by a certain person in a positive way it has something to do with gods? Makes no sense. Maybe if the same people are mentioned in a lot of thank you threads, they really are awesome people?<br><br><br>Good bye! You're name always fooled me, haha. :c

Juanoh, kindly be quiet. This isn't meant to be a negative forum topic, simply one to say goodbye. It doesn't matter whether he's gone for a week, a month, a year or forever, there's no harm in wishing him good luck. Not trying to start an argument, just pointing out some ideas to take into consideration. &lt;3
