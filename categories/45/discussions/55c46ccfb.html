The reason i am leaving is &nbsp;people are complaining about kit sniper from nexus.and i dont wanna start a war again to get it back.anyway its about losing something that i cant do something about to protect it.so i am going to another server where my irl friends are there can i get a high rank.<br>and create a server with friends where i can make decisions. I wish.i can get a server/website like this but i have to work for that.i wanna hoist our own flag.so bye guys i had a great time here .killerbye i will never forget what u did for me if i got money i buy u a rank.you guys are going to see me walking around the server because i am making a goodbye video but only when i got my elgato game capture hd.

I'm pretty sure your leaving because White Castle has introduced their "Belgium Waffle Sliders," and you just want to protect your kind's existence.<br>jk<br>But in all seriousness, it's a real shame you're going :( Please don't forget to visit back sometime. We'll miss you :)
