The Minecraft website I grew up with was the one with a dirt background but now they decided to change it and it just looks really bad :(. Here it is for yourself:<br><br><a href="https://minecraft.net/en/">https://minecraft.net/en/</a><br><br>That website was such a classic with the dirt background and they decided to get rid of it. For those who didn't know what the old website it looked like this: <br><br><a title="Link: https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=minecraft+website&amp;client=firefox-b-ab&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwji57i5ppLNAhVRFMAKHZPZA38Q_AUICCgC&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=971#imgrc=ss6F6HEjwBOHFM%3A" href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=minecraft+website&amp;client=firefox-b-ab&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwji57i5ppLNAhVRFMAKHZPZA38Q_AUICCgC&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=971#imgrc=ss6F6HEjwBOHFM%3A">https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=minecraft+website&amp;client=firefox-b-ab&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ve...</a><br><br>It was so easy to change your skin on that site ^ :(

I think it looks pretty cool. &nbsp;Gives it the "next gen" look

It looks like a bootleg Minecraft website that is 3 seconds away from a DMCA. Pretty sure the header image has jpeg artifacts and the hamburger menu is disgusting. The new shop merchandise is also atrocious. The bootleg looking site even has bootleg looking items.<br><br><a href="https://www.jinx.com/p/minecraft_periodic_table_of_resources.html">https://www.jinx.com/p/minecraft_periodic_table_of_resources.html</a><br><img src="https://i.gyazo.com/be42cdb59aadeb9fc59244d6590dccb6.png">

This isn't new, but it looks amazing for me. To be honest, the last design was very ugly.<br><br>So are you saying that with the new design is more difficult to change your skin?

Many people don't like change, especially on a large scale with something that's been the same for a very long time. I found the old one was starting to look cheap, out of date and unwelcoming, on the other hand this new website is on the modern side of design and looks very professional. Microsoft most likely wanted a redesign as they are now the owners of Mojang.

I am all for the new website, the old one - as Aura stated above - was outdated and not really pleasing. The new one certainly portrays an image of a company who knows what they are doing.

Minecraft accounts also have appeared to go up in price, it was around 30 NZD, now it's 40 NZD.

Agree with Auratixx.<br>Old website looked bad, and new one is well designed, in modern minimalistic way.

I agree with Auratixx. The old one wasn't exactly the nicest and it looked outdated. Now it looks modern and more becoming of a billionaire company.

Minecraft is pretty much a game set in the stone age. That is why i find this website unfitting for MC

the only thing that is shit in the website and annoys me is the top right corner menu opening animation. lol<br><br>i do miss the old website but the new one just like jozz and crimson said makes the company look like they know whay they are doing and imo makes new people buy the game more than the old website.
