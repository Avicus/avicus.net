Correct. The thread is over 1 year old, therefore I don't see the need to ask such a question.

"Am I cool" Read that 1000 times for me and actually think what you just said. You could have easily asked that on a recent AMA or on skype? It's not hard bud! The question is ridiculous itself and has no purpose. Why would you even bump a 1-year-old thread and write 3 words. This needs a lock because you can use something in between the left side and right side of your head. It's called a brain

It's not silly if the other user doesn't like it or just simply doesn't approve others using his memed face as a profile picture.

Considering I don't appreciate it, or give my consent to it, I think it's perfectly fine to enforce something if that something is insulting to other users.
