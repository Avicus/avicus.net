<b>Yes</b> it's true some people already know but others don't. <br>There is Various reasons why I'm quitting, It's Personal and also Minecraft related.<br>I'm quitting because I have a really busy life and i'm constantly doing homework from school, trying hard to get good grades and also trying not to drop from the Drumline and TRYING not to give another F to my older brothers projects in photography. So those are some reasons why but the ones from Minecraft are pretty overwhelming for me.&nbsp;<br>I'm really tired of playing the same thing Every single time i get on. It really stresses me out because What the Hell am I doing, i'm just sitting there doing nothing looking at a screen for 3 hours while I could read a book, go for a Run, buy the groceries, or even make my own music. I know it's really hard to let go of a really Amazing community like you guys and i appreciate that. But It's just time for me to move on just like my brother did. All those people I met in just 4 months, my brother talked about what you guys for what you have done for him and gave him memories and laughs to remember. And I thank you guys for giving me those memories to remember even when playing on MC with you guys. But it's time for me to let go this truly "<b><i>Amazing</i></b>" community. Farewell. :)&nbsp;<br><br>sincerely, HyperNatorMC
