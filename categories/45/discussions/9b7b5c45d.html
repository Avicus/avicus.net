FPS Problem Whilst Recording

Hi, I've been having issues lately with 2 separate screen recorders which seem to do the exact same thing, which is a big problem. With Open Broadcast Software (OBS) and Bandicam, recording my screen makes my FPS plummet from 160 frames to 4-12 frames. I don't really understand the issue here whenever I have my FPS settings on both recorders to ~120 or the max amount. Anyone know how to fix this?

So, your average FPS is 160... and you try to record at 120... Seems legit,

I'm not sure why people's FPS drop so much. I use fraps and mine rop only around 10fps. Sorry I can't help. :c

What's wrong with that? Attempting to record at 500 FPS drops to 40...

Hello Emmaye! Here is a list of things you could do. First off: switch to Fraps. No lag at all. But...get the payed version. Free version only records 30 sec. Awesome quality. You could pay for Camtasia, or get the 30 day trial. No lag, great quality. Or, like me you could get the "Action!" program made my Mirillis. Pretty much the payed version of Fraps. It does plummet your fps a little...but enough fps to get a good recording. Fraps, Camtasia, and Action or my favorites. Hope this helps! =D

try cracking action. Fraps screws up your dpi. Ask Splade, Action doesn't lag you as much

<span><b>@_PandaBoi_</b> -<b>&nbsp;</b>Fraps file sizes are way too big and screws with DPI. <b>@xHeat</b> - I tried that but it doesn't affect anything. <b>@Stimulating</b> - I'll try using that, thanks. (Also, the Bandicam I use is cracked).</span>

Yeah it's the same for me...<br>When I'm recording now, I always drop&nbsp;<b>at least</b> 30 FPS.<br>I really need a better recording software. I've heard from several people that Action is good, but I would need to crack it first, which can apparently cause problems.

It's depending on the hardware and software specs.<br>And how you configured your PC /BIOS settings etc.<br><br>For me: I can't use Fraps to record Minecraft, but I can record games like CS:GO The Forest etc.

He helped me get Action, but it didn't work, I opened the "dontcrack" file but then I get an error message while it's stuck on the launch screen for the application.
