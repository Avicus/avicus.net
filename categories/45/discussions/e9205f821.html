Ok so I Just had this idea of having the possibility to chat with your friends on the forums, like let's say I want to talk with my sexy boy dev_revs so I go to his profile and click an option on his profile or something to start talking/chating with him and maybe have the possibility to add more people to the chat or something

This has been suggested numerous amounts of times. It's a good idea but I believe it was denied because it would mean the website would be very slow.

O didn't know that it has been suggested before xD well it's something that I just thought about it, idk if it would lag the page, if the forums have a decent amount of ram and a good host then it's fine

-1 It's useless, you can go to a player's profile and check if they have skype or facebook and contact them there. It's just wasting the developers time, they could be developing more important things in the time.

I think it was an alright suggestion, if you are able to add it, it would help out with catching some of the hackers/getting staff to come one, let me explain: I usually always leave forums up on another tab, because I like to check it every now and then, and often there is a hacker or two on the server and no mods, but some mods are on the forums, commenting etc...So if we added this messaging thing we could contact mods and tell them to come online.<br><br>PS: Just a suggestion.

Some people don't want to put their public information on the forums (I wouldn't put my email, number, or other personal stuff. I've always liked this idea. It's more efficient to message someone on forums, it may prevent unnecessary comments on posts too.

I think the whole reason he suggested having forum messaging was so you&nbsp;<b>don't</b> have to go onto another platform.
