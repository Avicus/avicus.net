Don't ask me anything stupid.<br><br>Haven't actually properly played this game in like 2 years, but I had some fun times on this server.&nbsp; Ex mod mapdev official, ran all events in 2016 basically.<br><br>I don't know why I'm doing this so late, but here it goes.

Will never know why you never got a mic, don't know you as a person at all but you're a good player, I think you excel in Conquest but that is the only gamemode I've played with you in tbh,&nbsp; but in TDM I guess you can just kinda do your own thing and you don't really need to communicate that much, and I've never really seen you as a full out rusher? Good player tho, one of best on here ofc

I was never really involved in public Avicus, I just got bored, not even just of Avicus, but generally playing Minecraft in general. I just wanted to start my own projects because there was things I saw OCN and Avicus doing wrong which I thought I could make right and benefit from. So I just kept getting further away from Avicus.

Used to think you were fanboyish, hella annoying and not a good player, but ever since I kinda started playing more, I realised that you didn't suck and you weren't actually that annoying. Then we spoke more and got close and had an idea, but it didn't work out.
