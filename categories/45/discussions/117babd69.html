<b>AVICUSCARCE NEWS EPISODE 2</b> - [dated - August 5th, 2017]<br>What is up guys aagrant99 here and today we're coming out a hole nearly filled with tnt placed by a team griefer to report the news.<br><br>- The first story of today concerns Absolab.&nbsp; Absolab is nearly ready to pass Sunaye for the number 2 spot in number of kills on Avicus.&nbsp; He is less then 500 kills away from number 2.&nbsp; Sunaye has not been seen in 3 months, as he left.&nbsp; Absolab managed 83 kills in one match (rather impressive), this shows that he can get kills in a short amount of time and will&nbsp; quickly pass Sunaye.&nbsp; Probably by the end of tomorrow he will claim his title as number 2.<br><br>- Another story of today arrived to us from our Correspondent on dank maymay affairs (KizzyFizzy), she has witnessed an upsurge in the amount of times people are saying "pathetic" in chat.&nbsp; It has become a meme with entire games' chats filled with the word "pathetic." We have seen a few disgruntled staff shake their finger at the usage of the word as when directed it could b considered rude.<br><br>In other news today we report that BoldandBrash has assumed the title "Senior Mod", great job on your advancement.&nbsp; You were extremely worthy of it.&nbsp; Down to earth and humble. As well as LFT and _DISTRACTION they are new to this rank.&nbsp; They are both very suited for this and I think they will do great in that role.<br><br>Another story to us that is reported by our correspondent Thomas_Shoe.&nbsp; He reports that an absurdly high number of deaths have been reported from the first episode of Avicuscarce news.&nbsp; People have died from "The cringe" he stated.&nbsp; Societal breakdown has occurred across avicus and a (lynch aagrant99) petition on change.org has been signed by 1000 people from Avicus.&nbsp; When Thomas_Shoe asked how he (aagrant99) felt about that petition he stated "I will just bowspam them all like the noob I am." <br><br>In our final news today we report that the first ever Italian hot restaurant has been built on Avicus by the hot team.&nbsp; Our correspondent Thomas_Shoe went and asked why an Italian restaurant was built.&nbsp; The hot gang reported because "It's hot, very hot, yes."<br><br>Avicuscarce currently sitting at -160 views.&nbsp; 160 deaths reported from cringe. Tune into avicuscarce to hear more of the avicus news and if you haven't seen episode one yet see it now.&nbsp; In our next episode we will answer the question is aagrant99 a secret methhead, and can aagrant99 do anything besides bowspamming.&nbsp; Today for our giveaway we our giving away one free pair of lime leather boots.&nbsp; You heard me right, lime leather boots, enter our giveaway by commenting below.

Thomas_Shoe and KizzyFrizzy (Cooking show), are so memorable.&nbsp; Again every time I do one of these I will use old players that I knew to be my correspondents in memory of them.

<u></u>Yes we're very hot. &nbsp;Not just as the hot people whom build hot cafes but in the sensationalistic journalism that is created concerning us. &nbsp;People tune in because they hear hot hot hot in the article. &nbsp;Avicuscarce wouldn't be the same without them. &nbsp;They do wacky things all of the time like building Italian bistros. They are very spontaneous and entertaining with their behaviors.
