So Lets chat about why everyone is leaving avicus. Because number 1 they have removed levels from every game. I was trying to hit prestige and i was level 49 and they took it away. The question ill be asking is WHY?&nbsp;<br><br>Please Reply Avicus Moderators and Administrators why you took this away from all the people playing avicus. Page 859 of the forums proves most people left because of the level removal. Im very sad that this had to happen and i want to know why. <br><br>In the mornings you see about 60 people on. Afternoons gains about another 40-50 <br><br>This would go MUCH MUCH higher if these levels were put back in place.<br><br>Kind Regards,<br><br>ShadowWalker X

Things change, it might not have been the removal of prestiges, it may have been personal reasons. The admins have&nbsp;<b>Confirmed&nbsp;</b>that prestiges will not be added back regardless.<br>Plus, even if we did add prestiges back, what has done is done.

Yes I agree, these 'bring prestige back' threads really make me cringe because people are just not listening. The staff team said it once and will not say it again... Prestiges will not be returning to Avicus.

I think its because players are just losing interest in minecraft especially if they have played the same server(s) for several years. I am most certain it is not because of PRESTIGES!

You can't just expect servers not to change or update purely because you want to sustain a consistently high player count. Sometimes the count drops, sometimes very low but even then Avicus' flame is still burning. See the servers progress as a fire: if you leave it unattended to it'll smoulder and die, yet on the other hand if you feed it it'll grow and roar with energy and sometimes it rains a bit and the fire dies down a bit but it continues to burn through thick and thin and that is just one aspect that makes Avicus exceptionally unique.

I doubt the removal of levels and prestiges was the main cause as there personal reasons and such. IMO removing prestiges/XP system was pretty stupid and pissed me off when it was removed and I do want it back but it ain't coming back so yakno just let it be. &nbsp; and @tarheel ily&lt;3 xd

1.8 is unplayable on my computer. Plus I miss prestiges and shitty admins ;'c<br><br>But ye, Avicus appears to be gaining lots of players lately and the votes are going up. If everyone here voted daily the player count would increase faster. So vote damn it.

Yes, it isn't that we aren't listening or don't understand that they aren't coming back, it's the fact that they SHOULD be back. They were the reason players actually stayed online and why we had a consistent minimum of 200-300 people.&nbsp;<div>I don't want prestiges back to be whiny or get my way, but because it was very obviously a big part of keeping Avicus together and now it has been removed with imminent results.</div><div>Yesterday I saw 5 people online..

They are both similar and different, but with the new system, you can earn an amount of credits for a badge that has different designs and colors. When prestige was around, you could earn a badge, but they would be different colors for each one you earned. Honestly, I like the new system better, because I can buy the badge I want and the color I want with the credits I earn :P.<br>Edit: There is also no need for change because, many people are already adapted to the new Avicus. If Avicus were constantly changing, then that is a key factor for players to leave the server. There is no need to loose more players, when the server is gaining more players already.

Ivy/Funky/whatever couldve added credits WHILE keeping experience, I dont see why he didnt, as it did give players a goal to work towards even if the levels had no purpose, it was still there for people to look forward to.

Everyone left because of these prestige ranks taken away and because there is no goal there is not as much players. Ranks were fun working toward a new kit. That's the reason your losing.
