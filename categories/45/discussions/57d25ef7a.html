Hey guys Zegita here and I think most of you know me on the server and as you see by the title I am going away on holiday for about 3 weeks basically a month and I won't be able to upload any Avicus videos or any videos of the sort because I am not taking my laptop or pc as the whole of the summer holidays is to have a break and I had my GCSE exams which is the exams you do when you're between the age of 14-16 it's like an official exam for your life.<br><br>And so yeah I hope that you guys don't miss me too much swearing in the chat xD but I will be back with more and better videos and I hope you guys if you haven't give my channel a few minutes to look at and see what you think and if you enjoy it subscribe! :)<br><br>Thank you Avicus for playing on your wonderful server and idk why this sounds like goodbye BUT I AM NOT :D. I'll be back in a month to entertain you sexy viewers and yeahhhhh....<br><br>P.S It's also my birthday today and I am going away on it idk just to celebrate it I guess :)<br><br>My Channel: <a title="Link: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyUTAatWzU92DNOUd7BD1Zw" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyUTAatWzU92DNOUd7BD1Zw">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyUTAatWzU92DNOUd7BD1Zw</a><br><br>My going away video: <a title="Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMhdVtqf7GY" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMhdVtqf7GY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMhdVtqf7GY</a><br><br>Thanks and love you guys :)
