Few things. Too many channels for too little people. Private channels discourage community interactment. Nothing should be below the lobby, it's like having something below the first floor of a building.

In my opinion, even though there is no tournament at the moment, they should stay, if it's very efficient if teams are scrimming or such and don't have another ts.

From experience from both skype (which can be extremely buggy and hard to get everyone into) and public channels (which people easily can interrupt or troll) neither is really that good.

Would you rather have people on your teamspeak in a private channel or somebody in ANOTHER teamspeak?<br><br>You do realise it is just going to make Avicus TS inactive right??

75% of the ts community is made up of people who scrim or practice in their team channels. You're just making the ts less active and taking away a great function for many players. I don't see why it was done :/

Lots of people don't even USE their teamspeak, or have gone inactive. Really the only teams I see that use their teamspeak channel is Apollo and Cronus. Everyone else has their own private teamspeak server, has skype, or doesn't scrim anymore. Plus, every teamspeak has no point because if a member leaves the team, he tells everyone the password. It's not necessary to have a "private" teamspeak channel, when anyone could come in.

You're telling me you've never seen that before? Wow well let me explain some reasons to you.<br><br>1. If a channels overcrowded and you move to a different channel, and people follow you, because they think your moving for a different reason, you ask your friend "let's join your teams channel" and boom you have the password.<br><br>2. Added to a team channel as a sub<br>3. Wanna play some mini games with people in that channel so they invite you in.<br><br>Etc.<br><br>You can't change the password, only staff can.

Staff members can just move players into channels without passwords.<br>And team leaders can change the passwords.

Never knew about the team leaders can change the password, I apologize.<br>But again, stating my other reasons, it's supposed to be for private teams, not public use for anyone who wants to talk. I suggest using them only for tournaments, but I don't mind the reason of them coming back, after what you cleared up

Ask a senior staff member to make you leader and change the password of the channel.

Lots of people don't even USE their teamspeak, or have gone inactive. Really the only teams I see that use their teamspeak channel is Apollo and Cronus. Everyone else has their own private teamspeak server, has skype, or doesn't scrim anymore. Plus, every teamspeak has no point because if a member leaves the team, he tells everyone the password. It's not necessary to have a "private" teamspeak channel, when anyone could come in.

<p>"Everyone else has their own private teamspeak server" The team chats are generally for anything. But its a must when in tournaments, so every team does use it. They don't have to use it, inbetween tourney times, its their decision and its not hurting anyone</p>

So they have to use it? Or can they use their private server?&nbsp;<br><br>Anyway, I don't have anything against it, just merely stating it doesn't take away anything greatly beneficial to the players or server, nor brings anything negative

It is allowed to be in your own teamspeak server (or at least that what i understand)<br>In the league with ethernal cross we used our own teamspeak server
