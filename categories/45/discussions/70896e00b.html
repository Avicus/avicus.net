I'd rather have some official discussion over something like that instead of having developers and staff members try and make secrets and push updates riddled with issues people don't want. It's been said many times that people want to know what's going on and the progress on future updates instead of silly secrets.

Ivy actually does listen, and you'll be surprised what comes in the upcoming update. From what I've seen, most features that are noticeable are usually suggested by the community/staff. However I really do wish that the Senior staff would get involved in discussions and really get into depth with it... WITH the COMMUNITY. It's definitely a topic I will address in the Admin meeting and certainly an area in which we need to improve on.&nbsp;<br><br>As for Jake and I, we actually have a few events planned, and already we've asked for the communities opinions (EG; hand picked staff). Expect implementations from community suggestions soon!! :))
