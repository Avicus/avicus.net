So, some days this happens and some days it doesn't, <u>and this is happening on all servers</u>. I will go from 30-120ms all the way up to 250-1,500ms and I have no clue why. It's every other second, so it's pretty annoying, any suggestion on how to fix this issue? I have this more on 1v1 PvP servers rn, such as Kohi and Badlion, as they're both experiencing a bit of lag rn (26-30ms to 70-120ms). But as I said before, this is happening on all servers and I don't know why.&nbsp;<br><br>Any help please? L:

Maybe try reinstalling Minecraft because it sounds like it might be a problem with your client. If not that then try unplugging your router, wait 10 seconds and then replgging it back in again :]

Could be that, but I believe a lot of players are having this issue, including me. This leads me to think that it could be something on Avicus' part?

Yeah I get some lag spikes here and there on avicus. I was just suggesting doing those things because it sounds like it happens on more than one server. That gives me the idea its probably a problem with your router or your client, but that's just my idea :]

Simple, call your internet provider, explain him the issue and you're good!

It wouldn't be his Minecraft client since that's not what determines latency.

Avicus is lagging so much now that it keeps me from <b></b>breezily bridge.&nbsp; Today I finally got it figured out, and now I can't even do it.

Well, It's no framerate lag, but restarting your client can actually help with ms lag sometimes for some reason.&nbsp;<br><br>It's not really latency, as even when I'm lagging my pots are smoother than the average person with that ms, due to&nbsp;<br>lower latency, because most people get that ms because of the distance between them and their surface provider, not random lag.&nbsp;<br><br>This is on all servers L:

I went to OCN to see if it was just me ( since I just learned how to breezily bridge ) and I was doing it really well!&nbsp; So its Avicus...

That'll be the natural world a few chuncks into your render distance, pc's don't like a sudden rendering :3
