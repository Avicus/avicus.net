Did you pay the full $50 or the monthly fee?

If you're paying with a monthly subscription, cancel the subscription via the PayPal website. I would assume it's the same process with Google Wallet. If you paid $50 for it, you cannot get a refund.

If you paid for a subscription per month, just cancel your subscription. I am not quite sure how that process works out, though.&nbsp;However, if you paid the full $50 for your rank, you cannot get a refund.&nbsp;<br><br>Either way, whatever money has been transacted cannot be refunded.

You can cancel the monthly subscription. I don't think you can cancel if you payed for lifetime.

If the person realizes that they've "wasted" their money on a game, they'll probably want the money back to buy something that is more useful for themselves.<br><br>If you donate to the server, just think that you are helping to keep it up and running. Donations don't just go into Ivy's pocket; the help the server to function.

I'm not saying he doesn't deserve it; I'm just saying he obviously does get a cut when he can.
