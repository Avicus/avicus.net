Alright, I'm heading off to college in August... I'm either gonna go for Computer Science OR Graphic Design... but I'm unsure of which.<br><br>I wish to learn how to code different computer languages however I do not know much yet (Besides YAML and XML ofc). I wanna script different things and learn how to develop many things so's I can get a lot of mooooneeey! Computer Science is pretty much different careers rolled up into one, I can literally do and develop so much...<br><br><br><br>I'm self-teaching myself how to paint... and I'm steadily making progress. However, I believe that I'd do much more if I pursued a college degree in Graphic Design. The pic below is unfinished but i'm coloring in Grayscale, this is experimental.<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/plWEQ5t.png" title="Image: http://i.imgur.com/plWEQ5t.png"><br>And I wish to move on to the 3D domain soon enough to make animation and Video Game Assets.<br><br>Which one should I go for? I will NOT spend 8 years in college... I've already suffered through 13 years of school... I do not wish for 8 more xD

wow, they are really good :D the first one kinda has very long legs xD In my opinion, graphic design sounds much more interesting to pursue.

I'm using&nbsp;<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.w3schools.com/</a>&nbsp;to learn different languages in my spare time, currently revising HTML.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn">https://www.codecademy.com/learn</a>&nbsp;is also a great website. That's just for website design, other languages for coding programs etc. can be learnt in many different ways. The thing I love so much about coding is the endless possibilities and once you know it the only limit is your imagination.

I think you should go for Graphic Design!<br><br>My neighbour works in that career, and most graphic design work environments are supposedly really decent.

@bazookalokigh: Yeah, it definitely does seem more interesting... I need to do more research...<br>Also, I'm glad that you like the pic, I'm experimenting with Grayscaling right now. I'm getting the hang of Ambient Occlusion here ;)<br><br>@Auratixx: Well, thanks for the links Aura! I'll look into both websites whenever I have the time! And I'm glad to have some feedback from a guy learning to code themselves. Thanks man :)<br><br>@Hoops: I see, thanks for the example man. I'll look into doing this more, then hopefully I can work for some company such as Blizzard or Rockstar - <b>YEET</b> - Nah, I'm gonna be solo and work in the comfort of my home.<br><br>Yah. I'll do that. Perhaps you can interrogate your neighbor some more for me? Hmmm, Hoops? :)

I understand what you're saying but I find interest in BOTH.<br><br>I want to find ways to do both, and I found that there are websites like these from Auratixx.<br><br>This isn't meant to spur attention or anything, I'm just genuinely confused and worried. I don't want to make a mistake that will effect me 15 years down the line - 20 years.&nbsp;<br><br>So sue me for wanting to prevent that :/

If you don't like Math you won't like computer science. It's a lot of maths, and pretty intense maths at that. Plus lots of theory and concepts.

Meh, I like computers. And I used to like Math until I met my Geometry Teacher in 11th grade who couldn't teach even if his life depended on it...

There's a lot of proofing and stuff. And I'm not so sure about geometry, but there's a lot of set theory and all kinds of purer mathematics. You've gotta grow to like the stuff to the point where you're comfortable doing it.

Understandable, I'll have to see what I'm getting myself into when I go to college... hopefully I'm not in over my own head xD

Honestly, you do you.<br><br>Which one are you more interested in? What career do you wish to pursue. Do you find yourself as a graphic designer or in computer science in the future? After 10 years of this work, which one will you still enjoy and not get bored of?

Well you see, finding a job opening for Graphic Design, but If you're good at it and do really well it will be easier to find a job.<br><br>But It would be way easier to get a job in the Computer Science field.<br><br>Hope you make the right choice :)

It's much better to work in an industry that you love doing, not for the money (because at the end of the day the more dedicated you are the more $$ you'll receive) compared to a job where you're just in it for the money; it'll get boring real quick.

I don't know a lot about it, but I have some experience in studying programming from the zero level. And it is pretty hard, it is not these XML and YML, it is programming. That means, you have to know math very well (equations, polynomials, integrals, differentials...)<br>About design I know even less than you. You have to draw awesome arts, have sence of space, forms and colors. Design isn't only pictures of something material. It may be abstract and surrealistic.<br>To go to college you should have some kind of basis knowledges of the subject, you'll choose. But all this is nothing, if you aren't ready to work hard, like a horse, day and night and day.<br>Finally, how to choose? Flip a coin. Yes, I'm serious. When it will be in the air, your brain (frontal lobe) will tell you, which you wish most.&nbsp;<br>P.S. I wasn't hilarious. Never.

Thanks for the suggestion guys, I think I may know what I want to do...<br><br>Now that this has been answered... Can a staff member lock the topic or something?
