I've had my Logitech M185 (Some cheap non gaming mouse lol) for roughly a year and 3 months, it was fine until yesterday. I suddenly felt a massive change in my sensitivity. I was used to 100% but it suddenly felt like hyper speed I didn't know what was going on. I keep changing my sensitivity and I feel that different sensitivity's feel right at different times. I don't even know if this is possible but I figured the mouse must be auto changing it's DPI. Like I said before I don't know if this is the case but can someone help me change it back/ find the real problem xd.

Its not possible for some mice to change its DPI unless you have actual drivers that came with the mouse. So ever you had to change something, a software on your OS changed it or you had to rage so much you broke the mouse changing hardware configurations inside it.

Vsplesk that comment does not help and its off topic its just you wanting to show off, zedther and brian's comments are similar only asking for sympathy. Crusty it depends on if your mouse has a driver/macros or a DPI changers button. If it has a driver/macros then load it up and check your settings. If it has a button then check its not jammed or broken. If it is then you may need to get a new mouse, if it isn't then i don't think i can help you.
