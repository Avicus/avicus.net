<span>Today the icon at the bottom right of the screen told me there was no Internet connection available. When I troubleshot it, it suggested using the Ethernet cord to connect. The Ethernet cord connects fine, and the internet connection becomes available, but I'm still unable to use the Wifi.<br></span><br><span>This is an issue with my laptop, because all the other devices in my house are able to connect to the Wifi, and the modem is showing all the appropriate lights and such. I've tried turning it off and on again, but alas, this once that method has failed :/ I've also tried resetting the modem, and it made no difference.<br></span><br>Earlier today, I updated Windows 8, but when it started back up, a black screen would appear, and my PC wouldn't start correctly after multiple resets. Eventually, I refreshed my PC (Refreshing removes some apps) and it started fine, but this happened. I was able to connect to Wi-fi before the update. I'm not sure if I deleted something essential during the refresh, I really don't know.<br><br>I use Windows 8, and my PC has no Wi-Fi switch on it.

Just a thought... maybe you're missing a driver for your wireless card?
