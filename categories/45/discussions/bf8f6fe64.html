Well I guess I was banned. 2 years of my life wasted now because I'll never be able to see any of you again because I see no point in being on the forums if I'm banned. At least this opens up new time so I can actually do stuff helpful and meaningful. Thanks for being my friends &lt;3<br><br>NOTE: Apologies to Refuse

Dammmit Jojo ;-; I guess it's time for a paragraph of writing....<br><br>Jojo, you were really fun to talk to and hang out with. From the craziness, to the dramatic moments, to the laughs we shared there's absolutely no way I'll forget about you. You were one of my best friends on Avicus and it was so fun and crazy meeting you, and I hate to see you go but things happen and things change. I've known you for a couple months and there is absolutely no way I'll forget about you (even if I tried.. Trust me). Maybe one day we'll see you again? I hope we do cause I'm gonna miss seeing you on, chat with me on Skype sometime :) Or Snapchat me :D! It hurts me to say good bye to such a good friend, but I know I have to in this situation. Good bye Jojo and I wish you luck in wherever you may go... I also wish the new people that you'll meet good luck, they're gonna have to adjust to your craziness xD&nbsp;<br><span><br>Best wishes,<br>Jess</span>

Damn. I really want to write a long paragraph, but no one knows me. I have not tried to go on skype or teamspeak or anything, I have not tried to contact anybody, and it's been over a year. Way over a year. I have not made friends and yet this server has probably been my favourite ever, and the community is awesome. It was always fun to stalk around here, seeing people troll around, seeing people, y'know, stuff. It's terrible to see you go. I've seen avicus "fall", experience famous people leaving and see some come back, and I've not made friends. It's really sad to see you go. <br><br>*poof*
