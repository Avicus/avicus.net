A tournament doesn't take 6 months to plan. I planned my unofficial tournaments in less than a week. Also, I don't think that a walls tournament will be successful.

Tazz is probably busy with the current league at the moment. And dude, I personally think that walls wouldn't be &nbsp;the best as it is quite unpopular these days.

I can't name a specific person but definitely someone who can plan well and is experienced with walls. It's better to put walls into an unofficial tournament event (like it is at the moment) rather than an official tournament event.

I could probably help you but I think it would be better to do a walls tournament after league is over. It's a long time to wait but there would be no interest in one right now.
