Ok, so I saw 99250 did "[Discussion #1]" and it really was good, so I'm gonna continue it seeing it died out.<br><br>So, there will be one of these every week. I will look for fun debatable topics etc.. or you can just reply to this thread with one :).<br><br>So this week's topic will be: What if Avicus and OCN merged?<br><br>So I'm gonna guess a lot of you have seen KohiLion, so what are your thoughts on if Avicus and OCN merged?<br><br>This would be great, because both servers could gain stuff from one another, because Avicus has things OCN is good at, and OCN has things Avicus is good at. You put that together you got a really good competitive server.<br><br>Opinions? <br><br>*Note, I will Archive this post if a flame war happens, or a mod will lock it :)

I think its a bit useless, both servers have the same resources. Unless the people.

Like DaFrozen said the servers are so diferentes in a lot of aspect. So if they merge i think that it isnt a good idea.

I doubt that would be a good idea. Maybe it's because I'm from OCN myself, but I feel like OCN would play the dominating role if both servers were to merge. Meaning basically it would be normal OCN, but with a few more players, new maps, and possibly more staff. AVN would loose all that makes it AVN. All the unique aspects

It wouldn't be a good idea and it certainly wouldn't change anything, it may even make things worse.

There would be a lot of conflicts, and not just with the community.<br>Both servers have a lot of different views and ways of doing things, the merged staff team would implode.<br><br>It'll be a complete mess.

Well I actually had a few of these discussions planed just forgot to post them. Was going to post one next week lol.&nbsp;<br><br>As for Overcast and Avicus merging it wouldn't happen. Funky seems more than capable of funding Avicus for a while longer, while OCN owners aren't that active (that I know of). And the benefits would be so minimal that it wouldn't be worth the work.

Just look at both servers chat when Badlion and Kohi announced the merge... it was literally a third world war.
