I just meant that making threads to link other threads and making a thread with only a link and nothing to explain it was getting on my nerve, that's all.

Yes, Alex has been posting single thread lately regarding to his videos. What Tyn meant was that Alex should create a Video Hub under "Community Creations" and post all his videos there.

Imo it is <b>really annoying</b> when you post over ten threads about your yt and when you spam posts <b>everytime</b> you don't know what to upload, when you think of uploading a video, when you are about to upload your video, when your video is uploading and when your video is done. Yes, I think you are annoying, but then again, I guess you need the attention when it's all about the yt-rank ;)

You fail to realize I do it all on <b>ONE&nbsp;</b>thread, that is all I was talking about here. So there is no need for you to spread hate in this community and no it isn't all about that "yt rank" I do it because of the support from this community. But then there are people like you who just hate on everything... why? Do you get enjoyment out if it? What is the point?<br><br>Think about what your typing before you do it ...

I would be fine with your views but you are the most rudest human being I have met in this community. Please stop, I only update the main ones now. I made all the others before someone suggested to make a video hub, that's what I was trying to do here but you blew it out of proportion.<br><br>Thanks for making the end of my day miserable :(

So you're just calling him a hypocrite? Because you could've just saved me 30 seconds of my day by including that rather than 2 entire posts. I wouldn't say that I disagree at all (however Tynvale has a video hub now for all his videos, most of those examples look slightly outdated).&nbsp;And honestly, if you don't like him, you can always keep that to yourself. Just say what you want to say without insulting anyone :P<br><br><a href="http://gyazo.com/c04d0d1ac8dbab16604a127631869340" title="Link: http://gyazo.com/c04d0d1ac8dbab16604a127631869340">http://gyazo.com/c04d0d1ac8dbab16604a127631869340</a><br>Just in case you decide to edit your thread.

This is the first time I posted about a <b><i><u>VIDEO<br></u></i></b>The other posts about my YT channel is actually about my Team on Avicus. Look At Nitwit Core And It Explains Why, Or Look In The Looking For Members Section of Forums it also explains why.<br><b><i><u><br>The Team Is Linked To My Channel.</u></i></b>

Off Topic: I never understood the need to have multiple posts for your series, correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe there is something wonderful Youtube has called a playlist that you can link in a single post without being extremely disorganized...
