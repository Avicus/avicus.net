I'm not making this to start lots of hate and people&nbsp;<u><b>making stuff up</b>&nbsp;</u> because I have got my suspicions what happened just wanted to know for sure also why is nebula down sorry for being a pain asking but this also saves other discussions about this topic ! Thanks . <br><br>We think it was a <b>DDOS attack on Avicus</b> due to the website is hosted by the same host and the server so that why the message showed up when you tried reloading the website ! <b>Please correct me if I'm wrong !<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Nebula is BACK up !<br><br>It was said <u>NOT</u> to be a DDOS attack !</b>
