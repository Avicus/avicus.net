Wot? Why do you make such a post?<br>The staff team posts a official poll/survey once in a while where you can say what you think about the staffteam and what can be improved.<br>And tbh strawpoll isn't very official and it doesn't look that great.<br>The poll structure is kind of messy. You wrote "The staff team are" in every option to choose.&nbsp;<br>Maybe you ask a sr Mod+ when the next survey/poll is.

Sorry just people told me to make it about 10 people to find out about it because they had some issues so they told me to make this to find out if its just them that think that and what do other thing I do prologize if anyone didnt like it or got offended.&nbsp;<br>Also the options there are to pick were sent to me via skype to put on there the only one I added was the one which says the staff team are good and have room for improvement!

I like the idea of this topic, but as resepignev said, we normally have an official survey that requires written responses. The problem with strawpoll is that you can't write exactly what can improve, which makes it harder for the staff to benefit and learn from the results.

No, I don't think you should remove it.<br>It's a good community poll just to help the staff improve on, which I appreciate the fact that you made this

I agree with none of these. I think it's damn near impossible to describe how the staff team works in 1 sentence.

I agree with more than one of those, so maybe a written response would be better.

Well, it's not the best, but it does give the staff atleast a general idea of the community thoughts, so it can still be helpful, albeit not quite as good as a formal one with written responses. I say keep it.

It interests me what some people vote on. Most people who have Minecraft are not spending every minute they have on it. I'm sure most people here have lives and do other things than MC. For example, sometimes I go on vacations for a day or two, but just cause I don't get on doesn't mean I'm "inactive." I'm not saying the staff is perfect, though, I'm just saying some people tend to go overboard when a staff member doesn't come to answer their report in the next 5 seconds.

You can't really say that's impossible, although people are publicized to their own opinion(s), anything is possible here. Not having hope for something, if you actually care, wouldn't help.

I (unfortuanately) put "Infraction Thirsty" because of ONLY the new batch of mods. They are being too strict, and I understand, but I've gotten infractions for 100% jokes, and I've even said it was a joke, and got the infraction after.<br><br>Maybe a bit less roboticitity?

Is that a word? Roboticitity? xD<br>Aside from that, I agree with people here, but the strawpoll was nice to get a general kind of idea of what people think.
