Now I don't wanna dart anything too big. No flame please. Let's act like mature children. Just try and hide it please.&nbsp;<br><br>I want to ask one question:<br><br>Do you think that it's a stereotype to say Overcast players are based gods and that Avicus players suck at PvP? Do you think it's true?<br><br>I hear this a lot from both Avicus and Overcast players. I just wanted you guys take on it.<br><br>Sorry for any flame, I just wanna help settle this a bit.

I can guarantee you this is a very small percent of OCN players.<br><span><br>I would agree with the statement that the majority of Avicus players are not as good as the majority of OCN players.<br><span>&nbsp;<br>Although I do believe that there are some&nbsp;Avicus players that can&nbsp;hold their own against&nbsp;Overcast players. &nbsp;</span></span>

Avicus was once able to compete against Overcast in terms of player count... But, I gotta admit their average player base is much more better than our's.<br><br>Personnally, I didnt have any troubles killing them.&nbsp;<br><br>One thing to mention: Avicus Ping: 19ms &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; OCN Ping: 45ms<br><br>It made a slight difference in terms of NCP problems when fighting

I am a below average OCN player and i am not based god sadly :(. I really suck at pvp but in Avicus, they think i am pretty good. In OCN, i am a total scrub.&nbsp;<br><br>Back on topic- Ya, i gotta admit. From my experience, average OCN players are better than Avicus. (no h8 please. just my experience) but i do not think Avicus people are weaker than OCN people. I think of them as equals. I have seen avicus players like D00zie and gonzo that are boss at pvp.

Guys I am from OCN, let me answer this question, people who are bad at Avicus usually don't go up against average OCN, but OCN loves rushers and because of that most and a majority of them suck at PVP, I know this from experience I have been on that old server for quite some time.

. OCN does not love rushers. You know, people that usually rush are there just to play the game. Your basically saying that "playing the game" is bad. To stop "rushing" it is just simple defending. and also, OCN does not love rushers. Who ever said that?

You can't know that over a few games on OCN. You would need to play a lot of games and a lot of different gamemodes to accurately tell. And imo, The avg OCN player is better than the avg Avicus player.

Since OCN has a larger community/ player rate, they are naturally going to have better players, then, since Avicus is smaller it will have less. Also the perks of being on a larger server is that you face a lot more pvp styles than a smaller server. This doesn't mean that you can't have an elite smaller server. It's chances of "good" to "bad" player ratio will probably be smaller.<br><br><br><br>

That is not true. Servers with more players tend to be usually worse due to having a better chance of vsing bad pvpers. Bad pvpers = no inproovment

From the looks of this topic most people are saying that the Average OCN player is better, saying that OCN has a bigger player base then us. we have "less" players to choose from for our average therefor our average would be lower.&nbsp;

No if we have a bigger player base we have a better chance to have more bad players therefore lowering our average playerbase skill.

Well not exactly, the ratio between good and bad will either be very high or very low, I feel like the ratio between OCN's good players and bad players is higher because the good players have stuck with OCN for a while and have seen diversity in pvp skills, I.E. strafing block hitting comboing jitter strafing, because if you have more diversity in something the more likely you are going to be able to grasp it and he more knowledge.&nbsp;

Well, today, as most of us know, OCN was hacked and was shut down. In the absence of OCN, hundreds of regulars scrambled to Avicus for their daily dose of PvP. Playing today, I noticed the regulars and I also noticed the steady dropping of my KDR which was 4.2 this morning. These two events may well be connected, does this say something about Avicus and OCN players?

I am both an OCN and Avicus Veteran. I play on both servers equally. But here's what I got to say: OCN has a large variety of maps with a large diversity of gamemodes.<br><br>Plus a very high player count. These contribute to a higher chance of good as well as bad players.<br><br>Avicore on the other hand, has a lower variety of gamemodes and complete mistrust of TNT (Disappointed) plus smaller maps and player count. This, unfortunately, makes Avicore have a lower chance of elite pvpers and a higher chance of garbo pvpers. Plus, lets not forget that ping and hardware contribute to these equations as well.

Having been on OCN for over 2 years, I honestly say that the overall level of PvP has gone down a bit. I'm not the best at PvP but I can hold my own on either server. Plus there are so many different aspects of PvP, its hard to tell who's better at PvP. For example, on OCNs destroy and nostalgia servers, we have some of if not the best cannoners in the game, while Avicus(as far as I've seen doesnt have any cannoning maps). I think it would be pretty even other than that.

OCN does not "love rushing." There is that aspect of the OCN records for rushes on different maps, which is always fun to try and beat, but the majority of OCN is not rush-happy. No one defends on Avicus (that's hyperbole, people rarely defend*). There's no need. There's a 20 block void gap to the monument. Defending is sitting at a bridge with a bow. Avicus maps get rushed too, I commonly see people breaking 2-4 monuments without dying once.<br>Your comment on a multitude of OCN players sucking at PVP? Well... Your stats show otherwise.<br>At the time of writing:<br>OCN Stats:<br>Kills: 9509<br>Deaths: 3545<br>K/D: 2.282 (3DP)<br>Avicus Stats:<br>Kills: 1201<br>Deaths: 312<br>K/D: 3.849 (3DP)<br>Granted, you have spent more time on OCN, but your K/D ratio shows that you did not get as many kills on OCN players as you did on Avicus players and your K/D dropped by ~1.6, a very large number for K/D drop between two servers. Either your gameplay style changes drastically between the servers, or Avicus players are easier to beat than OCN players. The latter seems more realistic to me.<br>I do agree with D00ZiE though. Average OCN players are better than average Avicus players. I don't know many good Avicus players, but I would think there's some Avicus players who would still manage to survive against OCN's best.<br>

I have played on OCN a bit and they don't "love rushing" as some have said. Anyways on avicore I always rush and there are many like me who always goes for the monuments and get them almost every game. This significantly lowers some peoples K/DR and lowers the quality of our PvP. Also OCN have different game modes to us, so they use different PvP styles on different maps making it hard to properly compare pvp.<br>

Thank you Zedther for providing your helpful and unique insigh on the topic at hand -_-<br><br>But honestly I don't believe that PvP K/D is a good reflection of the level of play for each server. I go on TeamSpeak pretty constantly and a lot of the time whenever we catch somebody combat loging they are from OCN. Now I'm not saying that ALL OCN players combat log, I'm just saying that there is that level of play that all OCN players feel like they have to live up to (this leads to combat logging to achieve a good K/D).<br><br>

IMO it seems to be harder to get kills on OCN unless you cannon farm 24/7.<br>Average Overcast Regular is usually older than the Average Avicus Regular, meaning we deal with more stuff IRL usually.<br>Not to mention how much playing time you guys have already.<br>
