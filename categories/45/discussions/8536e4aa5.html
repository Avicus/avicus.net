&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Every Man For Himself<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Chapter 1&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Death. This is the fate of most prisoners in the Avicus Network. We are all put into crazy arenas filled with traps. There are 2 different challenges. Red Alert and Minotaur. In Red Alert, we the prisoners are trapped in a multi-leveled arena where we run non-stop. If we stop, we fall into a place called the Void where we slowly crumble into tiny pieces. In Minotaur, we all have a race to the end of an arena filled with death traps. That's not all. The King of our world, IvyStudios, chases us with an iron hammer named "The Rekker." If he catches up to us, our limbs are cut to pieces and we are eaten by pigs. This is my first time being here in prison but others have been here tons of times. But the thing is, I didn't break a rule. I was framed.<br><br><br><br>hey guys, this is just a pilot. If you would like more, please tell me. Out.
