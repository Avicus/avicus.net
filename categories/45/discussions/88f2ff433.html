I was looking around at other servers this morning, and see that OCN has about 5 times more players than Avicus, but has about the same game types, same messages during the match and would most certainly be the sister network, so I was thinking why do they have so many more players on and off peak.<br><br>I would like to see Avicus back in the 1000 player avg during peak and 500ish off peak... So any thoughts as to what they are doing or what we could do?

Most of the OCN players are spanish kids from 8-12 years fanboys of a lot of Youtubers. So they have a lot of players because of Youtubers :T

Avicus copied most from OCN. Although, I think avicus redid those things better.

We copied most of our stuff from OCN but improved those ideas into fun and enjoyable gamemodes.

I love it how you get permbanned for flyhacking, haven't even been on mumble, and have only 2 days of playtime and haven't made a single forum post and you assume that.<br>Yeah, your credibility= A+.<br>The OCN community is real nice. I say I'm from avicus a billion times and frankly, everyone doesn't discriminate, or I should say THEY DON'T CARE.

The OCN community are full of jerks, trust me. The mapdevs ignore most of the maps coming their way, some mods are real arses and automatically assume you're doing what the accuser said.&nbsp;<br><br>The only reason they have more peeps is because of their adaptable coding and more unique maps. They have mob disguises now! Mob disguises in their XML! They have TNT as well!<br><br>That's why they have more.&nbsp;<br><br>I'm trying to bring TNT to make Avicus funner and more experienced with TNT tactics.
