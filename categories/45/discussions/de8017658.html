Well, firstly I want to say thank you to a lot of people - you know who you are.<br>I am leaving because I feel that I am getting too competitive - to the extent that nothing is fun anymore. I joined about 6 or 7 months ago, and back then I had a lot of fun. Now when I play all I can think about is "Fastbridge, Skybridge, strats, PVP.<br>I might pop on every once in a while and you never know, I might come back but for now I am leaving minecraft as a whole and good luck. Good bye

<span>I share the same sentiment and opinions as you, at first you play because you enjoy it but it goes to </span>a limit where you feel it ain't what it used to be. <br><br>Goodbye my friend :)

<i>"I am leaving because I feel that I am getting too competitive"</i>Not the best reason to leave, but competitive players tend to get mad [Not all] when they do not win.Hope you come back and play on the Server once in awhile!

Being too competitive isn't good for you.&nbsp; You become angry at a video game and curse the world.&nbsp; We just need to support him at the moment.

I know I play competitive tennis (if you see some of the kids I play against, you must be mentally tough).&nbsp; But, if you are getting too competitive and getting angry at a <i>video game, </i>that isn't healthy.&nbsp; I don't agree that leaving because you are getting too competitive, but taking a break is a better idea.&nbsp; But it his his choice and we need to support that.

I am trying to go pro in tennis.&nbsp; If you are planning to go pro in something, you need to spend 10,000 hours on it and be competitive.&nbsp; But if you are doing something for fun, what is the point of getting too competitive.&nbsp; That is where you draw the line.
