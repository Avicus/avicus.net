What if the last movie, film, or series you watched became true?<br>Would you survive? How screwed would you be? Would it be a happy or a bad ending?<br><br>I watched Attack on Titan last, so... uh...

I watched Non Stop today. If I was a random passenger, I would probably survive, but if I was the main character then I would probably be killed because I don't have pro melee fighting skillz irl xD
