Our two year old cat is called Snowy, she suffered a serious injury to her back legs<br><br>Our cat only has one options. The best option is to give surgery to her legs, this costs £2,000 to do so. We do not have that money around, therefore, if we can't do it we will need to put her down.&nbsp;<br><br>We love our cat, she is two years old, we don't want her to be gone for our lives.&nbsp;<br><br>Please, donate and save my cats life, for my family, she means the world to us.<br><br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youcaring.com/pet-expenses/we-need-money-for-a-surgery-to-save-my-cat-s-leg-and-life/237667">http://www.youcaring.com/pet-expenses/we-need-money-for-a-surgery-to-save-my-cat-s-leg-and-life/2376...</a>

Yes doctors have a soul however they don't want to have 2k taken out their salary which is understandable, in the UK if it was a person then you wouldn't have to pay but i am almost sure that anywhere in the world you have to pay for vetinary services.

Step 1: Add more information, people want to see an emotional bond they can relate with. Tell people more about the injury and what it will cost your cat and your family.<br><br>Step 2: Carry on spreading the word; post it anywhere you can and get help from popular friends.<br><br>Step 3: Save the cat and reward those who helped you.
