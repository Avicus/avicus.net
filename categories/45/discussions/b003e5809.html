This is an idea that I have seen on other servers like hypixel or whatever. So Idk if people actually get targeted or anything because there a youtuber why not add the youtuber rank I'm so they could disguise themself with /Nick or So they won't get targeted as much.<br><br>Idk if this would work but tell me your thoughts

There's already a Youtuber/VIP rank that exists on the server. You just haven't seen anyone with the tag.

This rank already exists, except it is labelled as "YouTuber" and "VIP". I may bring it up in the senior staff meeting however about lowering the subscriber count, so there's more encouragement for posting videos.

Seriously? Just ditch media and ditch youtuber. There's no one advertising avicus commercially so the labeling is just attention seeking.

Nobody but very few have the ranks, I don't understand how someone having it is "attention seeking". I don't know what message you're trying to convey, however we aren't going to ditch advertisement ranks yet. We need to at least have some room for discussion before jumping to conclusions.

I'm not saying you should just remove it because I'm saying you should. When did I say that? I've put forward my argument serveral times. Ditch the ranks. I mean the worst one is 'tournament medalist.' I mean, what the hell? Its like avicus has completely ditched its professionalism.
