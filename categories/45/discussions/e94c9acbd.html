ScreenSharing on Public

</h1>
<b>edit- unbanned.&nbsp;</b>Hey, so I was recently banned for reduced kb, which was a false ban because I honestly play legit and someone just took a 54 second recording of me with low ms, not taking a lot of knockback. Basically, the only thing I'd like to bring up is screensharing. Hear me out when I say that an enormous part of the pvp community are HCF players, and on that gamemode all staff are required to at least know the basics of screensharing. Now, I know that the owners don't like the idea of ss'ing because I assume privacy is a big factor. My response to that is TOO BAD. If you refuse to screenshare on HCF you're fucking banned m8. <br><br>However, I think the server will seriously thrive if we just implement some basic screensharing. It's not even that difficult, because if one staff member acquires knowledge (which is not even that difficult to learn) of it then they can make an instruction manual and share it with the other staff. <b>Also, one thing I must add is that if staff lock this thread, that honestly proves they are scared to advance their server.<br><br></b>Literally a bunch of people using autoclickers or vape could be reading this thread right now and no one could stop them. I hate to say it but fuck it I'm banned: literally anyone could be staff on Avicus. JUST BE RESPONSIBLE AND UR HIRED KIDS. We need a barrier between what makes staff who they are and what makes the players feel like they aren't pvping against a cheater all the time. Anyways, this is probably not going to convince staff at all but it's worth a shot lmao. Maybe I'll get unbanned, but honestly there's no way to prove I'm legit than just telling you and being honest.<br><br><u>also i really don't expect anyone to read that whole thing, but if u did then ur a minecraft gang member</u>

Screensharing... been brought up so many times and it's not implemented for public matches (competitive matches, tournaments, players can be ss'd). I understand, trust me I do, but I honestly understand the Owners reasons as to why we shouldn't do it.<br><br>I like the idea of screensharing, however I dont feel it will "advance the server". It's not something that is going to make the network 3x better. You have to keep in mind that now a days, anyone could be cheating, even the WORST players. Plus, the 'basics' of screensharing will not get you anywhere. Some players have been cheating for years and have not been caught on other servers, so why would they get caught here if we only know the basics?<br><br>I get what you're trying to say, however I don't think it will get implemented for the public side. But, who knows, maybe the owners will change their mind.

Add public screen sharing its really not to hard to get the mods to learn, plus people say that to many people get ban a day to screen share them all but most of obvious people own up to hacking as they couldn't care less about the server, but as many people say its been brought up loads so i don't see why this thread will help but good luck!

obviously i don't want screensharing after people close their minecraft xD, that defeats the purpose. however, i just think it could be added because <u>not everyone has a self destruct and most clients these days are obvious as hell and are in the versions/mods folder.</u>

One thing I never understood is how the fuck does it invade privacy<br>people that know what they're doing when ssing, get to the minecraft folder through the in game functionality of going into the resource pack folder in the resource pack menu. That eliminates any need of a process from opening a desktop and having to type the app data thing. I'm quite certain that people don't keep their credit card number or download porn to their minecraft folder, so I don't see how it's a problem or invades privacy in any way

Don't think majority of the people that bring up screensharing actually know how to do it. There are only a few 'good' people at screensharing, and that is Vykz, and ItzTekk Both of which, have been doing it for years and have &nbsp;client developers working with their server owners to find clients a lot easier. Everyone believes that screensharing is something easy, it's really not. Players that have cheated for a while actually know how to get away from these 'basic' screenshares. It is something that would take to much time, and there are only 1-2 people on the staff team that know how to screenshare, which I believe are Spoookeh and Myself.&nbsp;<br><br>We're not being ignorant or 'in the same dumb position', we're being logical. It makes more sense to have screenshares happen on the competitive side more then public side. Yes, players do closet cheat on public, however players also want to win a tournament. So, they will cheat to do so. It's like going for a Citadel or EOTW cap, you try to find new ways of cheating the system, whether it's freezing your mc, cobwebbing yourself or even using anti-kb. You will do ANYTHING to win.

LFT i'm sorry but you're wrong. There are not only a few good screensharers. Basically all staff on Arcane, PotPvP, MineHQ, Ultra, ThePark, Velt, PvPLounge, Valux, etc know how to screen share well because there are manuals on how to find different clients that people like Vykz create and share with the other staff. Also, Vykz and Tekk are pretty good but not the best at ss'ing. I'd say the best screensharers are Phrasing and Tene. Also, some people don't have a team and can't get on one, so pub is their only way to play avic and so it means just &nbsp;as much to them as a tourney would mean to tourney players. Therefore, they cheat.

Not really. Vykzz is the only one on the MineHQ staff team that can actually screenshare. I've been screenshares numerous amounts of times on MineHQ and the only one who actually knows what they're doing is Vykzz. They've had to bring in Phrasing several times.&nbsp;<br><br>I dont care about who is who is the best screensharer anyways, I was using it as an example to prove it's not as easy as you're making it out to be. I've played HCF for 4 years and have been staff on several servers, including Badlion and Kohi.Even with that experience, I still don't know how to find a lot of things.

We can probably skid Cheatsmasher or get it and then catch dem pesky closet cheaters with it,<br>yeah, theres alot of closet cheaters around, and I believe we should screenshare, I dont think we should do it in like Public, but rather in Scrims and Official Tournaments.

Although I don't cheat, I can see how Shadow was doing his job even if I am a legit player. He's a chill guy if you actually get to exchange words with him. As for your ban, that was just you being stupid so don't blame it on him because any staff member would have banned you.

Don't think majority of the people that bring up screensharing actually know how to do it. There are only a few 'good' people at screensharing, and that is Vykz, and ItzTekk Both of which, have been doing it for years and have &nbsp;client developers working with their server owners to find clients a lot easier. Everyone believes that screensharing is something easy, it's really not. Players that have cheated for a while actually know how to get away from these 'basic' screenshares. It is something that would take to much time, and there are only 1-2 people on the staff team that know how to screenshare, which I believe are Spoookeh and Myself.&nbsp;<br><br>We're not being ignorant or 'in the same dumb position', we're being logical. It makes more sense to have screenshares happen on the competitive side more then public side. Yes, players do closet cheat on public, however players also want to win a tournament. So, they will cheat to do so. It's like going for a Citadel or EOTW cap, you try to find new ways of cheating the system, whether it's freezing your mc, cobwebbing yourself or even using anti-kb. You will do ANYTHING to win.

Not a mod anymore, but this is pretty much the basis for not allowing screensharing:<br><br>When screensharing is requested, the suspect is given a choice; either submit to SSing, or be banned from the server. In forcing the suspect to engage in something they are willing to do, they are acting under duress, something which is classified as a crime under US law. In forcing someone to give consent for their privacy to be invaded (be it minor or major as the case may be), the one carrying out the screensharing is violating the law and therefore is subject to criminal charges should they be caught or reported.<br><br>Now, you may be wondering why anyone would bother reporting such a minor violation (if you view it as minor). Regardless of how minor or major the violation, doing so is a crime, and can still be punished, be it by a fine or disciplinary action.<br><br>It's been a while since I left the team and the server as a whole so I'm not sure exactly how accurate my interpretation of this is, but I think this is more or less the gist of it.

I agree, no one has been called in for the Vape (ily Zuiy) and filed charges and also a screensharer has never been charged. If it hasn't happened on enormous servers such as MineHQ, Arcane, Velt, etc, I don't see why a comparably smaller server like Avicus can't implement such a thing.

Ok here's my view on this:<br><br>Its pointless to teach all the mods how to screenshare because there are many other good ways to find out if a person is hacking. Mods are trained to ban hackers after getting enough evidence, which means that if you think someone is hacking, just gather evidence, which is a much more harmless way of banning someone. It takes too long to screenshare and if someone has to go, does that mean they will be banned? Languages. During one of the tournaments, different languages came into play which means that it would take longer, or the player being screenshared would not understand what is going on, which is stressful, and unproductive. The aftereffect. Lets say, someone gets screenshared, and they didn't have anything showing them having hacks. They could easily leak the way the screenshare takes place, and could joke about it with other players, making the public screensharing look like an unprofessional joke. Not many screenshares would even take place. Who would we actually screenshare? Avicus regulars? I have never found the need or want the power to screenshare in public, as players who are reported are either blatant or Avicus regulars. In the rare occurance that someone was suspicious but mods couldn't get enough evidence (which is unlikely), then screenshares would be helpful, but I doubt mods have ever faced this. In general, screenshares aren't easy to do, and would take practice, and lots of retraining, which we don't have time for. It's much better for mods to just gather evidence, so that it's easier in appeals and to discuss with other moderators.&nbsp;<br><br>Ok thats enough ranting for now

I have never found the need or want the power to screenshare in public, as players who are reported are either blatant or Avicus regulars. In the rare occurance that someone was suspicious but mods couldn't get enough evidence (which is unlikely), then screenshares would be helpful, but I doubt mods have ever faced this. In general, screenshares aren't easy to do, and would take practice, and lots of retraining, which we don't have time for. It's much better for mods to just gather evidence, so that it's easier in appeals and to discuss with other moderators.&nbsp;<br><br>Ok thats enough ranting for now

If we punished for debating points, you'd be banned by now. You're fine to argue your points, although there isn't much of a point.

Minecraft is a pvp machine. Please stop. Stopping will result in an immediate stop. Stop now. By the words of george washington: "Grab them by the hand, i don't even eat cereal" he died on march 4th 1944 when nazi germany built and fabricated jake paul's insane dabbing technique, and according to scientific research.
