Anaconda is a honorable mention for me, there was a lot worse garbage out there, in the honorable mentions it's low; the highest being We Dem Boyz, No Flex Zone, Jealous, and Rude.<br><br><b><i><u></u></i><u><b>We Dem Boyz<br></b></u><b></b><b></b></b>Lyrics are just terrible and that's all I got to say. The whole song is a disgrace. Also I can see that you are boys and very f*cking loud. Screw off.<br><b><i></i><u><b>No Flex Zone</b></u><b></b></b><br>If you do not like We Dem Boyz there is no way on hell you like this.<br><b><u><b>Jealous</b></u><b></b><br></b>What the hell do you get Jealous about? She's a woman? This lyrics in this song are a jumbled up mess, by no means does it make sense.<br><i>"You're too sexy beautiful and everybody wants a taste, that's why"<br></i>Umm...DO&nbsp; YOU EVEN KNOW THE MEANING OF JEALOUSY<br><b></b><i>"You're the only one invited, I said there's no one else for you, cause you know when I get excited(yeah). When you get jealous too."</i><br>You lustful, envious, son a bitch. Yeah the song title matches. You.....wait....she's getting jealous too?<br>HOW THE LIVING F*CK DOES THAT WORK.<br><b><i><u></u></i><u><b>Rude</b></u></b><br>You are the rude one, mister. When somebody says no, they say no. You're a damn hypocrite.

Eh. i'm not much of a huge music fan.<br><br>But.....<br><br>If I could say the most popular song at my school this year it would be: Fancy, By Iggy Azalea. If i could say the most un popular song, it would be Anaconda. Anaconda is first off stupid, and the music is just repetitive non-sense that no one really wants to hear. Plus the whole message is really inappropriate! Honestly though My favorite songs that I listen to are all from the album "songs of innocence" by U2. They are currently my #1 band group!
