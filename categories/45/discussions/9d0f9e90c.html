There's been multiple times when servers steal from Avicus.<br><br>The best way to deal with spam advertisements like these is to simply ignore it, they advertise because they want your attention, and when tons of us go onto there, it only gets them attention.<br><br>If something like this happens again, just ignore it.

<i><b></b></i>No it was just that I happened to be in a Map where TNT was usable and people were spamming it. Lagging and tping everywhere they thought I had Anti Knock back. On here I had my mouse issue where my screen would just rotate my character looking up in circles or simply walking straight without pressing any buttons. I'm still banned and no one has given any hints, notes or feedback. It's like they're ignoring me.<i></i>
