Why are people leaving?

I'm not trying to be a bitch or anything but it's sad to see people go like so MANY people have gone this year and I know why either due to lack of interest, busy at school, can't be bothered etc. But it makes me sad because Avicus has had so many good people go and like I don't know where Avicus will be...<br><br>If anything, I'm probably worried about what will happen to Avicus seeing as basically everyone(not literally) are going. I guess I'm sad :(<br>I love this server too much but it's ironic due to my infractions xD. I guess I've just stuck around since mid 2013 and I don't want people to leave :/

They are leaving because every god damn person on avicus is 1-20 years old and have to move on from a block game. Other reasons are leaving because its affecting school and their grades.

This is probably the case for most people, but in my case, I'd LOVE to come on here more often than I do, but school just started (like Rilo mentioned) and I definitely don't want to be as... negligent as I've been in previous years. That, and I recently downloaded another game that I'm having WAY too much fun with :P

You have to move on y'know. Everyone will eventually get bored of the game. Others reasons can be due &nbsp;to IRL things.

I just got bored of DTM, The same people, and No one played CTH like all the time (my favorite game mode). Plus Zegita, Your point about school makes a big impact on life.. I do so much outside stuff.. I can never be on the server anymore anyways. Don't worry though, good people leave, and more come back in. At least that's what i've experienced :).

I understand I mean I'm in my final year at secondary school but you see I've had minecraft for 4 years so that's basically since Year 7(Grade 6), and I have experienced good and bad things on servers etc and I have had probably a great time just playing Minecraft - but obviously I do other things outside of school Minecraft is just a hobby, and the amount of people that I've met is ridiculous. My dad always says to me you have to life with life son, it's just the way it is and although it can make me sad in a way it is the truth and sometimes the truth hurts but you have to accept it.<br><br>Anyway before I go onto a sob story, sr mods if you are reading this, I know you're trying your best with the server but you have to show it to us, make a change!

Because of how repetitive Minecraft is in general, maybe it was more entertaining back in the days of survival servers but minigame servers like Avicus and OCN can definitely get more repetitive easier, especially now that there's significantly less players on.<br><br>Even moderating is repetitive, it may seem cool to hold a staff position and be able to ban hackers, but it gets annoying easily.&nbsp;It's no wonder why most staff who pass their junior mod trial don't even last more than 3 months, it's too much, and the impending risk of fucking up and getting demoted is also a factor.&nbsp;<br><br>Sorry, but Avicus is doomed and there's nothing we or the staff team can do about it, maybe we lasted longer than TNT's thread said a while ago (Spring 2015) but no matter who our admins are or how many developers we have it doesn't matter. When the omega update came out earlier this year I thought it would save Avicus, simply because of how good of an update it was, I thought the quality of the server went way up. But did our player count increase? No, it went down, and is still falling. It's been a good run guys, but I doubt we'll still be here by the time this school year ends in May.

I remember Avicus in 2013. One of the server's best years, in my opinion.<br><br>While I agree with a lot of the things that NolanDalton said, I don't think it's the game that gets boring. When I started playing Minecraft a few years back, I played almost every day. But as I got older, I began to realise that Minecraft just didn't interest me anymore.<br><br>It's not the game that's boring, it's the perception of the player that makes it seem boring.

Maybe it's because...uhm... BLOCK LAG. If I'd have one wish for Avicus, it'd be fix block lag.

^ tbh we can go around diagnosing the reason for the drop as being due to: staff, the tournament, the community. If we're honest with ourselves, the game-play OCN provides is much better due to a competitive environment, better maps, less lag, better hit detection and less bugs. The simple answer is most commonly the right one, people don't find the server or the games fun anymore.
