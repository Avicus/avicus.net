In my opinion I say PC is better, better keyboard and mouse and going on there is more easier.

PC is better, Mac mice and keyboards are horrible IMO. Also Macs cost a lot more than they a worth (if you are going to use it for gaming anyways).

I prefer Macs.&nbsp; I am using a Razor Deathaddar (Mouse) and a Razor Deathstalker (keyboard), so I don't use the Mac keyboards or mice.&nbsp; I wouldn't trade my Mac for a PC any day.&nbsp; But it is all about what feels comfortable and which you prefer.

Mouse+Keyboard= ~121.&nbsp; However, I didn't get them all at once.&nbsp; And I am getting about 120fps.&nbsp; My Mac is over 3 years old, so I don't know if that is a factor or not.

Way too overkill and a bad build in general. I'll post a build in a minute that will fit your needs and allow a little leeway if you want to do anything more intensive in the future.

For minecraft and most games, it should be enough, if not, then $30 in the future will double it to 8gb.

Aight, maybe looks cleaner for my case, but Im still not sure about 4GB of Memory, I mean 8GB isnt too expensive, + If he starts to render + recording etc. The CPU &amp; Ram will be upgraded, but not saying your &nbsp;build is bad, but maybe instead of upgrading your build, just buy an OP one already?

Why do that if there's also the equal possibility that you won't need the powerful features in the future?<br><br>4gb if fine for the purposes he has and more intensive ones. If he does need to use more, he can upgrade to 8, but if he doesn't need more, then he will have wasted $30 for no reason.

I'm on an iMac 21.5", 8gb ram, and I prefer it over PC. I get an average of 200-250fps on Minecraft, and if you use a gaming mouse instead of the Apple Magic Mouse, you shouldn't have a problem. I wouldn't recommend a MacBook Air though, mainly because of how annoying loud the fan is.

Honestly, it depends on how you're planning to use your computer. When I first got my MacBook Pro I didn't intend to use it to play games. But it works pretty well, and it's a laptop so I'm able to bring it with me :) But if you intend on using it for gaming, I have to say PC.

You can always get a refurbished one for a few hundred dollars off. To me, it's definitely worth the full price though, since I use a lot of the features bundled with Mac.

Ok. I've used both PC's and macs. PCs offer heaps more freedom and accessibility. The're generally more programs available for pc. Also, PCs are a breeze to fix if something goes wrong. Whereas macs have to be taken to a specialist. Also, Macs typically experience less problems. PCs also get more viruses than Macs, however they can be cleaned out pretty easy. If you want to game a lot, you definately don't want a mac. They are useless for games compared to pcs. A pc will also Cost a lot lesS and can be made very powerful. Pcs are east to upgrade too! My $350 pc runs minecraft at 80-150 fps. If you plan to do work and document stuff, choose a mac. For games, go with a pc.<br>As for pc parts. with your budget, go for a powerful Intel i5 (i5 4660 or better), they are pretty &nbsp;powerful. Or amd cpu. Intel is more reliable though.<br>Graphics card wise, take AT LEAST a nvidia gtx 460 or higher. Our an AMD equivalent. If you can go for a gtx 660 or 760.<br>And as for ram. You want at least 8gb. and &nbsp;play minecraft with at least 4gb of ram. Hope this helps!

From my own experience, i would prefer PC and heres why<br><br>First and foremost, PC would be cheaper to build depending on cost. You oculd build a cheaper PC that can perform the same quality as a MAC but a mac is usually "overpriced"<br><br>Also, there are more software available to PC so you could get some useful software as well. OF course, Apple does have good high end software such as final cut pro but there is more software availble to PC than Mac's in general. I would not really want to game on a MAC because im not really used to it and its to complicated for others such as my self (up to you of course). Some games aren't available on MAC but most games are typically available to PC. Also, Mac is not really built for gaming but more of like in a workstation<br><br>About the viresus thing. Mac's can STILL get viruses. It's just that there are fewer viruses on a MAC because there is like a system to protect it and people don't really make viruses for MAC. PC on the other hand tends to get viruses but hey, just get a free AVG anti virus software or something. IT would take care of it.<br><br>Finally, the most #1 reason why i think you should get or build (prefer building) a PC is because you can easily upgrade it cheaper. Think about it: if your upgrading a MAC, you would basically have to buy another $1000+ computer. On the other hand, you can switch your video card, processor, etc.. and upgrade for a much cheaper cost. And if you decide to upgrade your PC, you dont have to by another one but just replace some of the parts which is cheaper. The main disadvantage of Mac's imo is the fact you cannot really upgrade MAC parts because its hard and Apple simply wont let you do it cuz its a closed platform. You cannot really customize a Mac. (unless&nbsp; know how to upgrade Mac parts)<br><br>If your PC is broken, easy to fix. Get a new part and bam and i think its free compared taking a mac to a specialist (idk about it but pls tell me if im wrong). I would not want to go to a repair guy fixing my mac. too much of a hassle.<br><br>Mac to most people is user friendly to some people and its operating system looks better than windows. I gotta admit that but i find it harder to game on a mac than a pc (seriously, Ctrl +left click for right click?!?!)<br><br>Probably the main disadvantages to PC is you would have to upgrade at times and the building part. Building the PC is not really that hard but the hardest part is setting up the cables and wires and making sure you dont screw everything up.<br><br>So ya i would prefer PC but Mac's are good as well for gaming but some games/software may not be compatible with Mac and Mac is not really for professinal gaming. Your decsion is up to your personal preference but building a PC can be cheaper doe ;)

1) Cant fit a GTX 970 into it.. The only GPU that can handle a 4K display (And a 980) Excluding the Titan Series... and 4K Display will become a thing faster than you think<br><br>2) Omg.. the 5K retina desiplay, Integrated graphics sucks for that...<br>3) I could keep going but my faith is lost with people who think macs are good...

PC is definitely the better choice. Especially a custom built one, like mine.

Coming from a guy with R9 290X Crossfire (which demolishes the GTX 980)<br>4K is a lot harder to push than you think it is. A single 980 wouldn't be enough to max out 4K games. My R9 290X Crossfire rig is the bare minimum, and it's pretty much the best you can get right now.

I've played on a MAC, and unless you minimize the screen size (as in do not use fullscreen) whilst playing Minecraft, it lags.<br>Get a PC, there is a lot more customization you can do to one.
