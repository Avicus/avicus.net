Hello, I don't really know where to start; however, this is a thread where I'd like to address the mistakes that I've committed in the last few days. I've possibly been guilty of bringing toxicity towards the community and being a total dickhead to some individuals in this community. I'd like to dearly apologise to the people that I've affected. I don't know where this sudden change of attitude and personality has come from, but I didn't notice it until now. I've been getting T R I G G E R E D quite easily lately and unable to control it; therefore, leading to me releasing unwanted toxicity to certain people. Although I've been toxic, there are a few people who have been dicks and trying to provoke me in to gain a reaction; however, this is not the point nor do I care. This is a thread for me to personally apologise to those whom have been affected and hope they accept my apology with open arms. I won't be posting any replies on this thread because I am sure there some people who don't accept the apology and wish to argue back, but I would like to stay away from that. Thank you and hopefully you accept my apology.

An apology post is not always a fix, once people see changes in your actions they will start to accept you.<br>

If that is true, that is a fair point. He really didn't put all the blame on that fact. I won't defend him past that though, but that is out of his control.

Even though he can't do anything about it, he should think that he is the one who is making the apologize post.<br>But good POV though.

He is making the apology post though ^.^ If you read it, I'm 99.9% sure that you can see that. Also, he's stating a fact that people try to provoke him, nothing is wrong with that.

Even though you haven't been rude to me, I would accept as I believe in the quote "Forgive and eventually forget."
