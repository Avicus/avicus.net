so i've getting into mashups and remixes of songs and i thought it would be cool to try it out myself, obviously it's shit since it's my first one but i would like your feedback on the song and what you think would make it better or should do in the future.&nbsp;<br><br><br><b>The Remix:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dquVxxth1t4" title="Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dquVxxth1t4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dquVxxth1t4</a></b>

What DAW do you use?&nbsp;<br><br>You got some problems with the tempos of the two tracks which makes it sound off. If you wanna blend two tracks you need to start with having the two tracks around the same tempo for a start then thing about the key signature of the tracks. This might help:<a href="https://www.bpmdatabase.com">https://www.bpmdatabase.com</a>&nbsp; .&nbsp;<br><br>Remix is a very broad spectrum but from what i can hear you just layered vocals from one track to the instrumental of another which is a good start but doesn't really have much interest. Remixes usually have a structure, but the most important part of a remix is the melody line in the drop for example:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5EW6b8nVD8" title="Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5EW6b8nVD8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5EW6b8nVD8</a>&nbsp; at 1:08. &nbsp;I'm not sure if you have studied music theory but having a look at some of the melody writing and the theory behind writing a strong melody line might help with that.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.oscarvandillen.com/outline_of_basic_music_theory/" title="Link: http://www.oscarvandillen.com/outline_of_basic_music_theory/">http://www.oscarvandillen.com/outline_of_basic_music_theory/</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; understanding the basic music theory will help but is essential before you study music technology. <br><br>There are hella a lot more you could do with a remix like basic&nbsp;side chain compression or noise gating for example which is easy when you learn it&nbsp;and will make your tracks sound better. You should try experiment with some of the plug ins on your DAW for a start.&nbsp;This might help:<a href="http://www.musictech.net" title="Link: http://www.musictech.net">http://www.musictech.net</a>&nbsp; . I studied music tech for a while so i know a fair amount specifically the theory behind EDM&nbsp;and i don't mind helping.&nbsp;<br><br>From Nemo LOL JKS

I'm sure it's good but I have no idea why people appreciate remixes when all of them are far worse than the original song.

in some cases the remix doesn't have the spark the original song had but here is an example of in my opinion a remix being better than the original<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwnVI_x5g0I" rel="nofollow" title="Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwnVI_x5g0I">Original</a><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1yXfKy7cU0" rel="nofollow">Remix</a>

Would give a ton of feedback on this, but i'm too sick to really do so. Yes, i've been producing music for 3 years and i would love to listen but right now I can't.
