Hey guys! It's been almost a year, but I am going back to Cuba!!! For another two weeks :)&nbsp;<br>I will be leaving April 5th and will be leaving Cuba April 20th!<br>For those of you wondering what I will be doing with videos on my channel. I will be pre-uploading them and having them automatically go public on certain dates so you guys don't miss me!<br>It&nbsp;<b>is</b> the same resort as last year.<br>Here is an overview of the resort through a vid.&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aphNq4NEKkU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aphNq4NEKkU</a><br>&nbsp;<br>Last year I promised vlogs too, but there were reasons why I didn't upload them/stopped:<br><ul><li>Horrible Quality</li></ul>The quality of my phone was terrible. I recently got a new phone (Galaxy Core LTE) which records 720p instead of 240p, hence it is much better quality.<br><ul><li>Not organized</li></ul>I recorded so much I did not know which vids were for which date. With my new phone there is a feature where it organizes the dates of what was recorded/taken a picture of it.<br><ul><li>Boring</li></ul>I realised after the first vlog I posted on youtube that it was boring. Nothing exciting happened in like the first week.&nbsp;<br>This is where this thread comes in. I want your ideas of what to do vlogs about what I should get on tape. This can mean challenges, sports to play, e.t.c.<br>Thanks for the help guys! :)<br><br>Here is the review of my phone (me and a friend made it):<br><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-r1Q1PdwpU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-r1Q1PdwpU</a><br>Have a nice day! :)

I'd definitely like to see some type of activities, such as:<br><ul><li>Ping pong / Sports</li><li>Snorkeling (There are some <b>very </b>cheap underwater cameras which you can purchase from pretty much any store)</li><li>Build a sand castle and show us! (If you're bored!)</li><li>Anything that would make us laugh. :)</li></ul>Have fun in Cuba Vlad!

I'll have you know me and his ghost go freestyle at the dallas house of blues every saturday night during the summer, so that's only partially true.
