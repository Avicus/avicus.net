Hey!<br><br>Have you ever had a horrible/embarrassing autocorrect mistake happen? Well, share it down below! This is like avicus quotes in a way, but for funny mistakes that happened. I'll start off.<br><br>I was messaging someone one day, and while I was typing I meant to say "Kk", but it autocorrected to say KKK. So the text went like "KKK will see you there".&nbsp;<br><br>I hope lots of you respond!

You don't know how to fix that? Do you have any siblings? If so they probably created a shortcut so when you say "ok" it switches it to that
