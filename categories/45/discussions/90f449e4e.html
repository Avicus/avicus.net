Hey Guys,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;I would just like to clear something up with you. I may have told you guys I am a girl. This is false. The only reason I did this was to protect my identity. I am actually a boy in real life. I just wanted to clear things up with you just so you know what is real.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; I also may have told you I was 15 or something. This is also false. Again, trying to protect my identity. If you would like to know my real age just ask me on Avicus.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; I will probably change my skin, but for now, I'll leave it how it is. I hope you guys aren't to upset with me. Although J wouldn't see why you should be upset with me. Anyways, just wanted to clear that up with you.<br>Regards, Jason

I don't see anything wrong with hiding your true self over the internet. People have done this time and time again, yet we don't mind - anyone, guy or girl, old or young, can be helpful to any community, especially Avicus.<br><br>As long as you're you, that's all that matters.

People may not have thought that Jason was "her" name. Perhaps "she" shared the account with someone named Jason.
