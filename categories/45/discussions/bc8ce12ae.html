This is the custom RP I use in normal gameplay and in all my videos.

To be completely honest, this texture pack is just faithful with custom fire and particles :/ However, the things that are edited still look good :)

Well it's low fire, different particles, nicer water, lava and day and night sky. So basically it's a Custom faithful for PvP with general look improvements.

Lol just changing 5 things in a pack doesn't make it yours, you say you've invented a lot of things that you really haven't *cough* *cough* Zig Zag strafe *cough* *cough*. Also the things you've changed aren't your own, they're from other packs.

A) I made an edit on a combo mixed with zigzag strafing, and you know that.<br><br>B) I said it was a faithful edit and never that I owned faithful.&nbsp;<br><br>You also said you could probably no-pot me a short while back and you kinda lost the next 1v1...not that it determines anything. You tend to go overboard with statements as well.

Anyways sorry and thanks for shoutout. By the way the no pot thing was just a joke and I even said it was also I won 8-2 today but that shouldn't count because we were both failing with pots today.

Well I never tried to claim it as my own and others have made that mistake before, so no blame. I probs didn't explain well enough. Anyways, I'm not getting into anything.&nbsp;<br><br>It's k and I felt that you did a fair bit and that It wouldn't be fair to leave you out :P
