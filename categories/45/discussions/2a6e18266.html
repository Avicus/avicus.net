How does the LeaderBoard work?

I was taking a look around the all time LeaderBoard around the rankings that I am. I noticed that a player that was one rank ahead of me had stats that were, let's say "Less desirable than mine". I was wondering how the LeaderBoards actually work. <br><br>However let me stop those of you about to say "LeaderBoard ranks don't mean anything", I know this already I just like competition and would like a legitimate answer from someone who would actually like to help me.<br><br>Thank you in advance!

I think the Leaderboards are based off the total xp you have in all games. So if you have 1st prestige in Nebula and Nexus, that would be the same as 2nd prestige in Nebula or something.

I thought the LeaderBoards would be based off of k/d's... But that's just me...

There's a leaderboard for EXP (default,) kills, KD, etc.<br>But yeah, it's bugged right now and it doesn't seem to be updating.

In my opinion, having the default leaderboard based of kd would be pretty dumb since it would just have the people joining, farming kd and never play again. Like 100kd
