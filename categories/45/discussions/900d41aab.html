I have a Mac too, and the built-in Internal microphone doesn't work. I bought a headset with a microphone.<br>Your earpods should work as they do have a mic, I believe...

If it looks like this&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.google.ca/search?q=apple+earphones+with+a+mic&amp;es_sm=122&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gA7pU7_kJsqLyASEh4DYBA&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=643">https://www.google.ca/search?q=apple+earphones+with+a+mic&amp;es_sm=122&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gA7...</a>&nbsp;it has a mic in it, but idk for apple but for windows you either have to have it connected into your mic slot and have different earphones or plug it into your earphone slot and have it as earphones, but on apple and android (not sure for blackberry) it will work as both.

If you have the earphones that vlad showed it should work as a mic. What you should do is click on preferences for Teamspeak and then go to output. You should see a bar showing what your current mic is. Fiddle with what mic you are using and it should work fine. (I have used apple earphones for TS while on a Mac before) Sorry if this isn't too helpful I haven't used TS in a while. :3

Internal mics don't seam to work with team speak. Your better of using a external mic. Now ear pods, try not to use them first; see if you use only your speakers and the sound is coming out then yay its not the software. If sound isn't coming out well that means it is the software.<br><br>1. --&gt; Sound is coming out = use headphone or a head set.<br><br>2. --&gt; Sound isn't coming out = try re installing ts or drivers for your sound card.&nbsp;<br><br>Good luck m8. :3
