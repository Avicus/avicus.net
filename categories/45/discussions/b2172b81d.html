I'm not 100% positive where to make this thread so I'm putting it on "Off Topic"<br><br>This is a small suggestion having to do with kills and credits, as I've played Avicus throughout the years, pvping has always been fun, however trying to get a kill and then having it stolen by someone isn't very fun :( so here's my small suggestion... Also, I dont know if this has been suggested or talked about before so please let me know if it's been said.<br><br><u><b>Suggestion: Add " kill assists"</b></u><br><br>I'm sure it's self explanatory but here's a quick run down<br><br><blockquote style="margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;">Whenever you hit a player, but aren't the one that kills them, there should be an "Assist", so you, and anyone else that helped kill the player can get (half?) credits for helping kill the enemy.&nbsp;</blockquote><br><blockquote style="margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;">Also, If you hit a player but after a certain amount of time (s)he doesn't die, the assist goes away so you don't get credits for helping to kill them, that way no one taps every single enemy and just waits for other people to kill them.<br><br>I'm not sure what else to say about it, it's pretty simple to understand, this just helps even out fights and stuff IMO...<br><br>PS, Maybe the assists don't affect K/D stats??<br><br></blockquote>Let me know what you guys think, opinions are welcomed!!!!!!!!

It could work, if they made it so you get like 1 credit when you deal 33% or less of the damage done, or you get 2 credits for dealing 34%-66% of the damage done. This could help with killstealing and leeching off of people :p

Awesome suggestion!

Keeping track of time and damage tags to this extent would probably be a bit stressful and complicated...

It has been suggested before and it is quite an awesome proposal but it will unlikely happen. It would cause too much stress on the server. Just imagine tracking every single hit on the server, and the many different players - especially with the different conditions (see Zintenka's post)

I suppose right now isn't the best time to add something like this, I really didn't pay much attention to the math and coding it would take, however it's still a suggestion and something I'd love to see on the server, :)

But it can be done though and can potentially increase credit income as well as distribute it fairly.<br><br>Many games do this to avoid kill thieves. .

It's easy to understand the percentages and the math is up to the developers, my friend.<br><br>EDIT: In response to your other comment, there's no reason to be sarcastic when no one here is fighting. I'm not gonna take a bite of your bait so you better pack up and go home before you get eaten by a shark.

</div>
Yeah I understand that it helps distribute credits fairly, but as much as I want it (and I do want to have assists), I think it's simply not worth the effort to implement a system to fix fair distribution that should, theoretically, fix itself as more and more kills are made
