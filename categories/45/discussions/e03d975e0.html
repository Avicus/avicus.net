As a personal thing from me to you; I really would appreciate it if you guys would stop unconstructively stating +1 as a reputation point or something since it is not proper feedback nor contributing to the post; showing support can be done in other ways than a simple +1 and it's useless. If someone posts a map, don't post +1 for like 3 pages, post feedback or don't post at all. If there's a good idea, add onto it.<br><br>This goes for -1 as well.

We need a like button and people showing support in other ways for the "+1's" on the forums, as well as people providing constructive criticism for the "-1's".

to me, saying +1 is feedback because you're showing that you like the idea of something and that's better than saying nothing at all<br>but for -1's i think that people should elaborate on why we think that it deserves a -1 but most people do.<br>it's just showing support to an idea or saying that it needs improvement imo<u></u>

I 100% agree. It can be very annoying when you receive -1 or even +1 without telling us why.

I used to think +1 and -1 were fine but after thinking about it I fully agree.<br>If you're going to comment, make it constructive. If you haven't got anything that contributes to the discussion then don't post anything at all.

Agreed, what the hell can I do with a +1 on my map? What do you like? The structures, the colors or all? They can say +1 cuz the colors, but don't only +1. Same with -1.

Okay sorry, but this was needed ^.^ I personally don't care that much, but if +1 is all I see, then I raise hell, ever so slightly.

Because it's spammy and does not pertain to the original post at all (doing exactly what I tried to reduce); it falls under being annoying and trolling. But no, it's not a rule. I am just clearing up the people who like to spam.

Because what you're doing is essentially harassment.
