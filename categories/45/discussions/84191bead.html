Hey guys, it's Enflaming here, and I have a problem. As some of you know, my steam was hijacked, and steam support sucks, so I don't think I'm getting it back. :/ Soooo... I need your help! I have a plan, where people who play CS:GO can donate a gun skin to someone trustworthy who can then buy CS:GO and gift it to my new account. You don't have to (of course), but extra skins you don't need helps!<br><br>If you can hold the skins, please say so below.&nbsp;<br>And no, this isn't a scam or anything. My account was hijacked somehow, and I need to get CS:GO again.

JJ, if you still have access to the account, I can help you box out the hijacker, and regain control.
