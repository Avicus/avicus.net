<a href="http://pcpartpicker.com/p/cRpLK8" rel="nofollow">http://pcpartpicker.com/p/cRpLK8</a><br><br>This forms very much the basis of your PC, anything else you want to add on, such as the peripherals or the OS for example, are up to you. I wasn't able to add those in the PC build, as your budget is only ~$450.

I don't think it's likely you could run shaders on 100+ fps without a bit more of a budget. Because you'd have to let one part's quality suffer in order to get good enough other parts. You have to get a damn good processor, video card and good enough motherboard that actually can support those components, the RAM is also very improtant. Plus the power supply to meet the increased power usage from the parts, plus the $ if you get a legit version of the OS. And the fan as well...&nbsp;<br><br>You'd need to spend all of the 400-450 on the motherboard, graphics card and processor to get shaders to maybe run at 100+ fps. &nbsp;<br><br>My advice is to save up more. I'd rather wait longer and get what I want and maybe more, than getting it right away and most likely not getting what I want and being stuck with it.&nbsp;<br><br>I'm not saying it's not possible, just unlikely. <br><br>Gl&nbsp;<br><br>Note: cracking OS is painful, but you save SO much on your budget. And try to find good parts on sale, be prepaired to wait a bit.

Wtf are you saying?<br><br><br>"Ram Is important"<br><br>It is, but if you're just playing Minecraft or CS;GO 4GB of Ram ($30) is fine..<br><br>In terms of $400, Its possible to get a PC that runs shaders at 100+ fps.<br>The motherboard doesn't have to be that good, it just needs to have the socket size, that fits the CPU, and GPU slot, and RAM slots. And USB, other&nbsp;peripherals..&nbsp;<br>As far as the case goes, Silence isn't very important because you can just put it on a wood thing or on the floor, away from you so you don't hear it as much.<br><br>Cracking OS is not worth it, if something goes wrong you are dead.<br>just spend $80 its worth it... ffs, I mean an OS is a LARGE piece of code compared to minecraft, or any other programs like Sony Vegas which sells for $600, $80 for something thats going to be used EVERYDAY 24/7, Is worth $80...<br><br>As for a GPU, all you need is 2GB GDDR-5 vRam, and a clock speed higher than 900MHz to run shaders... Nothing much. As for the processor, a Pentium is perfectly fine, or an AMD X4 840K.
