Yes, very much, if I didn't I wouldn't be doing it xD. Like every job it has its challenges but it also has its rewards, so yes sometimes it can be hard but overall it's decent.

Well, ok.&nbsp;<br><br>You're one of the guys I can literally tell anything to without worrying about anyone else knowing. You're a fun guy to be around, and boy o boy do you swamp the cronus chat with memes. I'm pretty sure you were the one that got like half the team into snapchat xD Overall you're a funny guy and certainly a good friend of mine. Your mic and ping is still shit as ever but I can deal with that, I can litterally tell you one of my shit jokes, no matter how shit it is, and you'll laugh your ass off. Your decent at pvp, certainly not as shit as some people say.&nbsp;<br><br>No doing the thing.<br><br>um, the same olace where your leader rank is :&gt;

We're certainly ain't the shit aussies we started out to be. We've grown a lot and I'm happy about them, for me personally a team isn't about winning a final or a tournament, it's about a group of friends collaborating, a small community, which is what Cronus is to me. My future is better than ever. You're a good guy, you help run the team quite a bit and you're pretty good at pvp.

All seriousness, you're a good friend and someone who actually appreciates my work, my memes of course what other work do I do xd. I've known you for quite a while now and you have changed since we first became friends , whether or not that was Apollo or some other reason, but I still think we're very good friends. We meme each other and can still laugh it off and joke around. You make really amazing maps, I'm not saying that for the sake of it, and I sincerely mean it. Someone I can count on and someone I trust, even though I meme the heck out of ya and it might not seem like that at times ;P
