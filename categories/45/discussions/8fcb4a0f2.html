<b><u>lil_greg15</u> (Old main):&nbsp;</b>I came up with lil_greg15 because my irl name is <b>Greg</b>ory, My Birthday is may&nbsp;<b>15</b> and my father has the same name so that makes me a Jr. and that's where&nbsp;<b>lil</b> came from. That's who I came up with lil_greg15.<br><br><b><u>GrapeSmoothie</u> (New main):&nbsp;</b>I really like grape smoothies for some reason and so I thought it would be a cool username and so that's why I changed my main to it. Not that much of a story behind this name.<br><br><b><u>NovemberFlame</u>:&nbsp;</b>Back when I use to build on a server that had creative, the person that owned the plot next to me was named "NovemberPanic", I was a great friend of that person and I didn't have enough time to get their skype before the server shut down forever (2 years ago)and so I order to remember her I named my alt NovemberFlame.&nbsp;<br><br><b><u>OrangeSmoothie</u>:&nbsp;</b>Same story with GrapeSmoothie except I really didn't like my old name for this account (Synq_) and so the second I had the chance to change it I did. I got a few friends to vote on a name and OrangeSmoothie was a runner-up winner and so this is my other alt accounts name. *Cough Cough Blame FrostedCupcakez &amp; Frozen Solstice Cough Cough*<br><br><b><u>Biased:</u></b> Why not this username? its funny af xD<br><br><br><br>So that's the story behind my accounts..... Whats yours?

My friend gave me an account called "mlg_hammy" when I first started playing Minecraft. I no longer have that account, but I wanted to buy an account of my own which was similar to mlg_hammy since I had already started to make YouTube videos using that Minecraft account. So, I figured that "Porky" is similar to "Hammy", and I changed the mlg to MLG because I liked the caps better. :)

When I was six I decided to come up with a character in my head. I decided to come up with a name I thought was catchy and kinda cool. So I mixed up two things: spikes and blades. Which ended up becoming Splade. The numbers are my favourite number(4) in a pattern 4,8,12. I may change this name to something similar without numbers in the future.

From my very old AMA:<br>"How did I get my username? Oh boy, that's a question that I expected but I knew would be a long story. You better be prepared.&nbsp;<br>First things first, I've always loved dairy products such as milk and cheese, and I have no idea why.<br>Now, the story starts when I was randomly searching Kongregate for Multiplayer games. After a while, I found a game titled "Realm of the Mad God." I took a look at it, didn't think much of it, and then stopped.<br>Later, I picked up the game again, and got addicted. At that time, there was a professional guild known as "Mafia" that played this game. They later changed the guild to "Cream."<br>Fast forward a few months, and I started getting bored of the game. My birthday was coming up in a few months, and I had heard of Minecraft being the new "thing," so I decided to get that for my birthday. I decided to come up with a good name. I thought of Cream because of the professional guild and also because of my love of dairy products, but I found out Cream was taken.<br>So, I thought, "what's cream made out of again? Right, milk." So I tried CreamMilk. Didn't work. Finally, I went with MilkCream.<br>And that's the story of my name!"

iBiZa_TwisT is a well known gamer who is the best in the world at a franchise named Uncharted, and he inspired me to play the third instalment of this series, which I played multiplayer on for 18 months straight and flipping loved it (on the ps3) and the only reason I stopped playing it is because I got a PS4 and am now part of a clan on Call of Duty and are part of things in other games, so I had to move on.<br><br>Anyway, I took iBiZa's first name and put Minecraft on the end of it.<br><br>My kills on Uncharted 3 are 22145 for 13698 deaths (bearing in mind it was my first shooting game) which is good, but iBiZa's stats are still going up, and are around 350k for 80k, which is astonishing.

Canuck because&nbsp;<i>when i chose</i> this username i&nbsp;<i>was</i> a Vancouver canucks fan, and thought "canuck" sounded pretty cool. I then had to add something because the username was too short, so I added _pro, in reference to the professional hockey players.&nbsp;<br><br><br>note: Tomorrow canuck_pro will be NO MORE!!

Well, I was a bit young (9 or 10), when I first got MC. I had watched a few videos, and boom, HeroBrine. I capitalized the B because, well, I was 10. I tried a few numbers, then apparently either got mad and randomly hit numbers, or just banged my head against the num pad. xD<br><br>Welp, my name will be no more. &lt;3

Ok So In minecraft, I consider myself a pretty good sniper/marksman. I thought about saying "ShamrockSniper_" But I thought it didn't sound as cool as "spectre." A spectre is basically like sniper or someone whom no one can see killing people. I added "shamrock" in front because I thought a sniper needs to have luck, to have the right precision to take a shot. instead of putting something boring like "Lucky," I associated my name with "shamrock" because I liked how it sounded. So yea! that is pretty much Why I changed my name!! canuck_pro was just too boring..<br><br>In the game guys, please call me: Shamrock, xD thanks &lt;3.

User_1673 was my cracked account generated by Magic Launcher when I wanted to use mods, but because I did not have a legit Minecraft account it randomly generated a user. Which I just realized may be a reason why I say "Magic!" a lot. Also the user name holds many memorable moments as a cracked user from 2012-2013, so I mostly changed for the sentimental value &lt;3

Spartemex: I needed a Terraria name (this is before I had MC), so I combinied my favorite sports ream at the time with the brand of the watch I was wearing, Timex, and you get Spartimex! I thought Spartemex looked cooler, so I went with that. It has stuck ever since! I have no plans of changing it ;)

I guess I should explain my name :p<br>I think it was 2012 when I bought my account, however I had previously played on my brother's account. At that time, there was this popular white girl saying that goes like "I refuse to sink". The quote is often associated with an anchor. It represents that there is some hope to hold on to, and that I won't let obstacles get in my way. Basically, I won't give up no matter how hard it gets.<br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/s9ABG1K.png" title="Image: http://i.imgur.com/s9ABG1K.png">boom.

I've been asked this question so many times, and before you jump to conclusions no it has nothing to do with my real name.I remember back it grade school me and my friends would Get a snack time and I always choose Lance Crackers.As far as the 2000XD goes the 2000 part comes from the fact I love technology and 2000 was a very common thing to find on technology related things,the XD part well thats a story for another chicken...I mean time.
