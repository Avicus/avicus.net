</h1>
This Idea Came From The Mineplex Server.<br><br>So what I mean by personnel player hosting is.<br><br>Anyone with Emerald Rank + can host there own server for anyone from the community to join and play games with them.<br><br>This is not like Scrum servers, this is where you can 24/7 play the games you want to play, since you can't have a scrum server all the time. Idk tell me what you think.

Yes Ik, but it would be a server that is your own little thing that you could have open 24/7

That would cause a lot of lag :/<br><br>On the other hand, this idea inspired me to make a prize suggestion for the next tournament.<br><br>Maybe a 24/7 scrimmage server for the team that wins the next tournament would be cool. They would give the server to the next winner of the next tournament.

Hmm. +0.5 because I like the idea, it would be nice to get such a prize.<br><br>Otherwise, the already "best" team of Avicus would be able to practise 24/7 and will make them more OP. I think if they already won, they don't need it. :D<br><br>EDIT: Now it's +0.8 :) (see replies)

Then hopefully they are really nice people and will donate the server to those who need it. :)

There is still lag which has to be fixed :3<br><br>It doesn't help just upgrading the hardware, you need to fix the lag firszt!1!

Having more servers wouldn't necessarily lag anything at all. They are different servers.&nbsp;<br><br>We could maybe add it to the shop, reserving our rights to revoke it when needed. It's not a bad idea, but it would cost quite a lot for a normal user to afford it I guess. We definitely have more important things to worry about at the moment... again not a bad idea at all, just not very doable right now :)
