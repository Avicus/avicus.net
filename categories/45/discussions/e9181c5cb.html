Welp. Its time, the election is underway. Who do you guys think is gonna win? Also, who would you vote for and why? Personally the green party is the best out of all of them (even though it could be much better) as UKIP blame practically everything on immigration, other parties such a labour promise change and don't always live up to it. Also a whole host of other reasons. <br><br><i>remember, respect other peoples opinions and although a small debate wouldnt be too off topic, dont create massive flame wars<br></i>Without further ado, tell us your ideas!

I'm in Australia but following the UK elections. I'm going for David Cameron and the conservative party.<br><br>I don't know about you but over here the Greens Party is a minor and only get like 2 or 3 seats in a parliament every year and a few senators. So for us, expecting the Greens to win the election is like expecting pigs to fly!

I think the Tories will win and that's good; they're reducing the deficit more than any parties promise and are also tackling many other issues. Labour promise stuff and don't live up to it. Everyone says that UKIP is racist, but I think that they're policies are good; we would save 8.6 billion pounds a year if we leave the European Union which will help with the British debt.<br><br>I don't really want to say who my parents are voting for here, but I <b>would</b> vote for either the conservatives or UKIP.<br><br>You really want Ed Miliband as Prime Minister? Labour will just put this country into more debt than it actually is. Plus the NHS will have to go private at some point anyway because there are too many people using it ATM. Also we had a mock election at school and a load of people voted for the monster raving looney party xD The Conservatives still won though.<br><br><b>EDIT:&nbsp;</b>If labour win I'm leaving this country...
