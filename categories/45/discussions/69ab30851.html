So, today on walls a player was verbally harassing another player and i saw to much of it unfortunately i failed to screenshot it and i'm mad at myself because of it. After that game i decided to take maters into my own hands and i team killed the player that was harassing another player on another map. I now realize what i did was wrong and i apologize for &nbsp;what i did. I will accept any fair punishments. This may sound childish (me apologizing) but i am truly sorry.

Thanks for being honest. Cyberbullying is strictly prohibited on Avicus (and should be on every Minecraft server) so I understand why you did it.

Don't feel bad, it can be frustrating though. Due to my MOD experience on other servers, I can give you a few tips; Don't swear back at them, your stooping to their level. Report it if possible, and sit tight. The MODs are fast on this server.<br><br>~The Snow Queen
