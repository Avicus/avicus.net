When I wasn't very popular in the community, I started out by posting more on the forums. In game, I would greet many people. Over time, many people knew who I was and I became more popular. Also, I highly recommend TeamSpeak. :)

I started to become active on the server once I joined the Avicus Teamspeak! There are some really nice and funny users on there that are always open to meet new people! As well as what Pete said, greet some players in game and be open to having a conversation with players you don't even know, they may end up being good friend of yours! :P

I HIGHLY recommend TeamSpeak! It is a great way to meet new people and find other players that share similar interests with you! I would also try to get on a team, because The Tournament is coming up soon, and anyone who is anyone will join :D

Talk to people on the forums, go into TeamSpeak, and don't break the rules and you will have friends! You can also apply for livestreamer if you can livestream for events! This will be a good way to meet new people!

When I wasn't very popular in the community, I became a developer. &nbsp;Instant friendship points. &nbsp;But seriously, I'd just keep active and you'll gain friends. &nbsp;Don't be an a**hole. &nbsp;That is always helpful.

To Be Popular, You Have To Earn Reputation. Don't Be Like Me, After Gaining My Popularity, It Just Went Poof Because I Broke too Many Rules.
