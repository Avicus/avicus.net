Dear Avicus Members,<br><b><i>This post is in no way trying to start a flame war, offending an individual or targeting a group of people in any way.<br></i></b><br><b></b>What happened?<br><br>Well, i'll first start out by pointing out that I was banned for two years, so I have no idea what happened in that time. I have no idea why, so many people have left Avicus and it seems like the server is dying out? Before in 2013 and 14 the server was so big, I remember at a point we used to have over 600 people on the server, and today.. sometimes it's down to 10 players or even 60 to the most.<br><br>Did Avicus get a downgrade? Did Avicore effect Avicus?&nbsp;<br><br>And here is the part I need you to be considerate and keep an open mind about, how is the server 10x more laggy, many people are making posts about the server sucking (I still love it the way it is). So.. what happened in that time? Today, there's a constant spectator flying over my head. Tomorrow i'll be teleported into the monument? What's happening?<br><br>Please, do not start a flame war or think this comment is meant to offend an individual.<br><br>Thank you for your attention.<br><br>-Zal

If everyone misses the old avicus so much then why don't we request our dev's to revert back? I mean we didn't have the spectator glitches in Avicade and our hub was HUGE. If you miss it so much why don't you ask the dev's?<br><br>Anyone? or is everyone gonna say "Someone else will ask, it doesn't matter"

Dear Solstice,<br><br>Thank you for recommendation, as you mentioned there are millions of posts that just are providing hate, and some that provide constructive criticism. But my question to you is, by asking the public (around 80 players) about what they want on the server, how will that result in anything?&nbsp;<br><br>I agree that you guys are trying to help us but the issue is some recommendations for the server (EG. Bring back prestiges). Those discussions are either declined, ignored or simply just hated.<br><br>I'd like to at least have a fair vote on some recommendations that have been rejected.<br>Please, if you will request the higher admins to allow us to make a voting post, allowing us to vote on what needs to be added and&nbsp;<b>removed.</b><br><br>Warm Regards,<br><br>-Zal

Dear Solstice,<br><br>Thank you for recommendation, as you mentioned there are millions of posts that just are providing hate, and some that provide constructive criticism. But my question to you is, by asking the public (around 80 players) about what they want on the server, how will that result in anything?&nbsp;<br><br>I agree that you guys are trying to help us but the issue is some recommendations for the server (EG. Bring back prestiges). Those discussions are either declined, ignored or simply just hated.<br><br>I'd like to at least have a fair vote on some recommendations that have been rejected.<br>Please, if you will request the higher admins to allow us to make a voting post, allowing us to vote on what needs to be added and&nbsp;<b>removed.</b><br><br>Warm Regards,<br><br>-Zal

I will ask, and hopefully try arrange something regarding voting.<br><br>In response to your "bring back prestiges" point, it has been declined a number of times for quite vague reasons. I fully agree with the fact they need to be brought back.<br><br>Thanks for replying and keeping a great attitude!<br><br>Regards,<br>Frozen

Hello again,<br><br>Thank you for your commitment towards this post, the "bring back prestiges" point was just an example.<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>Zal.

Easy answer, server died.<br>Why? 1 person leaves, 20 people leave with him.<br>But the main reason is because people are getting in love with the more tough pvp servers such as: Kohi, Badlion, MCSG, Hive, and more.<br>And nothing more surprising Hypixel and Mineplex get more than 1500 new people on the server each day.<br>Also, Minecraft is getting boring for alot of people such as me, they moved to other games either console or pc.

Your negativity isn't going to help anything. Maybe if you could elaborate that would be more helpful.

My point being, you know why we have lost players? Look at Hive, look at Hypixel. (not mineplex, it's just squeakers no offence). What are they doing? They have one thing in common. That is being unique. Why did Avicus get up to 600 players? Uniqueness of the server. Nebula was an all new gamemode to me when I first logged on, I was shocked to see the things you could do. So how about take away something like SG with 0 players and put a new gamemode on? Easier said than done huh? But it takes work.<br><br>Abide by Minecraft, you'll get what you want out of the game.

New and unique gamemodes are not easy to implement.<br>And for Hypixel and Hive, they had advertisement. YouTubers play those servers, that's a huge form of advertisement.

So what stops YouTubers from coming here? Ghosts? Spirits? Nothing but uniquivity. &lt;-- not a real word<br>But how did they get their advertisement? They started somewhere for sure.

Please try not to go off topic but if Money is the matter, and no one is coming on, why isn't the server shut? Make it or lose it? true or false?

Avicus needs to add some more game modes and increase advertising. Its mostly the same people (Which is good) and most new people come on and dont really come back online, maybe because of the lack of games. EG: Oh i dont like decay, ill go on a different game mode or map oh wait, there is none running even if there's two they maybe maps they dont like and then they may go on a different server.
