Hello, so after about 2 years, ive decided to quit Avicus, OCN, Subbing for Teams Etc. I just don't find the game as fun anymore and quite frankly I probably spend to much time on it, these are the 2 main reasons ive decided to quit. I know ive been a hassle to the start the team what with me ban evading etc, and I really am sorry for that. For anyone who disliked me I hope that if we ever see eachother&nbsp; on TS or whatever we can start off on a new foot. Id like to just Mention some people before I leave, it might be a lot idk.<br><br>4lextr/Alex: Probably my first friend on TeamSpeak and Avicus in general. You used to find me annoying on TS but after a while we spoke more, did scrims on the same team we became good friends, although you don't come on that much anymore I hope youll still be on TS.<br>You got me into my first OCN team (THX 4 THAT BTW)<br><br>iManMachine, Myv, Unequalz, Nia, xCoco, Tobin: You were most of the only active people on my favourite gamemode, CTH and weve had really good times together on CTH as well as Walls!<br><br>Buster, Crafting theory:&nbsp;Thanks for being rly nice on TS and I hope we can play Overwatch together&nbsp;sometime.<br><br>Pythun/BucketsOfSweat: My best friend on avicus, we have had Hillarious TS calls/rooms and played OCN together a fair bit as well as avicus, Trolling on OCN with u is always a blast and theres never really a dull moment in TS if your in the room lmao.<br><br>Emily: My mother xdd srsly tho your one of the nicest people on avicus and I speak to u quite a lot on teamspeak and its always funny.<br><br>Lokigh: The only person on avicus ive met irl lmao. Ill probably see u irl again someday anyway tho.Your probably the nicest person on avicus TS and it was always fun doing Speed UCHs with you and going on lots of winning streaks. (ps we need to start a snap streak) lol.<br><br>Well that just about wraps its up, in case you Didn't know the new game I play now is overwatch so if u Play feel free to add me ON BattleNet, My user number is 2425 <br>Also if u wanna speak to me on another way other than TS then feel free to add me on snapchat:oscarly_hi (excuse the shitty name)<br><br>Sorry if I missed anyone. But other than that this is an AMA, so, ASK ME ANYTHING! Goodbye..<br>

Good bye, but what's the good in making an AMA if you're leaving? The whole point of an AMA is to get to know th user, and you're a,ready on your way out.

So answer my question, if no higher ups have told you that the thread is not allowed, why not lock it?<br><br>It is your duty to enforce rules no? And locking this thread would be enforcing the rules of no personal updates.<br>And with no higher up telling you otherwise, and that you are following the rules strictly, you should be fine with locking this and every other leaving thread.
