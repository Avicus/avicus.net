Hey guys,<br><br><br>So I'm not sure how many of you people out there have began to think about their childhood memories when getting older.<br><br>Well here's my childhood in a nutshell:<br><br>I used to love Lego; Lego was my life and I would play with it all day, which brings me to TV<br><br>At the age of 7 Disney channel released in South Africa. I was staying in a hotel away from home and I woke up early to see the release. It was more than I had ever imagined. Disney was my childhood, Lilo and Stitch, Loyd in Space, Recess and a lot of others were the magic in my life. The friends I used to play with loved it; memories of my crush also remain in my childhood. I loved Disney for 6 years straight, but suddenly everything changed. (When the fire nation attacked xD)<br><br>I suddenly saw the new TV shows on Disney as boring. &nbsp;Suddenly Lego became less amusing. Suddenly my childhood was gone. All the old TV shows vanished. The magic was gone.<br><br>Are memories sweeter in your head? Is your childhood that great? Or is your childhood never ending?<br><br>I don't know if you guys are reaching this point, but I thought I'd just like to share my thoughts because I know a lot of people also think like this!<br><br><br>Anyways thanks for reading :D<br><br><br>~Tortouse :D<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

I also used to be a cartoon addict. Then I turned 11 and stopped watching TV for a while. All I did after that was video games and soccer.<br><br>Now all I really do is Minecraft, and that's kind of childhood in a sense.<br><br>But most of my childhood was ruined by piles of homework and snotty kids at private schools. I don't ever want to go back to that. Nobody liked me, and nothing has changed :(<br><br>Although Legos were basically my pride and soul. I had enough to fill up a room in the house. Then I stopped. The only problem with Legos is you step on em...

I love lego's to! They were my life. I have a LEgo Star Wars collection. Some of them were the originals &nbsp;and i like toying with them at times. Being a child is so much fun. Less responsibilites and you can be free! As you grow older, more responsibilites show up and your stuck in this confinement wehere you have to make yourselves look good and act cool. I wish i was a child again. :(<i><b> "SO for all of you that are young, stay young and enjoy it while it last"<br><br><br>Pokemon was life too! Gen 1-3 is da best</b></i>
