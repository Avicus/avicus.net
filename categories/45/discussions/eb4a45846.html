Alright so, I don't know why but when I click rapidly to place blocks they don't place like at all. I'm filling up a tunnel and and I'm clicking like a mad man and the blocks just start to disappear. This is SO frustrating and it gets me killed at times when I'm on low health.<br><br>Now let me just say. If this is anti cheat, please remove it. This is not lethal.<br><br>Also on Titans, when I rightclick with bottles I keep getting them back if I rightclick quickly.

Yeah I get the exact same issue when I try to bridge on Nebula. I don't know if it's just me, but the effects seem to be worse when I use glass. It's extremely annoying and has caused numerous deaths.

<h2><b><u>I freaking hate that glitch.</u></b></h2><b><u><br></u></b><u></u>It always occurs at the worst times, like when I'm bridging to the monuments in Senex, or when I speedbridge on Frostbite before the other team starts shooting. A Senex match took 5 times longer than usual because of this glitch. I was playing with sfkwww, and it took him like 10 tries in Castle Adventure because of this glitch. Please remove this anti cheat thing if that's what's causing this. Anti cheat doesnt really help either, I still see players flying around, and it doesn't stop killaura or anti knockback. So what's the point of it?<b><u><br></u></b>
