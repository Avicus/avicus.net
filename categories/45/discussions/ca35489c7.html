What he's saying is that if you want to join a match of Nexus with only 8v8, you can join the side of the wall that has the 8/8 signs. If you want to join a match of Nexus that has 32 players on each team, you can join the side of the wall that has the 32/32 on it. That way people who only like 32/32 or 8/8 can both be happy. If there're already 16 people on an 8/8 wall, you can't join because it would be 9/8.&nbsp;<br>Personally, I think this should be added because it sounds like a really good way to make sure everyone is getting what they want and every loves the idea (:<br>Nice thinking, Boo!

so this would eliminate the ability for donors to join a match that is already full, right? o_o? not that I am complaining, but that would be awesome!
