Ignore them. They feed off of reactions and when you give into them and react, it gives them more gunpowder.

If you are getting bullied through minecraft, a pixel game breaking and placing blocks, quit. If it makes you wanna kill yourself, only way is to quit. :)

I agree. Bullies want a reaction, if you don't react/ignore them, they won't be having any "fun", so they will stop. However, if they get a reaction out of you, they will continue.

Make a change, if they bully you is for your personality, start doing something with your life, socialize in new places (this is probably from school) the best way is meeting people online, feel confident, and then do it IRL until you feel confident too

LOOK ON THE DAMN BRIGHT SIDE!... First off lemme tell ya.. I have been bullied SOO much that i would just want to rape them to pieces!!&nbsp;<br><br>So here is my advise: 1.&nbsp;<b>Lone wolf:&nbsp;</b>If your friends have abandoned you... Just ignore then, and all... they are f*cking retards that dont do sh*t! 2.&nbsp;<b>Retards:&nbsp;</b>Facing a retard-bully is just really hard (Retard: Mean, name calling, Judging religion, and making fun of your weight when hes a 5 year old kid weighing 10000000000000000000000000000 Kilo grams. 3.&nbsp;<b>Attack:&nbsp;</b>No, not hit them or anything, but if they are trying to kill you in that level, just full out <b><i><u><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqntrziKUNA">REK DEM</a></u></i></b>! DO NOT worry about getting kicked out of school, (Dont do dis... actually) just show em your not f*cking with these f*ggots!&nbsp;<b>Tips by: Yoda ~1997 (DO NOT TAKE DIS INTO ACCOUNT AS MOST OF THESE SUGGESTIONS REQUIRE HEAVY DUTY MURDER)&nbsp;</b>But really i hope you can survive, cause i've been and am being bullied, and your not alone, just ignore these mother f*ckers! :)&nbsp;<br><br><b>If you need more support call dis guy: "<a rel="nofollow" href="http://youtu.be/ytSuiaxNIaE?t=16s">MLGPRO QUICKSCOPER</a>"<br>PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE!! NOTE: I am not trying to be mean!! I am wanting to help AND entertain you! So i am SOOO sorry if you took this as an offence :'(</b>
