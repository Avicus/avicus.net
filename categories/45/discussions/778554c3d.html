So i totally didnt get this idea from experience but since avicus doesent use a filter is it necesary to have a /mute as a punishment? I think getting tempbanned is going way to far, because of something someone said. I think we should take away the powers people have when they abuse/break them. for instance, aimbot is game related, where as constant swearing in chat would be more verbal/chat related. If someone is vebally abusive, we should still let them play the (wonderful) game, but just cant talk.

Avicus used to have a chat filter but people bypassed it easily so they got rid of it.<br><br><b>"</b><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><b>is it </b><b>necesary</b><b> to have a /mute as a punishment?</b></span><b>"<br></b>It has been suggested to have one, but the topic gets tossed around from time to time.&nbsp;<br><b><br>"</b><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><b>I think getting </b><b>tempbanned</b><b> is going way to far, because of something someone said</b></span><b>"<br>"</b><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>If someone is </b><b>vebally</b><b> abusive, we should still let them play the (wonderful) game, but just </b><b>cant</b><b> talk.</b></span><b>"<br></b>It really depends on what they said and in what content [don't give an example].

In fewer words... It would just be Overkill... We already have enough ways to punish, so its up to the player to be responsible and appropriate.&nbsp;<br><br>Full version above ^

I've always been in favor of /mute, but if we are being real, the punishment system doesn't have any major flaws. Mute isn't totally needed, although I would prefer to have /mute over kicking someone off the server for chat offenses.

Muting is a terrible idea.<br>Ignoring a problem doesn't solve it.
