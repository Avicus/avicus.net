It is a website where anyone can share their music, and everyone takes turns playing a song of their choice to everyone, on a rotation.

Okay, I'll give you quick rundown.<br><br>You first go here&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://plug.dj/avicus">https://plug.dj/avicus</a>&nbsp;and sign up.<br>Then you join the community, and for the first day or two just sit back and watch how it works. Collect songs by clicking grab. Once you're reading and have good songs, click "join waitlist". Wait for your turn, and your music is playing!
