Hello!<br><br>Ummmm, I need to tell you guys something. I'm leaving avicus network. There are a lot of reasons, but if you want to know all reasons go to my profile, find skype username and add me.<br><br>So firstly, thanks Awesomerp, Jake, sunrise and others for your support. Playing on avicus was awesome and it couldn't be without you guys.<br><br>One of reasons is that players are swearing about me, family, friends,... It hurts me and makes me angry. They're swearing if the staff is online, too. But why can't they just say stop? I dont know what I am doing wrong but they're offending me, like I'm not welcome on avicus. So i decided, to left the server. If any of my friends will miss me, send me skype message and we'll see what we can do.<br><br>So, bye guys, thanks for support, fun,...<br><br>-oORusherProOo (aka tomibizjak123)!

I did change my name, because I didn't know that avicus exists, so I choosed my nickname to be tomibizjak123. I was playing a lot of slovenian servers but then i found this one. Second reason is cuz this nickname was really hard to say for american guys... Except slovenian.

Report them and ignore them. You are letting them win by leaving, show them you don't give a fuck. They can't drive you out. Remember, these people don't know you and your family.

And yes, about walls. I am a little bit bussy with website, php, css, java, c++, c# programming and running my web&amp;virtual servers hosting. I'm sure that we can find time and play together.
