Ok! Listen up. Am I the only one who is confused why sexual and all that shit songs are allowed? This makes the server look so bad when a former staff member is playing the song "I just had sex". Every rule has an explanation for it like hacking isn't allowed because it makes the game unfair. Sooo... Why is it allowed?

It shouldn't be allowed... Just get evidence and report him on the forums.<br>And don't you know that so many former staff become trollers.<br>They have a perfectly good explanation/excuse but the intent is just bad.

This is stupid, What server lets former staff members and other users play racist sexual songs. I tell them not to and they just don't give a shit. If avicus is gonna let this happen we're just gonna destroy the community even more. You don't say stuff in chat "You black nigga" so why play a song that says it? It's equivalent to getting your younger brother online and saying "You black nigga" so you don't get the punishment. Just stop!

Rilo tbh its not even that serious, I listen to "explicit" songs all the time, they say the n word a bunch and I don't mind. &nbsp;Most people on TS are older anyways and I'm sure if they listen to an "offensive" song they don't actually share the same values

It's unfair to kids. Having to hear 14-19 year olds playing sexual songs that they don't need to hear. I stand by my point of that there is not a valid reason for this to be allowed. Don't just say to kids "leave". Maybe they wanna hear appropriate music and not get kicked out for some immature teenager playing stupid songs. As much fun as you may think it is you try looking at it from others perspectives. Why the hell would we want this on our server? It makes the server look like a bunch of immature brats trying to look cool with their "amazing" songs. Imaging if some guy was to come on the ts and go to music room and see everyone singing/playing sexual/racist songs. I wonder what they would think.

This is the internet. If kids are so easily offended, they either need to lighten up or leave. I've heard some mod say something along the lines of "the music room is equivalent to the 18 plus channels".

The community comprises almost entirely people under eighteen years of age; I don't see how this is unfair to "kids". Regardless, nothing about it is "unfair" anyway; by participating in a public music channel in which the participants themselves and their musical preferences determine what gets played, you run the risk of hearing things you don't like or don't want to hear because not everyone shares the same likes and opinions (a general statement that applies to more than this particular situation). In this case, those "things" would be these "inappropriate songs" you're so distressed about — the hearing of which, I feel, is to be expected considering how much of the more popular music in contemporary society is obscene. Because songs like those are so mainstream, my belief is that people who join the music channel and hear this music being played either don't mind it, expect it, or perceive it to be relatively normal (which it is). Personally, I very much dislike most modern music — especially the music you seem to have issues with — but there's nothing I can do about it. Ultimately, as already stated, the rules allow it, and the majority of the community is fine with that.

Literally any other gaming server with a TS will have people playing songs, this literally happens everywhere.

Why do we need to be like every other god damn bloody server. If avicus was different maybe we would attract more players.

I highly doubt that changing one little rule will attract more players. New players rarely come on teamspeak until they are more into the community (=not being new anymore)

Why don't you just leave Avicus if it is so &nbsp;bad? We enjoy our team speak, we don't need you to muck it up.

Stop overreacting... one petty rule — on an extra Avicus service independent from the actual server — doesn't make us any more like any other server, nor will changing the rule in any way, shape, or form affect the amount of players the server does or does not attract.

Avicus uses it's own website engine and it's own plugins and is far different than all of the generic Factions/Towny/SG servers out there. So yeah, I don't think being different is an issue.

if you're offended by songs about sex or songs that have cursing/racism, you can go listen to your nursery rhymes buddy, because just about any new songs these days are explicit. and also&nbsp;<b>@snow</b> racism is perfectly fine in the music room, as there is no rule against it stated so. common sense is not something to be determined by you as you're not exactly qualified to state that. i have been told by senior staff that it is perfectly fine, and frankly they have a bit more power than you.
