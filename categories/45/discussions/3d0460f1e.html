Some of you may have noticed over the last few days i have been inactive this was mostly because of end of year tests.However, i'll be honest i have been getting bored of Minecraft and i have found a new game i love and it is just time for me to move on from one community to another.Basically i will be quitting Minecraft and i will be taking more interest in sport and other games.<br><br>I would like to thank everyone in this community for giving me one of the best years of my life so far, you guys have been amazing and without you i would never be here as long as i have.No matter who you are if we didn't get along or if we were amazing friends, all of you have been part of my amazing experience here.Don't worry i'll still be on skype if you ever wanna talk, even though i imagine most of you will remove me now :C.I may visit Avicus sometimes but not that often, i hope you guys continue to enjoy Avicus but don't forge nothing lasts forever so make here you have a awesome time here!<br><br>"No one notices your hardwork until you stop doing it" ~pizza334<br><br><br>Thank you guys!
