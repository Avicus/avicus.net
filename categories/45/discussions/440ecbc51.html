I think its kinda stupid...&nbsp;<br><br><br>The day before Black Friday, you say "I am so thankful i have ___ and have ____." Yet the next day you go craZ and start barging into stores trying to get what you want. ;p<br><br>What are your opinions?

I like Boxing day Canada version of Black Friday. Black Friday just sell crap I don't need or want.

A) Nobody likes spending thousands of dollars on Christmas presents.<br>B) Good for businesses.Good for people. Win Win.<br>C) Imagine no crowds whatsoever. If there was no crowd in front of the stores and that minority of people didn't die for the minority of people who are batshit insane, would you still have the same opinion on it? You can't prevent people from buying things on sale, it's a silly thought to try and prevent it.

My opinion on Black Friday?<br>I absolutely hate it, not because of the sales, but because of the way people will act just for saving a few dollars.<br>On that day, some people can act like what we're truly classified as: animals.<br><br>Jeez people, calm down, you save $30 on a device, you don't need to rip someone apart.<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFFqUdToBGc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFFqUdToBGc</a><br>A lovely example.

I dislike how people stereotype everyone that goes shopping. I highly doubt you will find anyone that gets into ridiculous fights and stuff like that. It really isn't too common.<br><br>Going out at like 3AM to some store with your friends is a pretty fun experience if you keep in mind that you're doing it to buy gifts for friends &amp; family.<br><br>When you have an expectation to buy people gifts the last thing you want is to pay full price for an already expensive item.

&nbsp;Midnight is right, I did buy a laptop for black friday but I didn't really care if the laptop was sold out. Everyone else was just so crazy to get it. Here, the sale wasn't that well but still people were going crazy for it.
