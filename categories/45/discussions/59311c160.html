<p>I think it's about time that I finally came out, recently I have been really inactive because of school and stuff, most of the time I would come on for 5 minutes a day and so on. I would just like to let all you wombats know, I'm retiring, I havn't been demoted. Hopefully I will be able to come back at a later date, which will be good to see. </p><p>I would like to thank the community, you were the people that made me like my job. Even if you were a hacker that I banned, or just a regular, I liked you all. Thankyou very much.</p><p>I would also like to thank the whole staff team, it was a great time working with you guys, and I hope to be back in it later, keep up the good work &lt;3</p><p>- Harry</p>

I'm going to be honest with you, Harry. I had high expectations for you, however I completely understand your situation and to retire is the right option. I hope you can return, I'll be watching! :P
