I know that these threats are pointless and I think these are spam but I'd like to inform you that I'm leaving for mostly the reason of higher education. I will still play minecraft but on my friends private, hardcore, survival server.&nbsp;<br>If you want to join us search HMCP Enjin. (No links, as for advertisement). Would be fun to maybe see some of the pros do the survival of the game.&nbsp;<br><br>Thank you you to all my friends I will pop in out sometimes but not as often.&nbsp;<br><br>Regards<br>Kamil

I'd raver leave when I'm at the top of my league, like athletes do than if I was that my weakest point. Moreover i miss the survival, new update means new challenges. &nbsp;Your more than welcome if you would want to join me on that journey.
