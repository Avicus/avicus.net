Seriously... it sounds like a robot having a seizure... or two robots having sexual intercourse.&nbsp;<br><br>Its just noise in my opinion. Yes it has a melody. But its noise all the same.<br><br>Too many youtubers use it as an intro. I am going to have a hemorrhage if i hear it again!

I respect all genres, but it's not just Dubstep; a lot of the "wub" and "whirr" noises are in other EDM genres. If you want some EDM like... that's cool, try Nu Disco or Glitch Hop. Get funky!

Many people don't like dubstep - I respect that. There's always some debate over Dubstep vs. Classical, or even Dubstep vs. Anything, once you think about it. Personally I enjoy Dubstep; many people don't realize how technical and intricate most dubstep really is. The placement of kicks, snares, and hi-hats, the sound design and engineering of the electronically produced wobble bass synths, and not to mention the lengthy and often tedious process of mixing and mastering everything. Dubstep is one of the most difficult genres of EDM (and music in general) to produce simply because of how much work must be put into these tracks, and the artists who create great dub step tracks are very talented people and should be respected (excluding a few people *coughskrillexcough*.) And if you think "dub step" is all robotic sex noises and annoying mechanical noises, there are many types of dub step out there - the one you are talking about is most likely "brostep," somewhat of a sub-genre of the original dubstep that developed in the Americas and features heavier, more "electronic" sounding bass drops and synth noises. Things like chill step, melodic dubstep, and even drum step often feature more melodic and soothing synths versus UK dubstep and bro-step. But, if you feel that dubstep is not your music, I cannot change that and I have no intent on changing it. Listen to what you desire, but keep an open mind (and open ears.) It might just change your mind ;)

Well, I prefer classical music for its... intricate confluence, complexity of notes, and the energy it gives me (déjà vu). Once you really start "getting into" classical music, typically by learning an orchestral instrument — the violin, in my case — you start to appreciate it more as you develop and mature in a technical sense and can more clearly "see" behind the notes.<br><br>For instance, when I first started learning how to play the violin, I was playing "notes, not music". Several years later, I can capriciously pick out and analyze a classical piece (such as one of my favorites, <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, by Tchaikovsky)&nbsp;and say to myself, "Wow, this is so cool... the theme in the exposition represents this one character, which later gets restated multiple times in the development. These sonorous minor chords symbolize death. Counterpoint in the low strings here, syncopation in the upper strings there..." And so on.<br><br>As a musical arranger myself, I know from firsthand experience how much effort composers put into their work. It's almost an insult when people say that classical music is "boring" because of, in reality, how excruciatingly difficult it is to create one presentable piece. I've tried getting my friends' opinions on this sonata I reworked (from piano to string orchestra) to see how to improve it, but it's very annoying when none of them want to listen to it because "classical music sucks". Countless hours, practically wasted over the course of countless weeks, and all I hear is ungrateful ignorance.<br><br>In other words, if you think classical music is "plain and straightforward", you're either listening to the wrong kind — I think Baroque compositions (the oldest variety) are boring beyond comprehension, but Romantic pieces (during a period when composers wrote music to volitionally express emotions, not because their despotic leader asked for a song) usually sound heavenly —&nbsp;or not listening to it properly.

I've listened to quite a bit of it, I consider myself an educated and dedicated audiophile and I try not to limit the possibilities of discovering new music, I really can't claim a whole music genre is bad, generalising is bad, I guide myself by artists more than genre, but I honestly can not stand dubstep :P<br><br>I do listen to some things that sound like Dubstep, like Aphex Twin, Working For a Nuclear Free City, Bonobo, Justice and Unforscene, some of them are a mix of Jazz, or Shoe Gaze with Trance and EDM, I saddly &nbsp;haven't found yet one single person in MC that shares my taste in music, I guess I'm too picky.

Ok, thanks for clearing all of that up :3<br>I totally respect your opinions and I think both type's people aren't being very understanding of eachother when they say one is better, they both seem like masterpieces to me.&nbsp;<br>I think the thing for me is I don't really think about the music I listen to. I'm usually doing something and listen to it for some cool, fast-paced and exiting back-ground noise.&nbsp;<br>Both pieces of music take a lot of knowledge, time, and effort to make and I feel like calling one "bad" is ridiculous. I just have a different taste than you, most likely from my siblings/friends even, so I like different types of music from their influence. Or maybe you were rebellious and liked classical music despite your family hating it.&nbsp;<br>Both types of music are amazing, but since the only time I listen to music is when I'm doing something, I'd really like some cool sounding, fast-paced, music that I'm comfortable to listening to due to years of listening to it.&nbsp;<br>Yet another post on this topic that was very well-said!<br>Nice job :3

Many people don't like dubstep - I respect that. There's always some debate over Dubstep vs. Classical, or even Dubstep vs. Anything, once you think about it. Personally I enjoy Dubstep; many people don't realize how technical and intricate most dubstep really is. The placement of kicks, snares, and hi-hats, the sound design and engineering of the electronically produced wobble bass synths, and not to mention the lengthy and often tedious process of mixing and mastering everything. Dubstep is one of the most difficult genres of EDM (and music in general) to produce simply because of how much work must be put into these tracks, and the artists who create great dub step tracks are very talented people and should be respected (excluding a few people *coughskrillexcough*.) And if you think "dub step" is all robotic sex noises and annoying mechanical noises, there are many types of dub step out there - the one you are talking about is most likely "brostep," somewhat of a sub-genre of the original dubstep that developed in the Americas and features heavier, more "electronic" sounding bass drops and synth noises. Things like chill step, melodic dubstep, and even drum step often feature more melodic and soothing synths versus UK dubstep and bro-step. But, if you feel that dubstep is not your music, I cannot change that and I have no intent on changing it. Listen to what you desire, but keep an open mind (and open ears.) It might just change your mind ;)

Thanks. Perhaps i was listening to one genre. I mostly like things with "soul" like R&amp;B or Jazz. And some very cool action music. I havent heard a lot of the music here, like "Trance" or "EDM". Boy, i need to catch up with this century...

Dubstep is only one genre of EDM, try other genres like progressive house or something calmer and less bassy.

I agree with Howsie. &nbsp;House, Progressive House, Nu Disco, maybe even some Electro. &nbsp;Dubstep isn't the only type of EDM, and personally, it's not my favorite at all. &nbsp;Try to expand your horizons, the world of EDM is fun!
