*<b>This is in Off-Topic so don't complain about it not being "Avicus Related Content"</b>*.<br>*<b>Please do not immediately lock, because this is serious for me, and I need opinions, thank you for understanding</b>*.<br>Hello everyone.<br>As most of you know, I have a YouTube channel with just over 325 subscribers.<br>However, I'm not sure if I should continue it, or if I should just leave it alone, and not spend so much time on it.<br>I've been thinking about this for a while, and I'm really not sure what to do anymore.<br>It just seems like I'm not really having as much fun recording videos as I used to a couple of months ago.<br><br>Really, what I need is just some type of series that I can do, and more people to record with who don't just sit there and play the game while I record and do 90% of the commentary. I've probably recorded over 20 videos where that has been the case, and I haven't uploaded them because they were probably the most boring videos I've ever watched in my life.<br><br>Also, YouTube is becoming more of a problem for some things in Minecraft, such as staff applications on several servers. When I submit an application, the person who is reading it always checks my YouTube, to see what type of content I provide, and I always "seem" to be acting "immature".<br>I haven't been a staff member on any"big" servers (biggest server had 100 players on it <b>max</b>), but I want to become a staff member on a bigger server. YouTube is usually the reason for why I get denied, and I don't want that to affect my chances anymore. If I could somehow fix this, I might still consider making "mature" videos.<br><br>So I ask of you, please give me your opinion on this, because it means a lot to me.<br><br>Also, if you do want to make a video with me, you can send me a request on YouTube or on this thread, but please don't be boring during the video, as I will&nbsp;<b>not</b> upload it.<br><br>Thanks for understanding guys, and I really look forward to your feedback.<br><br>-Porky

Stop doing prank calls... Simple as that... You told me it was because of that + tbh the russian prank call was a bit offensive since vladdy is part russian.

@SkyGirl Thanks for the motivation, I'll just think of new ideas for videos. I might record other games, not just minecraft, to maybe make it a bit more fun. &lt;3<br><br>@Vladdie Since when are you part Russian? Aren't both of your parents Romanian? :o

I think you should take a break, and then do something exciting for when you come back, like a challenge map with some people.<br>Since you are taking a break, you can have a chance to have more fun when you start.<br><br>But if you don't want to take a break, you can always just play/record different games like Nintendo games. (coolROM.com, playr.org, etc.) (Pokemon like Nuzlocke :P) so that it seems a lot more fresh than just prank calls and Minecraft, which, both get boring after a while.

You should do videos with other youtubers who have like180+ subs! *cough cinnamoncroc000 cough* it should help you have more fun when recording and also the commentary will be split to 50-50.

Damn, Porky its sad to see you considering this, and i understand where you're coming from, but i think you just need to find - like you said - some kind of a spark to propel your channel again, like I'm doing an actual series of Nebula (and no I'm not trying to advertise) where i kind of give an overview of what my objective is for that game or whatever, you could go a cycle maybe, like have a series of Avicus where each episode, you alternate between the different games, even thought Elimination and Avicade are basically never on, but still you get the idea. I personally thought your commentary was and is fine; it has much more random, edited humour that comes out of nowhere and i know I'm not the only one who finds that hilarious, but also you have a very smooth rate of talking, like you don't do the "umm"'s and "uhhh"'s during commentary, like i do, so i think give the channel a final chance to get up off its feet, because it could just be one of those "mid career" slumps or something like that, anyways hope i helped, peace out!<br>- OPTOBAT :)<br><br>EDIT: thinking of suggestions for other games too.. :)

We should record together. I was requested to do a collab with you, hehe ^-^<br><br>But man, I'm only at 271 subs. You're still going strong, and I think you should continue. If it's too much trouble, though, I perfectly understand. I've been in that spot multiple times.<br>Do what your heart tells you to. But remember, I'm looking forward to your videos ;)

I wrote about it in another post but I'll do it again, if you want to "do youtube" you need to see it as a long-term thing and actually enjoy recording, editing and uploading every single video. You can't just post a video once a week where you troll around or do prank calls which 25% of your subscibers think is fun, what about the other 75%? I know a couple of you guys will get offended as you got last time, but most of you on Avicus start a youtube channel because someone else did it, in the hopes of becoming the next PewDiePie. You shouldn't start a youtube channel because someone else did it, you shouldn't upload videos because someone else did it, if you don't want to give it 110% of yourself you will not making it trough a week or even month. If we take PewDiePie as an example again, the first few years, he was a nobody, still he kept playing, recordning, editing and uploading videos daily because he enjoyed "doing youtube". I don't expect someone on Avicus to become PewDiePie and get over milions and milions of subscriber but I do think you can get somewhere if you give it your all and actually do it because you want to, not because someone else wants it or someone else does it.

You should record what you enjoy. You should play what you want since after all its your channel.<br><br>Don't stop. Just make videos when you can but don't force yourself. Its a side thing not your full-time job.

@cinnamoncroc Sounds great! It doesn't matter if you have 50 subs (for example) and I have 400 subs; I'll still do a video with you, and that counts for everyone else as well. I really don't care about subscribers right now. All I care about is that people enojy watching my videos. :)<br><br>@S3M3L You're absolutely right, and thanks for writing that. I never expected to get as big as PewDiePie, or even get 100,000 subscribers. I honestly just started YouTube for fun, but I did have some thoughts of what might happen if I become bigger. Thanks for the support! :)<br><br>@Everyone else Thank you guys, I think that I'll most likely continue. I'll start making a list of games that I could record, but if you guys have any suggestions, feel free to share. :)<br><br>Thanks for the support everyone! ^o^
