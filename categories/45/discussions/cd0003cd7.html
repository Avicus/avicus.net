I hope you get better! I know some people are against getting flu shots and what ever but okay, that's their plan but I really do not want to see anyone land in the hospital because they got pneumonia and other sicknesses following it, it's not fun I have had&nbsp;pneumonia as a child and its seriously hell.

I completely agree as well! Although, if you aren't a fan of shots, at least get the nasal spray.<br><br>I used to get them at school, but I had an allergic reaction to the flu shot so I can't get them unless I'm at the doctor's office. I've lucked out of getting the shots d:^)

I've been very healthy my whole life, yet I still get a flu shot. Each year, it takes a different form, and the flu shot is for the most common form. Anyone can get it. But hey, I'm not a doctor :P Ask yours next time you see them, but flu shots are still a good idea.

We can, and we can go through horrible things, even if we don't care humans will survive. But what changes is the probability of getting influenza becoming smaller. We need a long and quality life, not just the survival of the Homo Sapiens itself. You could even die by getting influenza or any related disease.

Flu shots aim to prevent the flu as a whole not just the most common type. While I believe they are useful as children due to childrens immature immune system it becomes much less useful past childhood and it can relativley easily backfire, accidental injections of still harmful viruses are more common than you think.

I understand that there can be the possibility of a backfired reaction to the shot, but it's generally a risk that we may have to take. He likely had a weak immune system, which caused him to suffer severe affects from the shot.&nbsp;<br><br>On the other hand, I hope he recovers well. Must be pretty devastating for his family to have to go through such a shock.

I've had 14 needles within the last 10 months (I'll list out what each of them were for if you want uwu), and it's honestly not that bad. Obviously I still hate them, but..<br><br>Trust me kids, just get the shot.

Nope. No thanks. Took it until I was 12 and for the past 3 years I haven't taken it.<br>A flu shot is to assist your body to&nbsp;<b>temporarily</b> grow your immune system.<br>Best if you just grow it yourself and then it becomes&nbsp;<b>permanent</b>.<br>Don't think it's temporary? Than why take it each year?<br><br>All you do is inject one of the safer chemicals into your body which are still&nbsp;<b>chemicals.</b><br>I get sick like once a year, nothing more unless I go into a foreign country where I don't usually go, then I get sick pretty easily since my body isn't used to that type of bacteria/germs

You really should get flu shots guys.. I mean if you disagree arguing would make me look like an asshole, so Im just going to go ahead and say not taking flu shots makes your immune system a lot more open to viral attacks.<br><br>And yes.. &nbsp;I do have more experience regarding diseases than most of you...<br><br>(Just ask o.o)

I'm not sure why people are scared of shots. I mean, I use to cry my eyes out when I was really young, till I learned to relax your arm, look away, and blow softly when the shot went in. It really doesn't hurt at all, it's a few minutes after the shot where you get a dull pain. :p

It's because when people get their injections it usually causes pain. When people see needles again they remember pain, so it's like a mental warning to stay away from them otherwise you will get hurt.

My brother and I normally get a flu shot each year.<br>This year we both didn't get it.<br><br>I was fine but my brother got the flu, he was home sick for weeks, missing a lot of assignment deadlines&nbsp;and other projects while I just developed a cough for a few weeks.<br><br>There's nothing wrong wih having a flu shot because it's designed to help you. Yes it mutates and evoles to become resistant to he medicine but that process realistically takes years if not decades.<br><br>Yes, some people don't respond well to flu shots but that's generally because they might already be sick. <br><br>If you're currently sick and get a flu shot it'll make it worse because vaccines contain a small amount of the flu so your body can recognise and fight against it and a faster rate if you get it next time, that's how shots work.<br><br>If you don't get flu shots then you risk getting seriously sick for days if not weeks, regardless if you have a strong immune system or not.<br><br>Just my two cents.

The risk of catching the flu, either from everyday productivity or the shot itself, varies quite a bit throughout each individual. Some are more prone to catching it than others, leaving us torn between the choice of getting the shot or not despite the stories we've heard. The more efficient option is to get the injection. If things turn for the worst, just remember that it's not your fault, or rather that you were just on the bad luck side of things. It's either that or high risk of the flu. Your choice.
