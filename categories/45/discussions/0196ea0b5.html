Quintus means "fifth" I believe, there are 5 monuments, same with Ternio, meaning third, or something along the lines of that, same with it having 3 monuments...<br>:]

"Five" in Latin is "Quinque"<br>"Quintus" is a Roman name for guys<br><br>"Three" in Latin is "Tres"<br>I dont know where Ternio is from though.<br><br>But I can see where the 5 monuments and the 3 monuments came from though. In fact, it only makes sense if you put it that way.
