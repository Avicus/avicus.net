Hello guys Passively here and today I need your help because I'm really stressed with my Minecraft problem so let me explain what is happening.<br><br>Well, I upgraded my computer to Windows 10 Pro because I was having some RAM issues in the old Windows 7 (I couldn't allocate more RAM to my Minecraft) but that's not the point. Everything was working perfectly in the first weekend with the new Windows 10 but the problem arrived a few weeks ago.<br>When I leave the Minecraft inactive and look for something on the Internet, when I open again the Minecraft, appears 2 white boxes saying that the Minecraft isn't responding, everything is frozen and I can't do anything. But when it happens like 10 times in a row, the sensibility of my Minecraft is uncontrollable, for example, if I move the screen (moving the head) the FPS fall to 5-10, but if I press the right click, the sensitivity becomes normal, and I need to turn off my PC and wait like an hour to fix temporary the problem.<br><br>I honestly don't know how to fix this problem, I deleted my .minecraft folder, I reinstalled Java (the newest version), I tried some old solutions in some Minecraft Forums and none of them worked, I reinstalled Minecraft (Java version and .exe version) and I'm really tired of this problem.<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/F4J7UBg.jpg" title="Image: http://i.imgur.com/F4J7UBg.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/oxHHjFM.jpg" title="Image: http://i.imgur.com/oxHHjFM.jpg"><br><br>PC Specs:<br><ul><li><b>Processor</b>: AMD Anthlon(tm) II X4 640 Processor 3.00GHz</li><li><b>RAM</b>: 8.00 GB (2x4GB)</li><li><b>Windows Version</b>: Windows 10 Pro</li><li><b>Graphics Card</b>: NVIDIA GT420 128bit, 2GB DDR3</li><li><b>Motherboard</b>: ASRock N68C-GS4FXK</li><li><b>Java Version</b>:&nbsp;Java: 1.8.0_25 64Bit</li></ul>If someone can help with this it would be amazing, please :(

Your PC specs are probably too weak for Windows 10.<br><br>Did you update your graphics card driver?<br>Are other drivers also up-to-date?<br>Do you have problems with other games?
