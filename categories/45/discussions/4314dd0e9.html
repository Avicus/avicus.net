Hello Avicus players,<br>This is a post to inform you of the new Teamspeak server being run by former and current staff along with various members of the community of avicus. Since avicus would like to maintain its TeamSpeak's current stylings and there are a considerable amount of players who are disatisfied with it in its current state, we have created our own Teamspeak. This new TeamSpeak follows avicus rules and stylings to a degree where they don't contradict each other. This teamspeak is being run by a dedicated and entrusted staff team which is present to protect all users at all times. Donator ranks along with staff ranks will be respected as long as they belong to people who fill out their rank requirements. Certain old and new concepts have been added to this new TeamSpeak including:<br>-Private Spanish chats<br>-Suites<br>-Team Channels<br>-18+ chats<br>-Music Room<br>The server admins are myself, JOHN_CENAAAAAAAA, GrapeSmoothie, TheEpicPie, steven5703 and BoxehTheBull please contact one of them, myself or another various member of the community who has the ip to join us. See you there!<br>Please not that this is still developing and certain permisdions may be incorrect.<br>Note to staff members posts about SMP servers are allowed as long as they don't include the ip, the same premise applies to this.

I can tell this TS server is by far the best one I've seen. Totally orginal, no copies from Avicus's teamspeak at all, plus you're not babysitted 24/7 by 10 year olds!

Well the original host was Jamious, then Jami allowed us to remodel. Currentley the staff team running it is administrated by myself, Greg and Michael (steven and McPie are auxiliary admins). Jami has retained his admin permissions due to his original contributions though and because we generally enjoy his opinions and ideas. Staff mainly consists of: avicus staff, Fort members and various former staff members. Atm it is a free TS server, should we grow, we have plans to make it paid, while reaping none of the benefits of donations. :)<br><br>To others: You will receive the ip shortly.
