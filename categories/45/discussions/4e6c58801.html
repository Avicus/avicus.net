Ok so lately people are saying that a member on the team PureDogs, was using an illegal client, usually called "autoclicker". The team was not disqualified, and will go on to the qualifiers.&nbsp;<br>No offense to the officials and stuff, but im pretty sure you can't go against your own rule<br><i>cough cough <a href="http://imgur.com/WkgKySs" title="Link: http://imgur.com/WkgKySs">http://imgur.com/WkgKySs</a>&nbsp;cough cough</i>.&nbsp;<br><br>So to make it clear,<br><br>if they are not dq'ed, i see no reason why all the other teams cant just autoclick their way to the finish, not like they don't already.....<br>&nbsp;<br>In my frowned upon opinion, we should cast a vote.&nbsp;<a href="https://goo.gl/p5Y3kD" title="Link: https://goo.gl/p5Y3kD">https://goo.gl/p5Y3kD</a>&nbsp;k here's a poll<br><br><br>Downloading my autocliker for t6,<br>&nbsp;<br>-rattle

+1<br>definetly, if newdawn get's DQ'd for not showing up on one fucking match, PureDogs should definetly get DQ'd for having a guy who's autoclicking. Especially when it clearly says in the rules...

All the officials who voted against their own rules do not deserve their positions. Its clearly in your own ruleset and you did not need a vote to decide. Poor tournament in my opinion.<br><br><br><img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/63b88dffc6b44e08bd17aae089b12e95?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/Riilo.html" style="color: Gray">Riilo</a> yeah this happened many times

I'm hoping that this doesn't turn into yet another Avicus forums flame war but I have to agree. I have nothing against PureDogs and I'd like to think I'm friends with some of the members but, to me, rules are rules. I realise and understand how to decision to not disqualify PureDogs came about but I don't particularly agree with it. I'm not doing this as a last-ditch attempt to get back into the tournament because if I'm perfectly honest it's not terribly important to me. I just want to stress the fact that this is going to change the reputation of the Offical team, making it worse than it already is. Again, I have nothing against the staff team and I realise they do their best to create the best competitive atmosphere possible and I respect them for that but the fact of the matter is, I feel that people are going to see this as an opportunity to cheat. If they're caught cheating they are undoubtedly going to argue "PureDogs weren't disqualified when Zaoki was caught so why should we be dq'd". There is most likely more to this than I know but this is what I gathered from the whole situation. Obviously this post is not going to change a thing but I'd like to hear others' opinions on this without people flaming. Sorry for the rant and fair play if you read all this.

What none of you understand is that you know nothing about this situation. The rule states that if an autoclicker is found on someone's computer, they will be banned and their team dq'ed. Put in simple terms, an autoclicker was not found on his computer, so they are t dq'ing us.

Why is there even need for a discussion over this, this is honestly the most black and white rule that was set for this tourney. How are they not dq'ed? Officials? Hello?<br><br>To be fair, I know your official team consists of people who play for their team whilst 2 teams are delayed for 40 minutes to be allocated an official server and refs before said official realises "Oh shit, i forgot I should do my job" (I won't mentions Tomqss name because he would and should be fucking embarrassed) Putting that aside, I think you can manage this relatively easy problem.<br><br>My question is why did this take you 2 and a half hours to find an autoclicker? Nice screenshare - I think thats a problem as well.<br><br>I'm not claiming to be the best official in history, but the official team has slipped since I've been gone, pick up your fucking act please.

The Avicus Official Staff Team is the most unorganised, unreliable, most biased, most fickle lot of people you could possibly manage to promote. They make my 4 year old brother look clever. Just by there sheer stupidity. I have not once witnessed a more idiotic act of favouritism. Im starting to worry, not just for the teams that face the potential cheaters but for the whole community if senior mods and mods could over look a rule like that. Considering the official team has mods plus on it. &nbsp;Who evens makes a clear rule, which makes the community abide and believe in, then turns around and says 'we are making an exception' How should the potential team to take there place feel. How should the teams feel knowing exceptions are being made for the higher tier teams.<br><br><br>Not saying this to every official, just the ones who voted to go against there OWN rule.

There are also moderators and higher ups on the mapdev team. The fact that there are moderating staff on the official team has nothing to do with anything.

I'm hoping that this doesn't turn into yet another Avicus forums flame war but I have to agree. I have nothing against PureDogs and I'd like to think I'm friends with some of the members but, to me, rules are rules. I realise and understand how to decision to not disqualify PureDogs came about but I don't particularly agree with it. I'm not doing this as a last-ditch attempt to get back into the tournament because if I'm perfectly honest it's not terribly important to me. I just want to stress the fact that this is going to change the reputation of the Offical team, making it worse than it already is. Again, I have nothing against the staff team and I realise they do their best to create the best competitive atmosphere possible and I respect them for that but the fact of the matter is, I feel that people are going to see this as an opportunity to cheat. If they're caught cheating they are undoubtedly going to argue "PureDogs weren't disqualified when Zaoki was caught so why should we be dq'd". There is most likely more to this than I know but this is what I gathered from the whole situation. Obviously this post is not going to change a thing but I'd like to hear others' opinions on this without people flaming. Sorry for the rant and fair play if you read all this.

"The Avicus Official Staff Team" Which part of this makes you think im talking about the Moderating staff? The point im trying to get across is, that the official team has Moderators+ on it, so i don't know why they are breaking there own rules. Moderators and up reinforce rules not break them. Mods should know about rules and not to break them. Yet why is there an exception here?

Ok, listen. Trying to make this sound better than what it was isn't going to work. Every single person in our channel was telling you to shut the fuck up. Did you listen? Nope! You kept yapping on about why we were losing and telling us feedback half way through the game. Bro, why should we wait 40 minutes for our round 5 to start. We were told a starting time, and we expected to play 15 minutes maximum after the starting line, not fucking 40. Also koja told you to get out of channel because you pretty much yapped the whole entire time. Seriously...

I understand you jayster, my past team 'Xenarch' from which I got kicked due to not activity and because Rilo doesn't like the truth(I don't really care). Was screaming everytime during round 5 so I couldn't understand what were you saying, and anyone could listen you. Also as far as I know, I never heard you while we were playing our useless matches (because my past team didn't really care about'em), the only time I heard you, was when you started to shout. At this point I think you should've left the channel and going to the other team chat, until my team stopped shouting (thing that didn't happen). I'm sorry for the behaviour of my past team, and I know that you have taken some decisions.

Why has this even gotten this far? It is black and white. It isn't that hard to follow 1 simple rule, the fact that they have already beaten teams when they were supposed to be disqualified is fucking stupid. The rule is clear as fuck, I don't give 3 shits about all these excuses on why they shouldn't be dq'd.&nbsp;THEY HAD A FUCKING AUTOCLICKER! Why does this even need a vote? They obviously had an AutoClicker so I don't see any reason why they are still in the tournament.

yeah, we all know now what the officials did wrong and the tournament is over so we cant change anything anymore, so theres no point in what you are doing, we should try to get a better official team / improve the current one.

Ok, listen. Trying to make this sound better than what it was isn't going to work. Every single person in our channel was telling you to shut the fuck up. Did you listen? Nope! You kept yapping on about why we were losing and telling us feedback half way through the game. Bro, why should we wait 40 minutes for our round 5 to start. We were told a starting time, and we expected to play 15 minutes maximum after the starting line, not fucking 40. Also koja told you to get out of channel because you pretty much yapped the whole entire time. Seriously...
