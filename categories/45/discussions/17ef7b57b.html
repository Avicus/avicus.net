Alright let's face it.<br>Ever since Jeb and Dinnerboner took over MC has been going downhill.<br>Mojang is just money-hungry now IMO.<br>And the community is pretty damn bad from what I can see now days.<br>So discuss.<br>Is it going downhill?

From the current state of what I see, it's getting less sales, it's the #3 most sold game IIRC but that does not mean it's still strong.<br>Also, 1.8 was overhyped and is just a laggy piece of garbage.

It only seems like it's going downhill because you're personal interest of Minecraft is going downhill.<br><br>People are saying "Minecraft is dying" but in reality, it's doing extremely well.<br>Maybe you're starting to loose interest in the game and feel that it's going downhill.<br><br>That's simply not the case.

WelI think PVP is going downhill and becoming stale for mainly due to the fact that the meta is not being developed. Pretty much everything there has been developed accidental or not has been discovered more or less.

As far as I can tell,
Minecraft hasn't been as popular as it used to. Along with this, I don't see
Minecraft ever going away. I have a feeling that Minecraft will become one of
those games that has waves of popularity without ever disappearing completely.
It may have a few years of popularity and then a few dormant years, but will
come back and be popular again. (This is all speculation, but this is how I see
Minecraft playing out.)

It appeals to little kids more now (EULA [due to parents getting angry, but I can't really blame them for that part], lots of YouTubers playing it, etc.) and mostly little kids can be jerks (not all, but MOST in my experience. All of the jerks in game are mostly younger than 11.) and them being jerks ruins the community, and bad community=worse game.

the thing about minecraft is that eventually it gets old. the updates can't keep up with people. by that i mean that the rate at which you get bored with minecraft is greater than the rate at which they add new things to spark your interest for a while. for new players, it's still that magical thing you experienced when you started. when i started, i didnt know anything about the game. crafting recipes, different biomes, even how the game worked in the coding, how different aspects of it came together to create it, it was all a mystery. you see youtubers trying to keep themselves amused by doing mods or figuring out new things they can do, but there's not much you can do. everything comes to an end.

And I have no idea why you&nbsp;criticize Minecraft, if u got something against it just quit the game. Or if u want to u can just go back to play on a 1.4 server or something. There is really no point complaining about a game u have no power to do something about.<br><br>You asked for opinions and then you try to convince, where is the logic in that?

So you're saying minecraft is going downhill because you think updates are bad?<br>I used to frequent minecraft forums and I saw these threads with just about any update, yet here we are still.&nbsp;<br>Sure it's going to drop in popularity over time but then again we still have servers with thousands of players around the clock.

Tbh, Minecraft is going downhill... Again as you said its the #3 Top selling games.. but it doesnt mean anything.. Minecraft can be sh*t.. All the people who buy it probably quit in 1 week after the crappy updates... and If minecraft logic was better, for example: Physics of gravity... So.. It makes sense that dirt can randombly float in the air... Again people might not agree with me... thats just my opinion. Diamond pickaxe: Seriously.. where in real life do you see a god damn diamond pickaxe... If you try to break something the diamond would shatter completely...<br><br>And overall if physics where added to the game, such as creepers blowing up can cause more rock to fall down, same with tnt. For example.. You are in a mineshaft and a creeper comes to you, and it explodes.. Its a tiny space and other rocks are not supported to some fall... And Tbh if you could chip off pixels of the blocks it would be a lot nicer.. But nope, mojang just needs to add more un-realistic things. BEFORE YOU SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THIS. Yes I know.. "Minecraft wouldnt be minecraft with physics". To some extent yes.. but at least have an option in the world generation section, to what you want to play.. "There are mods for this". Screw mods, Seriously who wants to install mods? Yes some mods like optifine, dont take long to install, But other mods such as, lets say.. "Dragons mod". You need forge ffs, and then you have to go through stuff in you .minecraft to get it open... Screw that.. "If there were actual physics Minecraft would become a lot hard to some players and they would quit". ...There should be 2 options. One for Physical MC, and one for Standard MC...<br>"PVP will be ruined by physics". To some degree yes, The players would have diffirent animations and maybe even have a fainting animation... But again if you dont like that, there should be 2 options... Thats basically all i have to say, Note: This is just my opinion...

You need forge ffs, and then you have to go through stuff in you .minecraft to get it open... Screw that.. "If there were actual physics Minecraft would become a lot hard to some players and they would quit". ...There should be 2 options. One for Physical MC, and one for Standard MC...<br>"PVP will be ruined by physics". To some degree yes, The players would have diffirent animations and maybe even have a fainting animation... But again if you dont like that, there should be 2 options... Thats basically all i have to say, Note: This is just my opinion...

Saying that they're "mini-EA" is going way too far. They don't rerelease insipid games just to get more sales on an audience that is somehow perfectly fine with buying the same games over and over each year.

Personally, I think that all the new updates are taking away from the simple way Minecraft used to be. Maybe it's just been because I've played a lot, but Minecraft used to have a lot more of a "special" feel. All these updates are adding all this new stuff that takes away that minimalist feel to it.. :c

Tbh, Minecraft is going downhill... Again as you said its the #3 Top selling games.. but it doesnt mean anything.. Minecraft can be sh*t.. All the people who buy it probably quit in 1 week after the crappy updates... and If minecraft logic was better, for example: Physics of gravity... So.. It makes sense that dirt can randombly float in the air... Again people might not agree with me... thats just my opinion. Diamond pickaxe: Seriously.. where in real life do you see a god damn diamond pickaxe... If you try to break something the diamond would shatter completely...<br><br>And overall if physics where added to the game, such as creepers blowing up can cause more rock to fall down, same with tnt. For example.. You are in a mineshaft and a creeper comes to you, and it explodes.. Its a tiny space and other rocks are not supported to some fall... And Tbh if you could chip off pixels of the blocks it would be a lot nicer.. But nope, mojang just needs to add more un-realistic things. BEFORE YOU SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THIS. Yes I know.. "Minecraft wouldnt be minecraft with physics". To some extent yes.. but at least have an option in the world generation section, to what you want to play.. "There are mods for this". Screw mods, Seriously who wants to install mods? Yes some mods like optifine, dont take long to install, But other mods such as, lets say.. "Dragons mod".

But again if you dont like that, there should be 2 options... Thats basically all i have to say, Note: This is just my opinion...

Woah woah woah, who ever said Minecraft was meant to be a realistic portrayal of the Earth? <i>No one. </i>I'm pretty sure it's obviously to most of us that Minecraft was build to be a creative outlet for people to have fun. <i>It's a game.&nbsp;</i>I don't have a problem with this thread, but honestly, I couldn't care less if you don't like Minecraft anymore because or "I didn't like the new biome" or "I don't like some mods". <i>Guess what, </i>some people do!<br><br>If Minecraft is a game that you don't find enjoyable anymore, go find some other hobby!

It's not as much that the game itself is going downhill, it's more of the fact that the community has become almost at the same level of toxicity as the League of Legends community. For that reason I think that Minecraft has seen decline that you posted about.

I just seen some servers on my server list and the usually average number has gone down a bit. Take hypixel for example. When i look at it in the server list before and after, it has gone down. Even OCN, on my time zone, its usually around 700 players it used to be 1000+. This is because players have lost intrest in minecraft and its probably why its going down hill<br><br>Every game cannot last forever. Each game will have a downfall at somepoint because nothing can last forever. ITs like iphones where its popular at one point but a new one comes in and no one buys the older ones. ITs just like minecraft. New games will someday surpass it so even though people think its not going downhill, it will go downhill eventually<br><br>To conclude i maybe wrong about player base (just my experience k) and the community is going down a lot. IT used to be not as toxic as ever vefore. Seriously all i see is screaming skydoesminecraft kids and other little kids screaming random stuff in chat. Then you got the immature kids who just scream, HACker, HACKS, and just cuss just cause they think its cool. The community is going down. I mean, it was abd already but nows its just worse.<br><br>In terms of updates, i guess its ok. No change really. Just dont like 1.8 due to the water :/ I personally lost intrest in minecraft due to updates not being fun anymore.<br><br>In terms of community and server netowrk base, ya its going down ish. idk<br><br>Minecraft will last a pretty long time but it will probably will get no popular anymore. Well, it would be still popular but people wouldnt play it as much
