You're thinking about staff who were previously staff. Everyone who can punish is a staff member or has been a staff member, however there has been some illegitimacy with ranks such as naydurr being administrator. If an infraction shows just a gray name, then they were staff previously but retired/were demoted. I am an example of this since I was mod a while ago, but I am not anymore yet my punishments are still in effect.

Some people are past staff members, therefore their infractions show up with a gray name.<br><br><i>(Off Topic)<br></i><i>I'm only retired temporarly, i'll be back in a few days.</i>

To make things clear, only current staff members can punish. If you see a gray name in the infractions list of a person, that person was a staff member. <br><br>If a tempban was issued and the staff member was demoted/retired, the tempban will still be in effect until it expires. &nbsp;<br><br>Sorry if this caused any confusion.
