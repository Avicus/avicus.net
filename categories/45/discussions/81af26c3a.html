So yeah, if you clicked this, I probably know what you're all expecting to read.<br><br>Yes, me, Evocal, and TheMasterCow/ParaSpider are leaving or Map Developing duties as of now. We both quit our Map Developer rank.<br><br><b><i>ParaSpider / TheMasterCow:<br></i></b>I've been wanting to hang on for a while. I've been trying to feed off of other people's smiles, to give MYSELF a smile. All I want to do for people is make them happy -- give them a sense of enjoyment, even if that means leaving less for me. I have been dragging on as a mapdev to try to help everyone and do as much as I could for the server. I give all I can just to be treated like shit. My tolerance has lowered and my time has expired. I can no longer handle the stress or treatment I get from the community, as I am being thought of as an object and just getting random insults and annoyance. Sure, you expect some "Hey, check out my map" or "___ needs more maps", but not things like having us replaced, our ranks revoked, me being banned, a fuck you, and constant bugging of "update this" "do that" "fix x" or the harassment I receive. I did polls to be interactive, yet those were trolled and I am blamed. Every single thing I put to the table gets showered with hate.I no longer wish to be a map developer. It's not because of time, or just not wanting to do it; I've been forced to. As for your inactivity, Keenan, I know you may be busy but it's too difficult on our own. I feel dropped in the woods and I can't get your support because you're away. I thought I was right about our community, everyone was little angels and helpful and supportive, but that of course ended abruptly as it was just fake sympathy for me. This stress piled upon the shitload of issues I have IRL is not something I want to do.Not only this, but not one person has said thank you in the long run. Maybe once in a while it'll be a thanks, but it's by the same people who harass us and keep annoying us. As a moderator as well, why don't I punish them? Well, they're incompetent and just bugging us, doesn't deserve a punishment. I still want to be a mod, but not a mapdev. I truly want to be one and that rank is everything to me, but I can't take it anymore. Some of the comments/insults of these people... you don't realize how bad they are. They've made me have suicidal thoughts, they've harmed me as a whole, they bring down my emotions into a ghost with no feelings, and I can't do anything but put a fake mask in front of my face acting like I enjoy this. I don't anymore.It's not your fault, Evocal's fault, Howsie's fault, Gill's fault, or anyone's fault -- but it's the community. The ones I do so much for and get so little out of. They're selfish, arrogant, rude, spammy, annoying, and do every single thing I DON'T WANT TO DEAL WITH. I'm sorry, Keenan. I'm sorry, Mous. Sorry. But if anything ever happens to somehow clear up, I'm still here. I'm going to hopefully always be here. Sitting. Waiting by skype. To get a PM one day that everything's better.That is my rendition of a perfect world -- just to where I can help.<span>I love you.<br><br><b><i>Evocal:<br></i></b>I'm sorry, I'm quitting my Map Dev rank.<b><i><br></i></b>What Para said is true.<br>Very, very true.<br>I'm sorry, I just cannot handle it anymore<br>I cannot keep on doing this<br>:It doesn't make me happy anymore, knowing that there are way too many people complaining and complaining, all the aesthetic vs gameplay threads, complaints, a lot of stuff.<br>It's much more that what I'm saying right now but<br>I swear I'm right now so stressed out, trying not to curse anyone, controlling myself, I just cannot think of any words.<br>I'm leaving the Map Dev rank alongside Para, thanks for being kind, all of you, during my time as a staff member. Even though it's just a small rank, with no major importance whatsoever.<br><span>Thank you all (heart)<br><br>Okay, apart from the message above, it's just too much. All most of you do is complain, complain, complain, and never actually give a solution for this. It's driving me mad and it's what made me take my decision.<br>You're not content with anything, nothing seems right to you. "Stop editing good maps" "This map sucks" "Stop focusing on aesthetics" "Stop this stop that" "Evocal did you see my map" "Evocal Evocal Evocal" Para will my map be in rotations" "Para Para Para".<br>Seriously guys, when I made Justice 1 I&nbsp;<b><i>NEVER</i></b><i></i> did any sort of questions. I had to wait like 5 months for it to be put in rotations, and you guys get impatient over ANYTHING.<br>It's just too much, sorry, but I'm gone.<br><br><br><b><i>And to clear things up</i></b>, TheMasterCow/ParaSpider (Para) will still be a Moderator, though none of us will be a Map Developer anymore.<br>I'll still be making maps, whenever I wish, whenever I feel like it, without being disturbed all the time...<br><b>And there are, of course, people who do show gratitude towards out work, and complain about stuff in a correct way and with civilized manner. You guys, thank you.<br></b><br><i>- Good luck to everyone. Evocal &amp; ParaSpider.</i><br></span><br></span>

If I ever said any rude things about your maps, which I know I have, I sincerely apologize. I don't expect forgiveness, because some of the things I said about the maps were actually pretty rude. But, on the other hand, you guys have produced some of the best maps as well. So thank you for all the hard work that you guys did for the server. &lt;3

Some people do not realize how Map Devs are quite important in the community. They don't respect the privilege of having Map Devs. Those people are just selfish, judgemental and arrogant. You guys are the ones who add, review, and edit maps. Without you two, who are we to accomplish and complete those tasks? With Funky, being our only Dev, and also really busy, changes to maps and rotations are going to take much longer, thanks to the attitude of some people in the community.<br><br>Let this be a lesson learned to the community, how some things can't be accomplished alone, as they require a group of dedicated people to make it happen. Most likely you two have contemplated about resigning as Map Devs, but you two were more worried about the community, and how we would function without you. You guys get such little respect, and only a small amount of gratitude from others. I respect your decisions to both retire as Map Devs.<br><br>I wish you two the best, and I thank you both for your hard work you've put into Avicus.

nooooo :c<br><br>this is really sad... but the worst part is how bitterly true everything you've said here is...<br>im really at a loss for words here; i don't personally know either of you, and ive only submitted 3 maps :/ honestly though, the amount of stress it must cause doing all the things you've done must be incredible. no one could last forever doing that. but that's not to say that the things you have done so far have been in vain... really, think about it. without you two, avicus wouldn't exist right now. thank you SO much for the past you've been a part of, and the future you've created. the best of luck to you in your life &lt;3

If you walk away from this, then you are walking off something easy. You have seen it before, everyone complains about change and it usually lasts for 1-2 weeks and then people get used to it. I am not saying you should stay or you should leave but, you did know that it takes rough skin to do something big on the internet? Also, with the rotations I believe the changes have been getting better and better. If you see a post in the polls that even look a little trolling then don't look at it, or even make a warning that a punishment will be filed, even if you can't punish. If you don't think Last,Hypixel,Spu_, and Apple also have this crap on them then you are incorrect. But, they have the rough skin to get threw to the next day. Also if there is threads about gameplay or don't edit the old maps, those threads were really just addressing their concern because they want avicus to be the best that it can. I do not want hate I am just voicing my opinion. I am also thankful for your jobs that you did for the community

Para / Evol - I really hate to see great people not getting the back-end support they need. I know I have been one of the most verbal , but I certainly never put the mods / devs. down. I thought what you guys did with the Map Dev thread was great, and I really enjoyed the effort and communication given to me - It really helped.<br><br>I see how much time and effort you guys put into Avicus, and as you two step back from the map dev role, just know that you did a great job and deserve to have been supported in a better fashion. To anyone that cursed the map devs or put down their maps - you should be ashamed. To anyone that helped push them away from the job they were trying to do, or were in a leadership role and did not do as much as you could and should have to help them, you should be ashamed. To anyone that was unkind to the two teenagers trying to support this community and make playing this game and this server better, you should be ashamed and know that the combined negative efforts and neglect worked - and now Avicus is so much less than it was.<br><br>Thanks for reading - I hope to see Evol / Para return to the Map Dev role at some point, when they are able to get the back-end support needed. I promise it takes more than a few complainers on the forum to cause this, half if not more than half of the problem comes from the people on the back-end. If Evol/Para would have been given more attention, been given more help, and would have had more of the Admin staff standing up for them on the forums and in-game and regulating the comments that the map devs had to respond to, or even chiming in and squelching the bad forum junk we would not be here.

this I was told in advance so I am not surprised there are going to be more mapdevs coming soon IvyCode has to decide who he wants to become mapdev's, the mapdev's gave Ivy a list with frequent map makers and &nbsp;he will choose&nbsp;<br>but still we are screwed&nbsp;<br><br>Para thanks so much for being the only person that would actually answer me on skype when I finished a map

Evocal, you brought us Decay and Justice and all of these absolutely beautiful maps.<br>Personally i don't think i complained to the standard you guys are talking about, let alone at all really, but I would like to say you have my thanks, gratitude, sympathy and sheer astonishment for every single block of work you guys have provided us. HUNDREDS of people may not even be at this server if it weren't for you two coming together and constructing these maps that made me absolutely addicted to the game. &nbsp;Para/Cow i have talked to you a few times, remember? We had a few tiny little niggles over god knows what, i can't even remember, but we came clean, and i do remember you being very logical, calm and detailed throughout our whole little conversation (s). Para, you have been through alot. I do understand this. We barely know each other at all, but i am the type of person who really can understand another persons pain and remorse. I feel you man. Your account was simultaneously hacked, not that long ago, i know the pressure you must have felt to deliver when Avicus really needed a special map to replenish the hunger of those ungrateful, ignorant bastards who didn't care about your work, but what they got out of it, and finally i now understand the horror you faced dealing with these people, and I'm sorry man. I hope they are two.<br>Maybe, one day, Avicus will blow up BIG time and there will be history going down about how you two sparked off the amazing maps to this server.&nbsp;<br>You both deserve more than a sorry and an applause, because your contribution is beyond incredible.<br>Thanks guys - Fred/ A.K.A, OPTOBAT

This is such a shame. As ever, I wish both of you guys the best of luck for the future, but I would love it if you can in some way stick around Avicus - whether it be by the forums or online. This is just another stage, however, showing that Avicus is going down. We've had many important people retiring recently - obviously you 2 guys, and PeachyYas, although he came back. I don't want people thinking that they are retiring because they don't like the server - Avicus deserves so much more than this. But this begs the question - will izjust4fun become a Map Dev now? Now that you guys have gone, maps won't appear as often, admittedly, which may be a good thing because there are too many at the moment, but this is such a blow for Avicus. Evocal, ParaSpider, if you read this, please take this into acoount. I understand that you have to leave - I know that live is more important and you have school to be concerned with, but this is a major blow to this server. Bye guys, best of luck in life - happy retirement, and you will always be remembered for contributing so much to this wonderful server.<br>You guys brought so many of my favourite maps to life, thank you so much.<br><br>iBiZa_MiNeCrAfT. :(.

I've always thought that Map Developers were going to be hurt somehow by having such rank... I don't know about now, but when the Map Developer rank was introduced a lot of staffs were pissed(Now I won't be telling names because a)It was quite some time ago and b)I don't want to start anything with any staff, you know who you are) off of introducing the map developers to the staff team in the avicus network's staff team Skype chat. From that day on, I basically knew that becoming a Map Developer was going to become a pain in the ass with the matter of fact that you basically don't have the power to punish those that go further up the lines with their ways of criticizing things. I believe that if we want to polish such rank and earn the respect that this rank needs, it should have more power as of at least have the power to kick or warn people. I know that they have the /s command and what not, but they need to have something to defend themselves for the times a moderator isn't online. I do not blame Evocal or Paraspider for leaving their ranks as Map Developers because 1) I would've done the same thing 2) The way they got discriminated(Not only staff guys... I've seen other people saying that they don't see why they are considered staffs) was unbelievable and they deserve more respect. I am grateful for the hard work you guys have put into Avicus with the rank as a MapDev, and with that being said, thank you guys for everything!

Why are you still hating on this community? There are many types of bad people, and you seem to be causing lots of flames, hating and stuff and you're saying that the community is cancerous. A little ironic, maybe.<br><br>They're leaving... oh dang oh no oh my&nbsp;<br><br>Even though there are a lot of maps on right now, it'll be kinda hard to "improve" and spend hours on all these maps and stuff.

I'm not hating on it, I'm giving an opinion, which is well justified. I haven't caused 1 flame war in the 6 months of me being here and you don't understand what ironic means.

I will like to say on behalf of my small build team a massive thank you. Although at first I did criticize you as I couldn't get my maps accepted but later on I realized you were just doing your job. You both have put in so much work to Avicus i feel that ,although not all the players notice, but the point is Avicus would not be such an amazing pvp server without you. You both are well respected map dev's from me and I understand your decision as I know (from other experiences) to put in hundreds of hours of work and not get thanked only criticized. I for one hope I will never criticise like I have before again and I deeply apologise. I will miss you both and please don't hesitate to ask if you need any favours in the future. With all my respect,<br>Thanks, subzero110 &amp; samthemenace (Owner's of Fennercraft)
