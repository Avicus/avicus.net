YLO couldn't handle the topic either he gave up a few weeks ago.<br>you are qualified to become the next mapdev because of your awesome building skills and your knowledge of YAML &nbsp;but they might not need another or they might be discussing about you. Para might of been contemplating Evo for a month or more.
