I can't figure it out<br><br>The same maps on Mix/DTM are played constantly and I've done many updates for Frenzy and wasted so many hours to get it up and running and it became a graveyard, it's supposed to be fast-paced and fun but I guess Avicus isn't the right audience for fast paced gameplay? I assumed TDM and Blitz and Arcade fans would like it.<br><br>It has so many maps and many different styles. What could we do to make Frenzy great again?

I think it's because you only get one life and can't join an existing game, if I'm thinking of the correct gamemode.

Here is what I believe. &nbsp;DTM has been with Avicus since the creation of Avicus. &nbsp;Because of this, this is all Avicus players know. &nbsp;We haven't gotten many new players and the ones that continue to play on this server are so used to play DTM that it has become a natural thing. &nbsp;If you want players to play the new gamemodes, you would have to bring in new players and push people to play those. &nbsp;You need to advertise. &nbsp;Also, why not host a sort of "party" where players could win cool prizes while playing these new gamemodes.

You have to understand once and for all and stop looking for reasons<br>Start focusing on the only good gamemode you got which is nebula, focus on ctw and dtm since these are the only ones who can play competitively. stop focusing on improving useless features like friendship aesthetics on the forums or things like this, we wanna see updates on the competitive scene

why do you still not get that avicus is dead and by introducing new gamemodes wont make it more popular. why do you think you removed nexus and walls? why do you think no1 likes avicus anymore because of its gamemodes? you should honestly stop wasting your time into this server, invest it in life or school, these are matters that are worth spending time on. you all need to stop seeking for causes on why no1 plays it anymore and focus on improving on the only gamemode you have that is popular.

Frenzy is more of a game you need lots of players and lots of players doesn't like to wait for players to join. Also,&nbsp;it's a&nbsp;team game and&nbsp;in public matches it's harder to work together than in scrims<br>So what if we made a megascrim with frenzy maps sometime?

What about we remove the idea we stole from OCN altogether and work on making DTM a wonderful gamemode and raising the player count.

Even though it's a DTM server, maybe put a map of CTW and a map of Frenzy, so it can introduce new players to these gamemodes since everyone plays Destroy.
