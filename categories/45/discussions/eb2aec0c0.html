Hey, so I recently made an appeal but it was denied. So since I don't really have time or MC anymore I have decided to quit some reasons are personal other are drama and school related. I know I made an apology post before but I came back and spat in a mods face (you know who you are). I would like to say sorry to everyone for What I have done to you and I hope you forgive me.&nbsp;<br><br><br>I will be on the forums once a day if I get the chance. I don't think I'm gonna appeal again but if I do I will do it in 7months to a year.<br><br><br>Minecraft and Avicus have been a great experience I have grown since I first played minecraft as a person and a player.<br><br><br>Here are some people who helped me along the way.<br><br>MLGPorky: you were like on of my best friends I could remember that video (Gladiator) were you targeted me xD I wish you luck in school and your channel.<br><br>Vlad: I love you and your channel (no homo)<br>Especially your soccer videos.<br><br>Mango: Your a great admin and a great person. I know you will do a great job helping avicus grow. I remember when I played with you on your build server cya m8.<br><br>Staff Team: I know most of us got off on the wrong foot and I realized that now but I'd like to say I'm sorry and Thanks.<br><br>Avicus Community: this server probably has one of the best community's even if it is full of salt sometimes but anyone who joins is most likely to stay for a very long time.&nbsp;<br><br><br>Good Luck Avicus :D

Sorry but you've made too many apology threads and you've lost credibility. I will believe you if you've actually changed.
