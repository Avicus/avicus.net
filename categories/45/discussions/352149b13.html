I have 10k credits to somone for a cape, had it for a few minutes, went to change it and I couldnt because it got transfered to another account. I forgot the person name but you can probably find it in the chat logs of 7:50-8:00 am Estern today (december 9th 2015)<br><br><br>I need to contact the person so I can deal with it.<br><br>Thnaks in advance

You can't expect giving 10k creds for a cape that costs real money and not get scammed. Seriously, not to bash you or anything, but you really don't know the Internet if you think this isn't going to happen...<br><br>Anyways, 10k creds isn't much.

And you believe that? Did he give you any proof?<br><br>Even if he does have 5 capes, you think someone is going to give you a cape for 10k creds and not take it back if he can. He just took 10k creds from someone and didn't lose anything. There are tons of these people on the Internet, it's pretty sad.
