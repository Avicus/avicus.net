Use cheatbreaker?

</h1>
As many of you know, Cheatbreaker is said to be released on July 21. Which is&nbsp;tomorrow! What is Cheatbreaker? Well its a Client-side anticheat and modpack that is a client, which means you put it in your .versions folder and run! It is said to be not able to run hacks on it, Means that Injection Clients and AutoClickers wont be able to inject into cheatbreaker. Plus, servers with the cheatbreaker plugin has players that ONLY use Cheatbreaker, meaning that you cannot play with Labymod or Forge, you must use Cheatbreaker, since Cheatbreaker is notcapable of injection clients and auto clickers, there will Be&nbsp;<b>LESS HACKERS.</b><br>If you use another version other then Cheatbreaker,&nbsp;<b>You wont be able to play, meaning LESS HAXERS<br></b>Plus, If you get banned from a server with cheatbreaker,&nbsp;<b>YOU WILL BE BANNED FROM ALL CHEATBREAKER SERVERS.<br></b>Another thing is that Cheatbreaker will not allow you to play on VPN's and Proxy's <b>, LESS IPBAN EVADING<br></b>That means that if you get banned from a newbie server with cheatbreaker, You will get banned from over 1000 servers that use cheatbreaker plugin, pretty insane, and if every server uses it, You cant play on pretty much any server for like a year.&nbsp;<br><b><br>So, I suggest we should use Cheatbreaker and this should settle causalities , This will also fix the "avicus has no anticheat" meme and will fix those blatant fly hackers! Welp, we will see what will happen, Hopefully we use this plugin and client to our advantage and decrease hackers!<br><br>PS: Welp Cheatbreaker is 1.7 XD, i thought it was 1.8.<br><br>Maybe one day they will update to 1.8 :D</b>

Ah? Correct me if I'm wrong but cheat breaker is for 1.7.10? We support 1.8+ so cheatbreaker won't be doing anything for us.

CheatBreaker isn't being released on the 21st. I've asked EddythePro (one of the owners of MineHQ) and he said that it wont be out on the date like they said it would.<br><br>Also, CheatBreaker isn't an anti-cheat, its a minecraft version. So if we wanted an anti-cheat like Guardian that works with CheatBreaker, then we'd have to pay A LOT of money, which I dont see happening since they did also turn down Hypixels offer. As well as the CheatBreaker plugin, it will be a lot of money to pay for and I dont see it happening.

Eh, its all the servers with cheatbreaker, not including the ones that dont, but you know, the big servers like Mineplex and all dem aren't really going to put it but some PVP servers like MineHQ and others will definitely enforce it.<br><br>I do get what you mean though, I mean, being banned on a server with cheatbreaker gets u banned From All the servers with cheatbreaker, If Cheatbreaker rises to power, One sign of hacking and boom, 1 year of a HWID ban. And HWID bans are quite difficult to bypass.
