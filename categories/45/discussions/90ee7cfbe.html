Erm. I need some help from some technical geek.<br>So I was downloading some Emulators when I found I had a program called "<i>Reg Clean Pro</i>" installed. I had no Idea what it was so I tried to remove it. But it was still there. Then my laptop started going all slow and started to frequently crash. Please help. Google just gives me some complicated shit that i'm pretty sure isn't english :(<br>Love<br>Trans

Scan the program first and see if it is the cause of the program. Scan your computer with your anti virus and try to find the virus. Contact me on skype.

RegClean Pro presents itself as a free system-optimization utility and registry cleaner that rids Windows of system errors and stray files. Registry cleaners are extremely powerful 
applications that can damage the registry by using aggressive cleaning 
routines and cause your computer to become unstable, i.e. crash. <br><br>Go to Start&gt;Control Panel&gt;Programs&gt;Uninstall a program&gt;Right click RegClean Pro and click "Uninstall". Next, scan your computer with a reputable anti-virus software, and check to see if there are any bits and pieces left from any unwanted programs.<br><br>This may or may not be 100% correct, so don't judge me as I found this myself from the internet. Hope this helped :)

See my post! Uninstalling the program will not help you, scanning won't help you either.<br><br><a href="http://avicus.net/forums/6a4fa8604?page=2#reply103041" rel="nofollow">http://avicus.net/forums/6a4fa8604?page=2#reply103041</a>
