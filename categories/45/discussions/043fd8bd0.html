MC 1.9 is here, the long awaited Combat Update.<br><br>I haven't really investigated much about it yet, but I was wondering when and if Avicus is going to test 1.9 servers and eventually implant them?<br><br>Please answer if you know, cheers.

All I have to say is that they shouldn't have called it the "Combat Update", it ruined PVP... pl0xz nu update&nbsp;<br><br>I will say it's pretty good for survival worlds though. :D

I will say that I believe we are not updating at this current moment, but I was told this a couple weeks ago. <br><br>To appease some concerns about the punishing combat effect that the update imposes, there is a Spigot plugin that disables all pvp-aspects that 1.9 implements, I believe it's still in development. Although, I'm not entirely positive if it will be used.&nbsp;<br><br>You will definitely know when and if we update, there will for sure be an updated post about it.&nbsp;<br><br>All concerns are known about this update, but mind you, moving forward with this update or future 9.x at some point or another will happen.

It's soooo glitchy omg. Plus servers aren't even compatible with it except Arkham and hypixel, and hypixel doesn't even work. The shields and stuff that you place in your left hand are Sooo glitchy and just disappear. I'm sure 9.1 will be an update on making things more reliable

I'm sure that many server didn't like this update. I mean... It fucked the PvP. We can say #RipPvP2k16. But as Tiger said, I believe that they will change it with 1.9.1. Cuz this update looks like unplayable. We can't wait for 2.0 xd

1.9 is not that bad I gave it a few tests just get used to it.<br><br>Most pvpers don't wanna update and stay in the dull 1.7/1.8 because they can't adapt. IMO a true pvper can adapt to any combat situation. Also autoclickers can't really do anything in 1.9 because it is not about how fast you can click now it's about timing your clicks<br><br>You can also fly now with wings which is pretty cool it's not hugely OP.<br><br>Avicus will probably stay in 1.8 for the time being because they only updated like what 4/5 months ago + they still got some things to focus on.

1.9 really messed with pvp. Yes, we can all get used to it, and yes there are people who do like it.&nbsp;<br><br>That being said, 1.9 PvP is pretty bad. Whereas other updates may have changed some aspects, they have never done it to this degree. Nowadays PvP is fast pace and about landing hits and combos. The 1.9 update slows this pace down and pretty much makes combos useless. This slow pace does not work well with Avicus gamemodes, especially nebula's quick rush and kill tactics. In addition, it will completely screw over popular PvP gamemodes. Pot PVP will now take 5 years, Gapple will become a joke, and you might as well just remove sword pvp from Build/UHC, with the indirect buff to bows and iPvP.&nbsp;<br><br>Also about wings not being hugely OP...wings + skybridge = rip defense<br><br>Just my thoughts. I believe that change can be a good thing but this is too much.

Yes it's true you have to adapt to an update can't always stick in the past.<br><br>When I remember playing in 2012 mc pvp was basically blockhitting and jump hitting (critcal hits) to win but then we adapted and played in a new form of pvp a year later&nbsp; of strafing, clicking fast, aiming, etc. Obviously now that is not the case in 1.9 so we have to adapt in order to carry on playing and just finding out new ways.<br><br>It's like when you move house and you been in that house a long time you gotta adjust to the new house and get used to it.<br><br>Believe me, I don't particularly like the 1.9 update&nbsp; but the reason most people hate 1.9 is because of the sword cool down and I agree 100%. It Is bs, many people have practised pvp and learned to 
jitter/butterfly/whatever click and now mojang is pretty much saying f*** you to our faces.

There's a huge difference between adapting to 1.7 to 1.9 than any other version, it's not even comparable.&nbsp;<br><br>1.9 isn't going to be fun and it's going to be a complete waste of an update from a pvp standpoint &nbsp;(I say that generally as the people who say it's a good update are either trash at pvp, don't know what the fuck they're talking about or 9 year old kids who play sg).<br><br>Not many people are going to adapt to it as it's cancer to pvp - which obviously means they're not true pvpers!

Map building wise this update is useless, because there's only new purple end blocks which aren't that nice to look at, the only change in gameplay (excluding pvp) is wings; that could be very cool with limitations of course.
