NuclearDucky. I've had 0 infractions since the day, the hour, the second I joined. It was like this for such a long time. Until I made a mistake. I was kicked for Team Grief.<br><b><br></b><b>How?</b><br>&nbsp;It was a peaceful game in CherrylandMc when I killed someone who had a stack of TNT. I noticed a pack of decked out blueberries killing my team. I planted the dynamite and let loose a round. BAM! Then, I said "gtg." Because my Dad was calling me. When I came back I noticed I had been kicked. I was thinking it was because of being AFK too long. Wrong. I had been kicked for Team Grief. I believe Emerald may have gotten a little mad when I said gtg because he may have thought i was gonna grief and quickly leave.<br><b>Why?<br></b><b>&nbsp;</b>The opponents were breaching.<br><br>This is NOT me asking for it to be removed from my records. I am asking for forgiveness. From those in that game and EmeraldSword. Also, thank you Suli7 for answering some of my questions. And for helping me out a bit. Some may think it's stupid to be making a post about a "kick". It isn't. At least, for me it isn't. I have been here for years and had a clean record. I always looked at my infractions and smiled at how I had none. I jinxed it. Please forgive me.<br><br>NuclearDucky.

When I got my first kick for swearing by PeachyYas when I didnt I got mad and made threads asking to clean it from my record and staff keept deleting it and I reposting it, i think that was one of the reasons for me getting banned anyway I know how u feel.

I was playing Senex once and was really mad when a person broke one block and spleefed 7 people.

I think your making a big deal out of a little kick. My only infraction was a temporary ban for team spleefing (I had no clue I got banned until months later when I was looking at my profile picture)

I have 2 infractions.<br><br>#1: A mod told me that you can report yourself. I tested it, and that same mod kicked me for False Reporting. Wow.<br><br>#2: Was a test by Gill. There was some confusion about Gill's account being hacked, so I let him kick me to test his account.
