DLL? .dll files are files which are used for applictions/programs. I'm not sure if it means some dll files have issues, but if it is, try to reinstall Skype!

I reinstalled Skype already and my hardrive isn't full. I think it might be a virus which is associated with my email hack which is still trying to be worked out. So yeah I don't think it was that

So, I have recently upgraded to Windows 10, I play on a Laptop so when I use Skype it's already built in. But when I try to call someone it ends the call and says "your playback device isn't working" anyone have any way to fix this? If so I will be on Edawg TS if you would like to help me step by step
