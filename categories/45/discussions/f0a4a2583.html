Hello everyone!&nbsp;<br><br>I will explain my situation. I am currently playing on Minecraft PE, but I encountered this situation just yesterday. If I want to play in the Realms with my friends, I need to "sign in" to Xbox Live. On my other phone, it would direct me to page where it would let me sign in, but for some reason, it doesn't let me.&nbsp;<br>Here is a video so that you guys can take a clear look at the situation:<a href="https://youtu.be/T4wF_5KmUuM" title="Link: https://youtu.be/T4wF_5KmUuM">https://youtu.be/T4wF_5KmUuM</a>&nbsp;<br>Any help would be GREATLY appreciated! Thank you very much, I hope you all have a great day bye! ;)

What&nbsp;version of MCPE do you currently have?<br>Is this the first time it's happened?<br>Have you made sure your wifi connection is stable before attempting to connect?

It could be a bug with the Xbox app.<br><br>Force close both Minecraft and the Xbox app,<br>Then uninstall the Xbox app,<br>Now, log on like you normally would in Minecraft.<br><br>See if that works.

Some people who have had a similar issue have said that changing their region in their settings have fixed it, you could try that and see if it works.<br>Although from what I've read, it doesn't have the best success rate.<br><br>Try updating to the latest Andriod update and see if that changes anything.

If it still isn't working by now then it's most probably a bug.<br>You might just have to wait until the next MCPE version comes out.<br>(when it gets fixed)<br><br>It's a known bug and I assume it'll be fine in the next update.<br><br>Sorry :(

Firstly, thank you for all of your advices and tips you gave me so far. To be honest, I have tried all of those already, but I said, "hey, why not try it again?" and "what harm will it do?" Thank you very much ;)&nbsp;<br><br>Also, it is ok. xD I guess I should wait like you said. Thank you for all of your help.
