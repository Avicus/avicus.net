Recently when I started my computer, this popped up<br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/g55XBpc.png" title="Image: http://i.imgur.com/g55XBpc.png"><br>Sorry for bad highlighting xD<br><br>But yeah and when you click on it, it explains that it is a limited time offer to get Windows 10 for free. Does anyone else also get that or I am special?

idk, I'm debating if I should do it. I'm waiting until it gets released and wait maybe half a year or so. Windows 10 is free for upgrade on windows 7 &amp; 8.1 users for the first year prior to release (July 29th).<br>I do recommend waiting and getting the review of silly people who get it prior to coming out, as they have the full version (not test like people already have which is full of bugs).<br>I will only get it&nbsp;<b>if</b> the reviews are good in about 5-6-7 months. Maybe less if reviews are over 80 or 90% positive

Do you happen to have any of these versions (Windows 7 Enterprise, Windows 8/8.1 Enterprise, and Windows RT/RT 8.1.)? If you do, you aren't eligible, if you don't, just wait for the app to pop up, if it doesn't, just get Windows 10 from Microsoft when it releases. Just because you're not getting the app doesn't mean you won't be able to upgrade, unless of course, you have one of the editions I listed above.<br><br><img src="http://i.gyazo.com/471242d3e3d650dac687419a89ec9272.png" title="Image: http://i.gyazo.com/471242d3e3d650dac687419a89ec9272.png">

Now that I'm looking into this more, it really doesn't seem that bad. Only thing I don't really like is that the theme is a little too simple (non transparent task bar, icons). Now, I'm just basing that off the pictures I've seen, so if there is like a setting to change them I would like that.<br><a href="http://www.techradar.com/us/reviews/pc-mac/software/operating-systems/windows-10-1267364/review/1" title="Link: http://www.techradar.com/us/reviews/pc-mac/software/operating-systems/windows-10-1267364/review/1">http://www.techradar.com/us/reviews/pc-mac/software/operating-systems/windows-10-1267364/review/1</a><br>I <i>might</i> get it :)

Oh, and to add onto this post, windows 10 is probably the&nbsp;<b>last</b> windows system they will be making. But instead of making a grand opening with new windows versions it will be getting updated more frequently to fix all bugs and make it the "perfect" windows out there :o&nbsp;<br>So keep that in mind, might be a good idea to get windows 10.<br>But like I previously said, best to wait a few months for the review (After June 29th 2016 windows 10 will no longer be free)

I got windows 10 running on 3 pcs, a laptop of my dad, then on a laptop for working and 800€ custom built pc by me used for gaming by a friend. From what I have noticed is that for working it is really good and the multitasking is incredible. It is also really fast. For gaming, the performance didn't change yet, but I think the new Direct X isn't implemented yet. Can't say anything about cortana as it isn't available in my country
