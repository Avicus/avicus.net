Many people think they are Minecraft pros, but how are you a minecarft pro. As Minecarft got several things like redstone, PVP, Modpacks ... &nbsp;I think you have to be able to be very good in all of them. Share your opinions !

Some youtubers are really good. Some focus on other things then others. Direwolf20 mostly knows everything about the mods, sethbling is very good with commandblocks and zip krowd are beastly in survival.

ALL HAIL TEAMCRAFTED.<br><br>But really, I consider anyone a minecraft pro if they know the basics of building, basics of PvP, basics of coding/configs, basics of server hosting, and basics of commands.

Actually youtubers are nearly the only ones who play minecraft as their job, so they actually&nbsp;<u>are</u> minecraft professionals.

You have to be decent at all Minecraft elements, or be very well specialized in one element.

There is no such thing as a minecraft pro. There is over 99999999999 things to do in minecraft, no one can do them all. In my mind, we are all pros. Sethbling, redstone. Sky, trying to get people to smoke budder (its a drug look it up), Warrior making GG maps, etc. :)

Well, there's a lot of things to do in Minecraft (like a lot of people said.) Let me try and come up with some examples...<br><ul><li><b><i>PVP</i></b> - Killing other people for fun. I don't really know any "pros" but there's definitely some out there</li><li><b><i>Building</i></b> - One of the main aspects of Minecraft. Build teams like Gazamo and Mithrintia, and building experts like AwarriorVenom and the Paras :3 are a few examples</li><li><b><i>Survival</i></b><i></i> - Another main aspect of Minecraft. I consider some people on the HermitCraft/Mindcrack servers to be pros. Xisuma, for example, is a pro in my eyes. He looks through every mechanic of Minecraft (even going through its code) and tries to come up with ways that will use these mechanics to his advantage in survival. He's even good in building as well :O</li><li><b><i>Parkour</i></b><i></i> - Another part of MC, though a bit minor. There are a lot of people that are good at it ;)</li><li><b><i>Redstone/Command Blocks</i></b><i></i> - I classify them as two different things, but SethBling did/does both. There are a lot of people who work with these things. I classify them as two because I see redstone as mechanics using pistons, t-flip-flops, basic/complex circuits, hoppers, etc. Command Blocks is more about using the commands themselves. However, you need redstone to use Command Blocks, so they are closely linked. Some people are good with redstone and not command blocks, but most people who are good with command blocks are also decent/good in redstone<b>.</b></li><li><b><i><b>Progammers/Modders</b></i><b> - </b><i></i></b><i></i>These are the guys that either make servers/plugins for servers, and the guys who develop modifications for Minecraft. I don't know any specific people for modders. However, we all know who created Avicus/core ;)<i></i><br></li></ul>
