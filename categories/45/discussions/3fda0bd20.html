Staff can't be on every second, which is why we encourage players to record/screenshot evidence and send in online reports&nbsp;so that players can be banned as soon as possible if there are no staff on.<br><br>People forget that we are a volunteer staff team. <br>We can only be so active and do so much.

*sigh*&nbsp;<br>As you all know, staff are human. Most of us have school every, if not most, days. We don't do this as a job. We don't get paid. We do this because we want to help the community, and what payment do we get? A forum post saying that the whole staff team is a joke... What a fucking deal, sign me up!&nbsp;<br>Wanna know what I find a joke? How most of us try and try, and when some of us get a well deserved break for school, we all get blamed because it took 30 minutes to ban one hacker. I understand it sounds bad but you gotta understand, we aren't robots, we are human beings who have lives outside of this server and this game.<br><br>Oh, you had homework, assignments and anything that will help progress your future outside of a block game instead of moderating?&nbsp;<br>No one in their right mind would say, "This essay I have due tomorrow can wait, I have to moderate Avicus!" They don't. We all prioritize our real lives over Avicus, and it will always be like that<br><br>Trying to balance moderating with school, work, a social life and all the rest is easier said than done.&nbsp;We can't be on all day, everyday. As good as it sounds, it will never happen.

I'm tired of hearing "mods have lives"[WE KNOW YOU DO, ALMOST ALL OF US DO]&nbsp;"we cant cover all day". Rombeyy is right, <i>multiple </i>times today it would take 20-30 minutes to get a moderator online to ban a hacker, or to help in chat. Its ridiculous. I've been informed that &nbsp;a lot of staff are on leave currently, then something needs to be done by the staff team to fill in for those leave positions. It is one of the most peak times and days. A weekend, mid day for Americans, and no staff online.&nbsp;There are about&nbsp; ten mods that I rarely see online, or when they do come online, they are afk or don't do jack. You're right, the server cant be covered 24/7 but I bet half the mod team has the ability to get on when needed, they just choose not to. One of the best excuses is "oh I'm on leave I don't have to get on" the funniest part is those people have the ability to get on. We are fed up with the excuses, fix it, because I've heard some players want to leave because its getting outrageous. Seems you aren't recruiting active mods, but mods that meet other criteria's. TAKE THE FEEDBACK, DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. Because right now, you guys are just making excuses<br>+1 to cammy, always gets on when needed, great mod, deserves a break but he cant take one because all other 15 mods are never on. Alex and Pie are also some first responders, its strange its the same people each time..

Rombeyy, me parece un poco gracioso que hagas este post sinceramente. Quisiera dar mi opinión de lo que acabas de escribir pero Cammy tiene toda la razón del mundo, y la razón es que no somos robots, somos humanos y la verdad es que no nos podemos conectar todos los días. Nuestro "trabajo" es voluntario, no nos pagan y esto no es la vida real.<br>Nosotros hacemos lo que podemos para conectarnos el día al día pero si no se puede ya esta, nuestra vida no se va a basar en moderar este servidor para toda la vida.<br><br>Abrir las aplicaciones sinceramente no va a servir, pero ¿qué te hace pensar que vas a estar conectado todas las horas del día por 7 días jugando en Avicus?. Ese es el punto que estas tratando de llegar ¿no? que los staff se conecten cada minuto. Pero no, el staff <u>NO ES UNA BROMA</u> como tu dices, me da un poco de tristeza que especialmente tu digas esto.<br><br>Congrats&nbsp;<img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/31f2ccc2c0779b0e5e2c4d8cd7cc3701?s=20&amp;default=mm" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/Camemes.html" style="color: none">Camemes</a>, you explained everything really good.

There's a difference between making excuses and providing answers.<br><br>Also, I said it was <b>midday for New Zealand, not for America.</b><br>It's about 6pm EST.<br><br>Senior Moderators don't moderate as frequently as Moderators because they have other jobs to do apart from Moderating.<br><br>And yes, there are some mods (like me :P) who are currently on leave so there's not much we can do about that..<br><br><br>Which leaves aboooout 20ish people let's say.<br><br>I do agree that the staff in general need to work on their activity as a prioirty but there's only so much time 20 people can cover.<br><br>With only 20 people, you're gonna get some quiet spots unfortunately.<br><br>Youre asking us to 'be more active' but sometimes it's not that easy.

Yesterday I was playing against 3 bhoppers for two hours I thought them being banned.<br><br>Yeah I know it's hard to be a staff member. I did it for over a year on a server with a 1-3k player base. But seriously it seems not hard to jump on for ten minutes after school or before bed or some shit just to see if anyone needs help or if there are any hackers.

Here's a solution: Aim staff applications at younger players (i.e. 14 year olds). I don't know of many countries where they have important exams at the end of the year. This will reduce the number of LOAs being taken whilst providing the server with mods who are capable of getting on.<br><br>However, since you want to keep slandering the staff team, consider this little problem; the server's population mostly consists of Western Hemisphere players. This means that players are undoubtedly going to be vulnerable during other times. There's no work-around for this. No mod is going to keep playing into unreasonable times just to stop a hacker on a block game server. Personally, I'd rather have mods that are active during some times rather than no mods due to the mods all quitting due to unreasonable times being demanded of them.<br><br><br>As others are already stated, these staff members are volunteers. They willingly give up their free time to make&nbsp;<b>your&nbsp;</b>gaming experience on the server enjoyable.

Cammy put this perfectly, but just as an example, and I know a lot of staff would agree with me here:<br><br>I get on as soon as I get home as long as I have no homework. If I have homework then I am on when I am done with that. The only time I wouldn't be on is if I want to play CS:GO or if I am catching up on my Netflix shows. Other then that you can only Moderate for so long without getting bored. Just like you guys, we get bored, we don't always enjoy Avicus. One person can't stay online for 10 hours a day just because the community wants them to be. It's just too much. Try playing one game from the moment you get home from school to an hour before you go to bed. You would be bored after a few hours. I understand that we need to be more active, and that makes sense, but there's also a line between inactivity and just being busy or bored.

Most of them have school around the same time, meaning the times that most people are complaining about are around 6am-4pm EST. That would be the time most staff are at school, depending on what grade and/or timezone they are in. Sure, there are a fair amount of staff, but there are also times where it's just really hard to have someone online. Between school, work, and sleep a lot of people only get a few hours a day free.

Those are most of the people that apply. There is also a lot less people in other time zones, meaning they may not apply, and even if they do that doesn't mean they are mature enough or meet the requirements to be a Moderator. There are a lot of things that play into this, not just the fact that most applicants that are accepted are around the same timezone.

Who said anything about school on weekends? Although weekends tend to be people's only time to do stuff, because there is no school. Meaning there is even less time for moderating.&nbsp;<br><br>Also for this topic at least, the weekends are my "time off". I spend a lot of time on Avicus during the week, and the weekends are the only days that my IRL friends can be online. I spend most of my day in a Skype call with them, playing other servers or other games. If they are not on and I have nothing else to do, then sure I'll get on, but I spend all week on Avicus, on the weekend the last thing I want to do is get on Avicus again. I'm not sure how true this is for other Moderators, but this is how my schedule is.

en ningun momento dije que tienen que estar cada segundo, tienen staffs de casi todas partes del mundo desde EU y AU hasta en chile, cosa que deberia dar una ventaja al STAFF para poder tener gente en teoria en cualquier hora del dia no un staff en especifico.

Here's a solution: Make the next staff apps exclusive to Eastern Hemisphere players since the west has too much and the mod team is getting bigger.<br><br>It may be controversial but Avicus simply has too much people in Western TZs instead of the East.

Hello Rombeyy and everyone else on this thread.&nbsp;<br><br>As we can see there is an ongoing problem of not having enough staff members online at a moment, causing the server to go without staff members and hackers are flying and ruining the game. I understand the moment when there is a hacker online and you wish someone could come online and fix the game for you, which is what the moderators are supposed to be accomplishing.<br><br>At the moment I am compiling feedback and suggestions form this post noting activity. This has been an issue for a while and the idea of tackling it seems like a new and interesting subject for me and the community to come up solutions for. As one community member suggested tightening the organization area when moderators come online or should we be changing how we do moderator applications in the future,<br><br>Like I said before, the challenges of this certain topic is that this hasn't been worked on in the past, where we have been trying the same solution since McZone first came out and hoped that it would work. It seems that this will not stand for any longer and we will have to take a different approach on the matter, which in itself comes with the possibility of a trial and error approach.<br><br>If there are any questions/suggestions about what you guys think just reply to me and I will answer about this topic in hand.

'<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">However, since you want to keep slandering the staff team, consider this little problem; the server's population mostly consists of Western Hemisphere players. This means that players are undoubtedly going to be vulnerable during other times. There's no work-around for this. No mod is going to keep playing into unreasonable times just to stop a hacker on a block game server. Personally, I'd rather have mods that are active during some times rather than no mods due to the mods all quitting due to unreasonable times being demanded of them.'<br><br>Ergo, it's difficult to get Eastern mods.</span>

I'm tired of hearing "mods have lives"[WE KNOW YOU DO, ALMOST ALL OF US DO]&nbsp;"we cant cover all day". Rombeyy is right, <i>multiple </i>times today it would take 20-30 minutes to get a moderator online to ban a hacker, or to help in chat. Its ridiculous. I've been informed that &nbsp;a lot of staff are on leave currently, then something needs to be done by the staff team to fill in for those leave positions. It is one of the most peak times and days. A weekend, mid day for Americans, and no staff online.&nbsp;There are about&nbsp; ten mods that I rarely see online, or when they do come online, they are afk or don't do jack. You're right, the server cant be covered 24/7 but I bet half the mod team has the ability to get on when needed, they just choose not to. One of the best excuses is "oh I'm on leave I don't have to get on" the funniest part is those people have the ability to get on. We are fed up with the excuses, fix it, because I've heard some players want to leave because its getting outrageous. Seems you aren't recruiting active mods, but mods that meet other criteria's. TAKE THE FEEDBACK, DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. Because right now, you guys are just making excuses<br>+1 to cammy, always gets on when needed, great mod, deserves a break but he cant take one because all other 15 mods are never on. Alex and Pie are also some first responders, its strange its the same people each time..

I understand mods have lives outside of minecraft too, but if you can not balance your outside life and being active on mc then maybe you should not be mod?

I hope you realize majority of us applied to become a Mod and some referred, including myself. However, at the time of applying, we may of had more freetime as it was break or the beginning of school where there wasn't as much assignments assigned as of now as we are mid way through the school year. I see life as weather, it can be forcasted to be sunny the next day, but unexpectedly turns out to be raining. That will cause some delays to go anywhere or do anything. Irl activites creates delays on how long it will take to be available for our extra stuff we enjoy in our freetime, such as playing Minecraft and moderating if you are passionated qbout it. Every journey has a detour, from tiny to large.

'<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">However, since you want to keep slandering the staff team, consider this little problem; the server's population mostly consists of Western Hemisphere players. This means that players are undoubtedly going to be vulnerable during other times. There's no work-around for this.

Guys the staff is trying their hardest. They volunteered to look over the server. They have lives they can't be on all day every day. They are not a joke. They punish cheaters and toxic people when they are on. If their are no staff on you can record or screenshot evidence so they can be banned later. Respect the staff members don't call the staff team a joke.

Sorry but it takes a lot more mods on any server to accomplish mods on at every second of the day and even then they still have their own lives just like you do (at least I hope). Servers like mineplex and hypixel can accomplish this because of their near 300-500+ staff team and even there you rarely find a staff member. If you can name a server that can accomplish this with a smaller mod team then I'd be impressed

Staff members aren't just judged on their "last seen ingame" on their profile. You can view their rate of punishments over a period of time and decide if they are actually do anything. That's what that feature on the punishment page is there for.

Hello Rombeyy and everyone else on this thread.&nbsp;<br><br>As we can see there is an ongoing problem of not having enough staff members online at a moment, causing the server to go without staff members and hackers are flying and ruining the game. I understand the moment when there is a hacker online and you wish someone could come online and fix the game for you, which is what the moderators are supposed to be accomplishing.<br><br>At the moment I am compiling feedback and suggestions form this post noting activity. This has been an issue for a while and the idea of tackling it seems like a new and interesting subject for me and the community to come up solutions for. As one community member suggested tightening the organization area when moderators come online or should we be changing how we do moderator applications in the future,<br><br>Like I said before, the challenges of this certain topic is that this hasn't been worked on in the past, where we have been trying the same solution since McZone first came out and hoped that it would work. It seems that this will not stand for any longer and we will have to take a different approach on the matter, which in itself comes with the possibility of a trial and error approach.<br><br>If there are any questions/suggestions about what you guys think just reply to me and I will answer about this topic in hand.

no no, just saying the mod who is more active, the rest also come, but not so much and that should change, there are more less 14 hours in which there are ppl active, and each hour should have one mod ^

Tu post me parece un poco ridículo, no podemos estar siempre conectados, por que tenemos cosas que hacer mas importante que jugar y/o moderar en un servidor. Si quieres hacer algo bueno por el servidor te pediría que dejes de tener esas actitudes que afectan a la comunidad y mantén respeto hacia el personal por que se lo merece. Yo no considero que el Staff sea una broma por que se hace lo posible por mejorar la comunidad y cubriendo el mayor tiempo posible.<br><br>- Diego

Yo afecto a la comunidad? Mira el post y vasa ver como hay gente que piensa lo mismo que yo por lo que no es una idea mía sino de otros jugadores también y entiendo que haya otras cosas en la vida cotidiana por qué también fui staffs en otros servers pero si no tenes el tiempo necesario para moderar entonces para que seguís con un rango que otra persona más activa y que puede ayudar más puede tener.

Si lo es, es ridículo que pienses que este servidor o cualquier otro tenga staff 24/7 lo cual es imposible, recuerda que ellos hacen esto gratis, por lo tanto no tiene horarios pero si un tiempo de horas determinados al día, que no haya staff a la hora que tu quieras o en ese momento solamente llámalo excepción.

If you see this happening, you can take a screenshot of chat, and report the players accusing others of hacking (by creating a report on the forums).

How about you go play on other similar servers and compare the staff? We have a very efficient staff team and all you do is whine about it.

I'm not going to be rude about this, but you guys are complaining a lot about the staff team needing more member in other timezones. I agree with this, but if we are going to be honest, do we really want some of them as a staff member? Are they mature enough, do they know enough about hack detection, are they really going to do any better then what it is now? I haven't been on very often during the night in my time, because I'm normally asleep, but from the little I've seen there are very few mature people during those hours. There are definitely not any that stood out to me as staff member material.&nbsp;<br><br>Sometimes you have to make a choice between having a hacker online for 30 minutes or having a staff member who will be very immature and may not even really know what they are doing. The first option is much better, not only because that person could false ban a lot of people, but it also makes the staff team as a whole look bad. With this topic already in question, that's not something anyone wants right now.

Currently it is exam times for a large portion of the staff here, myself included. Which is why, or at least why I took a leave, most people are on leave ATM (to focus on studies all that).<br><br>This should pretty much clear up by February.

Speaking from experience, the EU timezone is not going to improve. Even when myself and several other mods were moderating we would have periods where no one would be on. As previously suggested, opening up applications for only people in the Eastern Hemisphere or Europe would not be a bad idea.<br><br><br>Also, this thread is amazing. Its like the old days. Mods defending themselves with everyone flaming top notch 10/10.

This sums it up, they will NOT demote inactive people, whether you are a ref, media, mod, sr mod whatever, BUT if you do anything they don't like or break a "rule" no matter how active you are doneso. There's a SR mod who hasn't been on in 3 months and they said "oh we warned him" probably 3/4 of the media/red team is never on, they aren't really required until tournament, but even last tournament they weren't. NOT ONE has been demoted
