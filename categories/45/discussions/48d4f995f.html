Removal of Censorships

</h1>
<span style="  font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial;   background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">Hey, I'm Zac as ya'll probably know. I've
dropped this issue for a while but have decided to bring it up again. This is
the argument of Anti-Censorship. As those who have followed my arguments on
this know I am against censorship in all forms. For the sake of this discussion
I will be forming my side into main sections to organize how people address
this post.</span><span style="  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><br>
<br>
<b>The N-word<br>
</b><span style="background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial;   background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">The
N-word has two forms. I hope that for the sake of adequately explaining my side
people will make an exception and allow me to fully quote a source. To show
that I do follow the rules even if I disagree with them however I will refer to
them as N-word-a and N-word-er when using them in my own content.</span><br>
</span><span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;
color:#2C353C;
">"Nigger; a black man with a slavery chain around his
neck. Nigga; a black man with a gold chain on his neck."<span class="apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><br>
-Tupac Shakur.&nbsp;<br>
<span style="  font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(85, 85, 85); background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial;   background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"></span>The N-word-er was historically used to oppress the
African-American people during their slavery and following periods of
discrimination against the minority. It has since been transformed into
N-word-a which while not only representative of N-word-er there are key
differences. Both however have been used by the Hip Hop movement and other
African-American empowering communities to prove the lack of power that word
holds over them as a people.&nbsp;While
N-word-er was originally purposed to support oppression, it was re-purposed to
show the lack of power that words have by overusing and common-izing the word.&nbsp;</span><span style="  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><br>
<br>
<b>Killing of Self/ Self harm</b><br>
<span style="background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial;   background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">Killing
oneself is a terrible and selfish action fueled by a desire for either
attention or end of suffering. It has become widely used especially around
gaming communities as a go-to insult.&nbsp;However such statements allow for
the development of social norms and the throwing off of the great level of pity
that normally accompanies such events. Making such events a topic of regular
discussion rather than a taboo topic not only encourages people to more openly
discuss their emotional and chemical imbalances but also allows for the self
pity hope of creating public pity to be destroyed leaving less motivation for
such actions to occur.</span><br>
<br>
<b>Satire<br>
</b><span style="background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial;   background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">Knowing
that there are other aspects than the negative connotations that come with
these topics; we can open ourselves to a new type of education for ourselves,
one designed not only to give us information efficiently but mixed with it's
own substance to allow it to hold the attention of the immediate gratification
society the new generation is being brought up in. The popularity and
effectiveness of this new form of education can be seen throughout popular
society. Whether it be the political satire of the Daily Show or the celebrity
satire of Katt Williams or even the twitch streamer persona of Brittney Venti,
satire is undeniably present and effective at publishing a message and
therefore should not be censored as it not only is contrary to the good of the
development of society but supports a world of oppression, division and silence.</span></span>

Satire breaks down barriers it shouldn't be limited to serve the feelings of individuals under the guise of rudeness.<br>Labeling something racist or rude encourages people to continue to taboo the subjects and give those statements merit as tools of oppression.

All of your points are pretty bad with the exception of the one surrounding killing yourself.<br><br>You're basically saying we should stop doing/saying such things for the sake of people being bothered by it, correct? According to your example, none of those people had a solid base to back up their opinions so in all honesty, censorship here should be a thing as long as the group of people who are against it provide a somewhat decent point of view over the situation to prove the opposite. Saying 'no' is not enough.

This is a minecraft server for teenagers, yes most understand racism and such but that doesn't mean that individuals won't be offended or hurt by suggestive comments. Satire provokes unnecessary arguments and hence can be incredibly harmful. The use of the N word is highly derogatory and has the same connotations as using terms such as "Paki" or "Jigaboo<span>." Assuming that just because it doesnt end with "er" is an incredibly stupid argument as it is the exact same term just spoken in slang. Also, saying "Nigga" in a rap song is HIGHLY different then saying "Nigger" to someone's face. Again this is not a server for toxic and rude people, its for people to actually have fun and not be plagued with rude and offensive terms.</span><span><b><br></b></span>

There's a thin line between satire and blatant rudeness and disrespect. No one deserves to be a victim of abuse, and while the idea of removing the effectiveness of these words/phrases in society is something that I whole-heartedly support, the sad truth is that it will never happen. Humanity has always used words that are intended to insult, and even if these words and phrases were removed, new words would inevitably be used in their place.<br><br>Also, while it's true that the N-word could have its effectiveness removed in society, telling someone to commit suicide should never be allowed. Using such a grave and significant term so flippantly is a terrible thing to do. Thus, I don't believe that people who commit suicide are seeking attention. More often than not, it's the media who publicise this information as if they have any right to, and as such people begin to believe that, "oh, he committed suicide because he wanted to be famous" or, "she's just thinking of herself". Some people feel that they don't have a choice, and if the removal of censorship were to occur, I believe that this rather ignorant viewpoint must be addressed and removed.

Saying nigger on the internet is different than to someone's face too. <br><br>The server can be fun without staff running around trying to make everyone happy. I think that nigger and nigga should both be allowed, continuing to censor it just gives the word more power and increases the animosity around it. Censoring the word undoes the work of those who want to remove the word's power and in turn empower those it profiles.

All properly functioning humans have a desire for social acceptance to help us work as a unit. This instinct can overwhelm us and cause us to end our lives thinking in our deaths that we will be remembered in a way that grants us social acceptance. Look at news coverage of a child who kills themselves after bullying. Everyone says the kid was nice or sweet but had issues adjusting, despite the positive feedback on the child they were bullied. The way media glorifies and reveres people who kill themselves teaches youth suicide is almost heroic. It's shit but it plays to our instincts.

Can you link me to that study? I don't see how scientists could carry out a study on the motives behind suicide. It's nigh impossible to divulge the nature of a suicide since the person is no longer capable of providing this information.<br><br>There are other ways to eliminate the effectiveness of derogatory terms. I highly doubt that if it was acceptable to say these words that people would be happy to wait an immeasurable amount of time for a term to become ineffective.

The society we live in is theoretically connected more than ever, however I feel more lonely texting than with someone. Strange huh? A screen doesn't actually build relationships? Who'd have guessed it?

There is a social theory of weak vs strong bonds. Weak requires little sacrifice and is ussually supported by society. Strong requires a lot of sacrifice and is often against society. A movement like Anti-Censorship is a weak bond movement requiring little/no sacrifice.

Racism and encouragement of self harm should never be allowed under any circumstance. Satire is fine if it doesn't involve the use of any inappropriate or racist language.

I've never seen suicide glorified.<br><br>Moving along, what exactly do you want to achieve out of this topic? If it's cancelling the censorship on the topics you listed earlier, I do have quite the problem with that.

I like how Zac actually thinks that censorship on Avicus is going to chance xD<br><br>Certain words, images, phrases etc. are censored for a reason.<br>It's to protect people.&nbsp;<br><br>In terms of Avicus, the player base ranges from approx. 12-18<br>Meaning that most of the community are classified as kids.<br><br>Thing is, the majority of people don't share the same opinion as Zac for obvious reasons.&nbsp;<br>Zac wants the words nigga and nigger to be allowed and references the historical backgrounds of these words, however, the reason why these words will<i> never&nbsp;</i>be allowed to say is because when someone says it, it's normally used as a derogatory and disrespectful manner.&nbsp;<br><br>Most people refer to these words as harmful and very rarely refer to them in a historical sense.<br><br>Regardless of personal opinion, nothing will change because..well..common sense xD<br><br>Could you imagine Avicus actually allowing this lol<br><br>/endrant<br><i>crawls back into the dark cave of inactivity</i>

All properly functioning humans have a desire for social acceptance to help us work as a unit. This instinct can overwhelm us and cause us to end our lives thinking in our deaths that we will be remembered in a way that grants us social acceptance. Look at news coverage of a child who kills themselves after bullying. Everyone says the kid was nice or sweet but had issues adjusting, despite the positive feedback on the child they were bullied. The way media glorifies and reveres people who kill themselves teaches youth suicide is almost heroic. It's shit but it plays to our instincts.

Some people like me don't have a problem with this, but others do. We have 10-12 year olds playing on this server, so I highly doubt any of them would appreciate this.
