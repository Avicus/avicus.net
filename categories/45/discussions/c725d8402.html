Hello, not to long ago I started live streaming on Twitch, there should be a rank that atleast tells others that you are a broadcaster and also would be cool if you could click on the broadcasters name in game and it would bring you to the stream or something like that. I just think it would be cool and a fun and easy way to grow your channel and your server capabilities! Please reply and tell me what you all think, thank you!

This is practically the same as the VIP rank, which is 5000 subscribers, and the YouTuber rank, which is 50,000 subscribers.<br><br>To have a Twitch rank, there should probably be some type of requirement as well.

Twitch is perfect for Avicus too because its SO EASY!!! Its literly in game at the press of f6 and so much advertising so fast and its so perfect! Broadcaster should be rewarded with a rank because they a literally FREE advertisement for Avicus!

Yes, it would be great to notify others. I would say 5K like glitchy.&nbsp;<br>Avicus should really be having a main YouTuber. Let's wait for Tynvale to reach 5K! ^-^

If you want that rank then you have to play/stream on Avicus and as everybody can see you weren't on the server for more than 3 months...

Back on topic guys.<br>For the twitch it should be the same as VIP and YouTuber's amount of subscribers.

Actually it should be #Tynvale5k2k15<br><br>But, I agree with Glitchy, 5k gets you VIP and 25k gets you the Twitch rank.
