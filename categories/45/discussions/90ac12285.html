[Rant] Apple.
by
<a href='/users/MidnightBeats.html' style='color: Gray'>MidnightBeats</a>
<small>September 17, 2014 at  5:09 PM UTC</small>
</h1>
<span><span><span>So this is just a little rant i'm doing. Now before I begin this rant, let me just clarify that&nbsp;<b>I DO NOT HATE APPLE'S PRODUCTS!&nbsp;</b>Nothing is perfect (If you have't realized that, go home), and I'm simply stating the bad things I've seen over the time that I've been using their products. I use Apple Product's myself and I enjoy using them. These are just the problems I've seen.<br><br>If you don't like my rant, that's fine. I won't get butthurt and I take constructive criticism well.&nbsp;</span>EDIT: This has been a long time since I've done one of my rants so I'm going all out here. <span><br><br>So first off...<br><b>THEIR iPHONE CHARGERS.<br></b><br>Jesus. Don't even get me started. Their chargers suck, and they are such a pain in the ass. I've had four of them break over the course of 3 months. People always tell me "treat your chargers better and they won't break." Um no. Their chargers just naturally break. I plugged one into my brother's iPad and I pulled it out. It snapped. And I wasn't even pulling hard. Of course, I've had to go replace them, which is such a pain. And because it's APPLE, their chargers are like $30. I've had to spend over $100 on CHARGERS alone. Just recently, another of my chargers broke and I'm not about to go pull $30 out of my wallet.</span></span><br><br><b>The Price.</b></span><br><span><span><span><span>Apple, we all know you use some quality material&nbsp;to make your phones and tablets but let's be honest. The price is too much. Who the&nbsp;hell wants to pay $400 for an iPad&nbsp;2? And&nbsp;$600 for&nbsp;the iPad Air? Hell no.&nbsp;And we know that your products are good, but I've seen Android make some better shit than you have for a cheaper price.<b>&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;<br></span><b></b></span><b></b></span><b><br></b><b><br></b><b>Seeing little kids with it.</b></span><br><span><b>Y</b>es, I've seen one too many kids with an iPhone 5s. And then I see their parents with like a flip phone. I take a little look at the kid, and the kid glares at me or gives me a smart-ass look, knowing that he has a better phone than me. My only thought. Go shit yourself.Why the hell does a little kid have the NEWEST phone (this was before the iPhone 6)? This kid already looks like a spoiled brat and you are giving him a device that he SURE as HELL doesn't NEED! People tell me, "There's a reason he might need a phone." Duh, Probably. But why the hell would you give him an iPhone 5s? Just get him a) a Prepaid phone b) Home Phone and c) (If you're really going to give him an iPhone...) iPhone 4s and below.<span><br><br></span><br><span>Finally.<br><b>iPhone 6.<br></b><br>My God, just build the iPod touch 6. So currently I use an iPod 5 (because I feel no need to have a phone atm. No I'm not crazy), and after looking at the iPhone 6 design, I just shook my head and said "what's the difference?" Actually, the iPod 5 and iPhone 6 are so similar. The only major difference? Larger screen and the ability to use data and call. What I don't like about the iPhone 6? CAMERA.&nbsp;<br>So yes, I like to take pictures, whether it be of scenery or just a still picture, I really like to just capture a photo. But the new camera on the iPhone 6? No. The thing I hated about the iPod touch 5 is the camera that comes out a little (because the iPod touch 5 is so thin), and now they had to pass that idea on to iPhone 6. Forget the new iPhone- If i get a chance to get one, I'll just stick with the 5S.<br><br><b></b>So I know this was a short rant, I'll add on to it later if you have any suggestions.&nbsp;<br><br>If you agree, just say so. If you don't, then OK!&nbsp;<br>Just DON'T START A FLAME WAR!<br><br>Is there really a reason to start a fight over a product?<br>No.<br><br>So thanks and in off topic,<br>Good luck everyone in their Mod Applications (To those who are applying).<br><br>Midnight</span></span>

I agree, as some people in TS might know my charger is the biggest pain in the ass. The cable has literally peeled on itself leaving the cables out (I dun even care). I usually stop playing because the charger fails too realise it needs too charge my computer..

No matter how much I love Apple, I just hate their chargers. Every time I get a new apple handheld device, the charger just breaks in less than 2 weeks because of how it bends. Like for real, fix the real problem, Apple. Secondly, the iPhone 6. The iPhone 6 is basically an iPhone 5s in an iPod touch 5 generation shell. Nothing too spectacular, which saddens me..

Ok, I'm not trying to be rude, but I wanna counter your arguments. I'm not trying to start a flame war at all.<br><br><b>Chargers</b><br>"<span>Their chargers just naturally break." They really don't, if you take good care of them. I bought an iPhone 4S when it came out, in November 2011. The charger is still good as new. And also, if you do actually break one, you can just buy a more affordable one on Amazon or something; I've gotten like a 5-pack of chargers for $10, and they work fine.<br><br><b>Price<br></b></span><span>"Who the&nbsp;hell wants to pay $400 for an iPad&nbsp;2? And&nbsp;$600 for&nbsp;the iPad Air?" iPad 2 is no longer sold by Apple. The iPad Air is $500, only $50 more than the Surface RT, and $50 less than the Galaxy Tab 10.5. You have to admit, Apple products are higher quality. Plastic vs Aluminum. Gorilla Glass 3 vs ion-strengthened glass.<br></span><br><b>Seeing little kids with it.<br></b>I completely agree with you on this one. It really pisses me off when I have to work like 16 hours each weekend to earn money, and little kids get a free phone from their parents.<br><br><b>iPhone 6<br></b>Honestly, the iPhone 6 is a lot different from the iPod Touch 5th generation. The iPhone 6 has a much larger screen, as already mentioned, but also has a handful of new features, including a NFC chip, a 401 ppi display, Touch ID, and a motion coprocessor, which makes performance a lot better. I do have to agree, though, that most new features it has, Android has already been using for years. However, Android has an NFC chip, but Google never made agreements with credit card companies to implement a feature like ApplePay.

I have never had any problems with Apple chargers...<br><br>And what Apple is doing is like Beats headphones.&nbsp;<br>They are worth so much because of the brand name, while not actually being worth the price. However, so many people buy them just because it's Apple.<br>Which is actually very smart on their side, as people actually fall for it.&nbsp;<br>The first thing I have seen Apple do to not just earn a bunch of money is release is the iPhone 5c, which then again is made with a cheap design that will cause it to break very easily.

Yeah, the things Apple do is basically a gimmick. They dramatized the iPhone 5c in order to make it look good, despite the fact that the material used to make the phone is cheap.

"you drop em 3 feet and they break"&nbsp;Not true at all. My brother dropped his iPhone way too many times, and it's still like new.<br><br>"if you're gonna update it to a whole nother number, at least add something" They actually add new features to iPhones, if you pay any attention to new product releases, you'd know. iPhone to iPhone 3G: added 3G compatibility. 3GS to 4: wallpapers, retina display, etc. 4S to 5: made a bigger screen, a lot thinner, and a more durable display. I'm not gonna describe every product release, but these are just some that I could think off the top of my head.

i know they added stuff then, i'm talking about this update. and when i say nothing, i of course mean that they didn't add any number of significant features. i was also exaggerating when i said the 3 feet thing, although i have seen that happen a few times.<br><br>i'm not saying i don't like what apple has done in the past. i still like many apple features and products, i'm just complaining about the things that are annoying :D

If you're implying that the iPhone 6 has no new significant features, then you're very wrong. ApplePay, larger screen, and optical image stabilization are just some of the main features. Especially ApplePay, when so many credit card companies already support it, and so many retailers and restaurants accept it. Why do you think four million people, including me, stayed up last Friday, trying to order one?

Oh no. I hate this company so much that I bought their newest MP3 player. Really?<br>I've never had a problem with a charger except for the rubber bit starting to peel away a bit after about 6-7 years. Their products are well built. The build quality is of a much higher standard than that of any android phone, or windows computer. I don't like the company, but I don't come up with ridiculous points against it.
