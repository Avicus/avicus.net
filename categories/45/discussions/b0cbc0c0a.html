Tomorrow- my time- the annual&nbsp;<b>Star Wars</b> day takes place. Personally I'm not a crazy fan, but I still enjoy watching all seven episodes. There's been an awakening... (oh yes I just went there) of May the 4th offers! A major one in my eyes is that you can purchase a BB-8 for just $129.99.<br><img src="http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0170/5178/products/bb8-charger-1_1024x1024.png?v=1441428782" title="Image: http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0170/5178/products/bb8-charger-1_1024x1024.png?v=1441428782"><br><br><ul><li>What's your favourite episode?</li><li>Who's your favourite character?</li><li>Sith or Jedi?</li></ul>Have a good one! c;<br><br>P.S: May the force be with you

Episode 3/5 - Yes, I enjoyed one of the prequels. Don't judge me!<br>Mace Windu - It's Samuel L Jackson with a purple lightsaber. What's not to love?<br>Sith - Cooler outfits and can shoot lightning.<br><br>P.S: I will forgive the awful Star Wars puns only this once. &gt;_&lt;

What's your favourite episode? Certainly not 7, 1, or 2...I would have to say either Episode 3 or 6.<br><br>Who's your favourite character? Obi-Wan, Domino Squad, Delta Squad, Commander Cody, Commander Thorn, Captain Rex...yeah, I like clones, lol.<br><br>Sith or Jedi? Honestly, both of them are really corrupt. Sith want power, and the masters know their apprentices are gonna kill them but let them live anyways. The Jedi claim to be peacekeepers yet enter and lead a war for 3 years...Sith have much better force abilities, Jedi's (sometimes) have the more peaceful and brave morals.

Yes, but the Sith have awesome outfits!<br><br>Also, the Jedi can use all of the Sith's abilities (e.g. force lightning). They just choose not to because they think it's too aggressive. Well, according to the old (and true) EU, anyway.

<b>What's your favourite episode?&nbsp;</b>As much as I like the originals, I don't understand why people hate on the prequels so much. I think i prefer the latest though, just because it opens up so many more possibilities for the series.<br><b>Who's your favourite character?&nbsp;</b>General Grevious (legend), Yoda and Captian Rex<br><b>Sith or Jedi?&nbsp;</b>Jedi
