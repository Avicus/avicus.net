When that happens quickly place blocks under you. Because that make the glowstone reappear then break it again. It works for me

This was a server-wide problem - no one could do anything. No one could pvp, and everyone kept breaking the mons because no one could hit them

It's the server being glitchy. Happened ever since the anti cheat was brought back. Rubber bands, poor hit detection, block lag and even going through blocks you place.

Calm down don't feel sick over glowstone. Can't tell you anything besides its a glitch, I recommend placing blocks under you quickly as well.

The server was restarted a couple hours ago to fix the problems. If you do however see another bug make sure to post it in GitHub.

I don't know first hand because I haven't been on the server, but I'm 99% they are fixed from what the Devs said.
