after talking with thetntdude with stuff, i just wanted to get into what issues i have..<br><br>to keep it short and sweet, i'm very afraid of people and come across harsh and rude because dominance of others is sometimes keeps people at bay from hurting me. when i decided to reapply, i didnt have those intentions to be dominant and think others as inferior to me. i wanted to just fit in and be someone liked and try to contribute, along the way making friends. that's why i believe i'm better as staff this time around, but still issues arise a lot and a bit too much. with me on tons of drugs, chemo, friends ruining my childhood, i realize the world is a twisted augmentation of bad. not one thing good comes out of anything and the only thing that brought me joy was becoming staff here. otherwise, i might not even be around.<br><br>with some supportive friends like thetntdude and evocal, i still have tons of wounds that are yet to heal that make me shield myself from others to be antisocial. avicus has shaped me up a bit because the staff are a family. it has a big role in my life from which i never want to escape which may happen eventually. the staff is super supportive and the worst thing i ever did was hurt them by leaking stuff from howsie and yoav and all the others. i love them. <br><br>rooting back from elementary, i've had issues with people for forever. teachers used to insist i have adhd and make fun of me, while i had to switch schools back and forth. in the process, i was constantly bullied by everyone and my life was a bore even at the age of 5 when i knew something wasn't right. when i went to elementary, i wanted a mask of authority so eventually i signed up to be apart of a safety patrol. after 4 years of bullying there coming home and crying everyday, it felt good to actually be doing something. i was even more disliked though as that and got into several physical fights.<br><br>that year, i got blackmailed and everything wrong happened. what happened during all these times was impossible to cope with however i did have one thing on my side; objects. objects don't hurt me and they're a little thing that i hug on and cry against as a shield, though sometimes dented. i try to show love for everything but what happens is just backstabbing and all kinds of terrible things. currently i rely on a pillow which i hug 24/7 and never let go of, i used to have a blue basketball at pe which was my friend. i didn't care about judgement or anything and upon writing this, i want to open up to the community. i hid it and it was my friend after emotional scarring from some other people. i'd cry when i left it and i'd cry when i'd see it. though kids used to bully through that utility by stealing it, and making fun of me for my cuddling, that didn't change anything and i tried to look past judgement.<br><br>now onto all the hospitalization and chemo and stuff, it's horrible but there's still a light at the end of the road. i'm getting stuck in puddles and i'm drowning. i can only do but so much by myself and life is becoming darker and the lights are burning out. i'm stuck at home all the time and i haven't gone anywhere in 6 years, nor have had the opportunity to make friends that don't hurt me.<br><br>from this, lots of friends i've gotten recently they take advantage of me and do the same exact stuff that everyone else used to do. it feels bad and i can't do anything about it plus it's not just the computer. i get a lot of false hope and all this breaks down into several broken shards labeled with negativity. when it comes back to me several (and i mean several) of my friends cut and physically injure themselves, it injures ME. and from what i can do behind the screen, i'm limited.<br><br>this box... this box that i'm in. it's shut closed and the only opportunity to get out is through you guys. you're the last string i grasp onto and you make me feel alright. avicus, sorry for the story which is probably going to be terrible, i just want to say thank you for your servings of occasional comfort and especially to the staff... there's 10x more worse than listed here but i dont feel like writing.<br><br>i still have no friends irl, but sometimes things are good while they last. thank you avicus for everything<br>edit; also from what i'm getting one of my friends is killing themself which isn't that good.

Para, you must survive. Remain strong and tenacious. You&nbsp;<i><b>will&nbsp;</b></i><b></b>defeat this disease. I believe in you.&nbsp;<br><br>A week ago, my mother had a heart attack. Clogging in the cardiac tissue and arteries. But she survived and she is still the kick ass Nigerian mother that I love so much.<br><br>You must remain strong and reserved. And if worst comes to worse, (god forbid) you have to take it with calm resignation and meet with the deity of religion. You are one of the best peeps here Para. Keep strong and don't lose yourself, bro.<br><br>-One of your friends, Zintenka.

Stay strong, dude. I know that probably sounds redundant, but that's all you can do. Just keep going. Find a driving force, and live for it. If that's Avicus, great. If not, that's great too. Do what you love and love what you do and you can push through anything that comes your way.

Para, we are here for you and we will always be here for you. I cannot think of any advise for you because you are deep in darkness however I can say that by people hitting or insulting you they are trying to make you sad to make them self look good so if you beat them by just ignoring them and pushing them away you will be winning, not just against them but as your future.

Why do kids have to be so damn useless at recognizing when something is bad. This is not 'i cri', 'aww para bb' shit. This is real. Sorry if i am picking on you rez but you were the first example i found. But para dude this is depressing, always keep in mind that no matter what cards life deal you, there is always good ones. Stay strong and hang tight because i know you can beat your illnesses, i know you can beat depression, i know you can beat societies non understanding, unsympathetic glare. Just push through it, in the end it will all be ok. Any time you need comforting, help or consolation please, talk to people before you do something that could make a worse impact on life. My skype is b.banno321 if you ever want anything don't hesitate to chat. Lots of respect and great wishes from bmb.
