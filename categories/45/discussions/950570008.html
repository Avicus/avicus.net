Hey guys.<br><br>Some of you are already aware, but many of you are not. I have left Avicus and Minecraft in general roughly one and a half months ago. I left without properly saying goodbye, and I truly regret leaving an amazing community without saying goodbye. I would like to keep this rather short and simple, but I would like to thank each and every single one of you for giving me the best gaming experience ever. I have thought about leaving many many times before, but the amazing community has kept me for such a long time. However, after my demotion I just felt there was no need to be here. I felt that I have served enough time here, and I needed to move on. I concluded my thoughts and decided to leave. I have burned my eyesight for this game, lost almost all of my physical fitness abilities, and dropped my grades and lost motivation in school. After only one month+ of leaving, I have gotten almost all of my physical fitness abilities that I had before playing so much Minecraft, became an honor roll student in my school meaning I have gotten straight A's for the last half of the school year. I know that if I come back to Minecraft, I will go back to being unhealthy. Enough rambling, seriously, I couldn't thank you all enough. My journey here on Avicus has been amazing, I met so many people, became staff on here, which was my dream. However, we all have our times where we feel we need to leave, and my time was last month. I will probably never be returning. Thank you all for giving me one of the best times of my life, I love each and every one of you. Goodbye.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><b>P.S:</b> I would still love to be able to talk to you guys, so&nbsp;<i>please</i> message me on Skype sometime @<b>peteplayzmc</b>. However, if you wish to add me, tell me who you are. :) &lt;3&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Thank you all, I love you.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MajestysDream &nbsp;/ Peter.

Thank you very much, you seem like an awesome guy yourself! ;) You don't have to follow my steps in leaving Minecraft, but if you really feel like you need to, do so. However, you can just take a little break until your grades have improved, but I do suggest thinking of something because school is&nbsp;<i>very</i> important. It all depends on what <i></i>state your grades are at (how good or bad they are). Goodbye man, I wish you good luck with your grades and everything in general. ;)

Aww cya man. You were probably my greatest friend on Avicus. I remember we would play all day long over the summer and we would wreck on Walls. I thank you for letting me have so much fun.<br><br>-FrankenRavi
