A guy said "jgkid, turn off your kill aura" I said "ok, off" I got an infraction as a warn saying dont joke about hacks. I didnt even know that was a rule and a lot of forumers joke like that and they dont get yelled at or anything. I was dumb to trust that topic on "what to do if someone says you hack" on the old forums somewhere. This lead to my first infraction a few minutes ago :(.

Once back in around 5th grade (I was around 12 years old) &nbsp;I was at the side of my house, practising golf. &nbsp;While practising, I decided it would be cool to shoot it off of my house, which in the end was not cool. &nbsp;I procceded to shoot it off the brick wall of my house, then the golf ball bounced back, and hit my forehead. &nbsp;<br><br><br>I also remember when I was practising golf again, but this time on my front lawn. &nbsp;I thought it was cool to hit the ball down my street, and see how far I could hit it. &nbsp;At the time I didn't consider the cars at the side of the road, and how golf balls like to make dents in them...

one time in Ocn, there was a huge map and it was my first day there. I was pretty lost. Then i saw people trying to climb up into a room which was the wool room. I get ladders and build ladders so they can get across the wall. Little did i know that i was helping the enemy get tough the last wool room. In the end, they won, and i was a scrub.<br><br>another thing was where i was in a match in Ocn, i made a scatter cannon but i forgot to put slabs. When i tried to fire it, the tnt fell to my own teams base and i team killed by accident :(.

3 things<br><br><br>1. I turned my pen into a "sniper" (can shoot everything in a 10m radius) and I shot my teachers laptop, turns out I broke it... screen and cords were broken...<br><br>2. I was like, 3 and I stole my mothers wallet and hid it, for a whole year, she cancelled her credit cards etc... she found it... I was in SO MUCH TROUBLE...<br><br>3. last year I decided to take those water skim balls, take of the outside layer, set it on fire, and throw it at my cousin's friend's neighbor... as usuall it blows up, but this blew up his stove, all his windows and his TV... &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;all these are TRUE and may be hilarious, but it caused me a lot of trouble...
