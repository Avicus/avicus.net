Once again, Banned for extremely shitty reasons, Not gonna mention anyone but all you need to do is look at my last two infractions.&nbsp;<br>Well. Cheers for people Like Iron, BmB Notal, Kiwi for giving me fun times.<br>But sometimes bias does get a bit bad, and I guess i was affected by that.<br>cya

Before you insult the staff more than you already do, go on ahead and take a moment to remember that we are people too, like you. Do you think we enjoy your constant rudeness and harassment?
