Once again, Banned for extremely shitty reasons, Not gonna mention anyone but all you need to do is look at my last two infractions.&nbsp;<br>Well. Cheers for people Like Iron, BmB Notal, Kiwi for giving me fun times.<br>But sometimes bias does get a bit bad, and I guess i was affected by that.<br>cya

Before you insult the staff more than you already do, go on ahead and take a moment to remember that we are people too, like you. Do you think we enjoy your constant rudeness and harassment?

Insread of appealing you already ban evaded, so you made it even more of a sound ban. You made it the absolute opposite of rediculous through your actions.
