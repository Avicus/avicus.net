DDoS.<br>It stands for Distributed Denial of Service. It is completely illegal and could bring your ass right to prison in most countries if you do enough damage.<br><br>I wouldn't get involved in this stuff, so just be aware when people say this kinda stuff.

To put it very simply, it is when you send a large amount of&nbsp;<b>ping</b> or information to a certain IP address. I wouldn't do this if I were you, since it is illegal, as tino said.

To elaborate a bit more, it's when it floods your router with packets to slow down your internet. When a website is ddosed, it's sorta like you refresh the page. Except the difference is that it requests the page x amount of times per millisecond, which is insane. For example, if you set your booter to request a page, let's say, 100 times per millisecond, then it's basically like refreshing the page 100 times in a much less than a second. That's pretty damn lethal.<br><br>Edit: When I say flood your router, I mean it's someone else flooding your router. Also, ddos slows the other person(s)' internet as well.

If someone says they're going to DDoS/DoS you on Avicus, report them. &nbsp;If you do get DDoS/DoSed, contact your ISP.<br><br>'nuff said.
