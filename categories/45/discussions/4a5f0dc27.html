So I know I can't be unbanned atm, but I was wondering if I could do anything in my power right now to get unbanned sooner?&nbsp;<br><br>-PaperNinja

You don't send one to support anymore :P<br><br>I think you should try making an appeal under the "Appeal an Infraction" tab located under Policy. Who knows, your ban might be shortened.

You can create an appeal under the "Appeal an Infraction" tab, as Gallant stated.<br>Since you have waited over three months, your ban might be lifted or shortened if your appeal is well written and sincere.<br><br>Good luck with appealing!

Just for future reference, I don't think he needs to be told to make an appeal 3 times. If there is a reason for this however, pl0x inform me :P
