This is really sad, and it haves to stop. But please, please, please.<br><br>The "praying" every time there is something like this is getting a bit annoying.<br><br>I don't know whether this time it was a jihadist attack or whatever, but most of the time the Pray thing is used on these cases. It seems like an eye by eye; and although I'm sure you don't mean it in that way, it feels to me like that. Like it encourages one religion vs another, I don't know. But there are other ways to show you care and getting involved than making "pray" stuff, imo.<br><br>Anyway, I hope the best for the injuried and feel really bad for the families and friends of the victims.

It doesn't matter, he is trying to inform you as well as sharing his sadness in his own way, try and be appreciative of that rather than this attitude.<br><br>It is true people do die everyday, however this does not make it okay for people to go on rampages or killing sprees.

Update: The shooter was a 15 year old who was bullied and was inspired by Anders Breivik. He also used advertising to draw more people to the restaurant.
