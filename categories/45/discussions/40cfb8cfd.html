I have a chance to move to Hamburg, Germany. Now I am living in Istanbul, I go to a Collage, and getting prepared for an exam that will change my destiny next year. As you know, there is no exam to be placed in a High-School in Germany. And unfortunately I'll be going school for 7 days next year. If I move to Germany, I'll be living with my father cuz my mom and father aren't married. I'm really confused. I really need help. If you are living in Germany, please tell me how school stuffs work there. I'm probably gonna move to Hamburg but still need to read your ideas about this. Please tell me what to do: Staying Istanbul or moving to Germany (btw I cannot speak German, if I move there I'll spend my first year with learning German)

I would suggest staying in Istanbul. You already knows how everything works, you don't speak German, you don't know their laws or rules. Stay where you would be more comfortable

But the education in here isn't decent =/. And if I cannot get a good mark in exam, my life will be very bad. But if I go to Germany, everything will be better. I am probably gonna move there but I'm afraid =[ Cuz i believe that it's gonna be better for my destiny.

Like stated above, Germany has one of the best, if not, the best education system but they are really strict. Meaning you are&nbsp;<b>not</b> allowed to miss a day of school -&gt; Learnt this from people who lived in Germany when I met them in Cuba.<br><br>Probably will be a bit harder than what you have and maybe stricter as well(?) But may be worth going to.<br><br>EDIT: Not 100% sure how accurate this is but a lot of the time it's accurate:&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_education#Germany">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_education#Germany</a><br>I'm assuming that by muslim your beliefs are in the islamic religion(?) Not sure what y'all believe in, but if so there is that implemented in Germany from what is says in the link above.

I got summoned lol<br><br>Well, First of all Hamburg is a beautiful city! The Alster, the Port, basically the whole city!<br><br>Now school works in 3-4 parts: First part is the primary school (grades 1-4), then the secondary school is split into 3 types (Haupt- (grades 5-9) and Realschule (grades 5-10) and the Gymnasium -&gt; grades 5-12/13). Both of them are required.<br>Then you can decide to take training (Ausbildung) or you go to the university.<br>Overall the school system is very balanced and they try to help everyone to succeed.<br><br>Also the thing Vlad mentioned that we are strict when you miss a day isn't really true, the teachers will ask for an letter by your parents or you wit their signature so they know you were ill, at the doctor, etc. It's just a confirmation that you didn't skipped school.&nbsp;<br><br>Yes, most Germans have the christian belief, but in school there is a special class or classes that focus on Muslims and other beliefs.&nbsp;<br><br>Also school is most of the time free! Also university is free! You just have to buy simple things like pencils and stuff. Not sure about text books, but most of the time they are provided.<br><br>Germans are very open minded to other cultures. Although there is some discrimination by the PEGIDA (they are idiots xD), but you shouldn't worry too much about them.<br><br>If know how to speak basic German, there shouldn't be a problem to find a decent job. Most of the people will also accept people that can speak English + they sometimes even offer courses to improve the German skills of their employees.<br><br>If the education is Turkey isn't that good as you say, then I would move to Germany :)<br>If you have any more questions, contact me on Skype: <b>flo.schmenni</b> or just post in this thread :D

I would say so. The systems shouldn't be that different.<br>And from what I noticed, people feel themselves as a "German" pretty fast, but some people never ever feel like a "German Guy", maybe because they don't try to adapt :D

I never knew the university is free. I mean basic German language can be a problem in finding jobs at times. If the education isn't as good as you say, maybe you could even go somewhere else. But education is a top priority, as long as you can deal with everything else (language, religion, etc)

Lotta turks been moving to Germany as of late, you sure you gonna be all alone? I know when one of my teachers lived in Germany he had a decent community of turkish to support him and help him and stuff, cos Germany is a really popular place for Turkish immigrants. In all honesty I'd go Germany, cos Germany has top notch education and you can probably get more contacts and work experience there, cos While Turkey might be an advanced country, on the whole it's nowhere near as advanced as Germany.<br>Dats just my opinion tho c:

If I move there, I won't spend time with Turkish people. Cause I need to get adapted living like a German. Turkey, or Turkish people will mean nothing for me if I go there actually =/<br><br>And yeah, you are right! I've been searching for schools and education system in Germany and it's very much better than Turkish one. Schools teach us things that we'll not use in life here. I need to change my lifestyle.

Well, most of you guys live in good countries. England, USA, Spain, Germany, Holland, or Australia... But make sure that Turkey is a bad country, with its fucking annoying name xD. Jks:9 I don't care about its name. Anyways, if I move to German, my biggest problem will be I'm not gonna be able to see my mother everyday. It's gonna be once a month if I move there. But I believe that I should be brave and save myself from this bad country. Even I'll live bad things or bad situtations, I think that when I get &nbsp;25 years old, I will say 'I wish I'd move to German earlier!'

Not quite. You would have 6 weeks summer holidays, 2 weeks in autumn, 3 weeks winter/Christmas holidays, 2 weeks in spring and most of the holidays (1 day thingies) are on a Thursday or Tuesday, means that the Friday &nbsp;after such a day is off or that Monday before them is off.

If I would have the choice between a good education in another country or losing my bestest bestest friends (who I probably would still be able to be in contact with) I would always choose education.

When I change things in my life, I can adapt very quickly. This year, I changed my school and the first day of the school was kinda like my other schools first day for me. New things, makes me feel new feelings, but they don't make me think like 'Ohh God, things won't go like in the past, what should I do, help me!'. Actually I feel like 'I like new startings. Lez do it Borra!' That's why I don't feel very afraid unless it changes my life but this thing will change my life. But the thing that makes me feel happy in this situation is, I know that my life will be better. But I am not a person, who can decide how to feel anyways.

As someone who has lived in 5 different countries, and over 7 homes. Moving is quite hard, especially for the first few times. However, the friends you make are not the end of it. You have a budding life to wait for! So go out and take advantage of every opportunity you get! If you don't..... You might just regret it...

Friends are important aswell. However, in my opinion education is more important. But for others, it would be more important to stay with friends than to get a better education.<br><br>Borra, I suggest going to Germany, where the education is better. I had a chance that could change my life to move to a better school and I denied it because of my friends. But the thing is, if their REALLY your friends, they would make the effort to stay in touch. Also the universities are free which is a HUGE bonus/opportunity.
