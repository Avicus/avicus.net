Well. When school started again, tons of people became inactive and started leaving. Elimination also has tons of glitches and bugs currently. Like the compass not working and some players not able to join. This causes the game to get confusing and takes along time to win. Which also isn't fun. Im sure this is the reason, because it was more popular back in the days.

Elim is the best but yeah as Slic said the glitches still need to be worked out, and since it will never be the most popular game mode, it wont be fixed any time soon. Nebula will always be more popular and if Nebula has glitches then they come first. Which it does. A lot.
