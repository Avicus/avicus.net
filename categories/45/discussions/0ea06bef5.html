So I have done a little bit of thinking and have come to the decision that my moderation needs a good bit of work. As a mod I should be able to work with the community more and learn what they would want from me as a moderator (not sure if that's the best way to word this but I am running on no sleep as I type this)<br><br>So the big question and main point of this post is: What do you guys think I can do to improve my moderating? This has been a thought for a while now but at this point I feel like I should ask.&nbsp;<br><br>(Try to be serious with your answers, but it is fine if you have a small joke or something)

For the ban messages, I don't use the "Hacking - " bit because well, it isn't needed. From what I was told since my junior mod trial that as long is it kept consistent and says what is needed, it works just as well as the little "Hacking -" part<br><br>As for maturity, not going to lie I can be a goof when I shouldn't be, so I will take this into account :)

The main reason I wrote that bit was to give a reason for any grammatical errors as I get annoyed when I do that. As for prioritising minecraft over real life: WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE TO TELL ME THAT! Nah just kidding but on a serious note the only reason I said that is because I was awake since 12 am to what WAS about 4 or 5 pm; and obviously with school and having Firefighter stuff to do I will be tired. In the past I have been a little stupid to put videos games first but I have been getting way better at it. Nowadays I moderate when I feel like I can have fun playing on Avicus or if I get bored of PotPvP or railing people on Hypixel (4k on classic duels guys!) so I guess thats better than feeling forced to do a volunteer job.<br><br>As for getting involved with another area of the staff team, I could for sure handle having one or two more ranks, but to be fair I can't translate anything unless you want it in better english. For Referee, I am not going to put myself in a position where I feel like I wouldn't do much in or feel at all interestedin (this isn't to knock on those who are referees of course) and as for Builder.... HAAHHAHAAHAH no. I can barely even build a half decent house on singleplayer.

Don't be such a noob, Henry.<br><br>Jks, ily :D Anyways, you should not prioritise Minecraft over real life. It's hard to tell you how to improve your moderation, since you're already good enough, but I can try. A great way of improving your moderation is to lead the team, suggest new ideas that could hopefully improve the server and gaming experience on here.

I appreciate the love, and I have already done a lot with prioritising my life over Minecraft (I think). As for leading the team, I would gladly do that but sometimes, and I know it sounds kind of bad, I have 0 clue on what is even going on. Saying that, it is not exactly the best idea to try and lead the team when I haven't a clue on what I am doing. As for suggesting new ideas and improving the server, I could for sure do that (that isn't to say I won't work on leading the team though). As for the last bit, I would love to work in other areas of the staff team but not only do some seem not that appealing to me, it is also that I don't think I have any sort of skill besides being able to moderate a minecraft server that would benefit any other part of the staff team but maybe some day down the line I will branch out :)

I would reply to each of the points you've made but I'd rather not type out something that is way too long to read. In no way what you said was harsh since you are only giving an opinion, which is what I was expecting from making this post. From here on I'll work on improvement to being beyond a moderator rather than just as a moderator as you said (assuming I read it right). Thank you for your input :) I know I may have not had the best reply but if there is anything you want me to bring up I wil gladly do it.
