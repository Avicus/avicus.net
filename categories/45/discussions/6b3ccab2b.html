Naw don't bother about covering the world news.&nbsp;<br>You should interview some well known(ish) players on certain topics. You should definitely try and interview some senior staff. Focus on the large topics created this week. However not large as in ban player above you or who has best skin type of stuff more important things like updates, map releases, admin blog and some topics that have created discussion. You also need a gossip type page where you share rumours and other things (Because no newspaper would be complete without that. :D). Also make sure you create it on something compatible with all computers such as adobe reader. You could create it on word if you have it and then copy it across just make sure that you publish it on something compatible with most if not all computers. Have fun and i think this is a really great idea! Well done for creating this and i really hope you go through with it, make sure to make it consistent. Mkkay? &nbsp;<br><br>P.S: Create a better title for it than Avicus Weekly :P.

Yes or No?: YES!! This could really keep players updated! Especially old players who are returning.<br><br>What topics to focus on?: Star players, famous players, staff, and ESPECIALLY players who arent very popular. (Give them a chance)<br><br>Should there be a featured/upcoming posts section?: Not sure about that.... But we could certainly use a category called AviNews Channel where we could keep our topics.<br><br><span>Would you like it too cover real world news?: YES!! Make sections in the paper talking about popular #s and stuff! Or things like terrorism, etc.<br><br>WE NEED FUNKY TO SEE THIS.</span>
