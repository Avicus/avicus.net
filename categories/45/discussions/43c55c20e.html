warning! if you're gonna read this, you may found some cuss words around here because it's a rant.<br><br>ok this topic is about the grading system which is basically school. everyone does hate school but don't you hate it too when your parents are very strict about your grades? i'll make a rant each grading system of every country but, request me about your experience with your grading system at your country if you want me to rant about it here and you may wonder why did i created this topic? i'll start it off here which is basically i'll explain it why.<br><br><b>UNITED STATES OF AMERIC<b>A <br><br>grading system:<br>A 90-100<br>B 80-89<br>C 70-79<br>D 60-69<br>F (the worst of the worst) below 60<br><br></b></b>like what i said, the teachers are supposed to follow this. but then i got 84 and 85% and a C? WTF?! i'm only in middle school NOT high school. i was expecting like 2 C's that i'm gonna be concerned about it and yet i received 2 D's?! my mom almost grounded and ban me from my computer just because she just saw the grade with my school report which is in over all, in math, i got 85% a B NOT a C and 84% a B too which is not a &nbsp;C. i'm taking this blame to the school itself but do some schools have to do with this sometimes? from my experience yes. <b></b>but, before you blame the school blame your parents first if they didn't know about the grading system in your country. it's all messed up when that happens. this made me furious and my mom didn't believe me with what am i saying. she thinks i'm crazy and hallucinating but no. i know the grading system and so on but yet i received almost failing scores? how come?! they already converted everything and yet give me or people who are affected down there with low grades?!<b><b>&nbsp;</b></b>what&nbsp;is wrong with their system? <b></b><b></b>explain this to me please? i want my grades to be fixed or your argument is invalid. and what's worse? <b><b>getting grounded or getting&nbsp;scolded&nbsp;by your parents especially when you're Asian. their mind setting and&nbsp;everything&nbsp;with all the pressure.</b></b>&nbsp; but still, all the blame is to your parents. <br><br><b>UNITED KINGDOM<br><b>same with USA but:<br>E 49-62<br>F either below 49 or 60<br><br></b></b>nothing much to rant here because their system of education is good and many parents are also not that strict i believe. but there's one fucking problem. sometimes it all has to do with your uniform and stuff that you need to wear but it helps a lot (some people can't tolerate wearing formal uniforms and their manners). their english there is way deeper than USA because their words are very deep like for example: snuggling is kissing and ranting is raging. <b><b><br><br>THE ASIAN SCORING SYSTEM (i include all countries in asia):<br>A 90-100 <br>B 80-89<br>C 70-79<br>F below 70<br><br></b></b>i am gonna rant with this a lot why? because usually asian parents are like competing to each other like shit and also they're grade whores (most of them). just because you want them to push harder and beat them up to get high grades doesn't mean the child will <b></b>learn from it. just bullshit. can we just all get along like in a friendly way and not by battling to each other with brains and so on and so forth? and also, their education is way advance than any other countries around. in fact, the teachers here are very strict but some of them are fucking abusive like my teacher before. she even humiliated my friend in front of the class because my classmate is sorta lost while everyone's checking their papers.<b> </b>only rare schools have teachers who are very good and not beating children up just to learn their lesson. <b></b><b></b>and if a child fails, the teachers will have a very long talk to that child's parents and what will happened? either getting fucking beaten, grounded or being shouted like what i said at my last setence of my USA rant, they didn't realized there's always another chance. a BIG facepalm for that especially when it's only the first quarter or semester. they also feel superior about themselves too and they think they're always right as in always and every.single.fucking.move. no offence those are retards especially when they're being corrected when they made a mistake and they shouted at you, <b>DU<b>MMKOPFS. </b></b><b><b>just DUMMKOPFS.</b></b> they're not always the correct ones or whatever. but in the end, some will regret on what they've done to their child. like the saying of the golden rule and "the karma". <b><b><br></b></b><br><b><br><br>(more rants coming soon)</b><br><br><br><br>try your best. that's the moral lesson down there. when your parents or you are smart enough to know more deeper than your grades, always try your best even though you got all the B's and C's. at least you try and there's always another chance not like:<br><br>"<b>IDIOT! <b>I'M EXPECTING YOU TO HAVE HIGH GRADES EVERY QUARTER AND ALWAYS HAZ DE AWARDS!"</b></b><b><b><br>"ARE YOU KIDDING ME? THAT'S YOUR GRADE, YOU'RE GROUNDED." (not unless you got F's and not trying all your best.)<br><br></b></b>and so much stuff that your parents may be thinking of. so remember what i said. just try your best in school even you didn't get awards and honors. peace out! (i am mad right now so sorry about my cuss.)<b><b><br></b></b><b><b></b></b>

this sucks... but high school is much worse in america. i almost switched &nbsp;out of my high school to a school that doesn't have grades cause of how bad they are about grades in traditional high school.<br><br>but at least my parents don't really care as long as i pass.

People expect a lot from me cos im smart but i aint a grade whore. Long as I got a 90 or something i dun give a care in da world. Honestly tho there's no problem getting a B if somethin's hard like all you have to do is practise till you get better. Das all a grade is, a response from the teacher telin you if you needa improve something or what not. I mean, when you apply to da private colleges i dont believe grades matter as much as da SAT or AP tests or ACT and Subject tests, etc. Stuff you manage to accomplish is more important than da grades too. If you wanna go to a medical school I'm sure some subjects such as physics and computer science you can be behind in if you excel in biology and chem. People stress too much with grades cos they think uni is what's important. Just go to uni, learn a bunch a stuff, and move on. A lot of da older unis are good too even if they're just state stuff. Plus, you can get your bachelor's from anywhere but if you do particularly well you can easily get into better colleges for graduate school, etc.

I'm in 7th grade, everyone is wanting a better grading system. At least 10% should be added if the teacher sees that the student is trying and not goofing off or whatever, because it's not fair for a hard-working student to try their best on a test they don't get and then getting a 0%.

"<span>i am gonna rant with this a lot why? because usually asian parents are like competing to each other like shit and also <u><b>they're grade whores (most of them)</b></u>. just because you want them to push harder and beat them up to get high grades doesn't mean the child will&nbsp;<b></b>learn from it. just bullshit. can we just all get along like in a friendly way and not by battling to each other with brains and so on and so forth? and also, their education is way advance than any other countries around. "<br><br>I am honestly apalled by the ignorance and flat out disrespect in this statement. I suppose you don't include Eastern Russians, Afgans, Syrians in this?</span>

Well, asia wants to be the leading country in the world, obviously parents must dicipline their children to try. It may seem harsh, I'm asian, I get shouted at alot. But when I grow up, and be successfull, I'll thank my parents for pushing me to the limits.<br><br><br>Studies show that china may even be the leading country instead of the USA in a couple of years.

Mini Rant on a rant thread:<br><br>Stayed up to 1AM doing some Humanities homework (Totally wasn't watching anime) Finished it half way. The homework not the anime.<br>Teacher: You have to stay in at lunch to do your homework because you didn't spend time doing your homework.&nbsp;<br>Stays in* doesn't finish...cycle repeats. Next day* I'm half way through homework<br>teacher: Ok work on it. MIND BLOWN! Epileptic inducing screen of colors engages*&nbsp;<br><br>I swear to god school is full of wizardry BS. They have the ability to magically summon demon fairies that Choke holds your sleep, and punches with brass knuckles until it's bruised and exhausted.<br><br>Also...Missed 3 assignments: 80% to 40% = failing the class.

For the first three year of secondary school (our version of High school I think), you get marked like this:<br><br>A: 100% - 85%<br>B: 84% - 70%<br>C: 69% - 55%<br>D: 54% - 40% (lowest passing grade)<br>E: 39% - 25%<br>F: 25% - 10%<br><span>NG(NoGrade): 10% -0%<br></span><br>But then for the last three years of secondary school it gets much more complicated with A1, A2, A3 etc and then each grade is worth a certain amount of points.
