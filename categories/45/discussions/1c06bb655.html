I highly suggest you go the extra mile:<br><ul><li><b>Shadowplay:</b>&nbsp;<u>THE BEST<b></b></u> recorder, if has incredibly low file sizes and incredibly high quality.&nbsp;(comes free with an Nvidia graphics card)</li><li><b>Audacity:&nbsp;</b>Bad mic, no prob, if you browse a tutorial, you'll have smooth audio. (free)<br></li><li><b>Adobe After Effects:</b> It's a more complex Sony Vegas, it has more features and more possibilities, it has constant updates, fixes, great commodities, templates, tutorials and people that'll help you. It's harder than Sony Vegas though. (20$ per month)<br></li></ul>

ShadowPlay if you have a Nvidia card. Recorded this video with it. Raw, absolutely nothing done for quality or no editing. Completely off my "Videos" folder and uploaded to YT. It isn't that bad quality if you ask me.

Depends on your GPU etc.. But turn the bit rate down to about 1k and then gradually raise it until you hit a sweetspot.

Ah ok.<br><br>Then just right click your desktop (background) and see if you have Nvidia control panel. If you do, select that and look around to see your card version. But since you have a laptop I'm pretty damn sure you don't have a Nvidia card :l
