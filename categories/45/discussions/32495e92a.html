Very disheartening to hear, my condolences go out to those affected. <br><br>I wish, though, that they would focus on writing an actual article instead of playing the media game, and rushing it... kind of disrespectful to me.&nbsp;Forget commas, spell "classrooms" wrong, get numbers wrong, article inconsistency... hard to understand. Hate it when media pulls stunts like that.

A lot of stubbornness when it comes to gun laws here, it seems. A lot of the adults that I do know wouldn't really like changing the laws, and they do make an argument (blame the gunner, not the gun) considering if they were mentally ill to do such a thing, they'd do it by other methods. I personally think money should be invested in helping the ill instead.

The problem with the "blame the gunner" way of thinking is that it can STILL be prevented (or lessened) by taking away the gunner's weapon. These school shootings would be rarer if guns were taken away, considering that they are a quick and efficient way of killing people. Other weapons could still be used, but the impact would be much less.

Thing that annoys me is that it's for attention and he thinks it makes him look cool.<br><br>But really this is awful, shooting after shooting in America and still the refusal of sane gun laws, it's crazy how America is considered one of the most advanced places in the world when they still won't get rid of guns. So many innocent deaths could have been prevented. Rest in piece to the victims and my condolences to the families and friends.

I know what you mean, the shootings keep happening and we are in panic everyday because we think "I'm here, anything could happen right now" the families are even more traumatized they have to go get counseling to be able to cope with the sadness, even when I looked at the article and then saw another about him and what he looks like make me feel very uncomfortable.

Heres the thing buddy. I don't care for this type of shit because it doesnt affect me. Why should I care for a dozen or so people's deaths when there isnt anything I can do about it. Now, say a disease such as cancer or something along those lines, Yeah I'll care. Because for one, I can donate to support cancer research, and 2, my Grandfather died due to cancer, but I'm not fucking weeping over it. The fact you're getting pissed at a"sweaty teenager" is fucking hilarious as well. So kindly, fuck off and dont trash talk me because I dont feel emotionally moved by a school shooting.

The fact that you don't feel any remorse or sadness is disturbing. Your point about the bombing is valid, yes. And what's to say that we didn't feel any grief after that happened? Just because something doesn't directly affect you, it doesn't mean you should feel zero remorse whatsoever. It's somewhat psychopathic.<br><br>Its not my place to be telling you how to feel or react to a situation though.

A lot of stubbornness when it comes to gun laws here, it seems. A lot of the adults that I do know wouldn't really like changing the laws, and they do make an argument (blame the gunner, not the gun) considering if they were mentally ill to do such a thing, they'd do it by other methods. I personally think money should be invested in helping the ill instead.

There are mentally ill people in Australia, Britain, and Canada. Where are the mass shootings?<br>That argument is weak.

I mean, I don't invalidate that guns should be under a bit more control, but it is a constitutional right to bear arms. There's plenty of ways to fix the situation, or make it more difficult, but it's not my job to. I've always been fascinated with how the human mind works to carry out incidents like this, but as for the mentally unstable, there could be a bit more of a push and funding for the ones who actually come forward, or some more "open" support systems. I've never really been political, so I probably convey this stuff poorly.

I agree a lot with what you have said. The "push" on mental health is very weak and regulations(In America) are not really considering that problem. I heard you can buy guns from Walmart(correct me if I am wrong). I also don't know a lot about American politics so that is the best I could give.

<a href="http://www.walmart.com/cp/Shooting-Supplies/1107532" rel="nofollow" title="Link: http://www.walmart.com/cp/Shooting-Supplies/1107532">Yes, you can indeed purchase firearms in Walmart.</a>&nbsp;I really don't agree with the fact they're sold there, and honestly, I think it should be taken out of stock and kept to (professional) firearm stores instead of just some walmart. Goes in hand with other issues regarding it, but it seems to be perfectly legal.<br><br>Mental health regulation is indeed poor. Many complaints go through, especially locally, and everything seems to be weighted on how badly it's done. I hear lots of veterans and political figures discuss how badly troops coming home are treated, and have so experienced talking with some elderly people about the problem. As well as this, students are expected to rely on the "system" to fix them by hurling all their issues towards a guidance counselor. Even worse, because you get lost in said system.<br><br>As for regular help, some institutions for mental help are poorly run and are expensive for those who need it. CPS is skewed too... :(

The media is messed up. As Glitchy and Apricot said, they go crazy when 15 people die in a school shooting yet they don't mind thousands of soldiers killing thousands of Afghans or Japanese people.&nbsp;<br><br>I do feel really sad for these people and their families, they had their entire lives ahead of them. I'm not an inconsiderate ass, but hundreds of thousands of people died in bombings from the U.S., invasions, etc. yet people freak out over this.<br><br>And it's ironic how I'm typing this while listening to Obama speaking about the shooting and gun laws. :p

Just to add onto the topic eako is talking about. The media is a biased platform. They will do anything to get you to read their material, especially newspapers. Newspapers are dying in the US and they really as many viewers as they can get (except a few select newspapers such as The New Your Times, and Wall Street Journal.) You can kind of think of what they are doing as clickbait, but instead of clickbait, its readbait or watchbait. It's toxic for the world.&nbsp;<br><br>I know a lot of people have stated that the TV media is to blame for incomplete news stories and I believe that might be because of the platforms. Some of you may know that political parties can play a big part in media. For example, the channel CNN is highly liberal (democrat) based, and vice versa, Fox News is highly conservative (Republican). That can play a huge role in how they show their stories on TV. <br><br>For example, CNN is more likely to cover bigger news stories around the world because Democrats favor big government, so therefore they will cover more worldwide topics and just skim over national topics. Now Fox News is the exact opposite. Fox will most likely display more local stories because of the way their channel service is setup.<br><br>&nbsp;Hopefully that enlightened a few of you. :]
