I read on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://avicus.net/user/bpirr">her</a> profile recently about how she left and that "nobody noticed". One the one hand, I notice when she leaves (or at least I think I do). On the other hand, I didn't know she left [assuming she means she left Avicus*] and now I feel sad.... &nbsp;;-;<br><br>In case you [the reader] are wondering why I decided to make a forum article about this, I'm just one of those people who states whatever comes into his/her mind. &nbsp; =I<br><br>___<br>* I probably don't look at the forums as much as I should.... &nbsp;._.
