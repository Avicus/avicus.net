So I was making a custom edit of the faithful pack, because I like the textures, but I was making more HD items. So I decided to make a 256x256 sword. To start with, I used a photo for it, and thos was the result:<br><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/EVCn3Uz.png"><br>Why is the side half see through? is it because the pixels were translucent?<br>So I tried making my own sword, and got this:<br><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/LqANI61.png"><br>There is still these weird lines on the edge...is that normal?<br>Thanks

I have never tried making a texture pack before, but from previous experiences in my graphic design, these are normally smudges or extra lines that you may have forgotten to delete/erase.&nbsp;<br><br>That or these are transparent, showing nothing.

Any res above 256 i think, its hard to monitor where the lines will appear. Most RP makers leave them becuase it is a hassle to get them out. Yes its normal...<br><br>Oh and for the black sword, you are probably using an out-dated texture pack, Im guessing your on 1.8 as well :P

Its likely that there are extra pixels yew didnt notice when creating the sword, if you want to get rid of it yew will have to erase the extra pixels :/
