Hi I would love to help you out with your computer. I would need to know a couple more specs about your computer like the amount of RAM it has and also the graphics card that it has so if you could supply me with that info i would be glad to help!!

The Celeron j1800, is decent for gaming, it's however sorry to say but it's cheap. The Celeron will be fine for Minecraft but I cannot speak for other games, I suggest you look for something that is of higher quality but refurbished for a good price. If you'd like a comparison of it with another CPU visit <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/article/Low-cost-CPU-Duel-Sempron-2650-vs-Celeron-J1800-Review/1884/4">http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/article/Low-cost-CPU-Duel-Sempron-2650-vs-Celeron-J1800-Review/1884/4</a>&nbsp;Specs will be&nbsp;listed and explained.&nbsp;<br><br>I also believe that it is not upgradable as well.<br><br>Edit: Cannot determine the amount of frames just from experience but I'd give you a range of 25-60 (or slightly higher)&nbsp;and you can always use Optifine to slightly increase that.

intel Celerons are kinda basic, but minecraft doesnt require much :D I play steam games and MC fine with an intel i3, which is a step above the Celeron, so you might want to look at that.

Sorry for the bump, just trying to help :P<br><br><b>Depends on:<br></b>Your motherboard<br>Your power supply<br>Your ram<br><br><b>If you have:</b><br>A motherboard that can support a AM3+ Mother board<br>A 100Watt power supply to suppor the CPU<br>and at least 8GB of ram<br><i>Go with the "<u>AMD FX-4300 3.8GHz Processor"<br></u></i><br>Pretty outstanding for gaming 80$ and can last a long time, if you need more Umph I guess, go with an AMD FX-6000+ or something. Intel is just more stable but costs more. From my knowledge this CPU is equivalent to an Intel core i3-4370?<br>Again just trying to help, sorry for the bump :P

Better GPU = Better performance, simple as that (provided you don't have a really bad CPU)

Well it depends if you render alot and do that type of work, then just go with a 6 core CPU :P

If you use programs such as<br>Sony vegas, and you put a lot of effects and color corrections on it, your CPU will be heavily beaten up...<br>So it its better to have a 6-core for rendering, but a 4 core will do nicely ;)

The possessor is ok if you just want to play minecraft and it to be playable you might get average (Not for sure) maybe 30fps ,but if your looking to get higher like in the 60fps go for on of the i3 or i5. Or for extreme gaming go for i7 . You can always dedicate more ram to get better fps !

For gaming, you dont even need an i7.. an i5 4690k is fine... and its cheaper..

I know you're not that good, but let me explain.<br><br><br>You need more Ram when you ACTUALLY need it.. There is no point in dedicating more Ram, when you're using like 500 MB... Add more ram, Doesn't work...<br><br>Same goes for VRAM, "OHH LET ME BUY THIS GTX 970 WITH 3.5 GB OF VRAM, ILL GET SO MUCH FPS", sorry, no.<br><br>The thing about Ram &amp; VRam, is that, your PC uses it when its actually NEEDED. For example, when you're rendering, 8GB Is Fine for todays computers, Just have all background programs closed, and you'll have about 5GB of Ram to spare (My OS uses 3.2GB)..&nbsp;<br><br>And Adding "ram" won't increase Rendering speed, It'll just increase the chances of it being rendered better... (ex:) When you render a video, lets say in After effects, you got all of them Effects going... And you spent TONS of money for 32GB of Ram. For rendering 32GB Is way more than you need unless you run TONS of background programs...<br><br>Welp, thats my explanation
