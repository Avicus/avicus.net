<b></b>Well, recently I just got "permanent" banned from avicus. I actually was a little sad that I got banned from my favorite minecraft server, but I guess I deserved this. This is not a ban appeal or something, its just a goodbye letter type thing. I just want to say I'm sorry for the trouble I have caused on the server, and it would be much appreciated if I got unbanned.&nbsp;I know most of you might not know me, since I guess I wasn't a popular player on avicus, and the staff won't really care or bother to even unban me, but it would still be very nice if the staff at least replied back.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Besides that, I would just want to say bye the great community avicus has, as well as the staff(sometimes). I have met many great people on here as well as get to know some people better. Well, I'm sorry to every play on avicus, if I ever troubled them in any way. Maybe one day I might get unbanned! o:&nbsp;<br>Thanks for reading, and goodbye avicus :&lt;

aa, you should appeal :P I personally oppose long bans over excessive infractions, but that's just me :P Most of the time, excessive infractions are appealed, as far as I know. ;p Anyways, hopefully you'll return... but as for now... goodbye, and good luck in life! ^_^

Infractions isn't something you should be proud of, it just shows you keep doing the opposite of what you are told to, if you can't follow the rules&nbsp;and keep breaking them even though you got a warn after a warn after a warn you shouldn't be playing at all.

Also, just like to state this out, probably because most of you guys are confused about why I have so many infractions, I mainly started at least, getting active on this server in September, So like, honestly, I really wouldn't care if I got banned from the server before that, and most of my last "infractions" didn't really make sense, knowing that at least 3 or 4 of them were mainly for quoting someone, I even checked if the person who said the original text got banned/reported/warned,etc, but no, yeah, yeah, I know I need to add this all on the avicus.support type thing, but I'm just letting you guys know. Also, its 4 pages of Infractions, one is blank for no reason, just saying, if that helps in any way. Also like to state that, before September, really, I never really took this server seriously, and starting to regret all the bad things I did, I just used to come on here with friends and mess around. I mean, I already know that most of you will argue with this, or think I deserve to be perm banned, but honestly, I really don't think I deserved it, just like most of my bans, but I feel like staff(not all) don't honestly care about these types of bans. I'm not even gonna start going to this avicus.support &nbsp;to make my ban appeal, first of all, they don't even answer, so honestly I don't really see how it makes sense. I guess this is the only thing that actually attracts attention from people on the server, the forums, so basically I'm just gonna state it here, go ahead staff, I know you are either gonna remove, lock, tell me to keep contacting avicus support, but if they are not doing anything, then I guess this is my only hope. I already have many infractions that don't make sense, but the staff still doesn't seem to reply to the many emails I sent them. I mean, I already found that at least 3 infractions, don't make sense in the last week or two, I emailed avicus, no reply, which was about 5 &nbsp;days ago, still no reply, so if you guys won't do anything about it, what is the real point of even emailing them?

Clearly, you haven't even read my post, does it look like I'm trying to gain attention? No. Am I crying to the staff to unban me? No. I CLEARLY stated that this is NOT a Ban appeal, and its just a post, to state that I got banned, either you can't read english or just bothered not to read it and do a comment, that made no sense what so ever.

...I think he meant that it's hard to differentiate threads like these when there are so many of them and "goodbye" is the only indicative word in its title. His post made more sense than yours anyway, so don't act like an egotistical jerk. When did he even refer to this as a ban appeal?

aa - if you are still reading this - on your next server just don't type anything.<br><br>All of your bans (that I saw, too many for to go through them all) were from what you typed.&nbsp; Swearing, report abuse, typing in all caps, etc.&nbsp; Just don't type.
