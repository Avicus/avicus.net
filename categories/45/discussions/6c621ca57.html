Hmm. Well there should be a section to chat. E.g One tab will say Avicus network then private 1 on 1 chats group private chats so and so.

The PM System sounds good but why not actually have a place where it shows what staff is online? Like "Avicus.net/onlinestaff" instead of searching all day on the LeaderBoards or forums or the staff page to see who is on? I think this would be useful to players looking for mods to help them with reports.

I totally agree with SethSkye. We need a section of the forums in which we can check if there are any staff members online. Also, the button where you can add people as a friend <i>needs&nbsp;</i>to be implemented.

Instead of emailing him, could we post our suggestions here, and you link it to ivy?<br>If so:<br>Implement the friend button, players can PM all their friends and staff. Staff can PM anyone. Sr.Mods+ can see all PMs. Also, it would be great if a forum chat was added, where you click "online users" and another window opens up where you can chat with everyone, mods+ having perms to kick or tempban people from the chat ^-^

I am sure that Directors will be able to see peoples messages if required. It is the same on any forum. In any case the person being abused could always screen shot the behaviour and report it.

They wouldn't/shouldn't however it is important that they have control over that.. In every single forums, minecraft or not related, the terms and conditions you sign when you join the forums include that you give permission for admin to access all your messages and whatnot.&nbsp;<br><br>It doesn't mean they would nor should they really but it is to cover themselves in case an instance of "he said she said" etc etc happens.<br><br>even facebook can look at all your messages if they so please. Naturally they do not though. It is just one of those things :P

Here's my take:<br><br>I don't think any staff should be able to view the conversation unless it is reported with a report button, then Senior Staff+ get access to the convo.<br><br>And yes, friends will be implemented back again, it's been added to the beta website already.

Yeah man, I mean where are you gonna physically store the messages server side so that they can be viewed client side? Like, obviously it's not gonna be blank every time you go into the interface, and I assume it's going to be somewhat like skype. So where are you gonna store all these images and messages for further access?<br><br>Also tos is cough in spanish XD. Just had a mental lapse i suppose

Maybe instead of having a page, we could have a section somewhere above or under the "Online Players" area that has the names of online staff that are on the servers? This would be more easier and convenient than a separate page, because it'll always be on the left side of the forums.
