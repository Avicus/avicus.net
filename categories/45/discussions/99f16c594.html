Recently, my brother started a new world on my account. It was some weird preset called Tunneler's Dream. Right after it was created, weird things started to happen. The blocks would have a layer of black over them in a certain region, or the lava texture. Sometimes, when chunks are loading on Avicus, it loads with yellow or orange on them. As soon as they load, the colors go away.<br><br>Before my brother created this world, none of this was happening. It's kind of annoying me and him, because there will be random colors appearing and disappearing after a second. Could anyone help me fix this problem?<br><br><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/c8kCjAI.png">

I'm bumping this because I really need help. I also added a picture so that you can see what I mean, if you didn't understand before.

I've never had this problem before.<br><br>I did have something similar though...<br>I was using 64 bit java settings when I had only 32 bit java. I now have 64 bit, so I don't know what the problem is.<br><br>Also, I'm getting a new computer soon, but the one I use now will be used more by my brother and he will make a huge fuss about it.
