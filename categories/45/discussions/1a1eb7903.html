Hulk is OP. He had dis supa dupa transfomation, and with it he can destroy North America EASY.<br><ul><li><b>The Green Scar</b>&nbsp;- The Hulk of World War Hulk is a cunning and more powerful version than the previous incarnations, for he is the insanely enraged version of the "Gravage Hulk". His rage is at its most focused, due to meditation training by his ally Hiroim. This incarnation has extremely high durability, shrugging off attacks that have hurt his other incarnations. He has had training in combat arms, including&nbsp;broadswords,&nbsp;spears, and battle shields, and is a capable leader and strategist. Another source of the Green Scar's strength in comparison to other versions was his lack of inner conflict, if not alliance, with Bruce Banner. There were several instances where the Hulk and Banner worked together strategically, such as acting to disable Dr Strange. Caiera, the Green Scar's wife, understood Banner as well, and both personalities loved her equally. This was the driving factor in the Banner/Hulk alliance. As a result of being caught in the explosion of the warp core of his ship which brought him to Sakaar, which destroyed the planet, Green Scar's base level of strength was dramatically increased. While in a calm emotional state, he is the strongest primary incarnation. During a burst of unexplained anger from the Hulk in New York City,Professor&nbsp;X&nbsp;attempted to slow down the angered Hulk with intense power; however, the Hulk proved to be resistant to the Professor's psionic effects. The Green Scar reached a new level of anger at the end of World War Hulk, after his fellow Warbound Miek attempted to provoke him to destroy the world. At this level, he started to release huge amounts of gamma energy from within his body, devastating New York, and causing quakes across North America. It would have taken but a couple of footsteps from the Hulk to completely destroy the eastern seaboard. If he had not let himself be stopped, then he definitely would have lived up to his "Worldbreaker" title, and would have completely destroyed the Earth. After World War Hulk, Banner suppressed the Green Scar, preventing him from surfacing. He momentarily reappeared in battle with the Hulk's son Skaar, still identifying himself as the "Worldbreaker". He seems to have resurfaced after Bruce regained his Hulk powers, his anger tempered from its "Worldbreaker" levels by another confrontation with Skaar, and was proven even strong enough to take down the Red Hulk without much of a fight despite Red Hulk continuously absorbing Hulk's radiation to empower himself. The Hulk lived up to his "Worldbreaker" title by destroying a world (from the huge amounts of gamma energy he was releasing) in the Dark Dimension.</li></ul><br>Yes, Hulk did marry someone and can break a world.

I'll tell it from the very beginning.&nbsp;<br><br>The hulk was at a rage, and there was a group of 7 superheros called the Illuminati, made of Mr. Fantastic, Iron Man, Professor X, Doctor Strange, Black Bolt, Namor and Black Panther, formed to fight against large threats of Extra-Terrestrial threats, since all of them specialized in something important.&nbsp;<br><br>Stuff happened, and the group had to think about the raging Hulk (Da prof. aint here right now). They had a plan of sending Hulk to space to spend his life alone. Black Panther and Namor disagreed and left because it was inhumane to do it to something so unintelligent and stuff. He was spent to space, gone for a long time period.&nbsp;<br><br>A couple years later or so, Hulk had landed in a planet with aliens and became their king, with a wife and friends, all of them buff and stuff (Hulk and his queen mated and made a baby c;). An unknown explosion that killed his wife and child made him mad at the Illuminati (even though it was probably someone else's fault). He decided to take revenge.<br><br>He's mad, okay? His chance of love and being a father, along with the Illuminati had made him mad, had transformed him into the thingy majig I said about before. So he defeated the Black bolt at his palace, and goes to the X men's place. He beats up a bunch of X Men, and Prof. X wants Hulk to rage on him because Prof. wanted the Hulk to go into space, but Big H spared X because of all dem mutants dying.<br><br>Welcome to New York. Hulk then completely defeats Iron Man's hulkbuster armour(which have worked, only for Hulk to become super transformed), along with the Avengers, Fantastic Four, and a couple other heroes. Hulk also crushes Dr. Strange's hand, defeating him easily. Some allies from Earth team up with Hulk, and Hulk's team creates a Gladiator Arena for people to fight in.&nbsp;<br><br>There is a lot of fighting, and Hulk decides to spare the Heroes and will leave New York destroyed, leaving Tony Stark in shame. However, the Sentry arrives (this dude with the power of a million exploding suns) and he clashes with the Hulk, and after some epic battle they transform into their human forms, and "Hulk" beats the "Sentry" with a puny punch (funny on how their human forms are freaking weak). One of Hulk's friends says that it was he that caused the explosion that killed his wife and son because he wanted to fight something, not do some peace. Hulk rages even more, kills that "friend" and can actually break earth.&nbsp;<br><br>Tony Stark uses some tech to gamma-nullify the Hulk, and his alien friends and him sit in an underground base waiting to heal, and Banner (the human form of hulk) meditates and stuff so the Hulk can't go world breaking any more.&nbsp;<br><br>The end :)<br><br>WAIT. A long haired green figure stands on an alien planet. It is Skarr, son of Hulk.<br><br>Yup. That's kind of it.
