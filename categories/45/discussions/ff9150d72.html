</h1>
Wildcard Weekend is done, Ravens vs Patriots, Colts vs Broncos, Panthers vs Seahawks, Cowboys vs Packers are the matchups for the divisional rounds.<br><br>I'm rooting for Panthers, but they are pretty much screwed.<br>Here are my predictions: <br><br><b><i><u><b>Divisional Round<br></b></u><b></b></i><b></b><u><i></i></u><i><u></u></i><u></u></b>Patriots win against Ravens 24-20<br>Patriots don't blowout, since Ravens pull up a good match, but they still come up on top.<br>Colts win against Broncos 28-26<br>The Colts' offense is too strong for Broncos to hang on, Colts come up on top with a close match.<br>Seahawks win against Panthers 17-10<br>Although Panthers killed Cardinals, Cardinals' offense did nothing itself, not including Panthers' defense. Panthers have a strong defense, sadly Seahawks have a stronger one, this defensive match goes to the Seahawks.<br>Packers win against Cowboys 31-10<br>Cowboys no doubt played pretty sloppy today against Lions, their offense and defense were overall lacking. Cowboys are also not used to playing in the freezing tundra which is Green Bay. This is blowout.<br><b><u><i><b>Conference Championships<br></b></i></u></b>Colts win against Patriots 30-28<br>This is very indeed a close match. After seeing Luck's performance vs Broncs, Colts can easily win against Patriots<br>Packers win against Seahawks 27-24<br>Packers' offense is more than Seahawks can handle, Seahawks' defense is useless. Their offense can't pull up enough sadly.<br><u><i><b><b>Super Bowl</b></b></i></u><i><b><b></b></b></i><b><b></b><br></b>Colts win against Packers 28-21<br>Rodger's leg is really going to hurt the team. Colts are a very good team, good enough to hold Packers down. Colts win.<br><b></b>

Their season wasn't terrible, it's just that their division is arguably the best division in the NFL.

ok here's mine:<br>NFC:<br><ul><li>Packers vs Cowboys:</li></ul>Packers of course! They have one of the best home field advantages and with an addition of extreme cold, the cowboys will cripple. Green bay's offense is way too explosive compared to Dallas. Winner: GB<br><ul><li>Seahawks vs Panthers:&nbsp;</li></ul>Being a 49ers fan, I hate the seahawks. I call them the peehawks. I just hate everything about that team. anyways, the game all comes down to defense, The panthers defense was good enough to hold up the cardinals crippling offense but will not be able to hold off seattle's extremely good offense. Winner: Seattle :c<br><br>AFC:<br><br>Ravens vs Patriots:<br>Baltimore's defense is pretty great, New england's offense is pretty good. Both these teams have pretty balanced lines. It all comes down to playing smart football. personally I'm tired of Tom Brady and the pats. I would like to see Baltimore make the AFC championship, because of the way they handled the Steelers. Winner: Baltimore. *NOTE: this will be a close game, I just think the ravens have the better edge.<br><br>Broncos vs Colts:<br>I'm sick of Manning and the ponies. Yes I call them the ponies. Personally I'm surprised they are in 2nd place in the AFC, the way they were smacked last february really proved to me that they truly sucked. But who knows Manning always&nbsp;has something up his sleeve. The broncos still have a descent offense and an ok defense. The colts on the other hand look a lot more hype for this game. The way they held off the bengals proved to me that the colts really are a threat. Winner:<br>Indy!!

The Cowboys would've lost IMO if that pass interference call wasn't taken back. It doesn't really matter tbh since I doubt either team could beat the Packers.

Packers just beat the Cowboys, what a game that was. Although, I think the Pats are going to win it in the Super Bowl, no doubt. Brady's arguably one of the greatest NFL quarterbacks, and the Patriots have performed greatly on their defensive line recently. No doubt, I'm calling the Patriots on this one. #LongLiveNewEngland

I think after the guy dropped the ball after the punt, all the Packers lost faith of winning. :/<br><br>And now in Patriots VS Colts. Colts are really getting demolished hard.&nbsp;<br>One thing is that after a team is getting dominated by the other team, they just lose faith of even trying to win.
