I already had the pleasure of meeting all of the USA Taekwondo Olympic athletes, and several from other countries, such as Moldova, Korea, Iraq, Great Britain, Spain, and Mexico.<br>I think Jackie Galloway has an okay shot at winning a medal, as does Stephen Lambdin, but I know that Steven Lopez will lose to Moldovan athlete Aaron Cook, and I've already bet a substantial amount of money on Cook getting the gold, as he's already ranked #1 in the world for his division.<br>Paige McPherson has to get a medal, she's one of the best in her division.<br>Despite losing in the London Olympics, I think that Lee Dae-hoon of Korea will go on to win the gold medal this time around, considering his overwhelmingly good performance in the 2015 World Championship.
