Inspired by the recent ones, i decided to make my own as well :p. This corresponds with my orignal lore in OCN so ya.<br><br>If you see me post something, i probably made a new chapter so be up to date if you want.<br><br>Technically, Avicus and Mcone are all under the Avicus Kingdom. They are just 2 seaparate districts<br><br><b>The Avicus Lore&nbsp;</b><br>"<i>so gr8, it will make you say 'has d0rit0s gone t0 fAr?"</i><br><i>"11/10- ign"</i><br><i>"Eurphia achieved"</i><br><br>Chapters:<br><br><b>Chapter 1- The Conflict&nbsp;</b>1-15-15<br><b>Chapter 2- Enimies and Allies&nbsp;</b>1-15-15<br><b>Chapter 3- First Enemies, and now friends?&nbsp;</b>1-15-15<br><b>Chapter 4- The Battle of Quntius&nbsp;</b>1-16-15<br><b>Chapter 5- ???</b><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><br>Red: Overcast<br>Dark Orange: Avicus<br>Dark Purple: Hypixel Empire<br><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/zq8B9sU.png"><br>Brief summary: A rising threat known as the Xanadeu Empire devoured and conqured many nations. However, Overcast and its allies had them beaten in the first war. Still, the nations allied with Xanadeu had bitter taste towards its victors<br><br>Soon after the war, Tribes of the OVercast were united. Avicus which was known as the McZone Kingdom reformed and turned into Avicus. Avicus was now divided into 2 districts, Old Mczone which is the orignal size of Avicus and Avicore which was the newer part and territory that was gained after the war&nbsp;<br><br>Overcast and Avicus were brand new nations, each nations that trained pvpers in order to defend their nation. In order to train them, both countries use map simulators to train them rigorsly in different areas. The map simulators cycle maps and this encourages vannila pvp. This in return gives out the best pvpers ever known.<br><br>Chapter 1- The Conflict<br><br>It has been 5 years after the great war and Avicus was enjoying its newly gained territory after the war (Avicus did not participate in the war but they got the territory that was abandonded after the war) "Today, we have a feast, to celebrate this newly given territory!"- said Ivy. Everyone at the party cheered. D00zie, a general in the Avicus army, went off to the shores to patrol. Then, they saw some new trade ships that they never seen. IT was the Overcast.<br><br>The Overcast sent ships to open up trade in Avicus. Both Overcast and Avicus never really heard from each other and so they were, well a bit curious of each other. Then, an Overcast'an and Aviccanadian got into a fight. This fight sparked a battle(not a war) between Overcast and Avicus.<br><br>News spread across both nations, both servers competing to be the best. They trainned hard, gathered arms, and were prepared for war. There was some skrmishes in both sides.&nbsp;<br><br>Then, both nations at the same time declared war. D00zie was shocked but he said to his men "we are dealing with one of the most best people in this region. Lets show them what we got"<br><br>"YAAAA" The people shouted. HottoDoge, prodigy and son of HattoWolf and general of the OCN army "We are dealing with an experienced and probably one of the best country we had ever faced. Be prepared for war!" "AGHH" they shouted with pride. Both armies began mobilzing and gearing up for war. D00zie led the navy towards the Overcast. He looked with his eyes and saw ships. "They are from the Overcast, be prepared to fire" There was a lot of ships on the horizon. Then, the Avicus army saw masses and masses of ships "This is not the Overcast Navy. This is Hypixels and Shotbow's invasion of the Overcast..." D00zie said.&nbsp;<br><br>Chapter 2- Enemies and Allies<br><br><b>The Hypixel Invasion<br></b><br><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/MZjVlem.png"><br><br>HottoDoge was waiting at the beach coast of Eta. Then, ships landed on the beachy shore. He then noticed that it wasn't Avicus. IT was Hypixel. HottoDoge with only an army of 1,000 and hypxel with 3,500 clashed. Increasingly overwhelmed, Hotto was forced to retreat.<br><br>D00zie and Commander 99250 (dont ask why his name is like that) made a decision "Ok we are going to stay neutral and we will head back to Avicus and set up defense preparations. When they went back to Avicus, it has been to late. Quintus City was captured and Nexus City was sacked. Hypixel took over a portion of Avicus land. When the later returned to the captial, IVy said "its too late. They are coming to Nebula City soon, our capital. "I won't let that happen sir" said D00zie. D00zie planned to stop their advanced at Luar and CherrylandMC but Avicus forces were spread so thin, Avicus will need more manpower in order to defend both cities at once. Hypixel is thinking about opening a second front that will threaten to invade MCZone.&nbsp;<br>"Hows the invasion going" The leader of hypixel spoke "Good my lord. We will take revenge on The overcast and take Avicus along with them. hehe" a soldier responded.<br><br>Overcast in the mean time also had its own problems. HottoDoge is stationed at Eta Village, awaiting reinforcements "what do we do, sire?" said Captain TNTTurtle? "We ned to rek dem first and drnk sum mtn. dew to rplinish our health." and so they drank Mtn. Dew to replinsh their health. Sadly, the mtwn dew was actually poison pots that said Mtn. Dew on them so the army was poisnoned for 3 seconds. "Ok. I think we need to ally with Avicus" said HottoDoge "With them? we just declared war on them earlier. Now we want to team with them?" said a soldier in anger. "This is the only way we can defeat Hypixel. Avicus can open a second front and besides, Badlion is still having problems with Kohi. "Ok fine. " said the soldier in agreement.<br><br>HottoDoge relayed the message to Apple and Apple approved of being allied with Avicus. Apple then sent the message to Avicus. "King Ivy, Apple wants us to form an alliance, my lord" said his guard. "hmm, PeachyYas,, send your army to Khazak islands. We will rendevou with them and meet up. Take the Avi-Squad with you as well." "as you wish, king ivy' he responded<br><br>The Avi-Squad was composed of the most elitiest pvpers in Avicus. Overcast had something similar called the OCN Elite.<br><br>Now that these forces are somewhat reluctant to be come allies, they must put the past behind and move forward. Or else, both of these nations shall die...<br><br><br>Chapter 3- First Enemies, and now friends? Be tuned somewhere later today at 1-15-15<br><br><br><br>Peachy and his army gathered at the Khazy islands. When they arrived, HottoDoge and his army were across, lined up with his forces. Both leaders stood face to face. Then, both zoomed at top speeds and charged at each other. Their swords clashed and both comboed well. Hotto relentlessley kept attacking but Peachy kept countering. Then they clashed swords and a loud boom rang around the island. Both of them then stopped. The soldiers on both sides were very confused "Nice to see you again Peachy" said Hotto "You look just like your father." he responded and both shook hands<br><br>Peachy and Hotto are good childhood friends long ago and they reunited once again. "Hows things in Avicus?" said Hotto. "D00zie is attempting to halt their advance towards Nebula City. Rumors says that Hypixel will open up a second front at Mczone" "man. Overcast can send reinforcements there but it will take time though. Commander TntTurtles is currently at Eta Village and they are on a sige. Hypixel's army is overwhelming but we can hold them back longer with our new tier cannons. If they capture Eta River, it will be hard to send reinforcements to Avicus." "I see. maybe Kohi and badlion can help us" peachy responded "I dont know. Badlion is exausted and im not sure about Kohi. " said Hotto.<br><br>"Do you guys need reinforcement? Hypixel and Shotbow might advance from the east" said peachy. "We are good. The Yukon mountains protect the border and its hard to get across. The only way to get over there is by airship. "&nbsp;<br><br>"ok its time to plan" Hotto said. Both agreed that Overcast should send reinforcements to Avicus. The goal would be to retake Quntius. D00zie's forces will push them back and Peachy and Hottos Combined forces will come from behind and regain their lost territory. The ultimate goal is to rendevou with D00zie's forces.&nbsp;<br><br>"Sir, Mczone has been invaded!" Commander pepaljex replied "What? Is this confirmed?!?" Peachy said. "Yes sir. However Commander kycraftt and his batallion are stainoned a Senex 2 but cannot hold on for much longer "What do you suggest we do Peachy?" Hotto said "We go as planned. Once we get rid of Hypixel forces in Avicus district, D00zie's army will back up kycrafts batallion." said Peachy<br><br><b>The Battle for Quintus&nbsp;</b><br><br>Avicus: 2,300 men<br>Overcast: 3,100 men<br>Hypixel: 7,650 men<br><br><br><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/uhj5bnX.png"><br><br><br><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/lUS0aLa.png"><br>Peachy and his forces landed on Quntius beach. The city was atop of a long steep hill. Hypixel forces have it pretty well defended. Once they landed, Hypixel unleashed hell. They bombared Avicus forces with tons of Arrows. There was barely any cover in the beach and so, they had to dig Trenches.<br><br>Meanwhile, Hotto and his navy landed near Senex 1. They encountered little resistance because they caught them up by surprise. Hotto sucessfuly captured Senex 1 and was now advancing towards Qunintus City to recapture it.<br><br>D00zie's forces encountered tough resistance. His vice- commander, &nbsp;EmeraldSword in the battle of CherrylandMc, both of them fought bravely. Emerald ordred to keep firing upon enemy troops with tnt cannons. " Shall we sword?" said D00zie "My pleasure." replied EmeraldSword. Both lead the charge and kept pushing foward. No matter what or how many forces were there, the odds did not matter to them. Both succesfully lead their men to the battle. Emerald kept fighting and he went on. He wielded his diamond sword like he knew how to use it. While he was running, he charged and went striaght for the Hypixel general. Hypixel troops were slashed and killed due to his sick sword skills "be careful!" said D00zie as he was blocking a sword attack " Ok i will-" Emerald then looked and he realized that he had been shot "SWORD!" screamed D00zie and he went to go check on him. "Fire" said the Hypixel general and arrows flew and zoomed through Avicus soldiers. Many died from the arrow barraged. "Fire" he said again and this time, in front of D00zie's eyes, arrows were pelted on EmeraldSword. about 60 of them pirced through his armor. D00zie was outraged. D00zie then ate a dorito chip on the floor. He was in MlG status mode.<br>&nbsp;He charged at the enemy and enemy bodies were scattered as the power of doritos was with him "HAS DORITOS GONE TO FAR?!?!?!?" He then got his bow and 360 n0scoped the general. The general, so overwhlmed by the power of doritos, has fallen and died. D00zie went back to EmeraldSword. He then gave him a proper burial at CheerylandCity "You were a friend to me." D00zie ordered his men to continue to move foward to Quntius, as the must retake it. When he went forward, he looked back once, and then he never looked back again...<br><br>Chapter 4- The Battle for Quntius City 1-16-15&nbsp;<br><br>-To Be Continued- (No h8 pls guys i love each server equally. &lt;3)<br><br><b>Some other notes</b><br>Also, OVercast wasn't meant to be that big. I tried transfering the size but i couldnt so Overcast should be smaller then Badlion. Sorry for wrong size proportions<br><br>Also, im not going to add people the request to be in this lore because it kinda ruins the excitment and action. ITs not cuz i h8 your or anythin ;) I just want it to be a surprise<br><br>Is there anything to add? I don't really know about the maps and places in Avicus as much and i want you to give me your opinion and tell me what to add or take away. Please do not say that your gonna add your self. I mean only add to the places. You can give suggestions for the plot doe :D

</div>
mineplex was to big so there had to be 2. Hive and Mineplex are good allies to each other so they sorta share the land<br><br>@kycrafft- Mczone was not really developed as the Avicore District thats why :/ but they want to attack McZone now to give Avicus more pressure
