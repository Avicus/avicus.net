Well you really need to ask Kylo because seniors don't have permission to give donator ranks to players, we can only transfer them from player to player. If your having trouble contacting him i'd be more then happy to talk to him on your behalf and sort this out.

I think they only have permission to do rank transfers rather than removing ranks and adding on ranks.
