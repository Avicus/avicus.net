I think the avicus network needs to fix walls. I think a good wall would look like this<br><br><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/20090529_Great_Wall_8185.jpg" title="Link: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/20090529_Great_Wall_8185.jpg">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/20090529_Great_Wall_8185.jpg</a><br><br>The kits are very messed up :( my homie stomper doesn't even get used anymore. please and thanks

Walls is still my favourite gamemode but it doesn't get played. The devs have way to many things like atlas that have way higher priorities then walls, well atleast they think that. I do agree that walls needs to be fixed, like the spawn glitch issue, the glitch where you get stuck in a quadrin as a spectator, etc.

I agree. I also miss homie stomps. The walls deserve to be like the Great Walls of Trump or Japan or Whatever it is, I don't know, I'm only twelve. The kits are pretty aids besides bunny and DJ, thus my new hot nickname DJ BunBun. I miss being able to be happy and playing "The Walls" with all of my hot babes, homie Gs, sons, and random kids that are sometimes D-Bags and sometimes nice. As this true homie said, please and thanks.

also, fix those gosh darn compasses. You broke those a long time before you broke the kits, the maps, and anything else I decide to be annoying and complain about even though 90% of the avicus population reading this is laughing and doesn't care about walls at all. But this is a&nbsp;<b><i><u>VERY</u></i></b> serious post meant to be taken seriously, so please use this constructive criticism to make this server better! Once again, please and thank you.

I very much appreciate your understanding of my thoughts and actions, you may even be receiving some pictures later on. Also, as a bit of a side note, I saw that you changed "effect" to "affect" in this post, and I had to call you out like the little female dog I am. In the future, if you ever do not know what one of those two to use, simply use the word "impact" instead. I once again hope you have a nice day, and after seeing your understanding and appreciation of what I said, I would even say that I hope you have a nice and successful life and future ahead of you. Although this makes no sense to put here at all, like that young lad WhatLiesBeneath said, please and thank you.

Yes what you saw was true. I used the wrong effect/affect because instead of paying attention in class and doing homework, I have been stressing over the walls community. I think all walls needs is a little bit of spice :) maybe some new maps in unique shapes :-) For future&nbsp;predicaments I will use impact instead of those other silly words. Thank you :)

I already tried to get the Developers to fix the compasses but apparently they can't at this stage. As for the kits I have talked with Fouled recently and we did agree that walls kits need to be redone. I'm open to any suggestions for new kits and for certain kits to be removed. Message me on Communy Slack if you have any ideas as to what Kits need to be redone, removed and any ideas for new kits.<br><br>As for other glitches please report them on Github since most of the time we aren't actually aware of these things.

I completely understand your mistake in wording. English isn't your first language after all. I agree with walls maps needing more spice and even pizaz. I heard that the map that the one CraftMoreTables guy is making is pretty ballin. But please, I hope you understand me pointing out that once again, we are getting off topic, and need to focus on how to improve the walls community, and even avicus itself. please and thank you.

Although I am completely aware that this discussion is supposed to be mainly focusing on walls and how to improve it; I would also like to bring attention to other gamemodes that are lacking it. Before I say these things, I would like to say how fully aware I am of how much developers, admins, sr moderators, moderators, jr moderators, map developers, jr map developers, refs, yes, even refs, and the community itself are already putting into making avicus a better place. Although I could and am fully capable of doing so, I am not going to be one of those people who say how amazing and better avicus was before the avicore update. When it was still McZone. The game types that I would like to bring attention to are the following. Survival games; as of right now, the servers are completely glitched and you are not able to start a game. But even when they are up, the maps are dull, and the loot is as well. The community should start making sg maps too. (not me though, bc im lazy and i suck at building anyways) They should also add some spice to loot tables, making the games more fun and interesting. CTH as well. The kits are in need of an update, and people like Passion_ pick demo, and use their donator rank to join, throw a grenade, leave, join, throw another, and repeat. Besides that, nothing is really wrong with CTH. But if you were to give it some attention, you would make the user Myv very happy. Nexus is also in need of kit change, as well as better spawn protection. I don't even wanna talk about CTW... And the nebula maps are in need of updates, as you have already began doing. I also see no reason for calling the server "throwback" throwback because it is the server that everybody plays on, and should just be considered a regular rotation. I hope you take this constructive criticism as I hope you do, and not as me being a male reproductive organ. please and thank you.

I don't like being stuck in a certain area, even if I am not in a joined team. Walls was the first game mode I ever played on this server and I hope to see it with more players one day.

I agree with you. Although walls was not my first gamemode, I was introduced into by some attractive players, and I fell in love with it, and the players, ever since. For a little bit, these players, myself included, were able to revive walls, but ever since the compasses were broken again, the walls community has been on a downward decline, and now, it breaks my heart to see it empty almost all the time. Abandoned by the people who once loved it. I only hope that it blossoms once again to what it once was, and that it doesn't decline to the point of being removed from the server for inactivity. please and thank you.

Good answer, but they did indeed do that earlier. Many people participated, but not many of them were "walls kids," or players who once played and enjoyed walls. Most were people who just felt the need to be competitive and partake in a tournament. It did bring attention to walls for a short while, but eventually is died out again. please and thank you.

WhatLiesBeaneath, you are an ignorant and selfish young lady for not allowing others to utilize your currency for the benefit and good of the people. Although I understand that you are a mexicano, and do not enjoy sharing your home lands (lol walls map reference) money, you should reconsider your decisions and think about the good of all, rather than yourself, and allow this nice fine young lady xAntoniaII to use your pesos, become moderator, and benefit the server! I hope that you have a nice day, and like that fine young gentleman WhatLiesBeneath said, please and thank you.

You should not abuse your rights as mod, in doing so, you are becoming just as, if not more corrupt than your average moderator, that would shine a rather poor light on the walls community, and that is not what any of us in that discussed community desire, we want it to grow! Not to die! So if you apply for moderator, don't ban people who give pesos for you, instead, buy a burrito, those are delicious and cause harm to nobody. &nbsp;I hope you consider my contribution to this respectable debate of the gamemode known as the walls which was originally created by hypixel. &nbsp;If you do not accept my opinion, it may reflect badly upon this dear community that i hold close to my heart and soul. &nbsp;I wish you luck in your purchase of moderator and beyond. &nbsp;Thank you.

I can't be bothered to read this topic because of the useless spam. Kylo (I believe) made a topic regarding Walls being changed in the upcoming Atlas update, you might as well check that thread. Also compasses can be fixed in the Minecraft settings from my knowledge, but the feature might be stetchy after 1.8

Believe it or not, I also do not like burritos, I was merely hoping to get you to buy something other than moderator. &nbsp;I am aware that you were going to buy moderator with 3 pesos, as I stated in my first paragraph in the fifth line, which extends to the sixth line, "I wish you luck in your purchase of moderator and beyond." &nbsp;The word 'purchased' is used, implying that you are going to exchange some form of currency, in this case, pesos, in order to obtain a product, service or position. &nbsp;Of course, you are purchasing a position, the rank of moderator on the avicus network, so it is not a product nor a service. &nbsp;Now that we have cleared up that amusing misunderstanding, we can continue our civilized and refined engagement upon the topic of the ban of WhatLiesBeaneath. &nbsp;As stated previously, I do not find Burritos in any form, appealing to the tongue, If you purchase the fine dessert common referred to as "donuts," then my opinion may sway in the position which you seem to stand upon. &nbsp;But I must appeal to you, think about the walls community, banning someone for such a trifle matter will only reflect a poor atmosphere for our community that is figuratively as small as an atom. I appreciate your reading of this small consideration.

Thank you for your time. I want to be honest to you so i need to tell you that this text was as boring as WhatLiesBeaneath's &nbsp;conversation and sh•t. I hate watching prople getting banned cause i bet they all loved the Avicus community before their ban. Anyway, to be more specific i &nbsp;never wanted to ban WhatLiesBeaneath but he/she/it has done too much to me so i had to do something &nbsp;about that, cause according to my mother ( thank you for supporting me mother) karma doesn't always help. So he/she/it deserves to be banned. He/She/It also stole my 3 pesos but no one believes me.

I knew Greece was just temples or sth. I am a dog if you have not noticed yet. The last time I used photoshop was on Kim K's photo shoot, and I got paid for that. If you don't want to believe that I still have my three pesos, look at your forums account because the mod rank is not there. I am pretty sure if Mexico's mens team played Greece they would kill them 5-0. gg please and thanks.

My desert country? Oh please, my country is not a desert. As i said a couple of minutes ago, Greece is a beautiful place and its islands are priceless. You can ask Xuph who &nbsp;has visited a part of the amazing Greece. I don't care (sorry for saying that, dear mods don't ban me or cancel my purchase) if Mexico attacks Greece. Here we work as a team and I'm sure Trump wouldn't like to come over here and try killing our community.

I decided to send you the link of the site to show you that here, in Greece we respect history and will never destroy anything that happened in a long time ago. You know nothing about history, do you? If you knew you wouldn't see just temples. The fact that you keep saying you have your pesos drives me crazy.&nbsp;<br>1. The pesos were never yours. You stole them.<br>2. You lost the chance. You didn't tell me if you are a young female or a male. You are a dog anyways so "it" doesn't sound mean.

Believe it or not, I took Art History which included stuff about Greece. Once I had to draw a Greek temple, it was the most painful experience ever. How would you get a hold of pesos since you are all the way in Greece??? I am a female, if you knew how click you way through forums, you'd be able to see on my forums page my gender.

Do you not respect dogs? Are you into animal fighting like michael vick? I am not surprised!!! I remember when I met you I couldn't tell if your name was Antonio or Antonia. I do not need your pesos, especially since there is a 99% chance you do not even have pesos. Do not refer to me as "sweetie" if you do not respect me like you should. You do not have to worry about wasting your time, it is not like you have anything to do.

I know she is still alive. She is 95 and healthy like 20. She has a smile in her face everyday like a 10 year old kid. I was testing your knowledge. I have never failed in my life.

Babe she is 94. LOL. BabyDaddyIsaac never did interrupt out discussion and everything that I have said counters your banter quite nicely. Please reread all of posts and reconsider your statement "everything you have said so far is stupid" :) especially since you don't know your grandmother's age.

I have never seen Betty White skybase, not even once. Building skybases didn't get her to where she is at today! I will refuse to go back to art history considering that was my first B I got in a class(I blame the greek temples). I do play very well thank you

Topic you say? Lets fix walls up a bit. Maps are useless because the active people who play it (about everyone, or the people who play it once every month or so) already know the maps, the routes, the ores, the strategies. There are about at max three players per team. These maps are designed for a full fledged 7 7 7 7 game, if not more. I came to this server looking for fun active walls games to compete on with acquaintances or rather strangers. Not people who know all maps by heart like I do. (not really I don't try as much as I did) still, I still think walls has potential and hasn't peaked yet. Three years ago there were three lobbies with 20 people each in them, all not knowing what the next map can be, trying to get to level 50 so they can prestige and prestige again. Now, its you have access to all kits no matter how good/bad you are. No ranking to look forward to if you did even play, no point really, except the few credits you will earn because there are no potential kills because there is no one even in thr game, but, if avicus can cooperate with the players, i think it will do much better as a community. Thanks for reading this Whereas I am turning 6 on monday

I'm not gonna take the time to read all of this xD&nbsp;<br><br>+1 Walls kits were bad before, now they are worse, Bunny is amazing, Stomper needs fixes, I haven't really tried any other kits, but none of them are useful, so there's no point. Compasses have been broken for like 3-4 months, it's not fun to play anymore because there is so many glitches and issues with some of the maps, kits, rotations, compasses, etc. Walls is a great gamemode, but there are so many things wrong with it that it's not worth taking the time to play it. I'm not sure how to fix any of these, or if it's possible to fix them right now, but it would be amazing to see some fixes. &lt;3

I have never seen Betty White skybase, not even once. Building skybases didn't get her to where she is at today! I will refuse to go back to art history considering that was my first B I got in a class(I blame the greek temples). I do play very well thank you
</blockquote>

You haven't seen her skybase, because she has been avoiding you for ages. When you get on she leaves. No matter her age, she still plays when you are not on. I can imagine how terrible you drew greek "temples".

My greek temples look like boxes with lines going down the middle. Betty White would never avoid me, we are on such good terms it is insane. I bet no one could beat u in a 1v1 since you take no kb. Thank you DaGoldBrick for pointing it out :-)

DaGoldBrick has nothing to do with it. (Not even his business my kb btw lol)<br>Please, WhatLiesBeaneath don't involve more people. My grandma has never played with you. Truth hurts. I don't really care how low your grade was &nbsp;because of the temples you drew. Acropolis is a monument. Respect our history.

LOL look I understand that you are still salty from my epic bridging earlier, but it is ok. Just put some of your salt on your nachos and move forward! Maybe Acropolis has some nachos you can have :D You're right the truth does hurt. Which explains why you completely refuse to accept the fact that I am close with your grandma. You don't want it to be true because it will hurt you. gg.

How about each active walls player makes their own map? Even if you aren't a map maker give it a shot!
