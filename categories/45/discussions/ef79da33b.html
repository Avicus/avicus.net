I would get rid of the borders of countries in Africa. Before the British made provinces in &nbsp;Africa, they didn't have any starvation problems. When they didn't have any borders and weren't guarded by soldiers, they were free to roam around and follow their food source. After the arrival, they were stuck in an area where they couldn't leave to follow their food.<br>&nbsp;I would also want make each and every single person equal to each other, where no one is better than each other. A place where everybody has the same amount of wealth. Where everyone has a second chance, like how we deserve a second chance.&nbsp;<br>I could go on and on, but this is the basics that I want to do, and basically, I just want to create a better enviornment.
