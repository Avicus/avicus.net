If Archybot was to buy OCN he probably wouldn't know where to place it within Badlion and end up killing it like various other minigames/sections such as Warfare and Kohi Games or simply won't know how to handle the competitive scene as previously seen in the 1K tourney, making the trade not worth and killing the scene as well

Not trying to be an asshole but majority of the people who were are on OCN are probably gonna quit MC or join Badlion(a lot of ocn players already mainly played BL in the first place).<br><br>Some people will probably come to Avicus though, which I can see as a good thing.

This is actually extremely depressing to me. I joined OCN (back then Project Ares) almost 4 years ago when it was only one server and they had just released PGM 2.0. I played there a lot until I made some major mistakes and unfortunately was removed from all contact with the server. This is an extremely sad day for me since I still really think of OCN as my original Minecraft home. Sure, the community has changed since I left, but it still has the roots of one of the best communities and servers I have been a part of. I used to religiously watch Apple's streams and would even watch and re-watch old archives. I have tears on my keyboard at this points so I'll wrap up this part of the post.<br><br>I urge you all to not trash OCN in any way, as it will just make us look back. I urge you all to embrace new players with open arms and to make them feel welcome. I personally don't think it would be right for us to use OCN maps, since they were built for that network and the community that originally played there. The core maps, such as the race for victory series and other extremely nostalgic maps, were built by the first real players of OCN, and they would have never thought that this day would come just a mere 3 1/2 years later. Out of respect for their creativity and ideas, it just wouldn't seem right to just take them without their explicit permission.

Yeah, they spent too much money proportional to their size, that's not managing well. And I'm not an expert, but if we are still here there's a high chance that they could still be here.

Just so you know, OCN had been losing players since before 1.9. iirc when 1.9 came out, we ddint have much more than 800-1000 players at ocn (and maybe that number is wrong completely, I feel like it was actually much lower)

This is actually extremely depressing to me. I joined OCN (back then Project Ares) almost 4 years ago when it was only one server and they had just released PGM 2.0. I played there a lot until I made some major mistakes and unfortunately was removed from all contact with the server. This is an extremely sad day for me since I still really think of OCN as my original Minecraft home. Sure, the community has changed since I left, but it still has the roots of one of the best communities and servers I have been a part of. I used to religiously watch Apple's streams and would even watch and re-watch old archives. I have tears on my keyboard at this points so I'll wrap up this part of the post.<br><br>I urge you all to not trash OCN in any way, as it will just make us look back. I urge you all to embrace new players with open arms and to make them feel welcome. I personally don't think it would be right for us to use OCN maps, since they were built for that network and the community that originally played there. The core maps, such as the race for victory series and other extremely nostalgic maps, were built by the first real players of OCN, and they would have never thought that this day would come just a mere 3 1/2 years later. Out of respect for their creativity and ideas, it just wouldn't seem right to just take them without their explicit permission. I would love to play OCn maps, but only on OCN.<br><br>If you've read this far, I thank you for reading my entire post and hope this has touched you in some way.<br>Thank you OCN for all you have done and the groundbreaking innovations that are seen in Avicus today. Without you, I would not be here, and I love you for that.<br>- ALM

Ahah! So then surely money is being wasted on CTW rotations, SG, TDM, Nexus, Walls and CTH ones too? So I suggest only one rotation on those gamemodes.

OCN has been my home since early 2013, and allowed me to discover Avicus a year later after some people where shit talking it on Nostalgia. It's been a great server, and being part of the event team has been even more special. Just lost a lot of motivation to continue playing minecraft :(

As an OCN player. I could give my side of the story. As I have been playing there for about 1 .5 years I have noticed a player drop. Everyday there would be less players on the server, but it was still about 350-500 players, so all was good. But then once it fully updated to 1.8 it lossed a good 50-100 players going down to a not so good 250-400, still a decent amount, but not enough. I still played the server and loved it. Eventually reaching 100 wools, and then just a few months later 200. Then I started to become very inactive, I was already inactive, and then the monster came. 1.9 *dramatic music* Once 1.9 came out I usually went on OCN a good 1 a month. I got very inactive. So inactive I made a forums post about me semi quitting. But then something brought me back. I think it was myself missing OCN and the great community. When 1.9 came I wasn't the only player to "quit". The player count right now is "209" But when it first switched to 1.9, I saw times where there were just 50 players on... Thats when I knew that OCN might shutdown sometime soon. I didn't think this soon of course. But I hope this could clear some stuff up about OCN for you Avicus players. Atleast your player count will go up. Maybe people will actually play CTW on here after it closes :/

Only time the community was listened to properly that I remember was with togglesprint when the staff claimed that freeing up your pinky finger, keep in mind a hell of a lot of people use the mod, is a big enough advantage to ban it. It felt more like it was added to the allowed mods list because their argument was beyond incoherent. Didn't listen with versions, didn't listen with the tournament and the list goes on. It really isn't just 1.7/1.8, it was a lot of different things that that brought the server down.&nbsp;<br><br>Btw idrc, people can have their own opinions, I'm always up for discussions.

As an OCN player who has stayed there for a 3-4+ years, this is truly saddening and without OCN, i wouldn't have discovered you guys. It is a shame that OCN and Avicus got off on the wrong foot. When I said my goodbye ama, I was actually tearing up no joke because it has become a home for me. Yes at the time, there were other big popular mc servers like hypixel but there was none other than OCN an its really sad. Sure the staff back then didn't do such a great job with their mistakes but they did their best. To all the Avicus community, please learn from these mistakes because Avicus has become a second home. I know most of you do not know me as I do not really come here often (years actually) but Avicus has great potential to become something greater so do not give up guys!<br><br>Anyways, I will still be inactive in MC because i just grew out of it and probs going to be at the forums but once OCN offically shuts down, I will reside in Avicus for the time being &lt;3

when i first joined OCN, about a year ago, I wasn't very good at minecraft but i enjoyed the server...&nbsp;<br>And when i saw Avicus, the most amazing server I've actually been playing on I left, for just 1 reason... To play on Avicus... Since that, I haven't been playing on OCN until... A few weeks ago... I think the server is awesome, the great CTW... It's like home for CTW... And the type of defenses are so different to those DTM Defenses... There they make like a wall of workbenches, and alot more things that is way more complicated than these... And by thinking about it now, I think it should've been very useful for me to not stop playing on the server for a while, because I think I should've known ALOT mor eabout defenses and stuff....&nbsp;<br><br>RIP OCN :(
