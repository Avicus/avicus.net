I really don't see the reasoning for hating gay people. These 'riots' seem petty and small from the homophobes who are doing them. Someone needs to go there and stop them. Anyway, thanks Obama!! (not that I live in the US, but it could start to pressurise other countries into making it legal).

So yeah, I'm in the lgbt+ community and I didn't see this coming. I'm very happy that same-sex couples finally have the same rights as straight couples. I was ecstatic about the news, but some of my conservative friends and family were obviously not (I blame Florida). So this is a great day in history, but we still have a lot more to do. It's all about the little steps. (:

Since I am Catholic, I can't really say this made me happy.

I respect your opinion but I disagree.<br><br>I am also catholic and it doesn't have to mean that you are against gay marriage. Jesus never said gay marriage is bad or so. Also gay people are not going to marry someone of the opposite gender cause they will never be able to love them. So either &nbsp;there are bunch of single who are not going to marry someone of the opposite gender or there are alot of pairs who truly love each other but are also not able to get a baby. So it doesn't matter really

I am on the same boat as you, I don't hate Gay people, they are nice people, it is just in my belief that marriage is woman-man not man-Man or woman-woman, but it's not like I hold it against them or anything, I just believe it isn't the right thing

I am on the same boat as you, I don't hate Gay people, they are nice people, it is just in my belief that marriage is woman-man not man-Man or woman-woman, but it's not like I hold it against them or anything, I just believe it isn't the right thing

I guess you could say sex whether in religion/evolution was meant for a man a women...<br>One can reproduce and is fun<br>The other is very unpleasant and reproduction does not occur.

how do you know that sex bewtween a gay couple is unpleseant ? Men also got a G- point like woman which is reached when two people have sex. Lesbians are kind of the same. There are alot of ways to also stimulate a woman without using a penis

I was very happy when I heard the news, however my entire Twitter timeline was not. I live in Texas, and there are a lot of very religious people here. A lot of people were hating on some friends that I have for being gay, which I see to be very unnecessary. I am a religious person as well, however I haven't been to church in over a year. I even saw a tweet saying that "6/26 is our new 9/11", which I found to be absolutely disgusting, since that day was a very happy day for all the lgbt community while 9/11 was a terrorist attack that cost thousands of lives. I respect others opinions, but I don't see it necessary to pick on the lgbt community. Anyways, at least our country has done something I agree with(:

Since I am Catholic, I can't really say this made me happy. Don't get me wrong, I have no issues with LGBT societies/individuals and I think they are wonderful people... but to me, same sex marriage ruins the reproductive cycle in the sense that this encourages LGBT practises. My reason may sounds idiotic and ignorant, and go ahead and insult me on thst behalf :P

I respect your opinion but I disagree.<br><br>I am also catholic and it doesn't have to mean that you are against gay marriage. Jesus never said gay marriage is bad or so. Also gay people are not going to marry someone of the opposite gender cause they will never be able to love them.

Where do I start....<br>These people are no different to you and me, they are average human beings who have opinions, friends and family. The one thing that is different is that they love different people. Why the hell should that matter? People discriminate against these people when they walk freely around the face of the Earth like you, me and all of the supporters and haters. <br>Plus, don't even get started on how they can't reproduce, around 7,120,000,000 people live on the Earth. This number is increasing rapidly, it's not like we as human beings are endangered, so why should some people not wanting to produce children be any problem? Straight married couples can marry and never have kids and have no grief over it whatsoever. <br>Some citizens of America, the land of freedom and opportunity, are now becoming as bad as those of North Korea, who have the strictest censorship in the world.<br>Saying that some people can't have happy lives because you don't like it is bullshit.

I'm with you.<br><br>I'm a catholic too, But I don't see the point of having people hating on love, because it's just love. In my opinion, A woman that loves a man is the same to a woman that loves a woman or a man that loves a man. People can't just fight against love, as you well said before, because, in the end, if you love someone truly, no-one can stop you. I also want to point out that i'm really pissed off with Twitt's like 6/26 is the new 9/11, As Refuse said before. People are always saying that differences between Men and Woman has ended, that we're living on the 21st Century, and the difference between sexes, In all ways, is better nowadays. To me, This seems similar to the racial problems today, because not letting 2 people that love each other is a bit of downgrading those people, as it used to happen with Slaves on earlier centuries. <br><br><br>I'd like to point out that we are all the same in the end, we mite look different, sound different, smell different, but in the end we are all humans, and we should all be treated the same way. You just can't treat better someone that is rich to someone that is poor just because of the money, and the same thing happens with this. <br><br>Obama said that it was a really good improvement to the U.S, which really is, it's just that the people that downgrade homosexual couples just because they love someone of the same sex, shouldn't live. That's all I have got to say about that. <br><br>The point is that people say that slavity and downgrading of people is now finished, but it clearly isn't. Just with one comment of one person saying that homosexual couples should die or shouldn't be allowed, should go to hell.<br><br><a href="http://www.tfpstudentaction.org/politically-incorrect/homosexuality/10-reasons-why-homosexual-marriage-is-harmful-and-must-be-opposed.html">http://www.tfpstudentaction.org/politically-incorrect/homosexuality/10-reasons-why-homosexual-marria...</a><br><br>Yea, TFP...

This whole argument of<br>"Protect our religious freedom don't allow same sex marriage!!111"&nbsp;<br>is plain stupid. Your "freedom" is depriving other individuals of their "freedom" to get married. A lot of people don't know marriage carries much more responsibilities / privileges then it sounds. Here's a list.

So let these guys do whatever the hell they want, it's not going to affect heterosexual marriage it's not like dicks are gonna come flying in your face.&nbsp;</li></ul>

It's how the person wants to live and be happy.<br><br>the Declaration of Independence says that &nbsp;people should <b></b>have life, liberty, and <b>the pursuit of happiness.&nbsp;</b>This is a fair thing to do since people want to be happy and being Gay is a life choice they like and they want to be happy about.

Haha yeah I suppose. But after Ireland and the US surely parliament would at least consider it in the next few months? &nbsp;I bet it will be put to a vote at least. How cool would it be if there were a referendum for it as well. Would sure what kind of people Australia really has anyways.
