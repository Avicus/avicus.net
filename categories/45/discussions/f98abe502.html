Hey guys there's this really cool minecraft youtuber&nbsp;<br>named fitmc that does very interesting and unique &nbsp;stuff unlike other youtubers like streaming ultrahardcore endless desert and endless ocean. He also interacts with many people I'd just like to kinda advertise this guy I guess because he's a pretty cool youtuber.<br><br>he also streams other games some times like donkey kong and subnatica

What's wrong with 1.9 pvp? You don't have to spam click to win

Doesn't he have a sort of negative fan base? (Ex - those Crashing Servers streams, those were a pain to deal with on OCN)

From what I've seen he plays a ton on 2B2T (an anarchy server).<br><br>I've seen him use modified clients (ex. Hacked Clients) that helped him around the server.<br><br>Not really too sure what his fan base is like either.

The exposure would be nice but we'd be attracting the wrong kind of players.<br>It'd be best if he doesn't come onto this server.

He's a cool guy but his fan base are a bunch of immature, toxic and salty people. He's also beyond fake with his voice and the way he acts when being viewed. The #1 reason he got this famous is because of TheCampingRusher going on 2b2t and then his fan base comes on 2b2t as well and all the "veterans" (not to mention he self proclaimed himself the leader of these "veterans") declared "war" on all the new players that wanted to have fun. The conflict became so big they added a queue and people had to wait more than 48 hours at some point to get in there. Then, they added a feature where you can buy yourself to the top of the queue by paying like 10-15$.&nbsp;<br><br>So in conclusion, the guy has a shit fan base, is fake as fuck, got his fame from another fake as shit youtuber that sincerely wanted to have fun on his server which he didn't let happen, but ultimately took advantage of the situation and made a a money making machine which both TCR and he were in on (they were supposed to be "enemies").&nbsp;<br><br>But he's built, so yeah I guess he's cool.<br><br>EDIT: holy shit i sound triggered

I've seen him before, I don't like his videos at all tbh. When I watch videos, I usually watch science, history, funny, or SSSniperWolf cause she's my favorite youtuber :3.
