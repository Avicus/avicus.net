A little tip...<br><br>Create a timetable for a&nbsp;<b>suitable</b> amount of work each night with an hour before you go to sleep free to relax and do whatever you want. Don't do hours at once, because after 45 minutes your brain starts to get tired and won't register the information. So do half an hour of work - take a break - then get back to it.<br><br>These are the most important exams, but also one of the most important times of your life so don't let revision rule your world.

Gpa is I don't know what it stands for but gpa is like ur overall knowledge with your grades in high school it goes to 4.0 if you have straight As u have a 4.0 usually&nbsp;<br><br>and most colleges usually want people with a 3.0 plus so it shows ur grades in a number form I guess
