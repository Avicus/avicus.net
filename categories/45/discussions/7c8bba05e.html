Hello Avicus Network<br>I have been on this server for a long time and know a lot of people but I have never made appreciation post regarding the server and what all of the staff so for us.<br><br><b>Developers<br></b>Guys, you do great stuff and implementing features into the Avicus Network. I would like to see this community grow into a massive awesome community that can enjoy Minecraft PVP together <i>*without hackers*&nbsp;</i>but all of the developers work hard to bring you new content and features on the Avicus Network. Have you ever seen the Development Stream INSANE! My Favorite Developer is definitely javi.<br><br><b>Moderators</b><br>Moderators up next, all of you do a amazing job to keep this server safe and hacker-free. Your all awesome and do your jobs insanely well! I would like to see more people like you on the Avicus! The that you guys put into the Avicus is insane and the time you take out of your day is incredible all the work you have done has really given the staff A Okay Approval for me! If there were any favorite mods I would have to choose from either Harry or Frosted.<br><br><b>Junior&nbsp;Moderators<br></b><b></b>Learners, you will learn from the best and trust me they are the best! Getting Staff Training for server situations and also learning what to do and memorizing the Punishment Guidelines but if you do get promoted its all in good works all Jr Mods will do a great job for the Avicus and congrats to PieZ on Jr Mod if there was any favorites mine is Tynvale.<br><br>Well I think that's it sorry if I was boring and wasted your time but last but not least the community is growing horrendously! This screenshot I will leave you with is from 22/11/15 @ 7:30AM AEDT. Isn't the Avicus Community just amazing thank you all for making Avicus what it is today and the awesome experience I have had on the server so far and the friends I have created and the memories I have created! LONG LIVE AVICUS!!!<br><br>shadowolf365<br>Peace Out!<br>.<br>.<img src="http://i.imgur.com/RiwMlkd.png" title="Image: http://i.imgur.com/RiwMlkd.png">
