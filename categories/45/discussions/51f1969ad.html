Then again, if you have 4000 ms, you could kill everyone by lagging

Just a side note: The connection bar next to a server name in the server list is never accurate :P<br><br>In most cases, the lower the better, but if you have high ping that could be good in some cases because you can be a ping warrior and knock everyone back 20 blocks and teleport around.<br>#basedping

Make sure to test with terminal (if you are on mac) or the command promt stuff for windows if you are on windows. Do "ping avic.us -c 10", and it will ping your server to avicus 10 times. Check the average. That's how much your ping is to avicus. Minecraft isn't accurate, that's why. :D My ping apparently to minecraft is about 200 ms, but on terminal, it's about 120 ms. See the diffference? If you are like 30 ms on minecraft, your probably about 20 really. :L Which is alot better.

Usually the lower the ms the better, but it almost seems to not matter for avicus, as I get 350ms but it feels like 30 :D <br><br>Avicus hosting FTW

Actually the connection bad next to a server name issue has been fixed. It now shows correct results.
