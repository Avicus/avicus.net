Guys, I am not going to be on the server anymore if this isn't changed, 1.8 is complete shitty for pvp, besides, we all have to update our Optifine. PLEASE, AVICUS, DON'T DO THIS!!!

Everything is eventually going to change m8. I know. Sometimes its hard for all of us to adapt, but we have to. This update was much needed and was finally released! We will just have to wait till the combat update maybe, but I'm sure most will be able to adapt.

I highly disagree with you:<br><ul><li>Did you actually like when people Blockhit spam you?</li><li>Bow delay was crap in 1.7</li><li>Same with the fishing rod, SG in 1.8 is basically perfect</li><li>Faster connection (Not sure if it has to do with 1.8)</li><li>Sure 1.8 might have terrible comboes, get used to it... MCSG is fine, regaining a lot of players that it lost from their update to 1.8 (RobertHDPotatoes, Huahwi, GoldEllipse, etc.)&nbsp;</li></ul>On the other hand:<br><ul><li>Lag.... Sure, remember the first time you had to get used to like 20 frames?</li><li>No block-hitting</li><li>Somewhat buffed Sprint key (I was playing a CTW match, and I was chased, kept hitting blocks never stopped sprinting) (I don't have better-sprint).</li><li>Yes.. you now need a Decent PC to play on it...</li><li>Serverlag.. It did improve, not in the slightest.. I still experience major lagbacks - Time outs.</li><li>Comboes are shit.</li></ul>In my opinion, Kylo (Ivy) did a wonderful decision switching. Reduces the amount of block-hitters. Sure, you have to get used to it, again MCSG did it... why can't we? Now, this is in no way that im saying it WAS a good dicision. Im not a dictator or anything lmao, Im just stating my opinion...

There is nothing you can do. In order for the server to work it needs 1.8 and you can't just downgrade a server. 1.8 is here to stay I guess. :/

Well technically this was a post on stating your opinion. I respect your's. Block hitting is still here tho, It just turned into massive crap.

Literally your last ten posts have been complaining about 1.8. I know that it might suck, but you don't need to whine about it everywhere. You really think Ivy will downgrade the server to 1.7?

You can't expect us to be on 1.7 forever, Soon 1.9 will be out, and I'm guessing that will be the thing everyone hates on.
