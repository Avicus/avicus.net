Also comes with a fully modular PSU, for better cable management and optionally to buy custom sleeved &nbsp;cables, and Windows 10.<br>It's 18$ over his budget.

Spending $2,000 just to play Minecraft and CS:GO is a waste, such a high budget is enthusiast-level, I'd recommend you only spend $1,000 if you just want to play games and not really care too much about anything else.
