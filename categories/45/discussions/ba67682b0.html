Herru ;D Well I'm going on vacation for about a Month and a half to a game reserve :3 *yey* When I come back I don't know if I'll still be interested in Avicus or minecraft... Idk. So this is just a little goodbye for a while or a very long time ;c it's been an amazing 1 year ;o Won't forget anyone on the server, who knew I could make such good friends with people on the other side of the world &lt;3&nbsp;<br><br><br>~Busteh
