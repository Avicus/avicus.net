Agnostic.<br><br>I've realized that religion as a whole perpetuates wars and many atrocities throughout human history.<br><br>Crusades... Inquisition... ISIS... Slavery (Somewhat)...<br><br>Also, many of the things inside of their texts show blatant examples of hypocrisy, favoritism and extreme violence.

Just curious, which God do you believe in?<br>Yahweh? Thor? Buddah? Zeus? Allah? Ranginui? Ares? Hermes? Apollo?<br><br>Also, if you're Catholic, then the Catholic teachings teach the following about why bad things happen in the world;<br><br>Bad things happen in the world because if God didn't allow people to commit bad crimes, then he would be stripping us of our free will.<br><br>Catholicism teachings say that God gives everyone free will, which means that anyone has the free will to do both good and bad.<br><br>Nowhere in Catholic teachings does it say that God lets bad things happen because "it's a test".

So, if Ghosts are dead souls,<br>(Presumably meaning that they are souls from people who have passed away) why don't we see millions of ghosts wandering around the street?<br><br>Why are there only limited reported/unreported sightings?

I am aware that those three religions all believe in the same Gods.<br>But it is with those different interpretations that spawn the differences in these religions.&nbsp;<br><br>Different interpretations result in different opinions and standpoints on similar topics, resulting in a natural inconsistency with regards to each religion's opinions on topics.

So you're going to assume that all Hatdiths are terrible people because of two verses?<br><br>I'm sorry but that's just ignorant.<br>I honestly do not understand how you can come to that conclusion.<br><br>You judge an entire religion because a few versus said that a few Hadiths were doing things that you personally find unacceptable.<br><br>So just like that you write off an entire religion while using stereotypes and disrespectful statements?<br><br>Regardless of what other people believe, you have to at least be respectful of their religion and their beliefs. <br><br>Even if you disagree with it. <br><br>Understand that they believe in their religion just as strong as you believe in yours. <br><br>Respect others and their religious beliefs.<br><br>And this is coming from someone who has no religious beliefs.

There are minor differences between Christianity and Islam. We believe in the same God. Christians (I don't know if it's Christians or Muslims) believe when Jesus was hung on the cross, God put a lifelike image of Jesus on the cross and kept him there, so Jesus didn't really die. The other religion believes that Jesus actually died, but God gave him life again.&nbsp;<br><br>Something that is confusing to me is the bible. If you go anywhere, bibles are always written differently. It is man-made. On the other hand, there is only 1 Quaran anywhere you go, which is considered written by God and passed down to us.

There are minor differences between Christianity and Islam. We believe in the same God. Christians (I don't know if it's Christians or Muslims) believe when Jesus was hung on the cross, God put a lifelike image of Jesus on the cross and kept him there, so Jesus didn't really die. The other religion believes that Jesus actually died, but God gave him life again.&nbsp;<br><br>Something that is confusing to me is the bible. If you go anywhere, bibles are always written differently. It is man-made. On the other hand, there is only 1 Quaran anywhere you go, which is considered written by God and passed down to us.

The main reason for the many different bibles is because when different religions were made, they would edit the bible to their teaching, either removing certain content, or adding content.

As I already linked, science is enough reason for me to believe in the fairy tales.<br><br>But you're right, if there isnt evidence we shouldn't believe it.

Simply because I don't believe that they are always visible, they make themselves seen.

It's the main reason why I don't like organised religion, to be honest. It's too easily manipulated to the point that I only support un-organised religion.<br><br>It's the same reason why I believe in a god but refuse to dedicate my life to a specific belief, be it Christianity, Judaism or Islam.

First, a ghost is a corporeal being. People believe that ghosts are the memories and soul left over from a person following their death. They, unlike the Judeo-Christian/Islamic interpretation(s) of God, don't have power over the physical world. Therefore, they can't help.<br><br>Second, the Christian/Jewish God selected the human race as his "chosen species".<br><br>Finally, I don't believe that life is a test from God. No offence, but if the only way to pass the test is to follow the Bible/Torah/Qur'an and some of their outdated teachings (e.g. homophobia), then I've definitely failed already.<br><br>I'm sorry if I offended you.

Okay. That is completely wrong. To be a muslim, the first thing you are required to do is say something called the shahadah. It is where you acknowledge that there is no god but Allah and that the prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is his servent and messenger. It is an essential belief that the Muhammad is one of god's messengers, and Allah orders us to follow his messenger. Hadith are considered things that the prophet did or said. And since it is essential to follow the prophet, should we not also follow hadith? Of course the Quran takes precedence over Hadith but hadith is an aid in following the Quran. Without it, there would be so many more conflicts and arguments about what is right. Whenever a religious leader (Imaam) is giving a lecture about a certain topic, they only use authentic hadith. This so we can try and preserve the purity of our religion. Almost never do proper imaams even mention hadith that have even a chance of not being authentic. Of course there are some hadith out there which may not be correct, but that is why muslims try their best to only use the ones that they are sure about. Also, hadith is not the cause of terrorism. Hadith is where we get a lot of our information about islam. It makes it easier for us as a society to interpret and follow the Quran.

First of all Both Muslim as Bukhari as the other big 4 Hadith compilers were 'converted' Persians. They most likely were Zoroastrians and the Zoroastrian believe tells people they can follow all religions as long as they live a Zoroastrian life. They just wanted to ensure there people would follow Zoroastrian traditions and get heaven.<br><br><img src="https://sonsofsunnah.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/page17_1.jpg" title="Image: https://sonsofsunnah.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/page17_1.jpg"><br>&nbsp;<br>wa eshhedoe is made up by Hadiths.&nbsp;<br><br>The Quran states the following<br><blockquote style="margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;"><div>[Quran 3:18] God bears witness that there is no god but He, and so do the angels and those who possess knowledge.</div></blockquote><div><br>As well as the Thorra</div><blockquote style="margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;"><div>[Deuteronomy 6:4] "Hear, O" Israel : the Lord our God, the Lord is One."&nbsp;</div></blockquote><div><br>People weren't allowed to write down Hadiths according to the Quran<br><blockquote style="margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;">[Quran 33:53] O you who believe, do not enter the prophet's homes except if you are invited to a meal, without you forcing such an invitation.

But God does not shy away from the truth. And if you ask his wives for something, ask them from behind a barrier. This is purer for your hearts and their hearts. And it is not for you to harm God's messenger, nor that you should marry his wives after him. This is indeed a gross offence with God.<div>[Quran 66:3]The prophet had trusted some of his wives with a certain hadith, then one of them spread it, and GOD let him know about it.

If it gets flamey imo worth to lock. It's not just that as well, but lack of respect for others religions isn't tolerable, therefore the lock. Noone really wants to go back and repeatedly archive posts on any thread in the first place either.&nbsp;<br><br>@OP&nbsp;<br><br>Athiest, but respect others' religions and the beliefs within them as long as they do not encompass or promote discrimination or violence of any kind.

When I said that Muslims use hadith, I did not mean that they are essential for Islam, I merely suggested that they are helpful in understanding the religion. Like I said before, Muslims do not base their entire lives off had ithesa. Quran comes first always, but we still do take had ithesa into consideration because they can help us understand the religion.

There's dark humour, then there's sadistic humour. 9/11 jokes aren't funny, considering that 3000 mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, sons, daughters, etc. died in that horrible attack.<br><br>As to your point about religion, the concept of religion is noble, but over centuries it has been twisted to suit people's own ends. I was a Christian, but I still believe in a god, be he/she - yes, I personally believe that God is a woman or can take either form. To claim that an omnipotent being is limited to one gender is contradictory to religious beliefs - Yahweh, Allah, Zeus, Odin, etc.&nbsp;<br><br>I don't understand why religious belief is such a joke among some people in society. Personally, I respect and admire people who stay true to their beliefs even when being persecuted or discriminated against.

Quran explains itself, Allah asks us only to follow his Hadith. I've seen so much important Hadiths contradicting the Quran.<br><br>Praying 5 times a day for example. It is accepting the Hadith (which is already wrong) where it tells us Allah doesnt know everything, since he first said 50 prayers per day.<br><br>Allah is all knowing.<br><br>Zoroastrians had to pray 5 times btw and the Quran which is complete only talked about 3 prayers<br><br>Also all Hadiths about the last day are false and contradicting the Quran<br><span>
"Say (O Muhammad), "I do not say to you that I possess the treasures of God. Nor do I know the future. Nor do I say to you that I am an angel. I simply follow what is revealed to me." Say, "Is the blind the same as the seer? Do you not reflect?" Quran 6:50

"Say (O Muhammad), "No one in the heavens and the earth knows the future except God. They do not even perceive how or when they will be resurrected." Quran 27:65</span>
<br><br>In this way I feel like traditional Muslims are disbanding there Quran, because Hadiths make them believe things which are contradicting the Quran and yet they believe and study it.<br><br>Hadiths are essential to follow the Sunnah of Muhammed in Sunni's eyes. But as I already told you, there only is a Sunnah of Allah
