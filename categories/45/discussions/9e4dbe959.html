Screw cancer, some of us want to buy a new phone, a new car, a new computer and whatever it maybe. But many animals and people fall under cancer, all they want is to win the battle. My leopard gecko happened to be one of the animals, and he did not win. All I'm saying is that us, people should be aware of such of these things. I could not help, he was still a baby, his anti-bodies were too weak to fight back. Even my snake is depressed, every sunday, I used to bring them out together and play with each other. Now my snake is confused and wonders, where my leopard gecko is.<br><br><br><h2><b>RIP.</b></h2><h2>Andrew Jr.</h2><img alt="" src="http://i59.tinypic.com/kdu00o.jpg"><br><br>Let's say you have toast for breakfast, but you don't want toast, well, you should be happy at least you get food, look at all the homeless, do you think they have food?<br><span>When you feel as if you're in pain, just because you didn't get the latest soccer boots, imagine all the people fighting cancer, they're in terrible pain, and they only want one thing.

My friend died from it. He used to want all the video games, and didn't really care. He ate fast food and pop for the majority of his life. When he was diagnosed, his body was too weak. #WeNeedTheCure&nbsp;<br>R.I.P.

There isn't necesarily a specific "cure" for cancer, as it is a disease that is basically a lump of your cells that have mutated, every cancer is different depending on where it originated, and if there were a cure announced, it would be all over the news. But, this isn't the thread to get technical, and I apologize for your loss.

Cancer is actually &nbsp;a stage says doctors it may be able to be stopped later on but this is a epidemic that money can't help we need to work and put time into it, I feel as if cancer is fucked up but we can't hope we have to take action, I agree with you &lt;3

Now that I hear your guys stories, my story doesn't matter, you've lost real family and friends, I've lost a pet. I'm sorry, I've been so stupid, complaining just because a pet died. You don't know how sorry I am for you guys, I watched my pet die in terrible pain, I stayed up, not sleeping at all, jus watching the tiny gecko arch its back in pain every few minutes. I cannot imagine what it would be like, watching a friend or family dissapear from your life.&nbsp;<br><br>Together, we can stop cancer.

I don't care if cancer has a cure, what I care about is, that people should be aware of these things, they act as if they don't care, but when a loved one is harmed by cancer, they start acting all sad. People need to be more aware of things in this world, let's say you have toast for breakfast, but you don't want toast, well, you should be happy at least you get food, look at all the homeless, do you think they have food?<br>When you feel as if you're in pain, just because you didn't get the latest soccer boots, imagine all the people fighting cancer, they're in terrible pain, and they only want one thing.
