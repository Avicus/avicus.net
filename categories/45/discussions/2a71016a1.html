So Avicus has a nice update and everything is looking good besides a glitch in one of the maps where you fall on a certain place and you get stuck in the air.<br><br>Not even 24 hours yet and we already have people saying that <b>"OMG AVICUZ IZ COPYIN OCN!!!111!!!!"<br><br>Shut up. Please.<br><br></b>You guys act as if OCN is the original creator of every gamemode.&nbsp;<br><b><br></b>We have CTW, many people wanted it. So do I. Now that we have it, you guys complain? Shut up. Seriously, enough this is bullcrap. The devs, mods, and map devs are trying their hardest to make this a great server and we got people who are saying that Avicus is copying OCN.<br><br>I mean like, with SG now we got people who are saying Avicus is copying other servers now. Seriously, this is a game... about blocks...<br><br>Other servers have copied other servers. TDM has always been here, CTW was a gamemode back in MCZone, SG is basically a different version of Hunger Games. <br><br>Every server has copied something or someone whether inside minecraft or outside minecraft. Seriously, stop. &nbsp;<br><br><b>You guys are like friggin' toddlers fighting over a glass of water...</b>

It doesn't matter if they have the same gamemodes, it depends on who does them better. A lot of things go into play that makes them the same but totally different(maps, amount of people, staff effectiveness, etc)

Dude, shut up. OCN copied some other server and from RL. How about you stop focusing on the negatives and look to the positives.<br><br>Think about it, who really was the first one to create TDM? What about some other thing?<br><br>Blitz is basically OCN's OITC. Please, stop.

Personally, idc if it is a knockoff of ocn (not saying it is). Idc if people care that they think its a knockoff of ocn (still not saying it is), In fact idc enough to comment showing idc (this comment doesn't exist :P).

well if ocn didn't exist tbh none of the gamemode's would have been used here. Many suggestions to improve nebula came from people who played on ocn; didn't haribo/parapenguin develop dtm? well iirc para always loved ocn and probably made a gamemode like it; so in theory avicus probably wouldnt have ctw and dtm if para didnt ever find ocn x) aka big copy x)

I was simply saying that we do not take it personal. But if we just let ppl say and do what they want all willy nilly then there would be no order and the community will be horrible.
