I have a PC as well. But from time to time I have the opportunity to work on a Mac! I honestly think its better. I mean you get a bunch of free programs. (I think, Hue) Such as: Garage Band (not on PC) Great for making your own music for videos! IMovie(not on PC) Great for enhancing and editing your footage! You can even make movie trailers if you would like! Also so much more that can help with your footage and stuff! Once again, I wish you the best of luck! I would love to enter this contest because I think I have the potential can creativity, I just don't know what to say! :c Good Luck!!! (Again Hue)
