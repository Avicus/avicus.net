Before you guys say this, yes, I know I'm posting this on a virtual lego server forum. My school counselor doesn't offer good advice, and neither do my teachers. The only resources I have are my friends.<br><br>Alright, I'm heading towards the end of my sophomore year in high school, and currently in the process of planning out the most important year of my life. I have three problems I need help with.<br><br>This one is about life, not necessarily school. There's this girl that I've liked for a while, and I share one class with her, orchestra, in which I regularly talk to her. She's a year above me though, and I don't know if she's in a relationship at the moment. I'm planning to ask her out sometime before the school year ends, if she's not with someone else. Would it be weird, though, for a sophomore to ask out a junior?<br><br>One of the bigger dilemmas that I'm encountering is my math class selection. My teacher recommended me for Honors Pre-Calc and AP Stat, and I'm not sure which one would be suitable for me. If I take Honors Pre-Calc, I'll be doing AP Calc in senior year, but if I take AP Stat, I'll be taking Honors Pre-Calc senior year. Another option for me would be to take dual math, since I do have enough space in my schedule for that, and going with that would mean taking AP Calc in my senior year. If any of you guys have experience with these courses, could you give me some advice? I'm planning on going into the Computer Science field later on, and I'm also taking AP Computer Science next year.<br><br>Another thing is standardized testing. Since the SAT is being changed in 2016, I'm considering taking the ACT instead since I'm not the best at English, and would do better with more Math and Science subjects. However, the ACT is scored way differently compared to the SAT. Again, if you've taken both, or are planning to do either one, which would you recommend?&nbsp;<br><br>Thanks for reading this, and any tips and help would be greatly appreciated.

1. i don't know a whole lot about those classes, but unless you love math classes i wouldn't recommend taking two at once. it's incredibly stressful.<br><br>2. if you like her, go for it. it's not unheard of for a sophomore to ask out a junior, i've had younger people ask me out and it was fine. i would figure out if she's in a relationship before asking her out. it's really awkward to ask people out and then find out they're in a relationship, i know that firsthand. life is short and if you really like someone and want to ask them out, do it.<br><br>good luck bro :)

Alrighty, lemme see if I can help out d:<br><br>1. I would definitely make sure that she doesn't have a boyfriend because that would make things very, very awkward. As for the sophomore asking out a junior, it's not too weird. It's not common, but it's not like it's a major no. If you guys are mature enough, I don't see a problem with it. A senior asking out a freshman though is very, very, very, very creepy. *shivers*<br><br>2. It all depends on your math skills. If you took Algebra II and you got either an A or a B, you should be okay. If you struggled with a low C, then I would not recommend Pre-Calc of any kind, especially AP. Depending on your teacher, AP Stat should be pretty easy. If you got an A or a B or even a C in Algebra II, you'll definitely do fine in that class.&nbsp;<br><br>3. I haven't taken either, but I'm supposed to. To be honest, only you can answer this question. Research, ask a teacher, do whatever you have to to make sure which test is better for you. Because you don't want to waste your money on a test that you don't feel comfortable with. <br><br>If you have any more questions, just ask me c:

1: Its perfectly fine if you wish to date her and it is very respectful of you to want to see if she isn't <a href="#" title="Click to Continue > by salesale" style="border: none !important; display: inline-block !important;   font-weight: bold !important; height: auto !important; margin: 0px !important; min-height: 0px !important; min-width: 0px !important; padding: 0px !important;  text-decoration: underline !important;  width: auto !important; background: transparent !important;">already<img src="https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png" style="border: none !important; display: inline-block !important;   font-weight: bold !important; height: 10px !important; margin: 0px 0px 0px 3px !important; min-height: 0px !important; min-width: 0px !important; padding: 0px !important;  text-decoration: underline !important;  width: 10px !important; background: transparent !important;"></a> dating.

And with a part-time job you can take her out to eat at a nice restaurant. Have a ball my dude, you're on the right track :)<br><br>2: Do not take both at the same time. I'd recommend taking one during junior year and the other at senior year. If you take both at separate years, these classes will look&nbsp;<i><b>very good and sexy&nbsp;</b></i>on your transcript and would help you a lot in applying for <a href="#" title="Click to Continue > by salesale" style="border: none !important; display: inline-block !important;   font-weight: bold !important; height: auto !important; margin: 0px !important; min-height: 0px !important; min-width: 0px !important; padding: 0px !important;  text-decoration: underline !important;  width: auto !important; background: transparent !important;">colleges and<img src="https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png" style="border: none !important; display: inline-block !important;   font-weight: bold !important; height: 10px !important; margin: 0px 0px 0px 3px !important; min-height: 0px !important; min-width: 0px !important; padding: 0px !important;  text-decoration: underline !important;  width: 10px !important; background: transparent !important;"></a> universities.&nbsp;<br><br>Just keep at it bro and you will get there.<br><br>3: I'm not quite sure how to answer this.

1) Ask her out. It's really not that creepy. &nbsp;There is nothing wrong with that :) If she says yes...well, you lucky son of a b*tch<br><br>2) If you want a relatively easier class, choose stats. I'm sure you can get by with a Stats/Pre-Calc combo and take Calculus in college. Normally, I'd suggest not taking 2 math classes at once, as that will be stressful. If you really want, you can skip Stats and take Calculus as a senior. Ultimately though, it is up to you. (I'm trying a Pre-Calc &gt; Stats &gt; Calculus combo right now. Hopefully it works)<br><br>3) Would recommend the SAT.<br><br>#kycrafftsbadschooladviceftw

Sounds like you can handle Stats and HPC so you might want to try that for 'fun'. You don't need to do Stats if you don't want to, though.&nbsp;<br><br>Also, it's 1am for you, not midnight.

First of all, I congragulate you on being successful in managing Minecraft things, a part time job and extra classes. So here is what I would do.&nbsp;<br><br>Junior year is the hardest year of high school (Trust me I know, since I'm a senior). DO NOT MURDER YOURSELF WITH TONS OF AP CLASSES. I took two AP classes my junior year (AP Music Theory and AP European History) and those two classes we really not that bad. HOWEVER, Honors Pre-Calc is a huge jump in difficulty from Algebra II. It is basically as close as you can get to an AP class without actually being an AP class. So in the end, don't kill yourself with two math classes. If you do, you will most likely mess up concepts between the two and just confuse yourself more. So either take AP stats, OR Honors-PreCalc.&nbsp;<br><br>Now for the ACT and SAT. I would take the ACT. The reason is, a lot of the high-technology based schools prefer the ACT over the SAT. And, from what I have been told, the ACT is easier to boost your overall score through other categories. So I would highly recommend the ACT.&nbsp;<br><br>How this helps. :]

It isn't weird at all for a sophomore to ask out a junior. In my freshman year of high school, I was asked by a senior to go to the homecoming dance with her, and I said yes. So I went with her to homecoming, and we danced and whatnot. So, that's a freshman to senior example, and I dated someone in the past who is currently a junior. I was in 8th grade, and she was a freshman in high school. So no, it's not weird at all. Age is just a number, so don't worry about it. It's perfectly normal to ask someone out that's a year or so older/younger than you.<br><br>Thats basically the only one I can answer at the moment, because I've had the most experience with that question out of the 3-4 you asked. However many others have answered your other questions, so I hope you've gotten the correct information from other people.&nbsp;<br><br>But I hope from what I provided, it helped you out a bit. Good luck with things!<br><br>-Jake

First of all, I congragulate you on being successful in managing Minecraft things, a part time job and extra classes. So here is what I would do.&nbsp;<br><br>Junior year is the hardest year of high school (Trust me I know, since I'm a senior). DO NOT MURDER YOURSELF WITH TONS OF AP CLASSES. I took two AP classes my junior year (AP Music Theory and AP European History) and those two classes we really not that bad. HOWEVER, Honors Pre-Calc is a huge jump in difficulty from Algebra II. It is basically as close as you can get to an AP class without actually being an AP class. So in the end, don't kill yourself with two math classes. If you do, you will most likely mess up concepts between the two and just confuse yourself more. So either take AP stats, OR Honors-PreCalc.&nbsp;<br><br>Now for the ACT and SAT. I would take the ACT. The reason is, a lot of the high-technology based schools prefer the ACT over the SAT. And, from what I have been told, the ACT is easier to boost your overall score through other categories. So I would highly recommend the ACT.&nbsp;<br><br>How this helps. :]

Thanks! This helped a lot, and made me lean farther toward taking the ACT rather than the SAT.

It isn't weird at all for a sophomore to ask out a junior. In my freshman year of high school, I was asked by a senior to go to the homecoming dance with her, and I said yes. So I went with her to homecoming, and we danced and whatnot. So, that's a freshman to senior example, and I dated someone in the past who is currently a junior. I was in 8th grade, and she was a freshman in high school. So no, it's not weird at all. Age is just a number, so don't worry about it. It's perfectly normal to ask someone out that's a year or so older/younger than you.<br><br>Thats basically the only one I can answer at the moment, because I've had the most experience with that question out of the 3-4 you asked. However many others have answered your other questions, so I hope you've gotten the correct information from other people.&nbsp;<br><br>But I hope from what I provided, it helped you out a bit. Good luck with things!<br><br>-Jake

Thanks, this was really helpful advice! I'll keep this in mind. Thanks to you guys for motivating me to ask her out.

As a Junior, I've already taken the ACT/SAT, scored 35 composite on ACT and 2280 on SAT. Lemme tell you, I was well used to the SAT and did a bunch of practice problems, bought a book and everything; ACT i didn't even really know much about the test other than like 3 practice sections I took about a year ago. ACT is a lot more forgiving to mistakes and is a lot easier to learn, tbh. The maths is much more straightforward, there aren't really any hard vocab questions in the reading, and the science section is just graphs and data analysis/comprehension. It's a lot easier to excel in than the SAT, and many colleges tend to accept both. It would do you quite good to focus on one or the other, but you should also take both; practise some SAT as well as ACT, you never know how you'll do until you actually take the bloody thing :D.<br>About maths, I was always pretty good at maths, and I'm just about to finish up calculus BC. I don't know about your school but in our school Pre-Cal was pretty much algebra 2.5, with a lot of graphing and algebra concepts as well as trig identities, which are pretty much the only new concepts. Besides limits/vectors, which I dont even know if everyone will learn. You can take Calculus in college, but I think it's much better to take calculus in high school, as you'll have more involvement with your teacher and he'll help you along the way. It's gonna be a lot nicer compared to college, which can be tough if you don't know what you're doing. My maths teacher also showed me that kids who take AP calc &nbsp;and score 3 or higher on the test tend to do a lot better in college calc than those who've no previous experience. Also, if you take the calc test in school you can get college credit and skip ahead up to Calc III, which is very useful in saving money. Stats I've not much experience with, but my friends tell me it doesn't seem very interesting, rather boring.

Doesn't your school offer calc as a junior? I'm taking capc A/B as a Junior and calc B/C as a senior so idk I think calc is wayy more useful. As for testing, I think ACT is more important for getting into most colleges so yee

My school does offer Calc AB to juniors, but one of the prerequisites is that you need to finish with an "A" in Honors Pre-Calc, which means I can't take it until senior year. However, my school doesn't offer Calculus BC.

Damn, you're pretty set. After reading your advice, and understanding the differences between the SAT and the ACT, I feel like the ACT would be much more suitable for me. It also seems as though Calculus would be way more useful than AP Stat, so I'll probably take Pre-Calc next year, and Calc in senior year. Thanks for listing the advantages of taking Calc in high school rather than in college. I never thought about those. Thanks for the help!
