<span><span>And before you say that leaving posts are not allowed, go away. I think I deserve this.&nbsp;<br>Well what a roller coaster ride it has been! From Ingi showing me the old days of MCZone when we wanted a good server to play walls on.. To finding Nexus and Nebula and then playing them continuously.. From joining the forums just before the Avicus update to see what the fuss was all about.. To applying for moderator.. Doing that interview which was some scary ass shit and to then becoming a moderator on this unbelievably awesome server.. How far Avicus has drawn me along it’s pretty staggering. <br>If you hadn’t figured, yes, this will be my last post. I need to go. I’m moving into my last year of GCSE’s at school and it’s pretty important. I now have three jobs to work my way around, and now the summer’s up I won’t have time for it all. I may come on from time to time with alts.. But that’ll be secret. </span><span>I cannot thank this community enough; how much I’ve changed. This staff team too is the best I’ve seen. The work rate is phenomenal. No one lays back. No one is lazy. Everyone co-operates together. <br><br>Now there’s just a few people I’d like to thank:<br></span><span><br>My “brother”, FTW. Haha, what a troll, and just to say, he didn’t want the joke to end. He wanted it to carry on. What an inspirational guy, great to speak to, great to withdraw advice from. To anyone who didn’t know him, well, he’s pretty darn awesome! A great moderator and friend. And to anyone who didn’t know about our “joke”, we pranked the community that we were in fact brothers. What a time that was! But now he’s kinda disappeared. haven’t spoken to him in what seems like a year. And if you’re reading this Hayden, well, check your Skype I got some sick myoozik to share! &lt;3 <br><br>To Ingi - nothing I really need to say about this d00d. He’ll always be there for me, for one simple reason. &lt;3<br></span><br><span>To Shi.. You’re a better troller than FTW and I.. Put it that way. An awesome builder, friend, personality, moderator. And I will one day join you on Rose Online.. I swear! Good luck in your endavours, however we’ll always stay in contact; whether I’m Apricot or nawt. <br><br>1Theodore1… We applied in the same window, we were interviewed at the same time, I was promoted before you, but who gives a shit, lemme get to the point. He’s pretty sw@g, great PvP’er (even though I did beat him twice on soup the other day, I mean, come on, cut me some slack) and an awesome friend who’s always there to talk to. ps, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://gyazo.com/16a40e1c3a281f4e6358d788885bb9d3">http://gyazo.com/16a40e1c3a281f4e6358d788885bb9d3</a> - I still kept it! L8rz Theo. &lt;3<br></span><br>To Howsie, Ivy and Gill. You are the heart of Avicus, even when people don’t recognise the work you do. I’ve never really got that close to any of you three, bar Howsie who I speak to on the odd occasion. But what I do know, 100%, is that you are great at what you do, and wouldn’t change you for the world. One thing I would say is, maybe speed up a little? That’s all ;3. Much luv. &lt;3<br><span>To Andy/Tel: You’re a great guy. Don’t let anyone change that aha, wonderful to speak to and most of all a friend. &lt;3<br><br>To NesaFairy.. I MEAN WHAT AN AWESOME PERSON. That time when we became friends.. You couldn’t access the forums, and I made it my mission to connect you up! You’re a great friend, an awesome artist, and a fun person to be around. &lt;3<br><br>To Buster_U, don’t changed. You’re amazing. Great to speak to, amazing person. +1 &lt;3</span><br><span>To MLGtino - great times 2v2’ing on Badlion.. Maybe should’ve done it moar. <br><br>To the TS crew.. Who I mean by Ducks, D00ZiE, Mooch, Glitchy, and all you lot. Idk why but I always see you all together, and usually join in on whatever you’re doing. Now you’re all mods (bar mooch, but you were &lt;3) and you’re all cracking at doing the best job evar! &lt;3<br><br>To Yoav, now what a k00l d00d we have here. You are totally awesome and I will miss you a lot! And ps, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://gyazo.com/47cd2cc728db3549e862ad1c38a05ae1">http://gyazo.com/47cd2cc728db3549e862ad1c38a05ae1</a>! 5eva “May” haha! &lt;3<br></span><br>To Jake.. I remember when I first met you. You were recently promoted, we were on Rendevous, and something had happened previously. God forgive my memory, I can’t remember what happened, I just remember coming out thinking “what a great guy”. &lt;3<br><br><span>To Joxxy, an amazingly underated PvP’er who is down right awesome. Get to know this guy, you won’t regret it. &lt;3<br><br>To Pel, who i haven’t spoken to in a while.. However we’ll keep in touch, I’m shure! &lt;3<br></span><br><span>To Para/Cow. What an inspirational guy. And imma keep it short and sweet. I love you, don’t change for the world. There. &lt;3<br><br></span><span>To Evo, another person who shouldn’t change. You’re amazing at your job, and keep it up! &lt;3<br><br><img alt="" src="http://i.gyazo.com/89ed5d00a09a5ff80473e2272975092e.png"><br><br>And there you go, a nice picture of me after doing the Ice Bucket thingy ma doo hickey!&nbsp;<br><br></span><span><br><br></span></span>

We'll never forget you, because you were such a good moderator."<br>This sounds like a normal goodbye massage from a player, but I talk from my heart. It was really such a great time with you. I didn't knew you very well, but what I know is, you are a great person and a great player. I respect you. You helped other if they needed help. If I needed help you helped. What I want to say is you are very helpful and a great staff member. You also was everytime friendly wethever you were stressed or so. The forums were always a better place if you posted a reply or a thread. I really hope that you are abled to play again, only to see you again. It was a great time. I'll never ever forget you and I'll love you for your personality. forever. (I really cry in real life to lose such a good guy like you.) &lt;3 (I'm down for some days I think :C)

If Avicus is still going on next July, we might be coing back... but do not get the hopes up.
