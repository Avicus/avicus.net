Our prime minister vow's to "shirt front Mr Putin" with the justification of "Australians died in MH17 by Russian backed rebels."<br><b><br></b>Unbeknownst to Abbott is that Putin has a black belt in &nbsp;tae-kwon-do and a fight between the two is most likely going to be one sided affair.<br><br>Yes I do understand MH17 was a tragedy but there is no need to act so unprofessional as Mr Abbott is the LEADER of our country. He shouldn't not be throwing out threats like a 13 year old in a school yard. Especially misguided and down-right stupid remarks such as those he stated.&nbsp;<br><br>Video:<br><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24ruCWdyRzY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24ruCWdyRzY</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b><br>Shirt Front:<br></b><span>A brutal shoulder charge in Australian rules football (AFL) where a player instead of tackling an opponent, bumps them forcefully in the chest. Often leads to heavy concussions due to incidental contact to the head.<br></span><b>- Urban Dictionary</b><b><br><br><br><br></b><b><br></b>

TBH I think the Dutch should be able to act like this considering they lost 198 people. I am not being biased, but every time I see Mr. Abbot act like this it makes me wonder why he doesn't support other countries like the Netherlands were we lost 198 but only caring about Australia.<br>Haters gonna hate

A not even that Putin is physically superior in every way. It's the fact that abbot can't legally lay a finger on Putin, and that Putin can legally kill him. Diplomatic immunity is a wonderful thing.
