I've been waiting so long to see if my application has been accepted, and with the new website I don't get it. How do I see if I've been accepted?

Okay, all good I just wish when people applied there was some more efficient way of notifying them instead of them having to check every few days. I checked every few days for the past like 6-8 months ._.

You are obviously not active enough to know what is happening. If you weren't listed on the post a few months ago or contacted then you obviously were not accepted.
