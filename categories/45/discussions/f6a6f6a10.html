I can't wait for it to come out! :D<br><br>My favourite one was Fast 5, it had the most action. :D<br><br>I'm wondering something though... did they already start filming the 7th movie when Paul Walker was still alive? If not, are they just not including him in the movie at all?

They filmed about half of his scenes before he died. He'll be in the movie. My favorite is Tokyo Drift
