Pretty sure this is going to be locked because its not avicus related and you are technically advertising badlion.

i am still struggling to understand how the fuck do you have 90 subs only. your pvp is great, so are your renders, editing and packs. you put a lot of effort in your channel and there are not so many who do that. if youd upload a bit more frequently, your channel could be really fucking successful.<br><br>if you are reading this dear people of the community please go subscribe to him.
