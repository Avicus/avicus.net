Now im not very experienced with producing music and I want to learn how to (mainly remixes) so I decided to make a thread so fellow users in this community could help everyone else out. I roughly know something about syncing the speed of the music with the vocal parts and secondary beat but idk what's the proper term called or where to learn about it

For VSTs, I recommend Synth1 (you can find a bunch of soundbanks online for free, and Synth1 itself is free.) I use it all the time and it produces great results, as well as it's probably the easiest to use to make custom soundbanks.

You forgot the equalizer, even more important than the compressor :)<br><br>@op I use fl studio myself, very easy to understand. Ableton, cubase, and logic pro are pretty good as well. As syntesizer i pretty much only use the Sylenth1, very nice to make your own sound with, and there are a shit load of presets for as well. I also recommend you to start creating a big collection of sample packs for your drums and stuff.

And Sound Design is a major key (eyyyyy) in music production. Knowing the presets you use and where yo're going to set them up is a very big deal in Music Production. And i stated about eq-ing above. Parametric EQ is the plugin i use, and almost everyone does as well.

Im quite aware of that, and the EQ.<br><br>However, you can get by without using sound design, just sampling... and then using sound design, so I guess not lol.

Well that may be the case, it's good to know how to get proper sounds, other than sampling. I like to sample, but not as much as i like to experiment with sounds and create my own presets.

Side-chain compression isn't a Audio plugin :/<br><br>A compresser is the plugin, and side-chaining the track to another track (via a bus) is just a way of using it, not a plugin in itself...<br><br>Sampling is the act of taking a portion or a specific idea from a previous recording, and either changing it or re-using it in a different way. So theoretically it wouldn't produce as 'unique sounds' as would creating sounds or loops with a synth or instrument from scratch. Just saying...<br><br>I&nbsp;don't&nbsp;know if you are talking about sample rates, and/or bit depth but i think you got it a bit wrong.<br><br>Usually when you use compression, its only used to minimise the gap between the highest amplitude and lowest&nbsp;amplitude. So you use threshold to find the lowest point&nbsp;in that specific track; using the ratio which when using&nbsp;compression is only around 3:1. Therefore, you can&nbsp;increase the makeup gain to a very high amount, and it&nbsp;wouldn't really clip at all. The major thing that is the cause of clipping is limiting, which is similar to compression, only with a ratio of 10:1. I mean&nbsp;I've seen someone add around 90dB of gain to a track and it&nbsp;doesn't clip.
