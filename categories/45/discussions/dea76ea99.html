I really don't even know what this is.<br>But seriously, this is getting annoying (Not really)<br><br>I have these links on SOME avicus posts, not all, but some that are just flat out strange...<br>You can take a look at one or two here:<br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/BggL9No.png" title="Image: http://i.imgur.com/BggL9No.png"><br><br>But see those green things with boxes and an arrow? When i hover over it, it says "Click to continue &gt; Salesprizes" Or something. Now, I have adblock so I doubt it affects me, but EVERY DAMN TIME, I run a virus scan, all it catches are the cookies this adware creates or whatever.<br><br>So any of you tech boys, help? &lt;3

Its some ad-connecting thing. If a word is related to an advertisement or something it might add a hyperlink or something to the word, which opens up a mini image of the ad you are hovering on. Hope this helped :D<br><br>P.S. I think you can change this in your settings :P

Exactly... I doubt I actually have a virus, but maybe the person who originally created the post does and it links it?... If so, the virus needs to find a bypass for Adblock, because the coders are just fucked if thats the case, I have not seen anyone without Adblock in my life... Not even my School LOL.......

I sent this to Vacuum a few days ago, hopefully it can help you guys understand as well, you are not affected if you don't post links like that.&nbsp;<br><br><i>"You are affected by an adware, it is called PriceChop. You will find it in the addons in your browser. You will need to remove it in the addons and uninstall it as a program.&nbsp;</i><br><br><i>Start &gt; Control Panel &gt; Uninstall a program &gt; PriceChop."</i>
