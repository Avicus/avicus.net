(This is not to be hateful and im not saying names)<br><br>So, there were 3 mods online that could ban. There were 3 hackers in my game and everyone was reporting them but you know what. None of them came. I asked one of them to come and they said they were busy with something else and I asked if anyone else could no response but isn't a mods duty to spread the reports out among them not just all do one report. <br><br>(Archive it if you want idc)

Heey Dawson,
<br>
<br>
The Mod's duty is to keep the server clean from hackers, basically moderate it. We also have to moderate the forums and the TS.
<br>
It looks like the moderators that were online failed to respond to the reports.
<br>
None the less you should report these moderators at <a href="support@avicus.net" alt="support email" title="Link: support@avicus.net">support@avicus.net</a> with screenshots or other evidence.
<br>
<br>
If you mean me with one of these mods, I'm really sorry but in the last time it's almost impossible for me to be on server due to my internet connection. I try to hop on as much as I can, but I keep timing out every 5 minutes or I get so much lag that I can't even send a message.

Umm, even with three mods on, sometimes a lot of reports come in, they might all be in the middle of something, maybe one was catching a different hacker, and another was with their team in a scrimmage, and the other could be dealing with a teamspeak problem<br><br>Don't assume they were ignoring the report's, sometimes things get flooded, and they can't get to it yet.<br><br>But of course, we don't know the story, maybe your right, maybe there were mods ignoring reports, so go ahead and follow resepignevs instructions, if this is a misunderstanding then it'll get cleared out, if there was some unacceptable behavior from mods, appropriate measures will be taken.

@Iron: If that was the case, then there was no way you could have checked the reports.<br><br>@Mr_Solstice: As ShutUpYouBiscuit said, perhaps the staff who were on were attending to other reports and they didn't have enough time to respond to yours.

Do you honestly think they did that on purpose? Do you honestly know how much stuff they have to do, not to mention their world outside of a block game? Who the hell cares about these hackers, it's just a game, have fun. Ignore the hackers. If you really want them banned record them lol.<br><br>Look, I'm not trying to be mean to you but I've made your same mistake. I still believe to this day that Staff have to get their shit together, but you have to think about them also. They have lives too!

Lol mods do the best they can, but at times they don't and no offense they get annoying. Whenever there's a hacker they say use /report. They need to know that they should stop and ban them when their RIGHT in front of them.

I was probalbly online when this happened and it's quite hard to deal with everyone when you have (in this case) 5 reports every minute. We're trying to take as many reports as possible, but sometimes, you have to be patient.

Well, I'm not sure about the others, but I find it hard to take someone who's calling someone out for hacking in public chat seriously. We tell them to use /report, because well, it's illegal to accuse them publicly and they'd know that if they read the rules page. Once someone is reported, a staff will try to jump onto it ASAP, watch and record, and boom.

95% of hackers I catch are from reports. It makes catching people easier with the tools we get out of reports. Also 99% of the time someone yells "hacker" it is someone raging that they died.

I would like to de-escalate this situation, as I was a witness to the described situation. Jive was taking multiple reports, however eric and I were preparing to screen-share a player. In the end Eric ended up screen sharing the said player in question, and I had to go do some chores IRL. Although there was a large quantity of reports, I am afraid that the few mods on were just overwhelmed. I apologize for not tending to your report (?) Alas, we were slightly overworked and missed your report!

Yeah, this happens sometimes. It is often difficult for Mods to communicate under certain circumstances, but they really do try hard to answer incoming reports. However, if you see a Moderator ignoring reports and generally not doing their job, feel free to report to a Senior Staff member, and we'll handle the situation from there. Despite this, though, I normally see most staff members consistently taking reports and efficiently working together. If you don't find this the case, again, feel free to contact me or another Senior Staff member either on Skype or TeamSpeak. o/

Usually, it depends on the circumstances.&nbsp; Sometimes you get a report, you go to check, and it's really obvious.&nbsp; Hey, that guys flying, ya done son.&nbsp; Most of the time, though, you have to watch the person for 3, maybe 5 minutes just so you're absolutely certain of their hacking.&nbsp; When a mod says use /report, they're usually saying "I'm watching the guy, so shush."

It takes the same amount of time to do /report (player name) (rules he's breaking). The report command was implanted for a reason, and that reason was not to have players messaging mods about hackers.

It's lovely to see that some community members are standing behind us, but it shouldn't be an excuse to ignore reports, even when many of them are coming in.<br>It was a fault on our end and I think there is room for improvement.<br>And as Qinn said, if you see that a moderator is constantly ignoring you or reports, then capture evidence and send an email to the support.<br><br>Now for the "Please use /report" Issue.<br>It makes our life and job easier if you do /report. If we are currently recording/watching a hacker, we can't respond to you over /msg because we have to focus on the hacker. Also it takes the same amount of time to do /report instead of /msg.<br>Another thing is that /report alerts all staff members that are online right now. Means if someone is on another server and doing nothing, he can attend the report.<br>The most important part is the disguise. If you yell "hacker, get banned" or "Heey mod resepignev, ban him!"<br>He turn the hacks off and we can't ban him since we have no evidence. We also can't answer any questions while spectating because it blow up our cover.
