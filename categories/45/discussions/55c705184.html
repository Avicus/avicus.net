So, have you had any?<br><br>I'm pretty sure I've seen a ghost at my friend's house once. I have photographic evidence, but I dont have the raw video anymore. It definitely scared me.<br><br>Because I'm weird, my friend and I made a Ouija board of paper and supposedly contacted whatever we thought was a ghost. I'm pretty sure it was that subconscious effect I forget the name of, but hey, it set a nice mood for the sleepover.<br><br>I do believe in ghosts, but no so much in demons or "evil manifestations."<br><br>Anyways, post away.

Where do I even begin?<br><br>For one thing, my cousin used to be in contact with great grandmother's spirit a short while after she passed.

Last year I was in the mountains with my siblings and my mom and my step dads family (they were getting married but that's not important) and my 2 sister and my step brother and my brother we all were in a room sleeping and there was this REALLY creepy monkey stuffed animal thing but that's not really important the thing was we all were talking and then we stopped and decided to go to bed and the after 5 minutes it was about 12:00 we heard children laughter and then our bedroom door opened up and no one was there we went to ask our step sister if she played a prank on us and she said no then we asked our parents and they said no so... Yeah it was freaky

Let's just say "sexual desire" isn't yellow, hue.<br><br>Synesthesia is essentially the senses overlapping each other, putting it in simple terms. Saying numbers and seeing them gives me a taste in my mouth, that's how that works. It's the same with colours and smell. Mirror synesthesia, is where I can see someone being poked, and I'll feel it. This carries over to videos as well.&nbsp;<br><br>Finally, the aura synesthesia is something nobody really understands. There hasn't been much research done on it. It's interesting nonetheless.

I went upstate New York with my friend a few years ago. At the time, Slenderman was super popular. (And the game was set in upstate New York where we were) I'm <b>deathly</b> afraid of Slenderman. My friend and I were walking around at night together in the woods, and we saw a figure about a mile away. We stupidly decided to investigate. As we got closer, we saw that it was white, black, and tall. As soon as we came to the realization that it looked like Slenderman, we ran for our lives. We ran back to the cabin as fast as we could and locked ourselves in and didn't come out for a day.<br><br>Also, I went on a spooky walk last Halloween with my friends and we saw a Slenderman, but we didn't think it was an actual person because it never moved when we saw it. We went through the walk a few more times, and on the last time I looked over to the Slenderman and it slowly rose it's hand and waved to me and I ran straight 'outta there like sanic.

Okay, story time. So in my house, I have always felt a presence where ever I would go. But one night, I was laying in bed on my computer and my bed started shaking like crazy. My first thought "you live across from a rail road, duh" but I looked outside and saw no train. I freaked the f*ck out and stepped off my bed (bed still shaking) and looked everywhere to see if there was someone there, no one to be seen. So yes, I do believe in the supernatural. I'm usually made fun of for this story but thanks for reading.

Once, I ate a cheesepuff and scrunched up the packet. I didn't realise one was left and now it haunts me forever =O.<br><br>Seriously though, I'm not sure whether to class my experiences as supernatural. I've had a weird sense of deja vu where I dreamed of something one night and it happened the next day exactly as I dreamed (that counts as a supernatural experience).<br><br>I don't think I've ever seen a ghost, though, which I'm glad for. It means that those of my relatives who have passed on have passed on peacefully; they're not bound to this world and forced to stay here in torment. Yes, I do believe that's how ghosts come to be and I believe in ghosts. Mock me if you must, but it's a source of comfort for me when a loved one passes away. =(

That's pretty amazing.<br>Sorry if this is too personal (you don't need to answer), but is it one of those conditions where some senses are over-developed while some are under-developed? Or are all of your senses at their intended stage of development, but some have developed past that point?<br><br>Sorry if that didn't really make sense. This is the first I've heard of that condition and I love to find out about new things, especially something as incredible (again, sorry if that's the wrong terminology - I'm thinking of it from a scientific point of view) as what you've described.<br><br>Thanks! =D<br><br>It's okay if you don't want to answer if it's too off-topic or personal.

That's pretty amazing.<br>Sorry if this is too personal (you don't need to answer), but is it one of those conditions where some senses are over-developed while some are under-developed? Or are all of your senses at their intended stage of development, but some have developed past that point?<br><br>Sorry if that didn't really make sense. This is the first I've heard of that condition and I love to find out about new things, especially something as incredible (again, sorry if that's the wrong terminology - I'm thinking of it from a scientific point of view) as what you've described.<br><br>Thanks! =D<br><br>It's okay if you don't want to answer if it's too off-topic or personal. I have no life. xD

I actually don't know!<br><br>Ive had synesthesia since birth, and what my normal is could be different to someone without the synesthesia. Let's just say I can't hear high frequency noises like a dog. :P<br><br>But I'd say my senses are all pretty normal, as normal as they can be.
