"Minecraft players will be able to change their in-game names beginning Feb. 4, developer Mojang announced today on its official blog.

The new ability will be available to those with a Mojang account through their account page. Those who sign in with their email address are ready to go. Those who don't can migrate their account. Banned players who change their names will remain banned.

Names will remain unique with the new service, and "old unpaid usernames" will be freed up. Players will need to wait 30 days before changing again." 

If you change your Usernane what would you change it to and why?.
Ill probably keep mine:P
