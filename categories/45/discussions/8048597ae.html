If you're only talking about avicus, I don't know how accurate the 7 and 8's are, but if you're talking about overall, 7 and 8 is nowhere near accurate for anyone who says so, i'm going to confidently say no one on avicus can beat me in a 1v1 with swords (barring Stan if he still plays).

Such arrogance. I would decimate you.&nbsp;What the duck did you just ducking say you bow spamming nerd? I’ll have you know I rekt everyone in McPvP and I’ve been involved in numerous scrims on OCN, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in bow pvp and I’m the top PvPer in the entire community. You are nothing to me but just another block hitting scrub. I will wipe you the duck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this forum, mark my ducking words R-E-K-T. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, creeper. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of MasterGBerry's across the USA and your account is being traced right now so you better prepare for the /duel, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your skill. You’re ducking done, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare blocky hands. Not only am I extensively trained in sword combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of StanMPL's inventory and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the server, you little shite. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “cocky” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your ducking w key instead of t. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn nub. I will shit witches all over your cave and you will drown in them. You’re ducking dead, scrub.

I've beaten mukmuk every time we've 1v1d. Matsuzen would destroy me with a bow (he's a based god with a bow) but in swords he's not that good. Also AFAIK Matsuzen doesn't play avicus.

Such arrogance. I would decimate you.&nbsp;What the duck did you just ducking say you bow spamming nerd? I’ll have you know I rekt everyone in McPvP and I’ve been involved in numerous scrims on OCN, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in bow pvp and I’m the top PvPer in the entire community. You are nothing to me but just another block hitting scrub. I will wipe you the duck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this forum, mark my ducking words R-E-K-T. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, creeper. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of MasterGBerry's across the USA and your account is being traced right now so you better prepare for the /duel, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your skill. You’re ducking done, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare blocky hands. Not only am I extensively trained in sword combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of StanMPL's inventory and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the server, you little shite. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “cocky” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your ducking w key instead of t. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn nub. I will shit witches all over your cave and you will drown in them. You’re ducking dead, scrub.

He has only negative things to say about most topics. Also he left the server so he might as well leave the forums too. That is my opinion.
