Hacked for a long time but never admitted, too cocky but actually pretty funny. You seem to either be a massive dick or someone that's really fun to be around. Good, reliable player that i think if things had gone differently would probably be a close friend.

Ni que tu hubieras podido hacer algo mejor, nunca la carreas ni nada. Ademas, la partida fue 8v8 &nbsp;y nosotros tampoco teníamos líder (Yo tuve que hacer de líder con Hivlik) porque a Tazz no le funcionaba TS, informate mejor y que no se te suba el ego a la próxima porque bueno no eres.. gg

No es por sacarle creditos pero en esa partida, uno de los defensas estaba muteado y el otro ni siquiera era defensa; pero si es verdad que duro alrededor de 10min la partida.

You're another genuinely nice person who I don't feel could be mean to anyone as well as that you've lowkey been in top teams since the start of all this, I remember you were on my team in my first ever scrim and that is really cool.
