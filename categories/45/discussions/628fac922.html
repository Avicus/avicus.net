Hacked for a long time but never admitted, too cocky but actually pretty funny. You seem to either be a massive dick or someone that's really fun to be around. Good, reliable player that i think if things had gone differently would probably be a close friend.

Ni que tu hubieras podido hacer algo mejor, nunca la carreas ni nada. Ademas, la partida fue 8v8 &nbsp;y nosotros tampoco teníamos líder (Yo tuve que hacer de líder con Hivlik) porque a Tazz no le funcionaba TS, informate mejor y que no se te suba el ego a la próxima porque bueno no eres.. gg

No es por sacarle creditos pero en esa partida, uno de los defensas estaba muteado y el otro ni siquiera era defensa; pero si es verdad que duro alrededor de 10min la partida.

I think you've got more confident since you first started but somewhat too confident. You often hack in scrims and you're very loud. At times you can be pretty funny too.

You're another genuinely nice person who I don't feel could be mean to anyone as well as that you've lowkey been in top teams since the start of all this, I remember you were on my team in my first ever scrim and that is really cool. Also good job on being the only female in Apollo (Eric discluded) and the only female in old BC, you managed well :P<br><br>What sort of question is that of course i do
