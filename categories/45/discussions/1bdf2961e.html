No, he's right. You can actually ask jozz about receiving the rank, that's all there is to it.

Eh. Assuming the guy asking is a regular and has the means of asking jozzlez, I have no argument there. But I am disgruntled that the reply from a staff member is 'ask jozz' and not 'hey, I'll let jozz know you're interested'. Its all about taking initiative.

You're right, but his answer is still acceptable in means of how to receive it. I've forwarded it now.

Or with the people on the public TeamSpeak?<br><br>It really depends on your:<br>- Internet Bandwidth<br>- Content<br>- Quality<br><br>Just some words of wisdom from Mr shadowolf! Have a great Night!
