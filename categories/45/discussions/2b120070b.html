I also have seen a great amount of players that just seem to stop playing... i don't know why tho, then again there are many, many servers among the Minecraft community.

Yea, I still haven't managed to play certain gamemodes because no-one is on... Honestly I'm not sure how this can be fixed, the only popular servers seem to be Nebula and The Walls...

I think avicus might be getting a bit old... I'm not saying it's a bad server, I'm saying people like to try new things and with giant giant giant servers like hypixel, where no game mode would ever be empty, people can be lured away. It's sad...

Some people don't like to try new things like Skywars (which is non-existant) or Avicade though :c

Man when McZone was here, there were HUGE amounts of people for Nebula, Walls, SG and Elimination and then an average amount for the others.<br>Were talking bout 300 - 500 more people coming on daily before than now...<br>so yes, Avicus has dropped people and in the last month, some of our most well known people have left as well :(

Back in the days, MCZone peaked at 1050 players, I even made a post about raising the 0/1000 player cap on the old forums.<br><br>:/
