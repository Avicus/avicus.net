Since many of you are obviously unclear about what you can and can not say, any joke that directly attacks or makes fun of a player or a serious matter (Ebola, Cancer, Race, etc.) will not be tolerated. I was actually about to make a post like this myself. You all know what's appropriate and what's not. Let's use some common sense, here.

In addition to this, if we see this on either the Forums, TeamSpeak, or Avicus, we will not hesitate to carry out a punishment.<br><br>The severity of the punishment will be dependant on how, where, and what kind of joke you used. In most cases however, it will be a tempban.

No. But you may have to <b>explain</b> to the mod that both parties are aware that it's just a joke.&nbsp;<br><br>But considering you're messaging via PM, no-one could report you apart from you and your friend. Meaning that a mod wouldn't know unless one of you call them over deliberately. Which would be a bit weird considering there would be no need to call a mod because you'd be joking with each other.<br><br>Do you understand me? :)

Since many players seem to be confused, here's what I'll say.&nbsp;<br><br>Although we would prefer you did not say these jokes, we will not completely restrict you from saying it.&nbsp;<br>For example,<br>Saying the word "ebola" once won't give you a tempban, we will give you a verbal warning. When you start to use these jokes in a more severe, inappropriate answer, then you will be punished.&nbsp;<br><br>Lately the amount of Ebola jokes and such have been getting out of hand so this thread was made just as a clarification.

You made a leaving thread and have also not been on the server (on this account) for 20 days. Why exactly do you continue to stay around simply to post negative posts? If you have such an issue with the server (which is the vibe I get from a lot of your posts) then suggest on ways to improve it as opposed to just being negative for the sake of being negative. It benefits no one, least of all you.

It amazes me that people know almost nothing about HIV, AIDS, Cancer, Ebola, and&nbsp;<u>especially</u> Autism and are so ignorant as to joke about them. IMO Racist jokes are fine IF NO ONE TAKES OFFENSE TO THEM OR CARES. The brown people make jokes about their race at school and people will say stuff like, "brown parents" and no one will care because we're just joking around. Not even the brown people care you said that. :P&nbsp;<br>Bottom line is that you can't just punish that if no one cared or everyone, including people of that race found it funny. Certain things have no exceptions. But certain things do. And read up a little on something before you make an ignorant joke/comment about it.&nbsp;<br>Just imagine the life you'd have to go through of you had Autism and/or were Gay.&nbsp;<br>You'd basically get bullied and insulted every day and probably would have little to no friends because loads of people are really shallow. How would you feel if evey day of your life you had to feel like complete shit because you were BORN that way?&nbsp;<br><br>This is just common sense, think about it.

If you see this happen I highly recommend you report it, but I highly doubt any member of the staff team would act that way.

I hate these freakin Ebola jokes, I can't stand them. Just because it's affecting people far away from North America people decide to make fun of it and laugh at a disease.... If Ebola was a thing here in Canada and USA no one and I mean absolutely NO ONE would make fun of it.
