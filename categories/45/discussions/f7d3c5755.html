Just a general question.<br>He has pretty much no comedy.<br>He is very boring.<br>And he has a pretty annoying accent, not as bad as some however.....<br>Why does he have so many subs?

The real question is would you want your kids to watch Sky or Pewdiepie or Stampy? Between Sky and Pewdipie they have more comedy. Their content/'comedy' are more violent though, compared to Stampy, he plays games with animals and is always encouraging<i>.</i>&nbsp;I&nbsp;find personally Stampy to be more uplifting and happy. Plus he has played with a penguin...Penguin &lt;3<br><br>Sidenote: Why are gamechaps popular?

Everyone has a different taste in humour. <br>What you might consider funny-someone else might not and vice versa.<br><br>Stampy is a very successful Youtuber who's audience mainly consists of children. As you may have probably already seen, his content is focused towards the younger demographic. <br>Older people may not see the attraction of his content, which is fine.<br><br>Each too their own, everyone has a different taste and opinion. <br>Respecting that is key.
