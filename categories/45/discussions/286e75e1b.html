I know that not a lot of you like me but I guess that's just life anyway I'm leaving minecraft for good and I'd like to say thx to a couple of people!<br><br>NathCoach: Without you my team would never had started so I'd Like to say I really appreciate the help you gave me and thx heaps<br><br>Acceqted: Even though we had our fights I felt you were a great team mate and even though I didn't want to hear some negative things about my team, U told me what I needed to hear so thx!<br><br>7hr133n and ur many alts: when times hit hard on the Assassins team u said "I don't care how stupid it seems, I'm staying with the Assassins till they die!" So for being heapful loyal and a good mate, Thank you!<br><br>DaFrozenBlaze: I never became good friends with you or anything but your easily one of the nicest people on Avicus and I believe would make an excellent mod!<br><br>To my whole team who was loyal: Thanks without you guys I obviously wouldn't have had a team! So cheers!<br><br>To Everyone who was mean to me in the mega scrim: I don't know why you didn't like me but I think what you did was not called for and made me feel terrible!<br><br>Sorry if you guys don't understand my grammar I am an Australian so yeah! Anyway thanks for a good run and I know a lot of you don't even care that I'm leaving but I'd like to say thx to the avicus community!
