Things are good thanks!<br>I rejoined and retired from the staff team while you were away lol.<br><br>Para is working on The Stratus Network. It's kind of like The Overcast Network with similar staff members. It looks cool.<br><br>Lots of other people have left and are doing their own thing.&nbsp;<br><br>I'm not really here that often these days, but meh, I'm always floating around :P
