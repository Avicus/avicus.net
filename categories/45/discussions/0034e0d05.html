I've had an issue for a while now.<br>Sometimes while playing games my monitors stop working, they just freeze or become totally blacked out. Sometimes the whole pc restarts while doing this, and sometimes the screen just get blacked out and after a few seconds it appears as normal and I won't crash again.<br><br>This is getting really annoying with the fact that I had to wait like 1 hour today to get my pc back to normal after a freeze.<br><br>I've got windows 8.0<br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/iebDHTl.png" title="Image: http://i.imgur.com/iebDHTl.png"><br>I got a gtx 760 card aswell..<br><br>I'm not the best with computers when it comes down to stuff like this, so if anyone know what I should do I would be more than happy to hear you out.

Maybe, but it seems inconsistent with a temperature problem, I'm thinking more that the PSU is shoddy and giving out less power than needed.
