Before i start, i just want to say that I am not used to the new website, so I do not know where to post this.<br>But anyways, A while ago I was banned for scamming because I did not give a rank account because something was wrong with my parents credit card. I was giving away an emerald rank. The person who won, said He would take gold because he heard of my problem. SINCE I bought both gold, AND emerald [I did not upgrade, I literally bought both], I would like to give my Gold rank away to him, and keep the emerald to myself since he bought both. I contacted Avigill, he said he would talk to funky, but I never got a response. I would like a Manager/Admin to talk to funky and ask if this is ok. If so, give my gold rank to Evocal. I was also told that I would be unbanned, once I give the rank out. Thank you for your time. if you need to, contact me Via skype at: AlexTheEpic99.<br><br>Have a nice day<br><br>~AlextheEpic99.

I that is the case then evocal should say that here. You didnt even remember who the winner was and it doesnt make sense that they would ask for the worse thig because you made a mistake, it isnt helping your situation any.

hakk you wanna know the truth? well here it is. my parents are low middle class, our insurance sucks, and we keep having to pay for supplies for managing my diabetes. craft and evo knew my money situation, and on the old forum, they said they would be fine with gold, im giving the rank to evo because he was the actual winner.

The importance is that he wants Evo to get his rank because he was the original winner. If Evo doesn't get his rank he will feel really really bad. He just wants to feel better and get unbanned.

Okay, alex, the money is already with the server, so whether or not you are poor how is it better that that money go towards your donator than the winners? I dont care im simply stating that this seems odd and you should consider that
