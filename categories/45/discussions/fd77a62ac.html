Please people! Stop complaining about how Avicus is laggy or takes 3 minutes to login but just deal with it, Avicus is a great server with or without lag, We have a great moderator system, Briliant Administrators who do their best to make avicus a safe, fun and enjoyable experience for everyone and top it all off, we have map developers who work tirelessly trying to create maps and judge maps by us, the public, to give us a server to play on,<br><br>So please, if it isn't too much trouble, Stop complaining, or posting that "It takes me 3 minutes to login to Avicus, WHAT DO I DO!! Fix it NOW!" Because mods and senior mods and enough to do running avicus than to put of with garbage like that and when they lock 1 conversation, someone else will just make a new one!<br><br>See What I mean people, so please just be thankful to have such a great server to play on and stop complaining about connection.<br><br>Cheers<br>- Sheamus

Staff are doing there best to remove flaws from the staff team and that is abusing /report sir, Avicus gets rid of people who don't meet their requirements as a member of the staff and replaces them with people who are diligent and faithful the our server.
