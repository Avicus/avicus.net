Say that someone across the room is using their
telepathic powers to cheat off you.<br></span>

the door.&nbsp; Then ask how you got there.<br></span>

<span>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;Raise your hand and ask if you can be excused to
skip class.<br></span>

<span>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;Meow and bark randomly.&nbsp;<br></span><span>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hold your head and groan, then tell your teacher
your multiple personalities are fighting.&nbsp;<br></span>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;Walk into class and look around confused.&nbsp; Ask where you are, then say that you thought

Read a book, and when class starts, raise your

and say “Sorry for being late, I just broke out of prison (even if you aren’t
late).

<br><span>14.&nbsp;&nbsp;

15.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Raise your hand and introduce the class to your
imaginary friend “Carl”.&nbsp; Then loudly whisper
to Carl that this class sucks.

Chew gum loudly.&nbsp;
When the teacher says, “I hope you brought enough for everyone”, take
out packs of gum and start passing them out.

<br>17.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Smack gum loudly.&nbsp; When told to take it out, put it on your
finger and insist that you have no gum.&nbsp;
Put it back in and repeat.

<br>18.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Stand up and introduce yourself at the start of

Speak a foreign language class (not in a foreign
language class).<br></span>

<span>26.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Write ‘Gullible’ on a piece of paper.&nbsp; Tape it anywhere in the classroom.&nbsp; Then tell everyone that there is ‘Gullible’
on wherever you put it.&nbsp; If they don’t believe
you, point and then say “MADE YOU LOOK!!!”<br></span>

<span>27.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Randomly laugh hysterically (no reason).<br></span>
