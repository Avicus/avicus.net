The title explains itself. And please, only a maximum of 3-5 per person. I know you all have an arsenal full of those, but I don't want a bunch of huge lists :P<br><br>Mine would probably be trying to remove a staple with my fingers, since it ended up getting stuck through my thumb instead.

I actually did this a while back, and I'm going back to the same location today.<br><br>Again, when I was rockclimbing, I decided to hang off the edge of the mountain with one hand. I managed to hang there for a bit, until it started to rain. The mountain is made of slippery granite, so I ended up slipping off the edge.<br><br>Now, I'm pretty sure I would've died. This mountain is about 1200m high. But I managed to pull out my climbing pick mid-fall and dig it into the rockface on a ledge below. It was very stupid of me, but I'm probably going to end up doing it again.

Do I even bother explaining?<br><br>You saw the slope, it's not something a harness needs. I was stupid and didn't follow basic safety. And I wasn't five when I did the climb. :P

I was in the middle of Maths class, listening to my French homework (we had to download a recording and listen to it, then answer questions based on what we heard). The maths teacher called out to me, then pointed at a number on the board (basically meaning "Yo, answer this textbook question"). Since I was focusing on French homework, I wrote out a random sentence from the recording the answer the question, completely forgetting that I was in a Maths class.<br><br>Let's just say not only was it not the correct answer to the Maths question (obviously), but the grammar in the question was also off, therefore making it an incorrect answer to the French questions..

i got a couple.<br><br>this is a sexual one. one time i was with this girl, walking back to her house, both of us a little bit drunk. She turns around and says "i really want you." okay, fine, I think she means sex, great. but we're in the middle of the street. so i l look around for a second and say "do you like that lawn?" and shes like what and yknow i said "i mean if you like that lawn, yhknow ... we can go there" and that just COMPLETELY killed the mood. we just kept walking and nothing happened.&nbsp;<br><br>another sexual one. this one time i met this girl from nyack, and we talked and i went up to her town. parents at her house, she wanted to hook up - fine. so we find a abandoned school and hang out there, start making out. note that she has braces on. we're making out and something comes into my mouth - a piece of food from her mouth to mine. you know those moments when youre doing something and you "wake up"? like realize whats happening? i did that. totally took me out of the moment, and i kinda backed off and we walked around the town. great town, by the way.

She turns around and says "i really want you." okay, fine, I think she means sex, great. but we're in the middle of the street. so i l look around for a second and say "do you like that lawn?" and shes like what and yknow i said "i mean if you like that lawn, yhknow ... we can go there" and that just COMPLETELY killed the mood. we just kept walking and nothing happened.&nbsp;<br><br>another sexual one. this one time i met this girl from nyack, and we talked and i went up to her town. parents at her house, she wanted to hook up - fine. so we find a abandoned school and hang out there, start making out. note that she has braces on. we're making out and something comes into my mouth - a piece of food from her mouth to mine. you know those moments when youre doing something and you "wake up"? like realize whats happening? i did that. totally took me out of the moment, and i kinda backed off and we walked around the town. great town, by the way.

third - this one time in california i was on venice beach and i walked up to this Jamaican dude. he offered me a CD for free, and unbeknownst to me, it was a scam. i pick up the cd from the guy, and i start to walk off - he puts his hand on my shoulder and says "naw man you want my signature?" so i said yeah and he wrote it on (and spelled my name wrong). the scam is that the Cd is free (because they can't technically sell stuff) and then the signature is 5$. my dad comes up and i dont have any money on me so he talks to the guy. my dad is funny in that when he talks to someone with a accent he starts to use that accent. when my dad starting angrily speaking in a Jamaican accent i knew i fucked up.&nbsp;<br><br>i learned not to do that again. the CD wasnt terrible, for the 5$, actually, but still.&nbsp;<br><br>funny thing is, when i was getting out a grand central terminal one time, i saw another guy doing the same scam. he said to me "free CD" so i just took it from his hand and walked away. he knew i was onto it so he grabbed the CD back and called me a fucking punk. good times.

You know those times during after the last school bell and you got varsity practice after and you decide to go the restrooms for abit during practice only to realize that ALL the mens restrooms for students are closed, then you're like "The womens restroom is still open..." *looks around* "fuck it..." *uses the womens restroom* "Omg hoooo" *steps out and check if anyones around* *RUNS BACK TO PRACTICE HOPING NO ONE SAW*<br><br>Btw, for some reason they only close all the mens restrooms but not the womens after last bell in our school when we also have male teachers, but majority of our teachers are young and female

I was at a Taekwondo tournament, and we were supposed to leave the hotel to practice, but the whole team decided for some unbeknownst reason to go into a conference room and have a dance party, and some big lady that worked at the hotel came in and started dancing with us.

i was climbing without a harness when all of a sudden a bolt of lighting hit the rocks in nepal,my hand was fried so i had to slice it off from the elbow down. I play minecraft whith a hook as a hand. So back to the story I was slicing my hand with a plastic spoon i had found in the river,unbeknownst to me the spoon had come from apple fields which had down syndromes spit all of it.The down syndromes deadly spit, has a&nbsp;unbeknownst illness called malariatism this is a deadly illness&nbsp;unbeknownst to me i had this and for 7 days i was in the yorkshire countryside without crisps or any kind of liquid,i resorted to drinking my own piss and eating my own faeces. i was about a 1/4 of a mile away from the nearest town which is called york.<br><br>I had sent up many flares to try and get the apple fields search and rescue to help me but&nbsp;unbeknownst to me the were not flares it was just a torch, this broke my little autistic heart.. After sitting in a little cave with my rabbits I was eventually found by these young children who dragged me to safety.

Me and friends were fooling around one day, and I grabbed my lighter and grabbed my friends axe (as in the Cologne) and just started acting like a pyro maniac, literally 10 seconds later, I caught my arm on fire. Luckily, I had my stupid friends over, and they did absolutely nothing, just stared at my arm and started laughing. Then my parents came out and poared water on it so it was cool. Caught the lawn on fire too.<br><br>Yes, I smoke.

I actually did this a while back, and I'm going back to the same location today.<br><br>Again, when I was rockclimbing, I decided to hang off the edge of the mountain with one hand. I managed to hang there for a bit, until it started to rain. The mountain is made of slippery granite, so I ended up slipping off the edge.<br><br>Now, I'm pretty sure I would've died. This mountain is about 1200m high. But I managed to pull out my climbing pick mid-fall and dig it into the rockface on a ledge below.

Alright. This is really awkward. So in my school all the teachers are old af, but our history teacher is young and my classmates always make jokes about how hot she is and some other stuff I won't write in that post (I think you can understand yourself xd). So one time after the lesson ended and the next lesson was history, the teacher didn't come, so me and my friend decided to go to the first floor to ask the head teacher if we have the lesson, while going down the stairs I fell and my head was stuck right in the history's teacher breast, I did not understand where I am and I started shaking my head, and my friend was laughing. Oh god, so awkward.

Alright. This is really awkward. So in my school all the teachers are old af, but our history teacher is young and my classmates always make jokes about how hot she is and some other stuff I won't write in that post (I think you can understand yourself xd). So one time after the lesson ended and the next lesson was history, the teacher didn't come, so me and my friend decided to go to the first floor to ask the head teacher if we have the lesson, while going down the stairs I fell and my head was stuck right in the history's teacher breast, I did not understand where I am and I started shaking my head, and my friend was laughing. Oh god, so awkward.

Me and friends were fooling around one day, and I grabbed my lighter and grabbed my friends axe (as in the Cologne) and just started acting like a pyro maniac, literally 10 seconds later, I caught my arm on fire. Luckily, I had my stupid friends over, and they did absolutely nothing, just stared at my arm and started laughing. Then my parents came out and poared water on it so it was cool. Caught the lawn on fire too.<br><br>Yes, I smoke. It's bad for you, don't suggest trying it out at all, unless if you just try it and is smart enough to realize that you're getting addicted.<br><br>I'm a bad boy&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(64, 64, 64); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;  ">( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)</span>

So I was in gym changing, and some idiot pulled the fire alarm (btw my school is in the hood, we literally have people who do weed in the bathroom and fight teachers) and I was in my underwear. I pulled on my shorts and t shirt and ran, but it turned out my shorts were on backwards, and it was raining, and a lot of people saw me, and luckily I was it the middle of a fist fight, so that day went great.<br><br>Its not the stupidest thing I've ever done, not even in top 50, but it's something.&nbsp;<br><br>My school is midway in the hood idk how to explain

I stuck my leg in between two metal poles at school in 5th grade and had to get the nurse to free my leg. Took oil, melted butter and an ice pack to finally free it. I had a bruise the size of a baseball on each side of my right thigh for like a week xD

i was climbing without a harness when all of a sudden a bolt of lighting hit the rocks in nepal,my hand was fried so i had to slice it off from the elbow down. I play minecraft whith a hook as a hand. So back to the story I was slicing my hand with a plastic spoon i had found in the river,unbeknownst to me the spoon had come from apple fields which had down syndromes spit all of it.The down syndromes deadly spit, has a&nbsp;unbeknownst illness called malariatism this is a deadly illness&nbsp;unbeknownst to me i had this and for 7 days i was in the yorkshire countryside without crisps or any kind of liquid,i resorted to drinking my own piss and eating my own faeces. i was about a 1/4 of a mile away from the nearest town which is called york.<br><br>I had sent up many flares to try and get the apple fields search and rescue to help me but&nbsp;unbeknownst to me the were not flares it was just a torch, this broke my little autistic heart.. After sitting in a little cave with my rabbits I was eventually found by these young children who dragged me to safety. They placed warm slugs onto my amputated hand to try to and re connect it but nothing worked not slugs not shit not anything.<br><br>&nbsp;Thankyou for reading this,this is my story, i hope i inspired many people that you can never give up &lt;3
