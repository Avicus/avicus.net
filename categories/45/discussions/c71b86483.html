Hey guys, so I basically am giving my channel a big update (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6nALb5Isx4" rel="nofollow">you can watch that video here</a>), and I really need someone to be able to make me a new channel art (NOT logo).<br><br>I don't want anything too complicated; all I want is:<br><b>- My name</b><br><b>- Twitter (symbol + URL)<br>- Some cool looking background (NOT MINECRAFT STYLE)<br></b><br><b></b>Anyways those are pretty much the only things I want on it, and I'll discuss more on Skype if you're able to do it for me.<br><br>Oh also, if you know anyone who can do it for free, let me know and if they're not on Avicus, I'll pay&nbsp;<b>YOU</b>&nbsp;the credits because of the reference.<br><br>Thanks!

I could give it a try. I'll make it a bit more cleaned up from that logo I made you.

I really like your work a lot, but I'm thinking something not Minecraft styled (mainly just text and some background pattern)<br><br>I know you're really good at Minecraft animation stuff, but if you could try something more along those lines, that'd be phenomenal (add my recent skype - playwithporky so we can talk a bit more if you're still interested)

When I come back from Romania, if you aren't satisfied, I can always hop on the bandwagon with Elsa, Venny, Liz and Ryan(I think) to make some God channel art lol
