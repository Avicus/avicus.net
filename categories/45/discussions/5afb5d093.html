He most likely used an auto clicker or some sort of mod/back to do some of those bridging types.

Besides the bridges he cheated on the video showed me a lot of new bridging techniques I haven't seen/tried before; such a bleeple.

I'm pretty sure it's possible if you have godly aim and timing and practice a lot but not really worth it. Ninja bridging is fast enough IMO.

7:29 watch in 0.25x<br><br>With legit cps (4-12 approx) you cannot keep constantly moving to the side especially with the angle showed in the video. If you take a look at his legs you can blatantly see that he never stopped moving niether a-d tapping like people do in order to breezily.<br>Therefore its pretty blatant he was using an autoclicker<br><br><br>Imo the whole point of the video was demonstrating different kinds of bridges, not do them legit or a tutorial of how to. Simply giving a brief look of different styles of bridges and some new ones that aren't well known.<br><br>But thats just my opinion xd

"Moonwalking" or moving backwards and placing blocks without shifting or strafing is impossible to do for more than a few blocks even with a 40 cps autolciker. It's not possible unless you're a robot or have a macro.<br>Derp bridging I think is slower than this and you can see clearly that Teddy Bridging is slower than "Moonwalking" as well by looking at his blocks per second counter.

Moonwalk is possible. Without high cps, too.

Well, nice that u guys have seen my video. But everything in this video was legitly performed (exept derpbridging, idk if it is legit). At Moonwalking I timed doubleclicks, like I did in my Tutorial für clicking twice with one click. ^^

In case some people here know me (maybe from ocn) I can confirm that everything in this video is legit, also moonwalk and tellybridge...&nbsp;<br><br>I was able to tellybridge too since it's a invention of Teddy and me (teddy+holly=telly) but I'm not able to do it anymore... Since it is possible to be way faster than Teddy was in his clip you can be way faster than derpbridge (which I can confirm to not be a macro as well) even tho teddys take on it was pretty much the same like derp^^

Can you please include a mousecam for moonwalking and maybe breeze. Sorry if it's already on your channel and I'm missing it.
