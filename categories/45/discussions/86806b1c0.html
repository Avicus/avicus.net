I've tried to stop several times, and I've actually gone a while without video games a couple of weeks ago. I'm not sure when I'll permanently stop gaming though, but it's bound to happen in the next two years.

The only video game I play is Minecraft. The only server I really play on is Avicus, so when Avicus dies, I will stop playing video games unless school gets really hard on me, but I doubt I'd have to quit because of school. I could manage myself. :P

I go through phases, I've already had a 6 month break from Avicus since a joined a little a year ago. So, as long as new, better games keep coming out, Ill most likely not stop playing them in my free time. But what do i know, I'm 13.

Yes, I have stopped playing. Easiest way: Find different activities in life, get a job, fill up your schedule so you don't have time for games.
