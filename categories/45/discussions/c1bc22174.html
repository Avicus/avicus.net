Yeah, I'd have to agree. It may seem pretty exhilarating and fun to watch them, but afterwards when you think about them, it's definitely not the best experience.. The best I've found (I haven't watched very many) is the Smiling Girl by CreepsMcPasta. He has an amazing, crisp voice and is really quite good at story telling in general.<br>Here's a link, although if you can't handle stuff like this, like me, &nbsp;I wouldn't recommend it.. &nbsp;<br><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUFyHScZWEY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUFyHScZWEY</a>

Two underrated ones are Mr. Mix and FunnyMouth. If you want good creepypastas that a lot of people know I suggest Squidward's Suicide, Lavender Town, and Ben Drowned.<br>I am thinking about writing two creepypastas soon, their names would be The Irish Torture Chamber and Sorry, Wrong Number.
