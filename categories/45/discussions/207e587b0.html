As the title said... they have a deal to buy Mojang for $2,000,000,000. It is suspected to be done by the end of this week.<br><br><br>Here's the article on it:&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/09/microsoft-in-serious-discussions-to-purchase-minecraft-dev-mojang">http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/09/microsoft-in-serious-discussions-to-purchase-minecraft-dev-mojang</a>

All I know is that mojang is more secure when people try to scratch your account password (all migrated accounts are taken out)...<br><br>I know this from experience :P I decided to scratch minecraft account passwords, got 2, one of them changed the password, other one I can still get on if I like :P

RIP Minecraft. This is the same company that said: Ya know the Xbox One has to always be online, Can't trade games to friends, and is 90% TV, Higher price than PS4 Etc negative stuff. Then later said: You know all that stuff we said earlier? We're totally not doing that at all, forget we said! We're doomed!

Bill Gates isn't part of Microsoft anymore, other than a shareholder. He was chairman until February 4th, 2014.

In my opinion, if Microsoft bought Minecraft they would add a pay to play feature which would ultimately kill off thousands maybe even millions of Minecraft players and BOOM! A waste of 2 billion dollars. Or Microsoft will keep multiplayer the same and the game will become much better with faster updates.

Because it really needs saving? People who aren't focused on the PvP aspect of it (a.k.a. the other 2 / 3's of the community...) think it's fine, including myself.<br><br>But, honestly... I would take this news with a grain of salt.<br>
<br>
The articles are stating that they want to buy Mojang for 2 billion 
dollars, and it is quite insane to believe that Mojang is worth 2 
billion dollars... And what benefit would Microsoft even have from 
obtaining Mojang? They now have a rag-tag team of developers, and a game
 that has already been out for years? Sure Minecraft still has lots of 
life left to go, but not worth 2 billion dollars kind of life.<br><br>In addition, I do not believe that Notch would be driven by monetary reasons. He's been quoted saying that "he has more money now than he could ever spend." In fact, I have a friend that <i>watched</i> him say that in an interview with Craig Ferguson.<br>
<br>
It'll be worth keeping an eye on, but until Mojang makes statements, I wouldn't believe any of it actually happening.
