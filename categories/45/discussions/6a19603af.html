<span>Two of my posts were archived. The first post was semi-understandable. The second archive was uncalled for since i did not instigate it and made some edits.&nbsp;<br><br>All i ask for is for no one to archive and let me have my peace. This really has made me see new things.&nbsp;<br></span><h1><b><u>My reasons for leaving:</u></b></h1><ul><li><b>#1: Bad decisions caused the server to lose player count.</b>&nbsp;I do not know who thought it was a good idea to get rid of CTW but&nbsp;<b><i>it was a very bad marketing decision.&nbsp;</i></b></li><li><b>#2: Degrading of avicus' community and poor moderating decisions.&nbsp;"In dark times the eye begins to see."</b>&nbsp;is relevant to this one. I've stayed with Avicus for a long time now and I've become to notice a lot of things that I do not like: Killfarming allowed, players banned on avicus being banned on TS, robotic-like and cold mods, and the faults on the players' side is simply too much to list.</li><li><b>#3:</b>&nbsp;<b>Loss of motivation, I've lost my will to make any more maps.</b>&nbsp;I have "mapmaker's block" right now. Also, I've been a mapmaker since around the ending of MCZone and all the way to here and still not mapdev, been trying my hardest but meh.&nbsp;<b>(Especially since my recent maps have great gameplay and YML seems to pan out quite well.)</b>&nbsp;Still don't have it and it really rubs me the wrong way to see that people who are newer to mapmaking have gotten mapdev with practically a snap of a finger :T I feel like I've been slapped in the face and my work spit on. Oh well.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2><b>(Do not take this the wrong way as I do not want to get into an unreasonable flame war.)</b></h2><br><b>"Any maps of mine not in the repo, perhaps I'll give 'em to other servers to make use of 'em. Heh, oh boy... perhaps they will find some usage on another server..."<br>- Zintenka</b><b><br><br></b><h2><b><u>Announcements</u></b></h2><ul><li>Remember, I am not gonna be completely off. Just gonna be inactive as hell.&nbsp;</li><li>Also, I&nbsp;<i>might&nbsp;</i>come back after the update.&nbsp;</li><li>So if you see me ingame then just know, I am just playing to see how avicus is doing.</li><li>Also, I want to play some Nebula as a "Goodbye party" of some sort.</li></ul>Good bye my fellow compatriots :)<br><br><h1>DO NOT ARCHIVE, I JUST WANT TO SAY GOODBYE TO MY FELLOW PLAYERS.</h1>

Well, gl. I thought you should have been Mapdev as well. IMO, it's kinda hard to remove kfing if the maps are designed to allow such. &nbsp;<br><br>If they really decided not to include CTW, I'm going more inactive...b/c that's bull...&nbsp;<br><br>Overall, gl and you're a great mapmaker.

Bye Zintenka D: Hopefully you come back after the update and your maps are put into the rots, they seem great :D I understand your frustration (pun not intended), but whatever you do later on, good luck!<br>~Frustration (kammy878)

Cya round Zin.<br>It annoys me to see the staff just blindly archiving people's posts, thinking they can just do things willy nilly.
