<span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What a year this has been. I still remember back in the Mczone days, when I would play walls, and boy, was I bad. Then after about a year of hardly even playing, I re-joined, and decided, “Why not join the forums?”. The first forum post I made was on “<i>Show your face to the World</i>”, and I got some interesting replies, including one that said “<i>You should get on teamspeak sometime</i>”. And I’m just sitting here thinking, “<i>What the heck is teamspeak?</i>”. I was playing in-game when Yoav came along,and encouraged me to get on. So, I downloaded it, and I joined. At first, I was scared of talking due to the fact that I was the only girl, but eventually, I was noticed and everyone was asking me to talk. Best decision I've ever made.</span><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Since that day, I’ve made many friends that I will cherish forever. Here are a few individuals that I would like to thank.<br><br><span><b>EmeraldSword85</b>- I remember back in “The Squaddd” days, I’m pretty sure you didn’t like me xD We weren’t really “close” at the time, and then I got you temp-banned.. But now, we’re pretty close, and I consider you as one of my best friends. Thank you.<br></span><span><b>Sulorak</b>- Oh goodness, have we had our ups and downs, but I’m thankful that you’re my friend. Even though you can be a buttnugget sometimes, I still enjoy talking and having a laugh with you. Thank you.<br></span><span><b>Lil_Greg15</b>- You make me smile a lot, and you’ve been a really cool friend. Thank you.<br></span><span><b>SomeonedoesMC (Kat)</b>- You were one of my first friends, and I’ll never forget you. Thank you.<br></span><span><b>Bpirr</b>- I’ve only heard you talk once, and it was when we played UHC. I wish we had been more close at the time so I wouldn’t have been so awkward xD Thank you.<br></span><span><b>CrafterPete1013</b>- Even though we get a lot of hate for being friends, I’ve enjoyed getting to know you, I’ve sent you some really embarrassing snapchats, so you’re obviously pretty special. Thanks for making me laugh and smile.<br></span><span><b>FrostedCupcakez</b>- Jess, you’re an awesome person. I’m so glad you’ve started getting on teamspeak lately, and that you’ve joined the penny fam. Stay you. Thank you.<br></span><span><b>_Quesadillas_</b>- I know he probably won’t see this because he hardly ever gets on, but I wanted to include him. Case, you’re a really cool guy, with great taste in music. Even though we’ve hit some rough patches, I’m glad we’re all good again. Thank you.<br></span><span><b>Yoavkipper</b>- I know he probably won’t see this as well, but I’d like to thank Yoav for being an awesome friend. I miss you so much, and I hope to see you return soon. I miss those late night group video calls in the “Kool Kids Klub”. Thank you.<br></span><span><b>DoctaPop</b>- I remember back when you were mod. Lol. We’ve had some fun times, I remember when we all built that giant house and you would always hide in my room and do stupid stuff… heh. Thanks for all the laughs, can’t wait to help you out with more surveys soon.<br></span><span><b>Staff Team</b>- Thank you guys (and girls), for all the fun times, and all the fun discussions that&nbsp;we've&nbsp;had in staff chat. Hope you all have a great new&nbsp;year.<br></span><span><b>Glitchy1</b>-&nbsp;</span>Well, what do I say, You've forever changed my life. You're always here when I need a shoulder to cry on. You've seen me at my best, and my worst. How could I ever forget someone like you? Thank you, so much.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thank you to anyone who took the time to read this, and anyone who wished me a "Happy Birthday". &nbsp;Apologies if I left anyone out, but just know that you’re still important to me. I hope everyone has a great New Year, make it a good one. Cheers.</span>
