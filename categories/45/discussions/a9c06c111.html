Was given permission from my parents to build my own computer, was wondering where I could get some parts. I have around a 600 to 700 dollar budget. This includes things like ram and a windows license so, I would like to know where to get some good parts

You should buy&nbsp;from Ebay they pretty much have everything at cheaper prices. Things might be Used but you won't be able to tell the difference.<br><br>I made a $150 build reusing a computer case I found from the street and some RAM lying around the house. I get 100+ fps all the time on normal settings.

You take such a big risk buying off of that... Not worth it if you have the money to buy a new computer...<br>I would also recommend waiting just a little bit longer, Skylake CPU's are coming out soon, yes they might be a little more expensive, but it will be worth it..<br><br>Here's an intel build:&nbsp;<a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/user/wrre/saved/YgBtt6" title="Link: https://pcpartpicker.com/user/wrre/saved/YgBtt6">https://pcpartpicker.com/user/wrre/saved/YgBtt6</a>&nbsp;(However:)<br><br>&nbsp;<br>I can't decide all parts for you. I don't know your preference (win 8, or 7?). How much storage do you need/want?&nbsp;What your case should looks like. What you're going to use it for.. etc. But this is a basic Mid-range build that will get by with a decent GPU and an upgrade-able CPU this is fine for what I think you're going to use it for.

If you invest into better parts, you will be able to record. $700 is more than enough.

Mine is probably overkill for your needs, I just got enough money, then I was able to buy the parts I needed/wanted (^~^) for my build, and... built it!

What are your uses? For a computer that will go well on nearly any modern game at 1080p, this&nbsp;<a href="http://pcpartpicker.com/p/JXYX7P">http://pcpartpicker.com/p/JXYX7P</a>&nbsp;will do the trick.

Well, I know it's kind of vague, but mostly what I want is 16gb of ram, win 7 that can record with good fps.

I would say, look at some of <a title="Link: http://maximumpc.com" rel="nofollow" href="http://maximumpc.com">MaximumPC</a>'s budget builds. They're designed for gaming, and are usually about 700 dollars. They also provide tips for the special parts.<br><br>Here's their spring budget build: <a title="Link: http://www.maximumpc.com/maximum-pcs-budget-gamer-build-for-may-2015/" href="http://www.maximumpc.com/maximum-pcs-budget-gamer-build-for-may-2015/">http://www.maximumpc.com/maximum-pcs-budget-gamer-build-for-may-2015/</a>

RAM is nowhere are near as important as CPU, GPU and so on. I would recommend you to get an SSD, because its like 2x as fast as normal HDD. What I would do, is that I would get a 1 TB normal HDD, and a 60 GB+ SSD, for things like OS (windows) games you like to play or even antiviruses. But aLl you need is 4 GB of RAM, I would recommend 8.

From personal experience buying second hand is totally worth it. For $200 USD I have been able to get myself an i5 2320, GTX 750, 8gb's of ram, 700watt PSU. I can get around 300 fps on minecraft on max settings, and can easily record. When buying second hand just be careful <u>who</u> you buy from. Make sure they have good reviews.<br><br>ALso, I know I usually insist on people get a fair amount of ram, but there is no way you need 16gb's, unless you plan on doing renders, and even then, 8gbs and 16gbs will have barely any difference in speed.<br><br>If you want to get a brand new PC, you should go with _Phyres build, it will easily do what you want.

<a href="http://pcpartpicker.com/p/phJkZL" title="Link: http://pcpartpicker.com/p/phJkZL">http://pcpartpicker.com/p/phJkZL</a>&nbsp;(With monitor)<br><br><a href="http://pcpartpicker.com/p/VgmxvK" title="Link: http://pcpartpicker.com/p/VgmxvK">http://pcpartpicker.com/p/VgmxvK</a>&nbsp;(Without monitor)<br><br>I highly recommend the second build, it will be much better at recording/rendering than the first one, it has a better CPU and GPU.&nbsp;I don't know if you need a monitor or not, but if you do, try to see if you can use a small TV or something. You don't need 16GB of RAM, you will barely ever hit 8GB of usage.&nbsp;Also, although SSDs are a lot faster than HDDs, they are much more expensive in terms of GB/$, you need a big enough HDD to make sure you can store all your video files and games.<br><br>You probably do want to get new parts, and I do recommend it since it's your first time and it will give you piece of mind having new parts and not having to worry about anything not working (although new parts can be defective too). However, if you know what you're doing and you're careful enough, you can get a really powerful build buying used parts from ebay. I built a $120 PC that runs Minecraft at about 70-150 FPS on normal settings and I've helped someone (PokerFace) with a similar build that was also around $150 and runs Minecraft at above 100 FPS. I've built both new and used, and both computers run very well.
