Hey everyone!<br>Max here with another strange problem. This one isn't necessarily math, but I would say its almost impossible to solve (even if its only a logic problem). I found this problem while reading BBC News: Its a problem Singapore used to measure teenagers ability to think logically (at least I'm pretty sure what it was... I know it was for teens), and it baffled the world. If you think you can solve this mind numbing puzzle, good luck!!!<br><br>"Albert and Bernard just become friends with Cheryl, and they want to know when Cheryl's birthday is. Cheryl gives them a list of possible dates.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>May 15 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;May 16 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;May 19<br>June 17 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; June 18<br>July 14 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;July 16<br>August 14 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; August 15 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; August 17<br><br>Cheryl then tells Albert and Bernard separately the month and day of her birthday respectively.<br><br>Albert: I do not know when Cheryl's birthday is, but I know Bernard does not know too.<br>Bernard: At first I don't know when Cheryl's birthday is, but I know now.<br>Albert: Then I also know when Cheryl's birthday is.<br><br>So when is Cheryl's birthday?"<br><br><br>Good luck on your endeavors! I hope someone gets it (Please do not look up or link content. Just guess and show logical reasoning).<br><br>-Max

Damnit, I used to know how to solve this problem.<br>It's a case of trial and error with the given dates.<br><br>It is possible to find the answer with the information given, I just can't remember how to do it xD

It's <b>may 15</b>, if you add both numbers together and subtract the amount of letters from the sum you get 3 =&gt; 3 sides =&gt; triangle =&gt; illuminati. But July 16 also equals 3. To determinate what date it is, you have to add the amount of the letters to the sum of the numbers. Now for may 15 you'll get 9 and for July 16 you get 11. Now if you subtract the 3 from the first calculation from 9 (second calculation) you get 6. Now you did 3 calculations. 3 times the 6 is 666 also known as the number of the devil. Since Cheryl is the name of the devils wife in some religions or such it's confirmed that&nbsp;<b>may 15&nbsp;</b><b></b>is the birthday of the devils wife and the date of the founding of the illuminati.

Ok, since Albert told Bernard he (Bernard) doesn't know, it means it must be a month in which the date is similar to another (Bernard has options to guess from). Thus, the only pairs are [May 15, August 15],[May 16, July 16],[June 17, August 17], and [July 14,&nbsp;<span>August 14]. Since June 18 is no longer an option, the updated list goes as follows:&nbsp;<br></span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; ">May 15 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;May 16 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;May 19</span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; "><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; ">June 17 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; "><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; ">July 14 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;July 16</span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; "><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; ">August 14 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;August 17<br></span><br>As you can see, June now only has one option: the 17th, driving Bernard to state how he now knows.<br><br>That's what I've gotten out of it, at least :P

July 16<br>Dis b mah logic ya'll<br>If Albert know dat Bernard aint know, dat means it can't be in a month where der is a number dat aint repeated, so since 19 and 18 aint repeated it cant be May and June<br>But now since May and June is gone we can discard dem, and with the remaining dates we know dat 14 repeats itself so Albert aint know if they was the answer, so it can't be a 14.<br>So Now cos Albert knows den if Bernard knows he cant have been told August, cos if Bernard knew he cant tell btwn which august it is; but if he was told July den he'd know which one it is cos der is only 1 option.<br>I think i did it :D

I remember there was a thread somewhere on the Internet where I posted my reasoning, and they told me it was incorrect, but it was just a simple subtraction mistake hehe.&nbsp;<br><br>But I think I recall it was may or July 16, can't remember
