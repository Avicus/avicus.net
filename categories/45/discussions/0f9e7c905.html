As most of you know, yeah its Jake on yet another account. But I got my retired rank on this account, (plus it isn't as easy to just switch accounts anymore) so yeah. But I just want to apologize for a few things.<br><br>When I was promoted to Administrator, from that very moment on up until the day I retired, I had been planning ideas with Jozz, Tel, and the EC. However, all of my plans were meant to be for when the Nise Update was released. I know I already made this known a few times, but I'd rather make it official. Because of the fact that I hadn't released or hosted any Community Events from that point up until my retirement, I'm sorry. I'm sorry if it caused boredom throughout the Community, or it just reflected badly on me.&nbsp;<br><br>I just figured I'd apologize, and now seemed appropriate to do so. Thanks, guys.<br><br>Regards, -Jake
