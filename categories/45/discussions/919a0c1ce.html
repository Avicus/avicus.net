Yeah been inactive for a while, seeing most of my old friends leave. I have have read many forum posts saying they were sick of the community, tired of playing Minecraft and not hanging out with their friends IRL. I can understand the last point...but wow I'd never thought they were much of a Minecraft fan. They should come back from time to time I mean they'd probably like to visit us sometime again.<br><br>Well yeah that's all I gotta say.

Its not like every single person is leaving avicus... I think these leaving threads are making people think that every single person/regular is leaving, but new ones may be joining everyday :p
