Here it is everyone, as promised!<br><br>I went on random.org, and put in&nbsp;<b>all 78 names</b> of those of who who entered for the giveaway! Yes, I did this 3 days earlier than I said I would, but the sooner the better!<br><br>Since there were 78 of you who entered, the chance of each of you winning is just over 1%, so do not be too disappointed if you lost.<br><br>Anyways, here is the video, and congratulations to the winner! Make sure to leave a comment on this thread within the next week, or the prize will go to the second person on the list!<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VKbWOl3AhM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VKbWOl3AhM</a>

It wouldn't surprise me if this was a scam, as you are a good friend of another scammer who strangely enough have a giveaway at the same time as you.

Alright, you are entitled to your own opinion, but I already added Jive on Skype and I am going to give him the account when I get on my laptop. I do have a question for you however; what would be the purpose of "scamming"? To enter this giveaway you did not have to subscribe to anything, so I am not gaining anything. This giveaway was meant to be something from me to the community for Christmas, but I did it a few weeks later. Also, I did a giveaway a few months ago, and that one proved to not be a scam.

You calling me a scammer!? Yes, I did scam in the past, but I came clean and I am re-making another giveaway.&nbsp;<br><br>1. If I scam again it would be obvious I scammed because of my past<br>2. If I scammed again I would probably be perm banned<br>3. If I scam I would lose my chance of getting my interview (which I have been accepted for) and lose my chance of being mod which I have been trying to get for the past year since I have joined Avicus.<br><br>Like Porky said, you are entitled to your opinion but please look at any facts before accusing of something that has happend around half a year ago and that I have confessed and apologized for as well as doing something that I gain nothing out of except the trust back of people I scammed, my giveaway was asking for nothing except to put your name in and you would be entered, I would also be losing some money that I worked for myself a real job, its not my parents money I'm using, its my own.<br><br>I hope my comment did not offend you at all as I am just trying to save you from someone who my hulk on you later on in you're life if you accuse of things that happends months ago.

I do think it's scamming when you are having giveaways with accounts that doesn't even exist, or ranks, as your friend did. If you actually do give away the account, kudos to you, as I said in my post, I wouldn't be surprised if it was/is a scam. You are gaining the attention, when you post your videos in order for people to see what to do and who won, I'll even quote your own friend. <br><br><a href="http://youtu.be/eV-z8t3FbKA" rel="nofollow">http://youtu.be/eV-z8t3FbKA</a><br>0:20 - 1:00

Read my last post, if Porky were scamming he would be risking:<br>1. A ban<br>2. Lose peoples trust<br>3. Lose an awesome Server<br>4. Lose the awesome chance of getting an interview for mod (which he has got the interview) that he has been trying to get for a whole year now.

S3M3L, you can believe what you want, but I'm done talking about this. Read what Vlad wrote in his last post, because that's exactly what I was going to say as well. If you really care about this, and don't want to drop the subject, you can ask Jive in the next 1-3 days if I gave him the account.&nbsp;<br>I'm done with this argument, as I can see that it will turn into a flame war. I will not respond to your posts regarding this subject anymore, Semel.
