Well, seems like the meme-train is coming to its last stop and I get the feeling nobody wants to get off. Its been an amazing journey and to be honest I have made some great friends. I would like to thank the community for accepting me as the noob builder that I am, and also playing some of my maps. I am glad to announce that just today I have got Jr.Mod on Pagoda so if you wanna keep seeing me, that is probably the place to go (or Avicus SMP &lt;3 Atdit). I wish this didn't have to end, but it seems like there is no stopping it. Ty to Rockyyyyy for letting me play with NewDawn, and then to all the numerous members of the different versions&nbsp;of Xenarch who accepted me into their team too.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>I will still be hanging around with as many people as I can, so go to Pagoda if you wanna keep seeing me around :)!<br>Friends who I will always miss (Even if I still see you rn): Lokigh&nbsp;(I finally saw your photo, neat haircut ;)), Czco, PowerPixel (Buddy Boi), Rilo, Xtra, Rocky, mels, Sweedie, Clijmart&nbsp;(Thankyou for teaching me World Edit!),&nbsp; Patrikano, Murph, resepignev (LEGEND OF MODERATORS), mench, Preni, NoPressureV2 and many others.<br>One day I will be good at PvP lel,<br><br>Goodbye my friends see you on the other side, Ask me any questions btw!<br><br>KomodoLord1 (PS, I will always remeber&nbsp;Piez setting Walluar Chaos and then world editing blocks to diamonds mid-game lel, the good old days!
