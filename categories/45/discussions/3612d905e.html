LOLLLLLL<br><br>All I want to say is that walls is fun. The only reason many people don't play it is because they don't know any shit so they leave before walls drop. You guys can spare 15-20 mins playing walls. It was like me. I was never a fan myself of walls. I only could get full iron on tetris maps. I can get full diamond and beast. Take 15-20 mins out of your life and try some walls

^^^^^^^<br>Walls is fun but there is nothing more aggravating that fighting a 2v1 and dying after you kill one person and bring the other down to two hearts :/<br><br>2v1s. 2v1s for days.<br><br>@Op tomorrow I'll think about it.

All I say is the walls community is some of the nicest people you'll meet on Avicus. &nbsp; People don't like Walls because this is a pvp server and Walls isn't only about pvp. &nbsp;I requires a lot more from a player and people don't got time for dat! &nbsp;I'm kind of ok if people can't bear a walls game.

Hahah, I use to play walls quite a bit. I use to dislike their community since they kinda had their own "circle" and I looked at most of them as randoms. I started talking to them a bit, and now whenever I join walls, I end up telling a super long story, or getting them to freak out of burning dogs and 911. yee.<br><br>I don't play walls much any,ore since I end up spending 10 minutes playing only to get like 1, 2, or even 0 kills. :p
