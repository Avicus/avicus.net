As the topic says on the top, i have a question about him.<br>So those players who were here when avicus was mc zone, mabye you would know about him. So my question is, what happened to him? I know his banned because of forum behaviors, and i am not sure why and i once thought that it is going to be a long story. So anyone out there can tell me the whole story of Tigerman20?

He posted inappropriate links on the forums. I'm going to guess Tigerman regrets what he did. The past is the past :P

A while ago, there once lived a tiger named Tigerman20. His first record on the forums was when someone posted a screenshot of him swearing, thinking that it was another tigerman who also happened to be on teh forums. (They have no connection besides the IGN btw.) After that, he became a little mad. He started being a very inappropriate person, talking about very....err....suggestive things. After a while, he was banned. Then, came someone named CaptainTigerman2. Although I am unsure whether this was an alt or his brother's account, he did the same thing that tigerman20 did, only a bit less intense, thus allowing him to cling on without being banned for a while. Then, the Tigerman Family came, and they bonded together to try to destroy Avicus. I'm not sure exactly who all was in it, but there were a couple who spammed the forums with....errr....gifs. Another was a guy called FightToFight, who wasn't a huge offender for a while, but he was still mean, and was eventually banned.<br>After all of the family was banned. (I'm not sure whether or not fishyfacediamond was in it, but I think she was at one time. She is not banned, and is a good member of our community today.) We didn't hear of them for around a couple months. Then, tigerman poped up on OCN. Yes, he tried to actually give them Nexus for them to use. OCN, not born yesterday, immediately rejected this idea. CaptainTigerman2 also popped up there, but he didn't really do much to my knowledge. Then, after about a month, a forum member (I think was fishyfacediamond.) received a tweet telling him/her that he has a little something to destroy Avicus. Although Avicus did go down for a little bit, it was never called out to be a DDoS attack, and is assumed to be regular downtime.<br>So, that is the story of tigerman so far.

No, because most of the main action happened on MC Zone, and those pages aren't on the web archive. However, the two recent Tigerman events are on old.avicus.net, search up Tigerman. And, my mistake, TinyNital got the tweet, not fishyfacediamond.<br><br>Here is most of what I remember:<br>tigerman20<br>CaptainTigerman2<br>Rofl1423 (Something like that.)<br>FightToFight
