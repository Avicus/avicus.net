A couple months ago I made an apology post along with why I was so inactive. It was locked because of "Personal update" and I swore to myself I wouldn't care how mean, salty, and negative I was and I wouldn't give a shit about anything, because I then realize that the server has gone to shit.<br><br>I am here today making a post because, even I, have limits to how I act. I have realized that I've been a complete asshole these couple of months. In my defense, I do have an addictive personality, and when I started being like that, I wanted more. After a couple of weeks, it got boring, but I continued, and I was conscious that I was making people hurt and was eventually going to hurt myself, but I couldn't stop myself. I felt really bad about myself, and I went through a slight depression. I was very negative and mean and I was being someone I didn't know. I was sure I was going to get a permanent ban of some sort, because as it is, I already had a lot of infractions back when I was a randy. I got around 5-6 infractions in the course of 2 months. I felt terrible, but I still continued.<br><br>Today, I said no. Today, I refused to be like that. I wrote this post as a manor of therapy and help so I can stop this nonsense. I will probably still be an asshole, sometimes, and when somebody sees me being like that, for the love of god, direct me to this post.&nbsp;<br><br>I have also been saying "WTF" or "OMFG" and stuff like that ever time I die, and I think it isn't helping much, so I'll try to stop that.&nbsp;<br><br>I've been an asshole on the forums as well, and that was the thing that really got my attention. Never in my life, have I ever been rude on the forums, but the day I did, I felt like shit.<br><br>So, I would just like to say, I am incredibly sorry for my behavior lately, and I really need you guys to help me figure myself out. If you don't accept my apology, I have no problem with that, that's free to you. But for those who do, thank you a million times, I can't express how much I love you for doing it.<br><br>Sincerely, Sevo...

I don't think you ever were rude to me, but it takes some courage to apologize.

Note, most the people I was a dick with were staff. There isn't a real good reason, but one of the only reasons I was like that is because of the block lag and biased kb. It's just really annoying, and I really needed to show my anger at someone. I didn't do it to any players, but I did it to the staff and that got me into trouble.

Was not false. We already had this discussion, you can still appeal it if you REALLY think it was false. No more talk about it please.
