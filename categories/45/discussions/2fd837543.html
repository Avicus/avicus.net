<b></b>Let me start off with, I'm leaving :,).<br><b>My story:</b> I found MCZone around April 2013. It was suggested by my cousin actually, the one who told me about Minecraft. I joined, I played, I had fun. I loved this new server. Months later, its ip didn't work. So I left minecraft for a short, short time. I come back about the beginning of November to see this new server called Avicus. I joined and it was ok, not as great as MCZone. It was then that I found walls. I joined it and found all these amazing people playing. I started playing, and at first, I wasn't very good. Then, I got better and better. Until I was one of the best. Walls has been my thing since the beginning. But now I must go after 2 amazing years of meeting new people.&nbsp;<br><b>Other Stuff:</b> Avicus has forever been my home for a long time. I couldn't find home in my family. So I logged on here, and found it. Avicus will be memory that I can't forget. I'm leaving mostly because I need to move on. I need to take a step away from the computer and go out in life and adventure. Life awaits me is what I'd say. I hope you guys live great lives. I will mention some people I met and will never forget. I'm sorry if I forgot some of you :(. Life awaits! See ya guys!<br><br>Polar_Express<br>99250<br>Micahb222000<br>Porcupine1016<br>MeggsAndBacon<br>Murph_the_cat<br>Halowarrior101<br>Drakerette<br><br><h1><strong>I'm back!</strong></h1>
