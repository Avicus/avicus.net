As some of you may have already noticed, there is "mk" in my username. Yes yes yes it stands for Mario Kart. But what does the 7 stand for you may ask? Not the 7th installment, but ALL 7 GAMES! (This account was made in 2011, so yeah it doesn't say 8). This is a thread to talk about the 8 mario kart games (and the 2 boring arcade ones if you would like, but i know nothing about them).<br><br>What is your guys favorite track if you've played them?

I'm with you on both of those about maybe 3 years ago. All the tracks are easy now thanks to tons and tons of practice/online racing.&nbsp;<br><br>I was so glad to see Grumble Volcano to return in Mario Kart 8.<br><br>I want to see Toad's Factory and Dry Dry Ruins return in Mario Kart 9.

It is ignorance. You said it has no customization, which it does. If you could not care less then that is your problem. It is as detailed if not more than other racing games. My list should mean something to you, as you're wrong. Adults play Mario Kart! It proves a lot, mainly that you are wrong.

You made my day again! Everytime i see a reply from you at a thread, I have to laugh! It's really funny to see, that a player is always making negative comments and starting arguments. You were already punished for that and you don't stop. Well I only give you one advise: stop with that. Stop making negative comments. Stop starting arguments. Just stop. It's okay to say their toughs, but not so. If you don't like something, then you don't like it. Maybe help to improve it. Positive comments are always good and people will like you. Take my advide.
