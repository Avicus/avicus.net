</h1>
<span>This is a PSA to those who think Avicus will be safe from the EULA because it "doesn't make a profit"<br><br><br>Technically, by business terms they ARE making a profit.&nbsp;<br>The business is selling&nbsp;in game&nbsp;commands and making a profit on it. Sure, the money earned is spent right back&nbsp;into the server itself. But by going by business terms (these are the terms the EULA will be based off) the server IS making a profit.&nbsp;<br><br>How the server decides to spend it is their business, but it's still a profit.<br>There's a difference between business profit, and personal profit. This EULA applies to both.</span>

profit means&nbsp;precisely: "a financial gain, especially the difference between the amount earned and&nbsp;the amount spent in buying, operating, or producing something." So they could make a loss of $200 a month from costs (from VPS &amp; DNS) and then if they get $200 from "donators" then they wouldn't have made a profit? I'm not really sure.

I don't know the whole story but I thought it was just in-game items not perks and such.<br>Like selling a diamond in-game for $10 wouldn't be allowed. I don't see the reason for a rank to be taking away because we donated and we didn't purchase it.

Actually you didn't donate. A donation is a freely given amount of money for no perks. You bought a shop package.

Yes, since they spent it on the server, Ivy isn't gaining anything. He spends it on the server to make&nbsp;<i>us</i> happy; not&nbsp;<i>him</i>. To gain something in my mind is to get something and get something and use it for yourself to receive pleasure. Ivy is not gaining anything because he's not using any of the money he gets to have fun, get food, et cetera, he's using it to give it to us, so <i>we</i> can have fun; not <i>him</i>. For example, say you're selling cookies for $1 each. Someone buys 10 cookies and with that $10 you just made, you spend it on ingredients to make more cookies. You're not making a gain because you have no money left over to do whatever you want with and you had no pleasure spending the money. Tomorrow, you sell 10 more cookies and get $10. You then decide since you don't need that money to buy more dough, you decide to go to an arcade and spend it on buying games. This is a gain because you didn't use the money on anything to prolong business-- you spent it on something that doesn't have anything to do with the business you're commencing.&nbsp;<br>I totally understand where you're coming from, but I believe Ivy is not making a profit.

@Craft ikr<br>@goldie<br>The issue isn't really about receiving profit either, even if the server loses money.<br>Mojang(Or maybe just this staff member) doesn't want selling, so a staff member stated that people who donated should blend in with the common crowd. This means, no prefixes, no perks, no suffixes, or any of that in game. D:

AviGill had it wrong if he stated that. Avicus, like any large network does make a profit. Take a look at the shop FAQ for more information regarding where any money to Avicus goes. Any money that we receive that in the end is put towards <b>giveaways</b>, <b>community events </b>or <b>developers </b>is considered profit as it is not directly helping Avicus to keep running. <br><br>Regardless, it's wise to drop all the concern over the EULA as Mojang has stated repeatedly that they plan not to change their ways. If they do, then Avicus will continue on as it is as they have stated that they only wish to target servers that have pay to win options. The benefits we provide our primarily cosmetic (trails, pets) or for convenience (joining full teams, faster XP rate, more kits). Mojang does not want to have servers that essentially force you to pay the owner in order to have any chance at competing properly. I hope that it's clear that Avicus' ranks are completely optional and give little to no advantage in game. The one area where we would fail at this would be the extra kits available to upgraded users.

Well, going by accounting it doesn't matter if the money goes back into the server, it's still a profit. Even if you get $100 a month, and put $120 back into the server. Technically you made a profit of $100 because that was the gains of the busines minus the expenses.<br><br>Yes I'm aware, this was just to notify the people that thought "since Avicus doesn't make a personal profit, we're safe!".

Well servers could charge $100 for a rank, then $100 to upgrade to the next rank. So a rank + 2 upgrades is still equal in price to a $300 rank.

Sooo you're telling me that all companies that sell digital items/games and companies in the service sector have no expenses because they don't sell tangible items? You aren't taking into account the cost to&nbsp;<u><i></i></u><i>run&nbsp;</i>the business (part of the cost of sales I suppose). &nbsp;For example, Mojang has employees that maintain Minecraft and also pay for servers to keep the game going. They charge money to purchase the game. Their profit is the money made from selling the game minus the cost to run the servers and pay their employees.<br><br>Edit: I'll just add a definition: "In accounting, profit is the difference between the purchase and the component costs of delivered goods and/or services and any <i>operating </i>or <i>other expenses</i>."

No no no. Cost of sales is basically paypal charges for you I guess.<br>Profit is just what I mentioned.<br><br>A term I can't remember is net profit plus gains (rent on buildings that kinda thing), and then minus losses (which would be wages, advertising, paying rent etc.)<br>The pure profit would just be the amount of money they make selling the game, minus the amount of money it costs them to DIRECTLY sell it. So transport if you're selling a physical item.<br><br>Profit is often mistaken as term I can't remember.<br><br><br>EDIT: I was mistaking Net profit for Gross I just realised, but my points are still valid. The pure profit isn't affected by how much it costs to run the business. Even if you make $100, spend $50 on running the server and spend $70 to improve the server. Your net profit is still $50 and your gross profit is $100

No no no. Cost of sales is basically paypal charges for you I guess.<br>Profit is just what I mentioned.<br><br>A term I can't remember is net profit plus gains (rent on buildings that kinda thing), and then minus losses (which would be wages, advertising, paying rent etc.)<br>The pure profit would just be the amount of money they make selling the game, minus the amount of money it costs them to DIRECTLY sell it. So transport if you're selling a physical item.<br><br>Profit is often mistaken as term I can't remember.<br><br><br>EDIT: I was mistaking Net profit for Gross I just realised, but my points are still valid. The pure profit isn't affected by how much it costs to run the business. Even if you make $100, spend $50 on running the server and spend $70 to improve the server. Your net profit is still $50 and your gross profit is $100

When i say funky walking away with cash i mean the server. I was just using him because hes the owns the server. You are still flat wrong. I dont think you can count studying business for several years if you keep failing because you refuse to grasp simple concepts. The server only puts all of its money into operating the server. Any extra money that we made more than we spent on just having the host is put into the server right away in some other form, thus enhancing the service, thus pertaining to the product. What minecraft eula is saying is that we can not have server owners doing this for a job, for any sort of excess money, outside purposes, etc.<br><br>Here is an official definition, previously stated, but again here to prove my point: "<span>a financial gain, especially the difference between the amount earned and the amount spent in buying, operating, or producing something."<br><br><br>1. Buying: the server buys server hosting, this is subtracted from profit<br><br>2. Operation: most servers have to pay some extra for upkeep.

<br><br>You're still not understanding. So I'll put this as simply as possible.<br><br>The gross profit the is the sales.<br>The net profit is the sales minus the cost of running the business.<br>Then he has his profit.<br><br>Spending the money on server enhancemnts and other things to help benefit the server are then put into the analysed cash book. The profit is not affected by how you spend it.<br><br>Basically imagine let's say, coca cola.<br>They sell 10 million euro worth of bottles. It cost 1 million for the bottles, 1 million to run the factories, 1 million for advertising and 2 million for wages. They make a 5 million euro profit on sales.. They then spend 3 million of that on a new factory.&nbsp;<br>Their profit was 5 million for the month. They just spent some of the profit in a way.

What volt says. EULA is bull. It WILL ruin mine craft, lets wait to see Hypixel, Hive Mineplex and Avicus, all the big servers will shut down with it. They won't have money to support themselves. The post about EULA and servers was posted 7 months ago, anything happened? No. I don't think it will be a problem for a LONG WHILE, if ever. But if they persist to crack down on servers about it, I might swell quit MC. I'll do anything it takes to go against this rule, it is complete crap.

Every large server makes a profit. If they made a loss it would decline. If they break even all the time they wouldn't expand. For the server to expand and add things it has to make a profit.<br><br>I noticed that IvyCode cleared it up. Just pointing it out to those who don't understand which servers make a profit.

Sadly to say this rule is being enforced, although they lightened it, you still cannot sell ranks that give kits, or anything that effects the gameplay. You can only sell cosmetic/non gameplay changing items or features. I know this for sure, because I also own a small network, and we were contacted by Mojang today about it, and asked about selling ranks and such.

Although i do agree with mojang about all this pay to win and kits for donators it will be a kick in the face to the servers that need the money
