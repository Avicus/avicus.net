Hey guys, Ive somehow only just realised that I've passed the one year mark on Avicus!<br>Anyways in 'commemoration' of reaching a year on this incredible server, i was thinking of constructing a list of all the players that have passed a year, and are still active on the server.<br><br>Just comment your name, and ill check your stats to see if you qualify for this veterans list!<br><br>Anyways, congrats to everyone who's passed a year, hope to add you to the list soon :)<br><br><b>+</b> = 2 years and over<br><br><b>VETERAN COUNT:</b><br><b>1+ Years:</b>&nbsp;90 Avicadians<br><b>2+ Years:&nbsp;</b>19 Avicadians<br><b>3+ Years:&nbsp;</b>0 Avicadians<b><br><br>LIST:<br></b><br><b><i>7h1r733n</i></b><br><i><b><u>+U_Mad_Bruh</u></b></i><br><b><i><u>+Drakeyy</u></i></b><br><b><i>Slvrflash<br>DaBaderMC</i></b><br><b><i>HarryRules2002</i></b><br><b><i>Y0urm0m1</i></b><br><b><i>lunax564</i><br><i>ArHCraftKiller</i><br><i>rileguy</i></b><br><b><i>StormzInvader<br>Polar_Express</i></b><br><b><i>trexdomobutter</i><br><i>ForscherFinder</i></b><br><b><i>americangirl2304<br>banway</i></b><br><b><i>MumbleGod</i></b><br><b><i>Mineitup1234<u><br>+ BALLZI</u></i></b><br><span><b><i>davidan13<br>mr_pengun_12<br>sheamus4414</i></b><br><b><i><u>+ jotbot</u></i></b><br></span><b><i>jgkid111<br>Tarheelkiwi</i><br><i>aslan73</i></b><br><b><i>FrankenRavi</i></b><br><b><i>Slugbo_1</i></b><br><b><i>Source_Route</i></b><br><b><i>benconsolver<br>Ninjurr</i></b><br><b><i>Warbry</i></b><br><b><i>Pie55555</i></b><br><i><b><u>+ FrostedCupcakez<br>+ c4ooo</u><br></b></i><span><b></b><i><b>99250</b></i><br></span><i><b>JuanoMC<br>WestbyBaller<br>TheTNTDude<br></b></i><i><b>FirstSintax</b></i><br><i><b>Robin_DD_J<br>Ironsoldier2000<br>SevoGT<br>Semmiexxx<br>zero9178</b></i><br><i><b><u>+ endertrevor</u><br>Sulorak</b></i><br><i><b>RefuseToSink<br></b></i><i><b>resepignev</b><br><b></b><b>X_Heat</b></i><br><b><i>Sethskye<br>kyleskill</i></b><br><b><i><u>+ iznot4fun</u><br>MilkCream<br>AFLTacker<br></i></b><i><b>NuclearDucky</b></i><br><b><i><u>+ Mooch24<br>+ RemyleOuistiti</u></i></b><br><b><i>HoboMaddy<br><u>+ Bluecichild</u><br><u>+legoche</u><br>AtditC<br>JKawesome<br>lil_greg15<br>Jozzmcozz<br>Fluenza_<br>PokerFace_Legend</i></b><br><b><i>PsychoStoner<br><u>+ TortouseMuncher</u><br><u>+ Merlinmaster</u><br>avumbaca<br>J420ac10k<br></i></b><b><i>26763<br></i></b><b><i><u>+ calwhovian</u><br></i></b><b><i>Zedther<br>Spock404<br><u>+ EmeraldSword85</u><br></i></b><b><i>TheHoopsman<br><b>Dinlas</b><br>Splade4812<br><u>+ TNTTurtles</u><br>Venomous_Viper1<br><u>+ bpirr</u><br>jord678901</i></b><i><b></b></i><b><i></i></b><br><b><i>BennettXL</i></b><br><b><i><u>+ JJTheGuy</u></i></b><br><b><u>+ </u><i><u>ebirdy9&nbsp;<br></u></i></b><b><i>MLGPorky<br>SweetMango<br>AwarriorVenom</i></b><br>&nbsp;<b><i>kycrafft&nbsp;<br>Trans4rm2me&nbsp;<br></i></b><b><i>D00ZiE&nbsp;<br></i></b><i><b>OPTOBAT&nbsp;<br></b></i>

Well, prestige has somewhat a purpose. It's like a goal. And plus, it removes your levels. Imo this is fine. It gives people a goal, a thing they're aiming for

But isn't a veteran not so different from that?<br><br>It encourages players who may be starting to get bored after a few months of playing to keep going for the veteran rank, and its not something you have to be good at to get, its more like an acknowledgement for someones dedication towards being a part of the community and game..<br><br>Anyway it won't bother me too much, I'm only bringing it up because theres WAY more veterans on this list then i thought there would be XD<br><br>I was thinking maybe 20 - 30 veterans1, and now we have 88!

I've been on for 2 years 1 of them was on a different account the username is "crombies". BTW I've just been shocked at how far avicus-mczone has come. I've seen mods and friends come and go. Mczone used to be a place where I'd just go for a quick game of SG and for the tightly knit community now it has turned into a huge hub server where I barely recognize anyone and it just amazes me.

Guys, I'm going to be totally honest; this list is going to be extremely hard and time consuming to update, considering I made this post 9 months ago.<br>Not only am i adding people, but I need to filter through the entire list to see who isn't active anymore (and take them off) and who has reached 2/3 years..<br><br>So if you've recently added your name, expect it to take a few hours to make the list, if not tomorrow even...
