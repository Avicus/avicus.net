Post below who you think is underrated on the avicus network<br><br>1.Tresh414. He's not that known but he's extremely good at pvp and he wrecks me.<br><br>2.Cole1crc. Another player who's amazing at pvp. He's another underrated person.<br><br>3. fishisea. I'm not sure how but he wrecks me everytime. He's good and doesn't seem like a bad person :)<br><br>4.jgkid11. He's an overall beast and is definitely on the top 20 pvpers on the server.<br><br>5.Craft_Sem. Again he's a great pvper but more active on the forums than in game. He's a nice guy and an amazing pvper if he puts his mind to it<br><br><br>6.bmbrocks321. Very underrated and probably in the top 50 pvpers on the server :)<br><br>7.Ingigo. A great pvper when he puts his mind to it and is on a par with me.<br><br><br>These are the only people I could think of. Please post anyone who you think is underrated below :)

People get hackusations anyway, that's just the way it is... Also OCN aren't much better, the chat is still spammed with false haccusations and i have experienced that.

I meant not much better for haccusations if you had read my previous post properly. But lets stop spamming the forums with off topic posts, if you want to persue the argument please do so over skype.
