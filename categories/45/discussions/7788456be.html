Hi everyone! I just wanted to share a music group with you guys. Now, I know everyone has different favorite genres of music but, I believe you must listen to this group. Some history, A group of 5 people Acapella. YOU MUST LISTEN.<br><br>Pentatonix-Daft Punk<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=3MteSlpxCpo">http://youtube.com/watch?v=3MteSlpxCpo</a><br>(Pretty cool music to groove too, the beatboxer surprises me with all the varieties of musix)<br><br>Pentatonix-Say Something<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://outube.com/watch?v=0dYlvdLdK9w">http://youtube.com/watch?v=0dYlvdLdK9w</a><br>(This is a truly inspirational song, their acapella routine+a viola touches my heart and I hope it touches yours too.)<br><br>-I have listened to a couple of other songs by Pentatonix but, these are my highlights. Anyways, Happy listening!<br><br>*I have made sure these songs are appropriate for people of all ages and that it is not advertising of any other minecraft related communities.
