<b>I am a developer.</b> &nbsp;Developers write code. &nbsp;As of right now (2015-7-4 21:56:50 EDT), the rank of Developer is the only one I hold, and nowhere in my job description does it say I am to do anything but write code.<br><br>As such, please:<br><ul><li>Do not message me via&nbsp;<b>any</b> contact method that I have provided the public and ask me to appeal a punishment or unban you. &nbsp;<b>Any offenders will be immediately blocked from that form of communication. &nbsp;</b>Protocol states to either a) post under the "Appeal an Infraction" category, or b) contact Avicus staff at <a href="mailto:support@avicus.net" title="Link: mailto:support@avicus.net">support@avicus.net</a>.</li><li>Do not ask me to spectate someone and decide if they're hacking. &nbsp;I have no qualifications as a moderator and quite frankly, I cannot see the difference between someone that is very good at PvP and someone who is hacking. /report works very well for these purposes; I assure you that you know more than me.</li><li>Do ask me questions about coding. &nbsp;I love to help people learn. &nbsp;I believe that coding in any language is a very important real-world skill that will soon become mandatory for any functioning member of society. &nbsp;I will even teach you an entire language.</li><li>Do give me suggestions via any channel that you find on my profile. &nbsp;<b>Do not give me suggestions in game. &nbsp;They will be ignored. &nbsp;</b>Suggestions must be given in such a way that I can catalog incoming suggestions, and in-game chat is transient and I will quickly lose your suggestions.</li><li>Do not ask me for credits in game. &nbsp;Come on guys, you saw what Kylo did to me when I gave&nbsp;<i>myself</i> credits, what do you think he would do to me if I gave them to you? &nbsp;You might never hear from me again.</li><li>Do ask me for creative gamemode&nbsp;<b>if and only if you are in the hub.</b> &nbsp;I am authorized to give people creative gamemode in the hub, for the time being.</li><li>Do continue to be supportive of me and the network as a whole. &nbsp;Overall, the community has been very helpful at getting me situated in this network.</li></ul>Thank you very much.

Can you teach me how to code a website counter for music playlists? Something, that repeats itself, even if the website is not being visited.

Actually, it's 100% your fault.&nbsp; If you hurt someone's feelings, you need to be a man and apologize.&nbsp; Speaking your mind is one thing, and that a good thing, but you need to be careful what you say.&nbsp; You never know why you say might offend someone.&nbsp; You wouldn't like it if I started cyber bullying you or something.&nbsp; Ruining your life and making you feel terrible.&nbsp; Again, I am 100% for freedom of speech, but but you need to be careful, because you never know when it's going to come back and bite you.

I in general don't mean like that. &nbsp;I mean that I'm not going to censor myself....this is hard to explain. &nbsp;I wouldn't ever say anything that would hurt anyone, but certain things about myself disturb people and I'm not going to hide anything just because society says I should. &nbsp;That's more of what I meant.
