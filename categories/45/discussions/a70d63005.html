Hey everyone, theres no story behind it, I just randomly came up with this idea:<br><br>I thought it would be cool to get to know a bit more about each other in a neat, easy going way, so here's how it works:<br><br>Comment below 5 random, but somewhat interesting facts about yourself, that may involve your hobbies, what you're good at, personal experience, etc.<br><br>Ill start as an example -<br><br><b>1.</b> My in game name, OPTOBAT, has no meaning - it just popped up in my head!<br><b>2.</b> I am a HUGE fan of hip hop, particularly Eminem<br><b>3.</b> I am Australian-American: My mum is Australian, and my dad is American.<br><b>4.</b> In 2011, in 6th grade, in the middle of the night, I saw what appeared to be a UFO<br><b>5.</b> My two most favourite and successful subjects are English and Media/Film<br><br>Your turn!
