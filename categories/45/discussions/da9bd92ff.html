You don't necessarily have to talk to one person at a time. You can try to join a conversation (politely) or start one with other people in your game :P<br><br><br>And guys, don't just leave when someone else joins, it's not cool.

Don't worry, people were probably just bored or something.<br><br>Don't be shy on TeamSpeak, it's great that you are at least being active. :)

i wouldn't recommend joining a chat with only one other person unless you know them well. its kind of awkward and they dont want to be forced into the situation.
