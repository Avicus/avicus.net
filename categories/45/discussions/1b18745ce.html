<span>Heyo guys! To be completely honest, I would’ve never
thought I'd be making one of these posts, but here it is. I will be leaving
Avicus, possibly Minecraft in general. I've had a recent incident that made me
realize how foolish I have been. Things in-game have been affected by more
important things in life. Real life. The fact that I had even thought,
"Wow. I should've done this 'in-game thing' instead of this
'school-related thing'," is evidence that I didn't have my priorities
straight. I should never had been concerned about things in-game if it meant
taking away from anything in the real world. I've had problems with this
before, and I had sworn to myself that I would never let it happen again.
Sadly, I haven't been able to reach a balance between being an active member of
the community and focusing on school and other things. With that being said, I
hope all of you can understand how grateful I am for&nbsp;<u>everything</u><span>&nbsp;large
and small you've done for me. The amount of people I want to thank is too great
for me to include specific names in this, but my thanks go out to everyone
reading this. Not just the people on TeamSpeak. Not just the people I talked to
daily. Everyone. Without all of you, Avicus wouldn't have ever been what it was
to me.&nbsp;<br>
<br><i>Keep Soaring - Upsoar</i><br><br></span></span>

The reason that this song was used was because it gives us hope. It allows us to relearn from our mistakes in the past and make a better future, not just for ourselves, but others around us. This song gives me hope, and I hope that it does the same for Upsoar.

Well, every good thing must come to an end :'( It saddens me a lot to see you go. I remember when I first met you on TS, when you got everyone to build a little city on Senex II and on Dust Devils. Eventually I came across you a couple of times and we slowly became friends. You may be going but I'll still be your "Pleb" through Kik and Skype. Don't know what you thought of me, but I know that I thought of you as a good pal. Maybe one day we'll meet up again but until then, good bye :'( You will be missed an never forgotten &lt;3
