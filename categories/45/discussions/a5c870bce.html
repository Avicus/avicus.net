Haven't been active on youtube lately, had a few projects I was working on for my 200th Video but they would all take another week, I decided to start the intro project.<br>Please note this is my&nbsp;<b>first</b> every minecraft animation. I thought it came out extremely well tho!<br>So check it out and apply for a chance to win a&nbsp;<b>FREE</b> 3D Minecraft Animation Intro!<br><br><b>Programs I used:</b><br>Cinema 4D<br>AfterEffects<br><br><b>Person I can thank for getting through my struggles of a first time animator:<br></b><b></b>_Phyre<br>He gave me tips while animating to make it better, showed me things I had trouble with (Keyframing minecraft characters, terribly long), gave me a few AE presets, e.t.c.<br><br><b>Intro:</b>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF4siO93VZM" title="Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF4siO93VZM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF4siO93VZM</a>

Do you want to enter the giveaway or have a custom intro?<br>If you want the giveaway just fill out the format and then comment on the video or here and put your google hangouts instead of skype.<br>If you want a custom intro (that is not the giveaway) I sadly ask for money even though I'm pretty new. It does take lots of effort into making intros but I can assure you the price is pretty much 100x less than any other animator asks for :P&nbsp;<a href="https://sellfy.com/vladthegreat100">https://sellfy.com/vladthegreat100</a>.<br>$2 for the 3D Minecraft Intros (takes a day or two, maybe more) just to animate, and then half a day to use the after effects.<br>Text Intros will be free for&nbsp;<b>Avicus Players</b> only. Otherwise its $0.90 :P<br><br>If you want the text intro just tell me the name you want in the intro and I will make it :P If you want the animated intro the $2 is necessary xd
