I decided to put my graphic design to the test and try to revamp this amazing server's logo!<br><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/VmaSX2n.png"><br><b>What do you think?</b>

While it does look good, I don't really think it fits the server's style. The current logo we have is simple and formal, while yours is more informal/cartoonish, not in a bad way.

Thanks for the opinions so far, I wasn't making this for the purpose of replacing the current logo. I just did this for fun and for some practice!

I had a go at trying to make a revamped logo. I haven't done much stuff like this before and I thought it would be good to see what I could do and to get some feedback on it.<br><b>Make sure to give me your opinions on it.<br><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/XomtWju.png"><br></b>

Tyn, I really like the logo you made, maybe add a background and some color. The style is really nice. Keep practicing :D
