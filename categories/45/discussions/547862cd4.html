It's sad how this can warrant infractions. Using this logic, the losing team saying W should be mutable for bad sportsmanship too because it literally means the same thing to say L as the winning team.&nbsp;<br><br>I don't know how the fuck people didn't get that Verzide and co originally said this shit as a joke, it's embarrassing how idiots on here think that L is bad sportsmanship, even more embarrassing that idiots on here hand out infractions for it when nothing has happened.<br><br>You want to type "k" to your friend? Misstype that as L and you get an ez infraction.<br><br>If you think L was supposed to be serious in the first place, u just don't have a brain my man<br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/Xmpg9lEes1E?t=210">https://youtu.be/Xmpg9lEes1E?t=210</a>

1) I got tempbanned by putting L in the chat, whilst I was in spec and sitting in spawn<br>2) Even in the context you consider it to be bad isn't bad at all, it's a running meme at this point and it's retarded how u can punish people for it lol

It aggrevates some people, simple as that. The L stands for loser, which nobody would want to be called. Saying it once or twice should warrant a verbal warn at the most, but when it becomes spammed, that's when harsher punishments may be needed. There really isn't a need to say it to people anyways, so why bother?

I didn't know saying L was bannable, because it is simply a retarded thing to ban off of. Saying L is not toxic at all, it was a fucking joke made up that idiots like you took too seriously and put it in the ruleset of your server. Saying a LETTER in the chat can get you banned, you obviously can't justify why saying L in the chat is toxic, I recommend you develop your brain before typing out this retarded shit to me.&nbsp;<br><br>Next time I'm on the losing team, I'll say W, if I don't get a punishment then your logic is completely fucking flawed because it's the exact same thing.

so if a mod tells us to stop playing, we have to stop playing? all this listen to mods bullshit needs to end, he was bloody SPECTATING AND DIEING WHEN HE WAS SAYING L, he wasn't killing people and saying it, the mods gets so salty over little things.. like before he told everyone to stop saying letters in chat because he didn't like it.

The topic is a grey area as well. I think the closest category we have for that is "Rudeness", but sometimes people say "L" for banter, so like I said earlier it depends on the context. If people say it with harmful intentions, that's when the punishments roll in. I think in this case it was just a mistake and these grey areas should be ironed out. Most of these problems arise from the newer moderators mainly because they haven't got the full experience. As time goes on, people who have been on the staff team longer in my opinion tend to be more lenient and not take every guideline word for word.

So it's basically a guess? Again, the moderator has to&nbsp;<b>assume&nbsp;</b>that the person has harmful intentions. Get it wrong and you end up with a post like this on the forums. Besides, the intentions are harmless anyways. Nobody should be punished for saying the letter L. It's one letter, out of an english alphabet of 26, which could have a myriad of meanings and a million different contexts. So having to make silly guesses in chat about the meaning shouldn't happen, and that shouldn't result in this kind of outcry, and it shouldn't result in the moderator&nbsp;<b>and&nbsp;</b>player facing the consequences.<br><br>If you want this to stop, just take the L &nbsp;(Also am I getting banned for that?) and fix the situation. Fucking do it. Don't argue about it on a forum post. I know you personally can do very little (believe me, I know), but someone should step in and do it.

I've always been on board with making rules like these more strict.<br>But "L" is legit one letter.<br><br>What I would suggest for your further actions if you really want this "L" thing to stop -<br><br>1. Appeal anybody who has been punished for "L"<br>2. Put this "L" rule if you really don't want people to be writing "L" in chat on the Official Rules Page, or add it to a subsection rule, such as rudeness.<br>3. Notify people that "L" can now be classified as rudeness or that you may not state "L" at all.<br>4. Give them a week, as it is stated on the rules page that there is a grace period of a week for every rule change. (Which y'all seem to overlook for some fucking reason even though its been brought up thousands of times)<br>5. Enjoy punishing people after a week and not have to deal with posts that have people surprised that they got banned for it.<br><br>Y'all did 2 things wrong here:<br>1. You pulled a new rule out of your asses without updating it on the Rules Page<br>2. Not sure when this was added, but seeing this is a recent post, I'll assume the rule came out recently thus breaking your own policy of a 1 week grace period.<br><br>Just a hint that none of y'all seem to have gotten over the past years of Avicus:<br>If there is a trend that is growing that breaks rules. Don't make that trend a specific rule in punishment messages. Generalize it with the rule that it's breaking. "L" can break the rudeness rule. Punish for rudeness. Make an official rule for it. <b>*Actually put it on the </b><a href="https://avicus.net/rules/en" rel="nofollow" title="Link: https://avicus.net/rules/en"><b>rules page</b></a><b>*</b> and actually give a week of a grace period notifying the community members (Not necessary, but courtesy) about it stating they have a week before they must start complying to said rule, as stated in <a href="https://i.gyazo.com/82ba55b7014c4884dc29ab838ae869b9.png" rel="nofollow" title="Link: https://i.gyazo.com/82ba55b7014c4884dc29ab838ae869b9.png">Section F #2</a><br><br>You guys tend to shoot out new rules to the staff, not notify any fucking community member about it, and then punish the day of and during that 1 week period that you promise and then when all hell breaks loose to revert back to how it was before. Also date the rules when added, or date it somewhere so people know you aren't lying to the community.<br><br>You're never going to please everybody, but at least following your own policies and actually notifying people, whether it be a legitimate post, or just updating it on the rules page along with giving them a grace period would stop a shit ton of backlash. Been stated multiple times, yet it still occurs.

The bottom line is, we make the rules, you have to follow them. In this case, you broke the already set rule, so you were punished. By saying "L" in chat, you are being disrespectful to others. Even if its a joke or not, you should always follow the rules.&nbsp;<br><br>If you want to take this further and actually do something about your ban, I suggest you create an appeal.<br><br>- Koja

Btw, this will be a long post and I left a note at the end. I would suggest not just skimming through and actually try to read as much as you can so you get a whole idea and not half a story.....<br><br><span><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;  ">@dev_revs - First off, I would ask that you don’t use my irl name when referring to how I staff or something related to that, use my ign please. Secondly, you are over exaggerating how I punish for saying L in chat. I do not care if the player is in spec mode or not, there is no reason for anyone to say L in chat and to also add onto that, I am only following the procedure I am required to follow unless their punishments say otherwise. Also, a verbal warn is nothing in my opinion because it doesn’t even go on your record. If I verbal warn someone then that means they should stop before it actually starts becoming a huge issue. The only reason it is a huge issue now is because people are acting like it is a new rule even though it has been a thing for over a year now at least. </span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;  ">@DaGoldBrick - In reality, you were temp-banned because you refused to follow staff orders and went from a simple verbal warn all the way to a temp-ban. I asked you the first time to not say L, and even privately messaged you in game as you had bluntly told me you would say it as you please, which does not mean you are allowed to say it. We went from a /warn to a kick, and when you say “</span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  "> I got temp-banned by putting L in the chat, whilst I was in spec and sitting in spawn”,</span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  "> </span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);  ">you actually came back on from being kicked, said “hold this L”, and earned yourself a temp-ban after having multiple opportunities to stop. Finally, being in spec mode and in spawn does not mean you can throw around “L” like it is nothing. And if you look on your appeal, you would see what I put there to justify your temp-ban. As for context, yes I can agree sometimes it can be bad since it is in chat and not a live interaction in a voice to voice thing, but even so; do you really expect us to gather enough context from just “L” to say “oh that dude is just saying it to his friend it’s alright we can let it slide”. I hope your answer is no considering that is the argument players try to make with us when we do something about it.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);  ">@Rocky - If you want to mock people after they die, go on a practice server and do it. Sorry to be a bit blunt about it but it has been a rule on here for a long time. As for your only reasoning being “</span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">If they don't like it then they shouldn't die”, </span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;  ">I do not understand what you mean. Are you saying that it is the person who died fault that the other player that killed them had mocked them in chat?</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;  ">@Pokerface - Agreed, this is the same process that I do with all the players but yet there is an issue with it? Apparently this is too strict even though players have about 5-6 chances to stop and avoid punishment. If anything it is good that we verbal warn first so why complain? As for the need to say it… FAX B.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;  ">@DaGoldBrick - We still punish for winning teams saying W after a match, or at least I do and around 2 other mods. As for you and the “irrelevant horizon” fella, the rule still applies no matter what. If we let you and the other player continue on then everyone else will want to do it and at that point people will just go and try to push it. As for being punishable off mod guidelines, he is right and as for context, if he read “take this L kid” “you're easy get good” “L (horizon dude)” then that is good enough for him to do something about it. As for how people become mod, they apply, get accepted and go through an interview, and finally become Jr Mod if they did good in the interview. After that they do a trial (like I did) and if they are deemed to be good enough/amazing, they get promoted. If they become mod that means they are doing something right even if people do not agree with the way they do it. As for training them, the trial period is basically training and a trial. Also, Jr Mods are taught how to staff before they even begin their trial, which is enough training considering they have a few weeks to get better at it and have access to other staff whenever they need anything.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;  ">@Lokigh - Exactly, I can understand when new players come on and say L, but considering most of the people we punish for it have been on for at least a few months, there is no excuse for them to not have taken the initiative to read the rules or at least have learned them from in game.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);  ">@profbananaslug - (ik you will say something like “what did i tell you, don't talk to me”, idc if i feel like I have to respond I will) He is referring to people arguing with each other in game like “kid L” -&gt; “nah your trash kek, agro kid 4v1” -&gt; “nah you just bad” and so on. </span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);  ">@dev_revs - I also forgot to mention earlier that I wouldn’t let you say random letters in chat because it triggered me is fair IMO. Rule 4 on the “Rules” states “</span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">Follow the directions given by any Avicus staff member. Do not lie to a staff member. </span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 700;  ">If you believe a staff member is abusing their power through wrongful punishments or other methods, please email </span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(3, 141, 210); font-weight: 700;  ">support@avicus.net</span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 700;  "> and provide any evidence or details you possess regarding the staff member.” …. </span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent;  ">More importantly, the bit on following a staff members directions. I had asked everyone in chat to stop with the letters because it was flooding chat with the amount of times everyone was saying it, spammy during certain points, and honestly just stupid to look at in chat, I would turn off chat but I have to read all the false reports that I also saw during those 30 minutes on people reporting for silly reasons. &lt;- that last thing is not part of the rules but the 1st and 2nd are valid from what I saw. Saying that I was triggered was false considering I was only asking that everyone would not flood chat with the letters even if it was a simple letter like “a” and “t” because it caused more players to join in.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent;  ">@APacketOfChips - FINALLY SOMEONE WITH SENSE!!!!! I will be honest and disagree with you on the “all fun and games” thing but I guess we both interpret the rules differently.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent;  ">@DaGoldBrick - you weren’t punished for “joking around”, yes the ban reason says “Please do not say L in chat” or something similar to that, but my reasoning behind it was because you refused to obey staff orders, which ultimately led to a temp-ban. In your appeal I told you why.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent;  ">@dev_revs - it was no accident, Brick was a spectator to you just saying L but what I saw was someone who refused to obey staff orders. Which in a previous thing above I had stated the rule on that.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent;  ">@Xylk - …</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent;  ">@APacketofChips - “</span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">Saying "L" in chat is toxic, and can be rude towards some people, which is why we don't allow it.” Correct and fax b.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">@Rombeyyy - What I said to dev_revs will be the same thing I will say to you, but I will add that Brick had earned his punishment legitimately. He could have stopped at the verbal warn or /warn but continued over a span of 10-15 mins.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">@DaGoldenBrick - First off, Packet is not stupid and you should never treat a young lady like that, so rude :(, and second off, it is not a silly thing to ban off of. As I have stated before you were banned for continuing to keep saying L in chat. Yes I agree that L started off as a joke, but now it has been turned into an insult, which goes against the rule I put in your appeal which stated proper etiquette and behavior on the server. As for being banned off a single letter, I will again state I. DID. NOT…. ban you over a letter, I banned you for the context in which you said it and refusal to follow my directions. As for you saying W when you are on the winning team, you told me you could care less and would say L as you wish and got punished, I would look back and apply that to future situations like this and try to not think “I know I got banned for something like this, but this is different because I am changing the letter so I can’t be banned” and think “Even though I am turning the table here, the context is the same so I shouldn’t do it.” because the punishment will still be the same if all you are worried about is context. As for your reply to Miqah, they had clearly said they didn’t understand the whole story, but I will leave this at that.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">@dev_revs - Your point is invalid when you say “so if a mod tells us to stop playing, we have to stop playing?”. What mod will tell anyone “Hey! YOU! Stop playing right now or ban.”? Also, the listen to mods bs is not bs. On any other server you will listen to a mod so Avicus is not any different. As for getting salty over little things, I suggest you refer to what I have said earlier. Also assuming I did not like you guys saying random letters in chat so I asked you guys to stop is stupid. I would expect someone with a Media Rank would have some decent sense and try to think about the rules. If that comes off as blunt, eh take it as you will. As for him being only a spectator who was dieing does not justify saying L in chat even if he was not killing people. L is not allowed to be said... end of conversation about him being only a spectator because I have already explained it 2 or 3 times already.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">@_Gill - I appreciate you stating your opinion in a mature manner. Like not even to be funny I actually do because now I can actually be more structured. My stance on the rule is this: I do not care if it is a joke, if you are in spec mode, if you don’t care about the rule, or if you think I need context as well as if you think I am unfair when I tell you to be a good sport. I interpret the rules a little more strict than other mods; nothing wrong with that at all to me, but it can be to you. Saying this, I would not take verbal warnings from me or any other staff with a grain of salt or try to go around it with saying anything similar. If I see you being a bad sport I will say something. If I see you in chat and it is hard to tell if you are actually being a bad sport, I ALWAYS… ask other staff and check rules.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">@MLGtino - it isn’t about it being a letter, it is about the </span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 700;   ">MEANING</span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">. As for stooping to this point, I wouldn’t even have to be making this if players actually listened to staff. As I have said many times before, this rule on bad sportsmanship is not even a new rule and has been around for a long time. Also with the assumption bit, yes it did create a grey area, but it is up to the mods on how they interpret rules. How I look at rules compared to Pokerface is different. As for controversy, really any rule can be controversial if you stretch it a bit.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">@DaGoldBrick - “this is like saying "why do you keep saying hi to players when you were asked to stop?", surely one character L is inferior to 2 characters h and i in the same sentence?”... This point is in no way valid, if anything it is stupid because unless you were spamming or flooding chat with ‘hi’, no staff would ask for you to stop….. ”the fact that I got warned or kicked in the first place (for putting a LETTER in the chat) shows the mod in question is an idiot who doesn't deserve his rank in the first place (although this is being dealt with anyways)”.... Yes the warn to ban reason was about a letter, but the actual reason behind it was from what I saw and what you did. Also calling me an idiot will not advance your case considering it basically diminishes what you were trying to say. Saying that I do not deserve my rank is honestly stupid (sorry not sorry) because clearly, I must be doing something right if I passed my trial. I can understand if you said “He is a bit too strict” and stuff like that but saying something like that is really stupid. If you do not approve of the way I staff, you can report me to a Sr. Mod or Admin and let them talk to me and then you can sit back and wait to let them do all the work. Another option is to read the rules….. “of course I'm going to challenge retarded shit, if left unchallenged that retarded shit will grow to an even more retarded level of 'punishable' offenses given the thickness of some mods on here”..... At this point you are not even challenging anything anymore, you are just looking to say something silly and then have people agree with you. Half the people who agreed with you were not even there, and then those with actual reasonable points I already explained. As for leaving it unchallenged, I can agree with that, even I don’t agree with some rules but you don’t see me complaining. Rules are there for a reason. At this point I am not even going to avoid the fact that I was the one who punished so calling me thickheaded (I can also assume this would be to the mods that cared enough to reply to your thread) does not do anything for you. If anything, we are both thickheaded here because you refuse to listen to a simple rule and I was “too mean” or “too strict” with the way I staff. Again, if you have an issue with the way I staff, report it to Sr. Mods or to Junr (when he isn’t on Overwatch) and have them deal with your report on me, if they tell me I should change something a bit or if I am doing just dandy I will of course change it up a bit but as for now I think I am doing good…../now referring to the ABC’s/: Brick, you are just stretching it at this point and trying to make silly points and reasons. No one but you and maybe some Team Rocket players will ever think of the first 3 letters of the alphabet in that way. If it is not widely seen as a sign of disrespect or bad sportsmanship, then we see no reason to punish for it unless you spammed it in chat.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">@SamuelJacob9 - correct</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">@vladthegreat100 - “3. Notify people that "L" can now be classified as rudeness or that you may not state "L" at all.”.... We have said this many times before and especially in the past few days, as for a grace period of course it will be a thing if this becomes changed…… “1. You pulled a new rule out of your asses without updating it on the Rules Page”...... No we have not. This has been a rule for a long time and if you scroll up, you can see that it is in fact, a rule. The rules in the “Rules” thread do not always blatantly say “Don’t say L, ez, izi, etc” but they are there if you took the time to think. Also, there has been many times that people have been just told that you were not allowed to say L or ez in chat. I remember 6 months ago a staff member telling me that saying those things was not allowed. Saying the rule came out recently is sadly false because even though it is not blatantly written, the rule has always been there. I see that you have already said something along the line of that it should be written blatantly if it is a rule, but at least I try to follow the bloody policies. Also, most/all staff that are in charge of that have much more important things to do than to add a rule that was already under another rule. You are right when you say that we will never please everyone. </span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">@DaGoldBrick - Badlion’s rules do not apply to this, have a problem with it, do the same thing you are doing here and challenge their rules. “Nazi chat rules”.... A bit of a hyperbole but I can see what you mean. “I'm only challenging it after I got banned because I honestly didn't expect to get banned lmao”.... Brick, what did you expect to happen? For me to give you a slap on the wrist and say “Bad Brick!”?. To what Miqah said, you really didn’t think you had it coming? Your ban is legitimate, so what do you mean that I need to be inspected by staff? When you were banned there were 2 other mods on and a Sr. Mod on the discord that I could easily contact so they could have easily stopped me if they thought I should have held back on hitting the enter key. If anything, at this point you should know how the procedure goes for punishments considering on how long you have been playing. Back to with me and my rank, if you have an issue, tell a Sr. Mod instead of now just telling them when you are banned on a forums post after you call the staff team thickheaded and idiots. Speaking of which, an “idiot” would not realise that they should stop continuing after a staff member told them to stop even if it was a joke. By the way, “L” on its own does not make it an obvious joke, so where was the context? Also, coming back after a kick and telling me to hold an L was what moved me to temp-ban.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">@profbananaslug - If I was doing a bad job/ not meeting standards of being staff, my trial would have ended early and you would have seen a “</span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);  ">CerealFirst</span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;  "> </span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;  ">has failed his trial and has been demoted from Jr mod</span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">” and a few pretty pictures on the #announcements in Discord. Also, I catch your drift when you called me afk in the head. If anything I am just fine in the head because when I go back and double check all the punishments I given, only 1 punishment was deemed false (it was appealed. That kind of tells me I think I know what I am doing in terms of being staff so I don’t know what the surprise was.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">@KojaCola; @MeMyselfAndSnow; @Miqah - You three have basically half summed up what I have said, thank god. For those that do not want to follow the rules of the server, you are not entitled or required to play on here. For those that try to push the rules, we will get on you for it. Finally for those that do not agree with how me or any other staff on here do their duty as moderator/staff, you have always had the option of reporting a “bad” mod to a Senior.</span></p><br><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">NOTE: If this comes off as rude to anyone in anyway, I do not intend it to be that way. Yes I may have said some borderline things, but they were meant to explain myself. As for those who want to tell me how to do my job, wait a few months, wait for apps to open, apply and hope to get accepted, go through the process and become mod yourself so you can make a change on the server. If you don’t want to go through that, make a well structured forum post that in no way offends anyone, leave it open to the community to have a reasonable conversation instead of attacking the way someone does something. Again, I will say I do not intend to be offensive to anyone I replied to, but this is me clearing myself up and explaining myself instead of being quiet like I usually am on what I do.</span></p><br></span>

I would suggest not just skimming through and actually try to read as much as you can so you get a whole idea and not half a story.....<br><br><span><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;  ">@dev_revs - First off, I would ask that you don’t use my irl name when referring to how I staff or something related to that, use my ign please. Secondly, you are over exaggerating how I punish for saying L in chat. I do not care if the player is in spec mode or not, there is no reason for anyone to say L in chat and to also add onto that, I am only following the procedure I am required to follow unless their punishments say otherwise. Also, a verbal warn is nothing in my opinion because it doesn’t even go on your record. If I verbal warn someone then that means they should stop before it actually starts becoming a huge issue. The only reason it is a huge issue now is because people are acting like it is a new rule even though it has been a thing for over a year now at least. </span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;  ">@DaGoldBrick - In reality, you were temp-banned because you refused to follow staff orders and went from a simple verbal warn all the way to a temp-ban. I asked you the first time to not say L, and even privately messaged you in game as you had bluntly told me you would say it as you please, which does not mean you are allowed to say it. We went from a /warn to a kick, and when you say “</span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  "> I got temp-banned by putting L in the chat, whilst I was in spec and sitting in spawn”,</span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  "> </span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);  ">you actually came back on from being kicked, said “hold this L”, and earned yourself a temp-ban after having multiple opportunities to stop. Finally, being in spec mode and in spawn does not mean you can throw around “L” like it is nothing. And if you look on your appeal, you would see what I put there to justify your temp-ban. As for context, yes I can agree sometimes it can be bad since it is in chat and not a live interaction in a voice to voice thing, but even so; do you really expect us to gather enough context from just “L” to say “oh that dude is just saying it to his friend it’s alright we can let it slide”. I hope your answer is no considering that is the argument players try to make with us when we do something about it.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);  ">@Rocky - If you want to mock people after they die, go on a practice server and do it. Sorry to be a bit blunt about it but it has been a rule on here for a long time. As for your only reasoning being “</span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">If they don't like it then they shouldn't die”, </span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;  ">I do not understand what you mean. Are you saying that it is the person who died fault that the other player that killed them had mocked them in chat?</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;  ">@Pokerface - Agreed, this is the same process that I do with all the players but yet there is an issue with it? Apparently this is too strict even though players have about 5-6 chances to stop and avoid punishment. If anything it is good that we verbal warn first so why complain? As for the need to say it… FAX B.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;  ">@DaGoldBrick - We still punish for winning teams saying W after a match, or at least I do and around 2 other mods. As for you and the “irrelevant horizon” fella, the rule still applies no matter what. If we let you and the other player continue on then everyone else will want to do it and at that point people will just go and try to push it. As for being punishable off mod guidelines, he is right and as for context, if he read “take this L kid” “you're easy get good” “L (horizon dude)” then that is good enough for him to do something about it. As for how people become mod, they apply, get accepted and go through an interview, and finally become Jr Mod if they did good in the interview. After that they do a trial (like I did) and if they are deemed to be good enough/amazing, they get promoted. If they become mod that means they are doing something right even if people do not agree with the way they do it. As for training them, the trial period is basically training and a trial. Also, Jr Mods are taught how to staff before they even begin their trial, which is enough training considering they have a few weeks to get better at it and have access to other staff whenever they need anything.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;  ">@Lokigh - Exactly, I can understand when new players come on and say L, but considering most of the people we punish for it have been on for at least a few months, there is no excuse for them to not have taken the initiative to read the rules or at least have learned them from in game.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);  ">@profbananaslug - (ik you will say something like “what did i tell you, don't talk to me”, idc if i feel like I have to respond I will) He is referring to people arguing with each other in game like “kid L” -&gt; “nah your trash kek, agro kid 4v1” -&gt; “nah you just bad” and so on. </span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);  ">@dev_revs - I also forgot to mention earlier that I wouldn’t let you say random letters in chat because it triggered me is fair IMO. Rule 4 on the “Rules” states “</span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">Follow the directions given by any Avicus staff member. Do not lie to a staff member. </span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 700;  ">If you believe a staff member is abusing their power through wrongful punishments or other methods, please email </span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(3, 141, 210); font-weight: 700;  ">support@avicus.net</span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 700;  "> and provide any evidence or details you possess regarding the staff member.” …. </span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent;  ">More importantly, the bit on following a staff members directions. I had asked everyone in chat to stop with the letters because it was flooding chat with the amount of times everyone was saying it, spammy during certain points, and honestly just stupid to look at in chat, I would turn off chat but I have to read all the false reports that I also saw during those 30 minutes on people reporting for silly reasons. &lt;- that last thing is not part of the rules but the 1st and 2nd are valid from what I saw. Saying that I was triggered was false considering I was only asking that everyone would not flood chat with the letters even if it was a simple letter like “a” and “t” because it caused more players to join in.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent;  ">@APacketOfChips - FINALLY SOMEONE WITH SENSE!!!!! I will be honest and disagree with you on the “all fun and games” thing but I guess we both interpret the rules differently.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent;  ">@DaGoldBrick - you weren’t punished for “joking around”, yes the ban reason says “Please do not say L in chat” or something similar to that, but my reasoning behind it was because you refused to obey staff orders, which ultimately led to a temp-ban. In your appeal I told you why.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent;  ">@dev_revs - it was no accident, Brick was a spectator to you just saying L but what I saw was someone who refused to obey staff orders. Which in a previous thing above I had stated the rule on that.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent;  ">@Xylk - …</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent;  ">@APacketofChips - “</span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">Saying "L" in chat is toxic, and can be rude towards some people, which is why we don't allow it.” Correct and fax b.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">@Rombeyyy - What I said to dev_revs will be the same thing I will say to you, but I will add that Brick had earned his punishment legitimately. He could have stopped at the verbal warn or /warn but continued over a span of 10-15 mins.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">@DaGoldenBrick - First off, Packet is not stupid and you should never treat a young lady like that, so rude :(, and second off, it is not a silly thing to ban off of. As I have stated before you were banned for continuing to keep saying L in chat. Yes I agree that L started off as a joke, but now it has been turned into an insult, which goes against the rule I put in your appeal which stated proper etiquette and behavior on the server. As for being banned off a single letter, I will again state I. DID. NOT…. ban you over a letter, I banned you for the context in which you said it and refusal to follow my directions. As for you saying W when you are on the winning team, you told me you could care less and would say L as you wish and got punished, I would look back and apply that to future situations like this and try to not think “I know I got banned for something like this, but this is different because I am changing the letter so I can’t be banned” and think “Even though I am turning the table here, the context is the same so I shouldn’t do it.” because the punishment will still be the same if all you are worried about is context. As for your reply to Miqah, they had clearly said they didn’t understand the whole story, but I will leave this at that.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">@dev_revs - Your point is invalid when you say “so if a mod tells us to stop playing, we have to stop playing?”. What mod will tell anyone “Hey! YOU! Stop playing right now or ban.”? Also, the listen to mods bs is not bs. On any other server you will listen to a mod so Avicus is not any different. As for getting salty over little things, I suggest you refer to what I have said earlier. Also assuming I did not like you guys saying random letters in chat so I asked you guys to stop is stupid. I would expect someone with a Media Rank would have some decent sense and try to think about the rules. If that comes off as blunt, eh take it as you will. As for him being only a spectator who was dieing does not justify saying L in chat even if he was not killing people. L is not allowed to be said... end of conversation about him being only a spectator because I have already explained it 2 or 3 times already.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">@_Gill - I appreciate you stating your opinion in a mature manner. Like not even to be funny I actually do because now I can actually be more structured. My stance on the rule is this: I do not care if it is a joke, if you are in spec mode, if you don’t care about the rule, or if you think I need context as well as if you think I am unfair when I tell you to be a good sport. I interpret the rules a little more strict than other mods; nothing wrong with that at all to me, but it can be to you. Saying this, I would not take verbal warnings from me or any other staff with a grain of salt or try to go around it with saying anything similar. If I see you being a bad sport I will say something. If I see you in chat and it is hard to tell if you are actually being a bad sport, I ALWAYS… ask other staff and check rules.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">@MLGtino - it isn’t about it being a letter, it is about the </span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 700;   ">MEANING</span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">. As for stooping to this point, I wouldn’t even have to be making this if players actually listened to staff. As I have said many times before, this rule on bad sportsmanship is not even a new rule and has been around for a long time. Also with the assumption bit, yes it did create a grey area, but it is up to the mods on how they interpret rules. How I look at rules compared to Pokerface is different. As for controversy, really any rule can be controversial if you stretch it a bit.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">@DaGoldBrick - “this is like saying "why do you keep saying hi to players when you were asked to stop?", surely one character L is inferior to 2 characters h and i in the same sentence?”... This point is in no way valid, if anything it is stupid because unless you were spamming or flooding chat with ‘hi’, no staff would ask for you to stop….. ”the fact that I got warned or kicked in the first place (for putting a LETTER in the chat) shows the mod in question is an idiot who doesn't deserve his rank in the first place (although this is being dealt with anyways)”.... Yes the warn to ban reason was about a letter, but the actual reason behind it was from what I saw and what you did. Also calling me an idiot will not advance your case considering it basically diminishes what you were trying to say. Saying that I do not deserve my rank is honestly stupid (sorry not sorry) because clearly, I must be doing something right if I passed my trial. I can understand if you said “He is a bit too strict” and stuff like that but saying something like that is really stupid. If you do not approve of the way I staff, you can report me to a Sr. Mod or Admin and let them talk to me and then you can sit back and wait to let them do all the work. Another option is to read the rules….. “of course I'm going to challenge retarded shit, if left unchallenged that retarded shit will grow to an even more retarded level of 'punishable' offenses given the thickness of some mods on here”..... At this point you are not even challenging anything anymore, you are just looking to say something silly and then have people agree with you. Half the people who agreed with you were not even there, and then those with actual reasonable points I already explained. As for leaving it unchallenged, I can agree with that, even I don’t agree with some rules but you don’t see me complaining. Rules are there for a reason. At this point I am not even going to avoid the fact that I was the one who punished so calling me thickheaded (I can also assume this would be to the mods that cared enough to reply to your thread) does not do anything for you. If anything, we are both thickheaded here because you refuse to listen to a simple rule and I was “too mean” or “too strict” with the way I staff. Again, if you have an issue with the way I staff, report it to Sr. Mods or to Junr (when he isn’t on Overwatch) and have them deal with your report on me, if they tell me I should change something a bit or if I am doing just dandy I will of course change it up a bit but as for now I think I am doing good…../now referring to the ABC’s/: Brick, you are just stretching it at this point and trying to make silly points and reasons. No one but you and maybe some Team Rocket players will ever think of the first 3 letters of the alphabet in that way. If it is not widely seen as a sign of disrespect or bad sportsmanship, then we see no reason to punish for it unless you spammed it in chat.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">@SamuelJacob9 - correct</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">@vladthegreat100 - “3. Notify people that "L" can now be classified as rudeness or that you may not state "L" at all.”.... We have said this many times before and especially in the past few days, as for a grace period of course it will be a thing if this becomes changed…… “1. You pulled a new rule out of your asses without updating it on the Rules Page”...... No we have not. This has been a rule for a long time and if you scroll up, you can see that it is in fact, a rule. The rules in the “Rules” thread do not always blatantly say “Don’t say L, ez, izi, etc” but they are there if you took the time to think. Also, there has been many times that people have been just told that you were not allowed to say L or ez in chat. I remember 6 months ago a staff member telling me that saying those things was not allowed. Saying the rule came out recently is sadly false because even though it is not blatantly written, the rule has always been there. I see that you have already said something along the line of that it should be written blatantly if it is a rule, but at least I try to follow the bloody policies. Also, most/all staff that are in charge of that have much more important things to do than to add a rule that was already under another rule. You are right when you say that we will never please everyone. </span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">@DaGoldBrick - Badlion’s rules do not apply to this, have a problem with it, do the same thing you are doing here and challenge their rules. “Nazi chat rules”.... A bit of a hyperbole but I can see what you mean. “I'm only challenging it after I got banned because I honestly didn't expect to get banned lmao”.... Brick, what did you expect to happen? For me to give you a slap on the wrist and say “Bad Brick!”?. To what Miqah said, you really didn’t think you had it coming? Your ban is legitimate, so what do you mean that I need to be inspected by staff? When you were banned there were 2 other mods on and a Sr. Mod on the discord that I could easily contact so they could have easily stopped me if they thought I should have held back on hitting the enter key. If anything, at this point you should know how the procedure goes for punishments considering on how long you have been playing. Back to with me and my rank, if you have an issue, tell a Sr. Mod instead of now just telling them when you are banned on a forums post after you call the staff team thickheaded and idiots. Speaking of which, an “idiot” would not realise that they should stop continuing after a staff member told them to stop even if it was a joke. By the way, “L” on its own does not make it an obvious joke, so where was the context? Also, coming back after a kick and telling me to hold an L was what moved me to temp-ban.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">@profbananaslug - If I was doing a bad job/ not meeting standards of being staff, my trial would have ended early and you would have seen a “</span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);  ">CerealFirst</span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;  "> </span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;  ">has failed his trial and has been demoted from Jr mod</span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">” and a few pretty pictures on the #announcements in Discord. Also, I catch your drift when you called me afk in the head. If anything I am just fine in the head because when I go back and double check all the punishments I given, only 1 punishment was deemed false (it was appealed. That kind of tells me I think I know what I am doing in terms of being staff so I don’t know what the surprise was.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">@KojaCola; @MeMyselfAndSnow; @Miqah - You three have basically half summed up what I have said, thank god. For those that do not want to follow the rules of the server, you are not entitled or required to play on here. For those that try to push the rules, we will get on you for it. Finally for those that do not agree with how me or any other staff on here do their duty as moderator/staff, you have always had the option of reporting a “bad” mod to a Senior.</span></p><br><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">NOTE: If this comes off as rude to anyone in anyway, I do not intend it to be that way. Yes I may have said some borderline things, but they were meant to explain myself. As for those who want to tell me how to do my job, wait a few months, wait for apps to open, apply and hope to get accepted, go through the process and become mod yourself so you can make a change on the server. If you don’t want to go through that, make a well structured forum post that in no way offends anyone, leave it open to the community to have a reasonable conversation instead of attacking the way someone does something. Again, I will say I do not intend to be offensive to anyone I replied to, but this is me clearing myself up and explaining myself instead of being quiet like I usually am on what I do.</span></p><br></span>

I stated my opinion and tried to explain myself? As for lack of respect, I tried to be very respectful in what I wrote. As for chilling out, I frankly do not care. I will say what I need to say and I will do it how I feel like I should do it even if it requires me writing a whole book. Also if you are refering for me to chill because I did my thing and punished a player, then you have no clue what is going on.

I will say what I need to say and I will do it how I feel like I should do it even if it requires me writing a whole book. Also if you are refering for me to chill because I did my thing and punished a player, then you have no clue what is going on.

Btw, this will be a long post and I left a note at the end. I would suggest not just skimming through and actually try to read as much as you can so you get a whole idea and not half a story.....<br><br><span><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;  ">@dev_revs - First off, I would ask that you don’t use my irl name when referring to how I staff or something related to that, use my ign please. Secondly, you are over exaggerating how I punish for saying L in chat. I do not care if the player is in spec mode or not, there is no reason for anyone to say L in chat and to also add onto that, I am only following the procedure I am required to follow unless their punishments say otherwise. Also, a verbal warn is nothing in my opinion because it doesn’t even go on your record. If I verbal warn someone then that means they should stop before it actually starts becoming a huge issue. The only reason it is a huge issue now is because people are acting like it is a new rule even though it has been a thing for over a year now at least. </span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;  ">@DaGoldBrick - In reality, you were temp-banned because you refused to follow staff orders and went from a simple verbal warn all the way to a temp-ban. I asked you the first time to not say L, and even privately messaged you in game as you had bluntly told me you would say it as you please, which does not mean you are allowed to say it. We went from a /warn to a kick, and when you say “</span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  "> I got temp-banned by putting L in the chat, whilst I was in spec and sitting in spawn”,</span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  "> </span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);  ">you actually came back on from being kicked, said “hold this L”, and earned yourself a temp-ban after having multiple opportunities to stop. Finally, being in spec mode and in spawn does not mean you can throw around “L” like it is nothing. And if you look on your appeal, you would see what I put there to justify your temp-ban. As for context, yes I can agree sometimes it can be bad since it is in chat and not a live interaction in a voice to voice thing, but even so; do you really expect us to gather enough context from just “L” to say “oh that dude is just saying it to his friend it’s alright we can let it slide”. I hope your answer is no considering that is the argument players try to make with us when we do something about it.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);  ">@Rocky - If you want to mock people after they die, go on a practice server and do it. Sorry to be a bit blunt about it but it has been a rule on here for a long time. As for your only reasoning being “</span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">If they don't like it then they shouldn't die”, </span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;  ">I do not understand what you mean. Are you saying that it is the person who died fault that the other player that killed them had mocked them in chat?</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;  ">@Pokerface - Agreed, this is the same process that I do with all the players but yet there is an issue with it? Apparently this is too strict even though players have about 5-6 chances to stop and avoid punishment. If anything it is good that we verbal warn first so why complain? As for the need to say it… FAX B.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;  ">@DaGoldBrick - We still punish for winning teams saying W after a match, or at least I do and around 2 other mods. As for you and the “irrelevant horizon” fella, the rule still applies no matter what. If we let you and the other player continue on then everyone else will want to do it and at that point people will just go and try to push it. As for being punishable off mod guidelines, he is right and as for context, if he read “take this L kid” “you're easy get good” “L (horizon dude)” then that is good enough for him to do something about it. As for how people become mod, they apply, get accepted and go through an interview, and finally become Jr Mod if they did good in the interview. After that they do a trial (like I did) and if they are deemed to be good enough/amazing, they get promoted. If they become mod that means they are doing something right even if people do not agree with the way they do it. As for training them, the trial period is basically training and a trial. Also, Jr Mods are taught how to staff before they even begin their trial, which is enough training considering they have a few weeks to get better at it and have access to other staff whenever they need anything.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;  ">@Lokigh - Exactly, I can understand when new players come on and say L, but considering most of the people we punish for it have been on for at least a few months, there is no excuse for them to not have taken the initiative to read the rules or at least have learned them from in game.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);  ">@profbananaslug - (ik you will say something like “what did i tell you, don't talk to me”, idc if i feel like I have to respond I will) He is referring to people arguing with each other in game like “kid L” -&gt; “nah your trash kek, agro kid 4v1” -&gt; “nah you just bad” and so on. </span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);  ">@dev_revs - I also forgot to mention earlier that I wouldn’t let you say random letters in chat because it triggered me is fair IMO. Rule 4 on the “Rules” states “</span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">Follow the directions given by any Avicus staff member. Do not lie to a staff member. </span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 700;  ">If you believe a staff member is abusing their power through wrongful punishments or other methods, please email </span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(3, 141, 210); font-weight: 700;  ">support@avicus.net</span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 700;  "> and provide any evidence or details you possess regarding the staff member.” …. </span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent;  ">More importantly, the bit on following a staff members directions. I had asked everyone in chat to stop with the letters because it was flooding chat with the amount of times everyone was saying it, spammy during certain points, and honestly just stupid to look at in chat, I would turn off chat but I have to read all the false reports that I also saw during those 30 minutes on people reporting for silly reasons. &lt;- that last thing is not part of the rules but the 1st and 2nd are valid from what I saw. Saying that I was triggered was false considering I was only asking that everyone would not flood chat with the letters even if it was a simple letter like “a” and “t” because it caused more players to join in.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent;  ">@APacketOfChips - FINALLY SOMEONE WITH SENSE!!!!! I will be honest and disagree with you on the “all fun and games” thing but I guess we both interpret the rules differently.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent;  ">@DaGoldBrick - you weren’t punished for “joking around”, yes the ban reason says “Please do not say L in chat” or something similar to that, but my reasoning behind it was because you refused to obey staff orders, which ultimately led to a temp-ban. In your appeal I told you why.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent;  ">@dev_revs - it was no accident, Brick was a spectator to you just saying L but what I saw was someone who refused to obey staff orders. Which in a previous thing above I had stated the rule on that.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent;  ">@Xylk - …</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent;  ">@APacketofChips - “</span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">Saying "L" in chat is toxic, and can be rude towards some people, which is why we don't allow it.” Correct and fax b.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">@Rombeyyy - What I said to dev_revs will be the same thing I will say to you, but I will add that Brick had earned his punishment legitimately. He could have stopped at the verbal warn or /warn but continued over a span of 10-15 mins.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">@DaGoldenBrick - First off, Packet is not stupid and you should never treat a young lady like that, so rude :(, and second off, it is not a silly thing to ban off of. As I have stated before you were banned for continuing to keep saying L in chat. Yes I agree that L started off as a joke, but now it has been turned into an insult, which goes against the rule I put in your appeal which stated proper etiquette and behavior on the server. As for being banned off a single letter, I will again state I. DID. NOT…. ban you over a letter, I banned you for the context in which you said it and refusal to follow my directions. As for you saying W when you are on the winning team, you told me you could care less and would say L as you wish and got punished, I would look back and apply that to future situations like this and try to not think “I know I got banned for something like this, but this is different because I am changing the letter so I can’t be banned” and think “Even though I am turning the table here, the context is the same so I shouldn’t do it.” because the punishment will still be the same if all you are worried about is context. As for your reply to Miqah, they had clearly said they didn’t understand the whole story, but I will leave this at that.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">@dev_revs - Your point is invalid when you say “so if a mod tells us to stop playing, we have to stop playing?”. What mod will tell anyone “Hey! YOU! Stop playing right now or ban.”? Also, the listen to mods bs is not bs. On any other server you will listen to a mod so Avicus is not any different. As for getting salty over little things, I suggest you refer to what I have said earlier. Also assuming I did not like you guys saying random letters in chat so I asked you guys to stop is stupid. I would expect someone with a Media Rank would have some decent sense and try to think about the rules. If that comes off as blunt, eh take it as you will. As for him being only a spectator who was dieing does not justify saying L in chat even if he was not killing people. L is not allowed to be said... end of conversation about him being only a spectator because I have already explained it 2 or 3 times already.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">@_Gill - I appreciate you stating your opinion in a mature manner. Like not even to be funny I actually do because now I can actually be more structured. My stance on the rule is this: I do not care if it is a joke, if you are in spec mode, if you don’t care about the rule, or if you think I need context as well as if you think I am unfair when I tell you to be a good sport. I interpret the rules a little more strict than other mods; nothing wrong with that at all to me, but it can be to you. Saying this, I would not take verbal warnings from me or any other staff with a grain of salt or try to go around it with saying anything similar. If I see you being a bad sport I will say something. If I see you in chat and it is hard to tell if you are actually being a bad sport, I ALWAYS… ask other staff and check rules.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">@MLGtino - it isn’t about it being a letter, it is about the </span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 700;   ">MEANING</span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">. As for stooping to this point, I wouldn’t even have to be making this if players actually listened to staff. As I have said many times before, this rule on bad sportsmanship is not even a new rule and has been around for a long time. Also with the assumption bit, yes it did create a grey area, but it is up to the mods on how they interpret rules. How I look at rules compared to Pokerface is different. As for controversy, really any rule can be controversial if you stretch it a bit.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">@DaGoldBrick - “this is like saying "why do you keep saying hi to players when you were asked to stop?", surely one character L is inferior to 2 characters h and i in the same sentence?”... This point is in no way valid, if anything it is stupid because unless you were spamming or flooding chat with ‘hi’, no staff would ask for you to stop….. ”the fact that I got warned or kicked in the first place (for putting a LETTER in the chat) shows the mod in question is an idiot who doesn't deserve his rank in the first place (although this is being dealt with anyways)”.... Yes the warn to ban reason was about a letter, but the actual reason behind it was from what I saw and what you did. Also calling me an idiot will not advance your case considering it basically diminishes what you were trying to say. Saying that I do not deserve my rank is honestly stupid (sorry not sorry) because clearly, I must be doing something right if I passed my trial. I can understand if you said “He is a bit too strict” and stuff like that but saying something like that is really stupid. If you do not approve of the way I staff, you can report me to a Sr. Mod or Admin and let them talk to me and then you can sit back and wait to let them do all the work. Another option is to read the rules….. “of course I'm going to challenge retarded shit, if left unchallenged that retarded shit will grow to an even more retarded level of 'punishable' offenses given the thickness of some mods on here”..... At this point you are not even challenging anything anymore, you are just looking to say something silly and then have people agree with you. Half the people who agreed with you were not even there, and then those with actual reasonable points I already explained. As for leaving it unchallenged, I can agree with that, even I don’t agree with some rules but you don’t see me complaining. Rules are there for a reason. At this point I am not even going to avoid the fact that I was the one who punished so calling me thickheaded (I can also assume this would be to the mods that cared enough to reply to your thread) does not do anything for you. If anything, we are both thickheaded here because you refuse to listen to a simple rule and I was “too mean” or “too strict” with the way I staff. Again, if you have an issue with the way I staff, report it to Sr. Mods or to Junr (when he isn’t on Overwatch) and have them deal with your report on me, if they tell me I should change something a bit or if I am doing just dandy I will of course change it up a bit but as for now I think I am doing good…../now referring to the ABC’s/: Brick, you are just stretching it at this point and trying to make silly points and reasons. No one but you and maybe some Team Rocket players will ever think of the first 3 letters of the alphabet in that way. If it is not widely seen as a sign of disrespect or bad sportsmanship, then we see no reason to punish for it unless you spammed it in chat.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">@SamuelJacob9 - correct</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">@vladthegreat100 - “3. Notify people that "L" can now be classified as rudeness or that you may not state "L" at all.”.... We have said this many times before and especially in the past few days, as for a grace period of course it will be a thing if this becomes changed…… “1. You pulled a new rule out of your asses without updating it on the Rules Page”...... No we have not. This has been a rule for a long time and if you scroll up, you can see that it is in fact, a rule. The rules in the “Rules” thread do not always blatantly say “Don’t say L, ez, izi, etc” but they are there if you took the time to think. Also, there has been many times that people have been just told that you were not allowed to say L or ez in chat. I remember 6 months ago a staff member telling me that saying those things was not allowed. Saying the rule came out recently is sadly false because even though it is not blatantly written, the rule has always been there. I see that you have already said something along the line of that it should be written blatantly if it is a rule, but at least I try to follow the bloody policies. Also, most/all staff that are in charge of that have much more important things to do than to add a rule that was already under another rule. You are right when you say that we will never please everyone. </span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">@DaGoldBrick - Badlion’s rules do not apply to this, have a problem with it, do the same thing you are doing here and challenge their rules. “Nazi chat rules”.... A bit of a hyperbole but I can see what you mean. “I'm only challenging it after I got banned because I honestly didn't expect to get banned lmao”.... Brick, what did you expect to happen? For me to give you a slap on the wrist and say “Bad Brick!”?. To what Miqah said, you really didn’t think you had it coming? Your ban is legitimate, so what do you mean that I need to be inspected by staff? When you were banned there were 2 other mods on and a Sr. Mod on the discord that I could easily contact so they could have easily stopped me if they thought I should have held back on hitting the enter key. If anything, at this point you should know how the procedure goes for punishments considering on how long you have been playing. Back to with me and my rank, if you have an issue, tell a Sr. Mod instead of now just telling them when you are banned on a forums post after you call the staff team thickheaded and idiots. Speaking of which, an “idiot” would not realise that they should stop continuing after a staff member told them to stop even if it was a joke. By the way, “L” on its own does not make it an obvious joke, so where was the context? Also, coming back after a kick and telling me to hold an L was what moved me to temp-ban.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">@profbananaslug - If I was doing a bad job/ not meeting standards of being staff, my trial would have ended early and you would have seen a “</span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);  ">CerealFirst</span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;  "> </span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;  ">has failed his trial and has been demoted from Jr mod</span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">” and a few pretty pictures on the #announcements in Discord. Also, I catch your drift when you called me afk in the head. If anything I am just fine in the head because when I go back and double check all the punishments I given, only 1 punishment was deemed false (it was appealed. That kind of tells me I think I know what I am doing in terms of being staff so I don’t know what the surprise was.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">@KojaCola; @MeMyselfAndSnow; @Miqah - You three have basically half summed up what I have said, thank god. For those that do not want to follow the rules of the server, you are not entitled or required to play on here. For those that try to push the rules, we will get on you for it. Finally for those that do not agree with how me or any other staff on here do their duty as moderator/staff, you have always had the option of reporting a “bad” mod to a Senior.</span></p><br><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">NOTE: If this comes off as rude to anyone in anyway, I do not intend it to be that way. Yes I may have said some borderline things, but they were meant to explain myself. As for those who want to tell me how to do my job, wait a few months, wait for apps to open, apply and hope to get accepted, go through the process and become mod yourself so you can make a change on the server. If you don’t want to go through that, make a well structured forum post that in no way offends anyone, leave it open to the community to have a reasonable conversation instead of attacking the way someone does something. Again, I will say I do not intend to be offensive to anyone I replied to, but this is me clearing myself up and explaining myself instead of being quiet like I usually am on what I do.</span></p><br></span>

Becoming a mod on Avicus is not hard. I passed by 2nd interview while p<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">ℒ</span>aying Badlion. The training is very sparse from what I remember as we<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">ℒ</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">ℒ</span>, and from what I've heard it hasn't gotten better. (As another aside I'm pretty sure the protocol for this specific infraction is: warn &gt;&gt; kick &gt;&gt; 1 day temp. could be wrong) But most<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">ℒ</span>y what I'm getting at is I see a lot of the mods assume a position that they're above the rest of the community and that they have some sort of governmenta<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">ℒ</span>&nbsp;authority, when really their position is under payed daycare with about a few hours of training, a coup<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">ℒ</span>e docs, and a pretty sticker attached. I think this feeds into some of the triba<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">ℒ</span>&nbsp;mentality that should be diffused by the staff not perpetuated.

The main problem I see here is really in the behavior of the mods and sr. staff in trying to (or lack of) handle this situation or update the rules to make them more clear as other have suggested.

What did I tell you? That I could care less about what you told me, you can say the same thing to me but that will not stop me from replying or having to talk to you. Might as well learn to put up with it at this point. Also there is no need for the "L" in fancy lettering

Btw, this will be a long post and I left a note at the end. I would suggest not just skimming through and actually try to read as much as you can so you get a whole idea and not half a story.....<br><br><span><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;  ">@dev_revs - First off, I would ask that you don’t use my irl name when referring to how I staff or something related to that, use my ign please. Secondly, you are over exaggerating how I punish for saying L in chat. I do not care if the player is in spec mode or not, there is no reason for anyone to say L in chat and to also add onto that, I am only following the procedure I am required to follow unless their punishments say otherwise. Also, a verbal warn is nothing in my opinion because it doesn’t even go on your record. If I verbal warn someone then that means they should stop before it actually starts becoming a huge issue. The only reason it is a huge issue now is because people are acting like it is a new rule even though it has been a thing for over a year now at least. </span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;  ">@DaGoldBrick - In reality, you were temp-banned because you refused to follow staff orders and went from a simple verbal warn all the way to a temp-ban. I asked you the first time to not say L, and even privately messaged you in game as you had bluntly told me you would say it as you please, which does not mean you are allowed to say it. We went from a /warn to a kick, and when you say “</span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  "> I got temp-banned by putting L in the chat, whilst I was in spec and sitting in spawn”,</span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  "> </span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);  ">you actually came back on from being kicked, said “hold this L”, and earned yourself a temp-ban after having multiple opportunities to stop. Finally, being in spec mode and in spawn does not mean you can throw around “L” like it is nothing. And if you look on your appeal, you would see what I put there to justify your temp-ban. As for context, yes I can agree sometimes it can be bad since it is in chat and not a live interaction in a voice to voice thing, but even so; do you really expect us to gather enough context from just “L” to say “oh that dude is just saying it to his friend it’s alright we can let it slide”. I hope your answer is no considering that is the argument players try to make with us when we do something about it.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);  ">@Rocky - If you want to mock people after they die, go on a practice server and do it. Sorry to be a bit blunt about it but it has been a rule on here for a long time. As for your only reasoning being “</span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">If they don't like it then they shouldn't die”, </span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;  ">I do not understand what you mean. Are you saying that it is the person who died fault that the other player that killed them had mocked them in chat?</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;  ">@Pokerface - Agreed, this is the same process that I do with all the players but yet there is an issue with it? Apparently this is too strict even though players have about 5-6 chances to stop and avoid punishment. If anything it is good that we verbal warn first so why complain? As for the need to say it… FAX B.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;  ">@DaGoldBrick - We still punish for winning teams saying W after a match, or at least I do and around 2 other mods. As for you and the “irrelevant horizon” fella, the rule still applies no matter what. If we let you and the other player continue on then everyone else will want to do it and at that point people will just go and try to push it. As for being punishable off mod guidelines, he is right and as for context, if he read “take this L kid” “you're easy get good” “L (horizon dude)” then that is good enough for him to do something about it. As for how people become mod, they apply, get accepted and go through an interview, and finally become Jr Mod if they did good in the interview. After that they do a trial (like I did) and if they are deemed to be good enough/amazing, they get promoted. If they become mod that means they are doing something right even if people do not agree with the way they do it. As for training them, the trial period is basically training and a trial. Also, Jr Mods are taught how to staff before they even begin their trial, which is enough training considering they have a few weeks to get better at it and have access to other staff whenever they need anything.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;  ">@Lokigh - Exactly, I can understand when new players come on and say L, but considering most of the people we punish for it have been on for at least a few months, there is no excuse for them to not have taken the initiative to read the rules or at least have learned them from in game.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);  ">@profbananaslug - (ik you will say something like “what did i tell you, don't talk to me”, idc if i feel like I have to respond I will) He is referring to people arguing with each other in game like “kid L” -&gt; “nah your trash kek, agro kid 4v1” -&gt; “nah you just bad” and so on. </span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);  ">@dev_revs - I also forgot to mention earlier that I wouldn’t let you say random letters in chat because it triggered me is fair IMO. Rule 4 on the “Rules” states “</span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">Follow the directions given by any Avicus staff member. Do not lie to a staff member. </span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 700;  ">If you believe a staff member is abusing their power through wrongful punishments or other methods, please email </span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(3, 141, 210); font-weight: 700;  ">support@avicus.net</span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 700;  "> and provide any evidence or details you possess regarding the staff member.” …. </span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent;  ">More importantly, the bit on following a staff members directions. I had asked everyone in chat to stop with the letters because it was flooding chat with the amount of times everyone was saying it, spammy during certain points, and honestly just stupid to look at in chat, I would turn off chat but I have to read all the false reports that I also saw during those 30 minutes on people reporting for silly reasons. &lt;- that last thing is not part of the rules but the 1st and 2nd are valid from what I saw. Saying that I was triggered was false considering I was only asking that everyone would not flood chat with the letters even if it was a simple letter like “a” and “t” because it caused more players to join in.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent;  ">@APacketOfChips - FINALLY SOMEONE WITH SENSE!!!!!

As I have stated before you were banned for continuing to keep saying L in chat. Yes I agree that L started off as a joke, but now it has been turned into an insult, which goes against the rule I put in your appeal which stated proper etiquette and behavior on the server. As for being banned off a single letter, I will again state I. DID. NOT…. ban you over a letter, I banned you for the context in which you said it and refusal to follow my directions. As for you saying W when you are on the winning team, you told me you could care less and would say L as you wish and got punished, I would look back and apply that to future situations like this and try to not think “I know I got banned for something like this, but this is different because I am changing the letter so I can’t be banned” and think “Even though I am turning the table here, the context is the same so I shouldn’t do it.” because the punishment will still be the same if all you are worried about is context. As for your reply to Miqah, they had clearly said they didn’t understand the whole story, but I will leave this at that.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">@dev_revs - Your point is invalid when you say “so if a mod tells us to stop playing, we have to stop playing?”. What mod will tell anyone “Hey! YOU! Stop playing right now or ban.”? Also, the listen to mods bs is not bs. On any other server you will listen to a mod so Avicus is not any different. As for getting salty over little things, I suggest you refer to what I have said earlier. Also assuming I did not like you guys saying random letters in chat so I asked you guys to stop is stupid. I would expect someone with a Media Rank would have some decent sense and try to think about the rules. If that comes off as blunt, eh take it as you will. As for him being only a spectator who was dieing does not justify saying L in chat even if he was not killing people. L is not allowed to be said... end of conversation about him being only a spectator because I have already explained it 2 or 3 times already.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">@_Gill - I appreciate you stating your opinion in a mature manner. Like not even to be funny I actually do because now I can actually be more structured. My stance on the rule is this: I do not care if it is a joke, if you are in spec mode, if you don’t care about the rule, or if you think I need context as well as if you think I am unfair when I tell you to be a good sport. I interpret the rules a little more strict than other mods; nothing wrong with that at all to me, but it can be to you. Saying this, I would not take verbal warnings from me or any other staff with a grain of salt or try to go around it with saying anything similar. If I see you being a bad sport I will say something. If I see you in chat and it is hard to tell if you are actually being a bad sport, I ALWAYS… ask other staff and check rules.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">@MLGtino - it isn’t about it being a letter, it is about the </span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 700;   ">MEANING</span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">. As for stooping to this point, I wouldn’t even have to be making this if players actually listened to staff. As I have said many times before, this rule on bad sportsmanship is not even a new rule and has been around for a long time. Also with the assumption bit, yes it did create a grey area, but it is up to the mods on how they interpret rules. How I look at rules compared to Pokerface is different. As for controversy, really any rule can be controversial if you stretch it a bit.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">@DaGoldBrick - “this is like saying "why do you keep saying hi to players when you were asked to stop?", surely one character L is inferior to 2 characters h and i in the same sentence?”... This point is in no way valid, if anything it is stupid because unless you were spamming or flooding chat with ‘hi’, no staff would ask for you to stop….. ”the fact that I got warned or kicked in the first place (for putting a LETTER in the chat) shows the mod in question is an idiot who doesn't deserve his rank in the first place (although this is being dealt with anyways)”.... Yes the warn to ban reason was about a letter, but the actual reason behind it was from what I saw and what you did. Also calling me an idiot will not advance your case considering it basically diminishes what you were trying to say. Saying that I do not deserve my rank is honestly stupid (sorry not sorry) because clearly, I must be doing something right if I passed my trial. I can understand if you said “He is a bit too strict” and stuff like that but saying something like that is really stupid. If you do not approve of the way I staff, you can report me to a Sr. Mod or Admin and let them talk to me and then you can sit back and wait to let them do all the work. Another option is to read the rules….. “of course I'm going to challenge retarded shit, if left unchallenged that retarded shit will grow to an even more retarded level of 'punishable' offenses given the thickness of some mods on here”..... At this point you are not even challenging anything anymore, you are just looking to say something silly and then have people agree with you. Half the people who agreed with you were not even there, and then those with actual reasonable points I already explained. As for leaving it unchallenged, I can agree with that, even I don’t agree with some rules but you don’t see me complaining. Rules are there for a reason. At this point I am not even going to avoid the fact that I was the one who punished so calling me thickheaded (I can also assume this would be to the mods that cared enough to reply to your thread) does not do anything for you. If anything, we are both thickheaded here because you refuse to listen to a simple rule and I was “too mean” or “too strict” with the way I staff. Again, if you have an issue with the way I staff, report it to Sr. Mods or to Junr (when he isn’t on Overwatch) and have them deal with your report on me, if they tell me I should change something a bit or if I am doing just dandy I will of course change it up a bit but as for now I think I am doing good…../now referring to the ABC’s/: Brick, you are just stretching it at this point and trying to make silly points and reasons. No one but you and maybe some Team Rocket players will ever think of the first 3 letters of the alphabet in that way. If it is not widely seen as a sign of disrespect or bad sportsmanship, then we see no reason to punish for it unless you spammed it in chat.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">@SamuelJacob9 - correct</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">@vladthegreat100 - “3. Notify people that "L" can now be classified as rudeness or that you may not state "L" at all.”.... We have said this many times before and especially in the past few days, as for a grace period of course it will be a thing if this becomes changed…… “1. You pulled a new rule out of your asses without updating it on the Rules Page”...... No we have not. This has been a rule for a long time and if you scroll up, you can see that it is in fact, a rule. The rules in the “Rules” thread do not always blatantly say “Don’t say L, ez, izi, etc” but they are there if you took the time to think. Also, there has been many times that people have been just told that you were not allowed to say L or ez in chat. I remember 6 months ago a staff member telling me that saying those things was not allowed. Saying the rule came out recently is sadly false because even though it is not blatantly written, the rule has always been there. I see that you have already said something along the line of that it should be written blatantly if it is a rule, but at least I try to follow the bloody policies. Also, most/all staff that are in charge of that have much more important things to do than to add a rule that was already under another rule. You are right when you say that we will never please everyone. </span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">@DaGoldBrick - Badlion’s rules do not apply to this, have a problem with it, do the same thing you are doing here and challenge their rules. “Nazi chat rules”.... A bit of a hyperbole but I can see what you mean. “I'm only challenging it after I got banned because I honestly didn't expect to get banned lmao”.... Brick, what did you expect to happen? For me to give you a slap on the wrist and say “Bad Brick!”?. To what Miqah said, you really didn’t think you had it coming? Your ban is legitimate, so what do you mean that I need to be inspected by staff? When you were banned there were 2 other mods on and a Sr. Mod on the discord that I could easily contact so they could have easily stopped me if they thought I should have held back on hitting the enter key. If anything, at this point you should know how the procedure goes for punishments considering on how long you have been playing. Back to with me and my rank, if you have an issue, tell a Sr. Mod instead of now just telling them when you are banned on a forums post after you call the staff team thickheaded and idiots. Speaking of which, an “idiot” would not realise that they should stop continuing after a staff member told them to stop even if it was a joke. By the way, “L” on its own does not make it an obvious joke, so where was the context? Also, coming back after a kick and telling me to hold an L was what moved me to temp-ban.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">@profbananaslug - If I was doing a bad job/ not meeting standards of being staff, my trial would have ended early and you would have seen a “</span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);  ">CerealFirst</span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;  "> </span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;  ">has failed his trial and has been demoted from Jr mod</span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">” and a few pretty pictures on the #announcements in Discord. Also, I catch your drift when you called me afk in the head. If anything I am just fine in the head because when I go back and double check all the punishments I given, only 1 punishment was deemed false (it was appealed. That kind of tells me I think I know what I am doing in terms of being staff so I don’t know what the surprise was.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">@KojaCola; @MeMyselfAndSnow; @Miqah - You three have basically half summed up what I have said, thank god.

As for those who want to tell me how to do my job, wait a few months, wait for apps to open, apply and hope to get accepted, go through the process and become mod yourself so you can make a change on the server. If you don’t want to go through that, make a well structured forum post that in no way offends anyone, leave it open to the community to have a reasonable conversation instead of attacking the way someone does something. Again, I will say I do not intend to be offensive to anyone I replied to, but this is me clearing myself up and explaining myself instead of being quiet like I usually am on what I do.</span></p><br></span>

Ok, the fact that you warned/kicked/tempbanned me for putting a fucking LETTER in the chat is retarded. I see people spamming nigga/nigger, but what do I do?

All of Hitler's staff obeyed his orders, now look at where they are. Mute for A B C D E F G H I J K M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z if you're going to mute for L, "please do not put L in the chat" is literally a joke, I don't know how the fuck you think this can even be regarded as bad sportsmanship in the first place.<br><br>I'm going to stop reading here because you make no justified points other than shit like "we are the staff, we follow the rules, we can punish people for putting 1 letter in the chat"<br><br>I wouldn't mind making a video on this and see what 1.5k other people have to say about this, tempbanning someone for putting a letter in the chat.

Oftentimes in threads where the core issue is a gray area in the rules and its framed as punished guy vs. staff that punished, there's a very distinct us vs. them situation that arises in which the mods defend their fe<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">ℒ</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">ℒ</span>ow staff, while&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">ℒ</span>ay players fo<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">ℒ</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">ℒ</span>ow suit on the other side.

However, this behavior by the mods is triba<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">ℒ</span>&nbsp;at best and at worst segregates the community and drives dissent towards the mod team.

Becoming a mod on Avicus is not hard. I passed by 2nd interview while p<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">ℒ</span>aying Badlion. The training is very sparse from what I remember as we<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">ℒ</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">ℒ</span>, and from what I've heard it hasn't gotten better. (As another aside I'm pretty sure the protocol for this specific infraction is: warn &gt;&gt; kick &gt;&gt; 1 day temp. could be wrong) But most<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">ℒ</span>y what I'm getting at is I see a lot of the mods assume a position that they're above the rest of the community and that they have some sort of governmenta<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">ℒ</span>&nbsp;authority, when really their position is under payed daycare with about a few hours of training, a coup<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">ℒ</span>e docs, and a pretty sticker attached. I think this feeds into some of the triba<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">ℒ</span>&nbsp;mentality that should be diffused by the staff not perpetuated. This could easily be fixed by more training and coordination in the moderation team or maybe even more agency for mods in terms of changing rules themselves.<br><br>So in conclusion, Henry, i think given what you know about the rules, you did exactly what you had to.

The main problem I see here is really in the behavior of the mods and sr. staff in trying to (or lack of) handle this situation or update the rules to make them more clear as other have suggested.

You sir just gained a lot of respect.<br><br>Henry followed the guildlines he was given when he passed his interview, not his fault. Brick is right about the rules needing change, but shouldn't be talking about his punishment as an example. From everything that's been said, nothing was done wrong.&nbsp;<br><br>-Rules have needed to be more clear for as long as I can remember. imo the staff team needs to have a full day or something where we all get into TS and just talk about the rules and how they need to be changed. After that we have a rough draft of what the rules should be like, or at least an idea, and the Seniors can edit it for typos and make stuff more clear. <br><br>None of this should be a problem, but for some reason it always is...

L=lossers. Nobody want to get called losser,&nbsp; it can make to some people to feel uncomfortable and it can create a bad atmosphere on the chat, and it also refelcts that you are not a good sportman if you are calling losser to everyone who lose. So that is why, in my opinion, it´s against the rules and must be punishable.

In your opinion it's against the rules? That's not how it works, it's either against the rules or it isn't, there is no opinion.

Btw, this will be a long post and I left a note at the end. I would suggest not just skimming through and actually try to read as much as you can so you get a whole idea and not half a story.....<br><br><span><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;  ">@dev_revs - First off, I would ask that you don’t use my irl name when referring to how I staff or something related to that, use my ign please. Secondly, you are over exaggerating how I punish for saying L in chat. I do not care if the player is in spec mode or not, there is no reason for anyone to say L in chat and to also add onto that, I am only following the procedure I am required to follow unless their punishments say otherwise. Also, a verbal warn is nothing in my opinion because it doesn’t even go on your record. If I verbal warn someone then that means they should stop before it actually starts becoming a huge issue. The only reason it is a huge issue now is because people are acting like it is a new rule even though it has been a thing for over a year now at least. </span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;  ">@DaGoldBrick - In reality, you were temp-banned because you refused to follow staff orders and went from a simple verbal warn all the way to a temp-ban. I asked you the first time to not say L, and even privately messaged you in game as you had bluntly told me you would say it as you please, which does not mean you are allowed to say it. We went from a /warn to a kick, and when you say “</span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  "> I got temp-banned by putting L in the chat, whilst I was in spec and sitting in spawn”,</span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  "> </span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);  ">you actually came back on from being kicked, said “hold this L”, and earned yourself a temp-ban after having multiple opportunities to stop. Finally, being in spec mode and in spawn does not mean you can throw around “L” like it is nothing. And if you look on your appeal, you would see what I put there to justify your temp-ban. As for context, yes I can agree sometimes it can be bad since it is in chat and not a live interaction in a voice to voice thing, but even so; do you really expect us to gather enough context from just “L” to say “oh that dude is just saying it to his friend it’s alright we can let it slide”. I hope your answer is no considering that is the argument players try to make with us when we do something about it.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);  ">@Rocky - If you want to mock people after they die, go on a practice server and do it. Sorry to be a bit blunt about it but it has been a rule on here for a long time. As for your only reasoning being “</span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">If they don't like it then they shouldn't die”, </span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;  ">I do not understand what you mean.

Apparently this is too strict even though players have about 5-6 chances to stop and avoid punishment. If anything it is good that we verbal warn first so why complain? As for the need to say it… FAX B.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;  ">@DaGoldBrick - We still punish for winning teams saying W after a match, or at least I do and around 2 other mods. As for you and the “irrelevant horizon” fella, the rule still applies no matter what. If we let you and the other player continue on then everyone else will want to do it and at that point people will just go and try to push it. As for being punishable off mod guidelines, he is right and as for context, if he read “take this L kid” “you're easy get good” “L (horizon dude)” then that is good enough for him to do something about it. As for how people become mod, they apply, get accepted and go through an interview, and finally become Jr Mod if they did good in the interview. After that they do a trial (like I did) and if they are deemed to be good enough/amazing, they get promoted. If they become mod that means they are doing something right even if people do not agree with the way they do it. As for training them, the trial period is basically training and a trial. Also, Jr Mods are taught how to staff before they even begin their trial, which is enough training considering they have a few weeks to get better at it and have access to other staff whenever they need anything.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;  ">@Lokigh - Exactly, I can understand when new players come on and say L, but considering most of the people we punish for it have been on for at least a few months, there is no excuse for them to not have taken the initiative to read the rules or at least have learned them from in game.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);  ">@profbananaslug - (ik you will say something like “what did i tell you, don't talk to me”, idc if i feel like I have to respond I will) He is referring to people arguing with each other in game like “kid L” -&gt; “nah your trash kek, agro kid 4v1” -&gt; “nah you just bad” and so on. </span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);  ">@dev_revs - I also forgot to mention earlier that I wouldn’t let you say random letters in chat because it triggered me is fair IMO.

I had asked everyone in chat to stop with the letters because it was flooding chat with the amount of times everyone was saying it, spammy during certain points, and honestly just stupid to look at in chat, I would turn off chat but I have to read all the false reports that I also saw during those 30 minutes on people reporting for silly reasons. &lt;- that last thing is not part of the rules but the 1st and 2nd are valid from what I saw. Saying that I was triggered was false considering I was only asking that everyone would not flood chat with the letters even if it was a simple letter like “a” and “t” because it caused more players to join in.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); background-color: transparent;  ">@APacketOfChips - FINALLY SOMEONE WITH SENSE!!!!!

As I have stated before you were banned for continuing to keep saying L in chat. Yes I agree that L started off as a joke, but now it has been turned into an insult, which goes against the rule I put in your appeal which stated proper etiquette and behavior on the server. As for being banned off a single letter, I will again state I. DID. NOT…. ban you over a letter, I banned you for the context in which you said it and refusal to follow my directions. As for you saying W when you are on the winning team, you told me you could care less and would say L as you wish and got punished, I would look back and apply that to future situations like this and try to not think “I know I got banned for something like this, but this is different because I am changing the letter so I can’t be banned” and think “Even though I am turning the table here, the context is the same so I shouldn’t do it.” because the punishment will still be the same if all you are worried about is context. As for your reply to Miqah, they had clearly said they didn’t understand the whole story, but I will leave this at that.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">@dev_revs - Your point is invalid when you say “so if a mod tells us to stop playing, we have to stop playing?”. What mod will tell anyone “Hey! YOU! Stop playing right now or ban.”? Also, the listen to mods bs is not bs. On any other server you will listen to a mod so Avicus is not any different. As for getting salty over little things, I suggest you refer to what I have said earlier. Also assuming I did not like you guys saying random letters in chat so I asked you guys to stop is stupid. I would expect someone with a Media Rank would have some decent sense and try to think about the rules. If that comes off as blunt, eh take it as you will. As for him being only a spectator who was dieing does not justify saying L in chat even if he was not killing people. L is not allowed to be said... end of conversation about him being only a spectator because I have already explained it 2 or 3 times already.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">@_Gill - I appreciate you stating your opinion in a mature manner. Like not even to be funny I actually do because now I can actually be more structured. My stance on the rule is this: I do not care if it is a joke, if you are in spec mode, if you don’t care about the rule, or if you think I need context as well as if you think I am unfair when I tell you to be a good sport. I interpret the rules a little more strict than other mods; nothing wrong with that at all to me, but it can be to you. Saying this, I would not take verbal warnings from me or any other staff with a grain of salt or try to go around it with saying anything similar. If I see you being a bad sport I will say something. If I see you in chat and it is hard to tell if you are actually being a bad sport, I ALWAYS… ask other staff and check rules.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">@MLGtino - it isn’t about it being a letter, it is about the </span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-weight: 700;   ">MEANING</span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">. As for stooping to this point, I wouldn’t even have to be making this if players actually listened to staff. As I have said many times before, this rule on bad sportsmanship is not even a new rule and has been around for a long time. Also with the assumption bit, yes it did create a grey area, but it is up to the mods on how they interpret rules. How I look at rules compared to Pokerface is different. As for controversy, really any rule can be controversial if you stretch it a bit.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">@DaGoldBrick - “this is like saying "why do you keep saying hi to players when you were asked to stop?", surely one character L is inferior to 2 characters h and i in the same sentence?”... This point is in no way valid, if anything it is stupid because unless you were spamming or flooding chat with ‘hi’, no staff would ask for you to stop….. ”the fact that I got warned or kicked in the first place (for putting a LETTER in the chat) shows the mod in question is an idiot who doesn't deserve his rank in the first place (although this is being dealt with anyways)”.... Yes the warn to ban reason was about a letter, but the actual reason behind it was from what I saw and what you did. Also calling me an idiot will not advance your case considering it basically diminishes what you were trying to say. Saying that I do not deserve my rank is honestly stupid (sorry not sorry) because clearly, I must be doing something right if I passed my trial. I can understand if you said “He is a bit too strict” and stuff like that but saying something like that is really stupid. If you do not approve of the way I staff, you can report me to a Sr. Mod or Admin and let them talk to me and then you can sit back and wait to let them do all the work. Another option is to read the rules….. “of course I'm going to challenge retarded shit, if left unchallenged that retarded shit will grow to an even more retarded level of 'punishable' offenses given the thickness of some mods on here”..... At this point you are not even challenging anything anymore, you are just looking to say something silly and then have people agree with you. Half the people who agreed with you were not even there, and then those with actual reasonable points I already explained. As for leaving it unchallenged, I can agree with that, even I don’t agree with some rules but you don’t see me complaining. Rules are there for a reason. At this point I am not even going to avoid the fact that I was the one who punished so calling me thickheaded (I can also assume this would be to the mods that cared enough to reply to your thread) does not do anything for you. If anything, we are both thickheaded here because you refuse to listen to a simple rule and I was “too mean” or “too strict” with the way I staff. Again, if you have an issue with the way I staff, report it to Sr. Mods or to Junr (when he isn’t on Overwatch) and have them deal with your report on me, if they tell me I should change something a bit or if I am doing just dandy I will of course change it up a bit but as for now I think I am doing good…../now referring to the ABC’s/: Brick, you are just stretching it at this point and trying to make silly points and reasons. No one but you and maybe some Team Rocket players will ever think of the first 3 letters of the alphabet in that way. If it is not widely seen as a sign of disrespect or bad sportsmanship, then we see no reason to punish for it unless you spammed it in chat.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">@SamuelJacob9 - correct</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">@vladthegreat100 - “3. Notify people that "L" can now be classified as rudeness or that you may not state "L" at all.”.... We have said this many times before and especially in the past few days, as for a grace period of course it will be a thing if this becomes changed…… “1. You pulled a new rule out of your asses without updating it on the Rules Page”...... No we have not. This has been a rule for a long time and if you scroll up, you can see that it is in fact, a rule. The rules in the “Rules” thread do not always blatantly say “Don’t say L, ez, izi, etc” but they are there if you took the time to think. Also, there has been many times that people have been just told that you were not allowed to say L or ez in chat. I remember 6 months ago a staff member telling me that saying those things was not allowed. Saying the rule came out recently is sadly false because even though it is not blatantly written, the rule has always been there. I see that you have already said something along the line of that it should be written blatantly if it is a rule, but at least I try to follow the bloody policies. Also, most/all staff that are in charge of that have much more important things to do than to add a rule that was already under another rule. You are right when you say that we will never please everyone. </span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">@DaGoldBrick - Badlion’s rules do not apply to this, have a problem with it, do the same thing you are doing here and challenge their rules. “Nazi chat rules”.... A bit of a hyperbole but I can see what you mean. “I'm only challenging it after I got banned because I honestly didn't expect to get banned lmao”.... Brick, what did you expect to happen? For me to give you a slap on the wrist and say “Bad Brick!”?. To what Miqah said, you really didn’t think you had it coming? Your ban is legitimate, so what do you mean that I need to be inspected by staff? When you were banned there were 2 other mods on and a Sr. Mod on the discord that I could easily contact so they could have easily stopped me if they thought I should have held back on hitting the enter key. If anything, at this point you should know how the procedure goes for punishments considering on how long you have been playing. Back to with me and my rank, if you have an issue, tell a Sr. Mod instead of now just telling them when you are banned on a forums post after you call the staff team thickheaded and idiots. Speaking of which, an “idiot” would not realise that they should stop continuing after a staff member told them to stop even if it was a joke. By the way, “L” on its own does not make it an obvious joke, so where was the context? Also, coming back after a kick and telling me to hold an L was what moved me to temp-ban.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">@profbananaslug - If I was doing a bad job/ not meeting standards of being staff, my trial would have ended early and you would have seen a “</span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);  ">CerealFirst</span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;  "> </span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;  ">has failed his trial and has been demoted from Jr mod</span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  ">” and a few pretty pictures on the #announcements in Discord. Also, I catch your drift when you called me afk in the head. If anything I am just fine in the head because when I go back and double check all the punishments I given, only 1 punishment was deemed false (it was appealed.

L=lossers.

So that is why, in my opinion, it´s against the rules and must be punishable.

Just me personally but, I don't find L that rude at all. It's more of a "meme" people usually say it as a joke, like Ironically to how some cringey people actually find it cool to say "gang gang L" and stuff.&nbsp;<br><br>Also, being called a loser isn't exactly heartbreaking xd.

As someone else said below this, L is a term that has turned to mean loser, which is considered bad sportsmanship. Bad sportsmanship is already a rule widely accepted (because ez and izi are punishable offenses and people have been punished for this exact reason) which makes the "L" part of that rule automatically

I will say that 1) that punishment was not stretched. The punishment will remain in action until appealed. 2) Yes we may need to change the rules a bit to be more precise but until then the way I interpret the rule will remain the way I do so. I am not gonna change how I moderate just because of one ban and most of the server coming at me for doing my job, 3) lack of training or 'context' does not justify anything, if anything I got a lot of training from staff such as Crazy, Bold, and shadow as well as lion. So saying we need more training is out of the question because new staff have so much access to more experienced staff, 4)Yes there are grey areas in rules, especially in this case, but this does not mean that we still can not punish as we see fit (and reasonable, for those that think i am thirsty for punishments). As for me handling the situation I have been in the past 2 days and weill continue to do so. If anyone has any issues you may PM me on discord about it and we can have a mature and respectful conversation about it<br><br>I completely agree with what LGMATIAS said, and as for prof banana slug, telling me not talk to you and me talking to you is not disrespectful. It is more of I am disregarding it. Tbh I dont even pay attention to you unless you do something in which I do have to say something.

Again, saying every letter of the alphabet can be toxic is pointless. Not a single person looks at the letter A or P and thinks "oh man that is so rude he/she should be punished". As for the meaning of L, telling someone to hold an L is toxic and is mostly accepted to be, saying L after killing someone or dieing is not as toxic but even so, you are not allowed to do it. If you actually listened when I told you to stop saying L this wouldn't happen.<br><br>With your thing on context, I will be blunt. IDGAF.... about context, especially considering you just decided to disobey staff orders. As for "a joke", keep it in PMs or don't say it at all. Again on bad sportsmanship, telling me to hold and L after kicking you is under that so idk what you are on about. Calling me punishment hungry is completely false considering I ask if I think a punishmnet may cause drama... if you took a look at the screenshot I gave you you can see that other staff warranted that ban also. Telling me I have no outside life is not only false, but unreasonable and does move your case forward.<br><br>Again with the jokes, keep it in pms or do not say it at all. Telling everyone that a mod is incapable of reading a situation correctly is kinda dumb because you are basically making this over the punishment I gave you, which tells me that I can't read a situation right. If anything I would call myself a bit strict. Also with the 'bs' on listening to staff, in the rules it blatantly says to listen to staff so I would follow that rule. If a punishment is unreasonable you can appeal it. No one has ever been denied the option to appeal so what makes you an exception? You are also just stretching this when you try to use a historical example and try to relate it to this. WW2 is completely different to a punishment in Minecraft. If you are refering to leaving, you can leave the server and not come back. No one is forcing you to play.

I'm going to try to say this as respectfully and in the nicest way possible.

You say all of this with evidence solely based off&nbsp;<b>your</b> punishment. You need to rethink why you made this post, and maybe try not being so rude. Everything you've said so far has been very rude towards whoever you are talking to, and honestly at this point you're close to a forum punishment.&nbsp;<br><br>As for your "it's a joke" point. Guess what? So can "kys" but that shouldn't be said in general. There's no reason to tell&nbsp;<b><i>ANYONE</i></b> to kill themselves. Whether it's a joke or not, some people legitimately deal with that struggle and it's a <b>real thing</b> that happens. If you're telling your friend, or your friends are telling you to "kys" you should probably rethink your friends. Someone who is telling you to kill yourself is probably not a great person to be around, and honestly just from that simple sentence it can tell you a lot about how much they care about you.&nbsp;<br><br>If a Moderator asks you to stop saying something, that CAN be against the rules, clearly they thought that it was against the rules, so why would you keep saying it? Then after you come on the forums to complain that it was a bad punishment? Maybe you should have taken the obvious sign that Henry wasn't joking and stopped?...&nbsp;<br><br>Plus you tell Lythure that you don't care about his opinion, and that opinions don't matter, yet&nbsp;<b>this entire post is based off an&nbsp;<i>opinion.</i></b><br><br>-I'm done here, but I felt like that was needed.<b></b>

As someone else said below this, L is a term that has turned to mean loser, which is considered bad sportsmanship. Bad sportsmanship is already a rule widely accepted (because ez and izi are punishable offenses and people have been punished for this exact reason) which makes the "L" part of that rule automatically

Ok, get this. I'm not fighting to say it shouldn't be against the rules. I'm not. I've been known to argue to make the chat filter even more strict on Avicus.<br><br>What I'm stating here is that no one was notified from the community in any shape that "L" was now punishable for bad sportsmanship before anybody got punished, this includes verbal warnings. Meaning until stated on the Rules Page or publicly announced, it shouldn't be punished for, and even then, once announced that it goes for bad sportsmanship, its a rule change. And according to the rules, a 1 week grace period should have been given, meaning anyone who was punished *Up to date* for saying "L" or for "Bad Sportsmanship" due to saying L should be fully appealed and have that punishment removed from his/her infractions page.<br><br>You can't fucking expect to add a terminology that is widely used as "Bad Sportsmanship", not notify anyone from the community and then start punishing for it. It totally goes against what your policies in the rules state which you promised, you staff are always told this by the community (Or at least me), yet still continue to pull the exact same mistake.<br>Can we just have our own terminology on Avicus here? Instead of saying "They pulled the same mistake again", can we say "They pulled an Avicus again"? Because this is happening way too often with you people.

<u><b></b></u><b></b>Then dont type it. It is as easy as that. L means loser, there is no context, its an expression.<br>Also Im 18, so dont make that unnecesary comment just because you arent agree with other people opinions.

Wow, you sure don't type like you're 18 XD<br><br>"<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">you arent agree with other people opinions."<br><br>L can mean so much more than just loser, you can't just assume that the person is meaning loser when they say l, so yeah, there is context.<br>And you know, the fact that it's a fucken letter? XD<br><br>and dgb is right, no one gives a fuck what your opinion about what is right and wrong on this server if the rules themselves say otherwise.<br><br>L</span>

Hello, everyone.<br><br>The seniors have spoken about this issue and decided on this issue. This is what will happen.<br>The "L" rule is still under the questioning of the senior team but the miscommunication comes from the fact that no one has updated the community about this. Because of that, there will be a one week grace after the decision is made by the senior staff. At the moment as long as you are not spamming or harassing players by actively hunting them down and saying "L," there should be no issue.&nbsp;<br><br>From the senior staff team, I apologize for our lack of reaction to this issue and should be an opportunity for the senior staff including myself to learn from. Thank you and sorry for the problems created by this.&nbsp;<br>If you want to contact me even further about this issue, please message me on Discord, PieZ#5514
