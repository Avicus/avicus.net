Ok so my mouse broke yesterday and the sensor isn't working, also, I don't think there is any way to open it and fix it as there is no "hole" in any part of the mouse.<br>I tried e-mailing Razer (Because I have a Naga 14) but no answer, still I asked my parents for a new mouse and they gave me a shitty but temporary mouse so..<br><b><i>What mouse do you think is good?</i></b><i></i><br><br><b><i><u>Note!:</u></i></b><i><u></u></i><u></u> I don't jitter-click so don't say (Get the "Example mouse" because it clicks faster), no, I don't need that as jitter-click doesn't help me at all, 8 cps are better.

Don't know how to fix it but here is my opinion on this :) Yes, your mouse is broken, but <br>"<i>I asked my parents for a new mouse and they gave a shitty but temporary mouse"<br></i> Would like to just say that no mouse is shitty (except mouse pads on laptops). But yea, no mouse is shitty as long as you know how to use the mouse to its greatest capabilities :) I use an acer office mouse, and I always get complimented on how amazing my pvp is xD. So until you get your new mouse just get the learn the temporary mouse better, you will see a bigger difference in your pvp when you do.<i><br></i>

No, there are shitty mouses that are made with cheap material and don't work extremely well. The mouse I had before was only capable of making like 2 cps because of the cheap plastic and weird clicking response.

Razer DeathAdder, I got it for 50$ and it was worth it, only problem is that I cant go back to a normal mouse .-.<br><br>And as Pedroh said the Chroma is useless unless you want 10k dpi =P

I strongly recommend this:&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://gaming.logitech.com/en-gb/product/moba-gaming-mouse-g302">http://gaming.logitech.com/en-gb/product/moba-gaming-mouse-g302</a>&nbsp;.&nbsp;<br><ul><li>If you want to have lights, it has fading in and out, blue.</li><li>Programmable buttons (3) 2 on the left side, 1 on top.</li><li>4 modes of sensitivity.</li><li>Springs for fast hitting.</li><li>Easy to hold.</li><li>Perfect shape of buttons.</li></ul>I love this mouse, I use it currently, an upgrade from the standard Mac mouse.<br>If you want the brand like <i>"Beats By Dre"&nbsp;</i>then buy razor, same mice bigger price. That rhymes. Haha! I think. :/<br>I personally don't see any point in Chroma, unless you wan't to waste £/€/$20 on fancy lights. Probably different amounts in different currency. &gt;.&lt;<br>I highly&nbsp;recommend this mouse. ;D<br><br>P.S: Tell me what ya get! :3

This is the mouse I have <a href="http://www.razerzone.com/gaming-mice/razer-naga-epic-chroma" rel="nofollow">http://www.razerzone.com/gaming-mice/razer-naga-epic-chroma</a> .<br><ul><li>19 MMO Optimized programmed buttons</li><li>Wireless gaming-grade technology</li><li>Customizable color options</li><li>Upgrades from the Razer Naga Epic to this</li><li>Tilt Scroll wheel</li><li>Charging dock (charger)</li></ul>I love this mouse, which I use currently. It is alot of money though, which is the bad thing about it. But, it isn't "fucking useless". It upgrades from the Razer Naga Epic with better things, its not just a pretty mouse with flashy lights, its much more.<br><br>Hope this helps!

$100 mouse for $37 and has side macro buttons like &nbsp;the Naga:&nbsp;<br>On amazon<u>.com</u>, search "Redragon Perdition" under Electronics<br><br>Search up "Redragon" on amazon<u>.com</u> and pretty much all their mice are on sale for good prices.&nbsp;<br><br>Or "Redragon Mammoth", $28 from $90&nbsp;<br><br>I have the Deathadder, godly mouse, highly reccomend. Don't spend the money upgrading to Chroma if you're getting it, $30 more for a few colours and higher dpi that you don't need in the first place. So basically $30 more for colours.

I have the Razer DeathAdder Chroma, and I strongly recommend you to buy it because it's good for gaming, you can set your DPI up go 10000 :o, it's switching colors (cool xD), good for aim and clicking.
