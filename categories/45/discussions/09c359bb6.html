Hello people of Avicus! I'm going to quit this server since I'm perm-banned and just wanted to say goodbye. It's been a good 4 months. LOL. Most people probably don't know me but eh. I'll someday meet someone of y'all on different servers in the future. Most people don't even talk to me anymore. :/ And I know you can't, but if a mod could really give my rank to someone, I would appreciate it because it's a waste of 50 dollars. Have a good life, peace!

You've only been on for a month, and you have got as many infractions as that??? I don't feel much emotion because of this, but try to appeal if you really liked this server from the month you've been here.<br><br>P.S: I've been banned for Killaura, and because I appealed, staff noticed it was a mistake. So you still have a chance buddy ;)
