Hey, as some of you may know, I'm really into computer hardware and building computers. A couple of weeks ago, I was cleaning my room and I found my 10-year old HP Pavilion. I was going to throw it away but I decided to upgrade it a little bit with a few used parts from eBay. At this point, almost anything was considered an upgrade to this 10-year old dinosaur. I already have a gaming computer that I built about 3 months ago but this was just a fun project I wanted to do.<br><br>I got everything used from eBay except the power supply and the graphics card. I bought the power supply on Amazon, I didn't want to cheap out on the most important component. I bought the graphics card (NVIDIA Geforce GT 620) during the EVGA Memorial Weekend Sale (only thing I bought on sale). I found an Intel processor on ebay as well as a decent Gygabite motherboard to go along with it. Everything else was basic stuff such as CPU cooler, thermal paste and some adapters (the hard drive and DVD drives were so old that the new motherboard didn't support them without adapters). The only parts I kept from the original build are the case, keyboard, monitor,DVD/CD drives and a 40 GB (Yes 40 GB) hard drive. I used my old Razer Abyssus gaming mouse.<br><br>As far as actual building goes, I had to replace the I/O shield so it would fit the new motherboard and I had a bit of trouble taking the old one off, it was well secured so I had to use a couple of flat-head screwdrivers. When I was ready to install Windows, the computer kept shutting off and I didn't know why. I saw that the CPU temperatures were reaching 100<span style="color: rgb(84, 84, 84); font-family: arial, sans-serif;  ">°C (not good at all).</span>&nbsp;I checked the CPU cooler and it wasn't secured well. I spent a good 30 minutes trying to install it correctly. After that, I managed to install Windows 8.1 and properly set up the PC.<br><br>The parts list is the following (all prices in USD, including shipping):<br>Power supply (EVGA 430 Watt 80+): <b>$37.88</b> Amazon<br>Thermal paste: <b>$2.77</b> eBay<br>IDE to SATA Adapter: <b>$4.59</b> eBay<br>Motherboard (Gygabite G41): <b>$21.45</b> eBay<br>CPU (Intel Core 2 Duo E8400): <b>$7.95</b> eBay<br>Heatsink/Fan: <b>$5.46</b> eBay<br>RAM (2x1GB Crucial DDR2-800): <b>$12.18&nbsp;</b>eBay<br>Graphics card (GT 620): <b>$24.99&nbsp;</b>EVGA<br><br>Total: <b>$117.27<br></b><br>As far as performance goes, I'm very pleased. I am quite surprised and could not ask for more. So far I've only tested Minecraft and here are the results:<br><br><img src="http://i.gyazo.com/2cdad496ca4fa37459b7f0faa95f4b99.png" title="Image: http://i.gyazo.com/2cdad496ca4fa37459b7f0faa95f4b99.png"><br><img src="http://i.gyazo.com/1e191a9e5808a7f52dc47ac63c38c988.png" title="Image: http://i.gyazo.com/1e191a9e5808a7f52dc47ac63c38c988.png"><br><br>Yup, up to 150 FPS, although it's mostly around 60-70 FPS, rarely dipping below. I don't know if Optifine boosts my FPS or not but I don't play Minecraft without it, I can't play without zoom. I'm using a 1024 x 768 resolution monitor. I am quite happy with the results, very high frame rate considering it's a $30 CPU+GPU combo.<br><br>Let me know what you guys think, also, I'm here to help with anything related to hardware and building PCs.

eBay. There are a lot of old CPUs for less than $20 that still perform well. The GPU was on sale on EVGA's website during Memorial weekend :P

He's been helping me as well. 5 star rating on help. In fact, I'm going to end up spending about the same amount as him and not to one-up him but, it might be a bit faster.

That is one beast PC for the price, buying second hand is definitely the way to go with lower budgets.
