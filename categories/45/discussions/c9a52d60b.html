Ok, so here i go. When you join a game of dtm, mix, etc., the blocks cold be in slot nine in one map, and slot 7 in another.this makes gameplay more boring because people take like 5 mins organizing their inventory just to be killed within the minute. A LOT of people get annoyed having to REORGANIZE their inventory every single map. SO, what if the map making people make it so that the inventory is the same for all games. Example(just an idea)<br>SLOT:<br>1 sword<br>2 bow<br>3 pickaxe<br>4 gap<br>5 raw wood<br>6 glass<br>7 regular food<br>8 whatever<br>9 whatever<br>&nbsp;<br>There could also be an option to customize your inventor<br><br>Thanks,&nbsp;<br><br>UrpleGlurp and rat<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>&nbsp;egitserp kcab gnirb

Customising your hotbar would be best for everyone, considering everyone has different tastes.

One issue is that different maps give different items, and they would not correspond. There are no plans to standardize spawn kits, so the situation isn't moving in favor of this suggestion.

I think that we should be able to choose our own inventory setup in-game. For example every Destroy map has a sword, a pickaxe &amp; a bow. We will also get food, golden apples and blocks. If we could choose which order we'd want to have them in i think it'd be a lot easier.

I would suggest a system in which each item get's labelled with a tag , eg....<br>Food<br>Blocks_wood<br>Blocks_glass<br>sword<br>pick&nbsp;<br>etc<br>etc<br><br>Then from there you could set your preference in a sorta lobby like you can with badlion kits; it would then auto load that each map.<br><br>But i don't think devs need anything else to worry about so let's all just pretend i never suggested this and all go about their usual day.

Or Maybe before every game, there is a menu where you can rearrange your hotbar for&nbsp;<i>that game</i>.<br>so every time you respawn, you can have a set hotbar so gameplay is quicker and more tolerable.<br>OR<br>say you die with your hotbar like this<br>sword<br>bow<br>pick<br>gap<br>block<br>block<br><br>So, maybe instead of the idea above, all the items you had when you died got replenished but in the same place as they were the game before

Let's start with the basics: adding axes to maps where wood is the primary block. Don't tell me to craft axes myself, when I make armour I usually craft buckets with the 3 remaining ingots, and I don't want to waste an iron block just to make an axe.

Why not just have some kind of system that allows each individual to customize their own loadout and when a map loads the server would read their custom loadout and assign a hotbar based on their preference? Kinda like how on pot servers you can customize your hotbar pre game.&nbsp;<br><br>I do agree though, it is very annoying. I don't think it would be wise though to adopt one universal hotbar, it just would annoy people even more since everyone is different.

Ye, I thought the same. Should be a system like badlion has, or something like that you'd make your hotbar like you want it, and then you do /save and it would stay like that until you change it

This was suggested before but someone shot it down because it would apparently take too much resources to remember each users custom hotbars for every map.&nbsp;<br><br>I think we could probably find a workaround, with some of the ideas in this thread.
