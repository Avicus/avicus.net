I'm just fucking done with the staff team. When players complain on the forums that the staff team is inactive, the only responses we get is:<br><br>-"Staff members have lives too!"<br>-"You can record hackers and report them online!"<br>-"Qualitative staff is much more important than active staff."<br>-"You can ping the mods on slack!"<br>-"#StaffLivesMatter" (okay, that one not.)<br>-etc<br><br>It's just a fucking disgrace to this server that the staff team literally doesn't care about the community which is acutally&nbsp;<b><i><u>PLAYING ON THE SERVER</u></i></b>&nbsp;(I'm not saying each staff member, just the staff team generally.) I come on the server and want to play. 5 seconds after joining some random kid tps to me with InfiniteReach hacks and kills me. I check /staff - None online. What did I expect?&nbsp;What really bothers me is that this happened now 4 out of 5 times in the past at&nbsp;<b>different times of the day</b>.<br><br>There are people like <img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/afc67e5d2a82a5f416a6211a43f19ce4?s=20&amp;default=mm" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/Jahaj.html" style="color: none">Jahaj</a> who played 2 hours the past month and idk... 20 hours the past 6 months? and <img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d2124417da55a6c5feacfe0c5b4b9bc0?s=20&amp;default=mm" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/PokerFace.html" style="color: Gray">PokerFace</a> who played 6 hours the past month. <img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/208c84af790a41dabf7eeb184f17bdf8?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/Elly.html" style="color: none">Elly</a> didn't do shit for months or years. <img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/701196d59e574bc9c19b7f63e1fbfaef?s=20&amp;default=mm" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/Arigenn.html" style="color: none">Arigenn</a> who should not be demoted because he's inactive as fuck, but for not giving a shit about his own community and for being a fucking troll for not temp-retiring or completely retiring. And then the best: THE ADMINS AND SENIOR MODS WHO DONT CARE ABOUT THESE THINGS OR WHO DONT DO ANYTHING. Whenever someone asks when Arigenn gets demoted, the staff answers: "We are about to demote him, we just have to follow our policies and SHIT." WELL WHO GIVES A FUCK ABOUT POLICIES WHEN THE 99% OF THE COMMUNITY AND 99% OF THE STAFF TEAM WANTS HIM DEMOTED?&nbsp;<br><br><br>What I would love the staff to do: Change their stupid polices that everyone can be demoted WITHOUT a warning and that QUALITY ISN'T MORE IMPORTANT THAN ACTIVITY and FUCKING OPEN YOUR STAFF APPLICATIONS AND ACCEPT MORE THAN JUST 6 PLAYERS OMFG.<br><br>GREETINGS&nbsp;<br>Moonman

keep in mind we dont have access to LOA's. Half the staff can be on leave (it was like that when I was mod, 10+ mods were always on LOA). Also, Elly has been developer for no where near a year, however I agree he hasn't done anything.

If you want to actually achieve anything with this post you should probably get rid of it all and rewrite it because they arent going to listen to you if you insult them, swear in every other sentence and tag mods who are inactive. Just saying..

Demotions don't help the matter, especially with the case of moderators.

So you would rather have more staff on, but more people get false banned, and have the staff team be a bunch of dicks? And, demoting mods is supposed to help? even if they only come on once a week, thats once more a week than you would have if you demoted them, so as long as they are helping the server out, i don't see the problem? and all the solutions that you mocked in the OP are actually what you are supposed to do, and it would help out more to do those than to complain about them. either offer a good solution or just stop.

LOA can only be up 3 weeks or you have to take a temp retirement. You have to ask the Mentors about iAbusing.

Pretty upsetting considering the amount of work the 2013-2014 team put into having clearly defined values and motives for the daily running of the server/community.

If this is so annoying then gives ideas to fix it. I'm not even going to fight this again... There's been so many posts like this and with all of them I've seen, what, two(?) good ideas that are actually logical and helpful? Instead of making complaints give an idea to fix it... A whole new post on this topic is the most unhelpful and pointless thing you could have done at this point... Like honestly if you're not going to give a new idea then why are you even ranting?
