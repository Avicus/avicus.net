Before you say "oh leaving posts aren't allowed" I think I deserve this since I've been here since 2012. I'm leaving for a number of reasons I do not care to talk about out. I just want to say thanks to everyone here, especially kiwi, Sem,Ingigo,rot43 and many others who have been here with me on this amazing journey. It is sad that I won't see the year anniversary of avicus. That's all I really have too say. And before you ask yes my mojang account is gone so no one gets an alt :p

I don't want to be a buzzkill or anything but these posts are getting really spammy and they are hurting our reputation.<br><br>If new players come on forums and notice the number of these posts, they will turn away. Please, stop.

It's fine if it's a meaningful leaving post meaning that you won't just come back after a week, you're really leaving. But cya man, I still remember some times with you in control the hill.
