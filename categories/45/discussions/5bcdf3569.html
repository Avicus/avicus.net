Well I am not going to make a huge essay to such a thing cause I am way to tired, but I want to say, I am leaving, permanently :D Last week on Avicus and MC :)<br><br>For those who like me: I am sorry, i understand how you guys feel, but there is going to be a time when you guys are going to quit minecraft too and your friends are going to feel the same, its part of the cycle :)<br><br>For those who don't like me: Well not much to say ;P Hope you guys the best and sorry for whatever I have done :P<br><br>I am not giving my account... and YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN THE BEST COMMUNITY FROM THE START. I'LL MISS YOU GUYS A LOT, YOU GUYS HELPED ME COPE MY STRESS AND WELL NOW IT'S TIME, I need to start my serious practice of my music if I really want to be what I want to be ;) Next week finals exams start, and when summer comes, it's all about guitar and music not about computer, sorry guys but it is just not happening. And I have a puppy to take care of and socialize with my friends, so in the end MC may be a stress reliever but there are other things better and healthier... so if you see me this week, I wouldn't bother a Hi from you ;P<br><br>You guys have been really been the best community and well now I am crying and it still isn't the end of the week xD It's sad but we all have to move on to their dreams!

God dang, I really wanted to be your friend ever since you quit being a mod... You're just such a kind person and although we never knew eachother, I really liked you.. I felt like I didn't want to be friends while you were a mod because I didn't want to look like one of those shallow suck-ups who just do that for power.. ):<br>Just let me tell 'ya: have tons of fun in-real-life, continue treating people so kindly, and have the best life you can-- you deserve it. (:
