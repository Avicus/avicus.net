Earlier I was visiting this petshop called petco.<br><br>All of a sudden, when I'm visiting the back shelf of thepet store I see this.<br><img alt="" src="http://i60.tinypic.com/2rygh8m.jpg"><br>Then, in my mind I start raging,<br>"I HATE ANIMAL ABUSE!"<br>"AHHH I'M GONNA RAGE, SCREW PETCO, THEY DON'T GIVE A CRAP ABOUT THEIR ANIMALS"<br>It's very sadistic, it makes us, animal lovers look bad.<br>I found out, that's what happens in the back of every pet store.&nbsp;<br>Poor snake, he shall RIP.<br>Personally I prefer private breeders.<br>Now, compare that, with a picture of my happy snake.<br><br><img alt="" src="http://i58.tinypic.com/33xjalu.jpg">I definetly would prefer that ^ Rather than dead snakes all over the floor.<br>Seriously, STOP ANIMAL ABUSE.<br>I know, earlier my gecko died of cancer.<br>Yes, he died. But I did not kill him, there was nothing I could do to save him. This however, can be prevented. If people actually started caring about animals.<br><br>#StopAnimalAbuse<br>Seriously, use that hashtag to spread the word.<br><br><br>"When someone abuses a dog, they are arrested for animal cruelty, when someone chops off a snakes head, they are seen as a hero." -26763

Well, they didn't care for the snake, they probably forgot to give water to him, he then died of thirst. Basically it's still the petshops fault it died. It was definetly not a temp-place, it still had the price tag, and description.<br><br>Funny thing is' the description said, "Alive and healthy 9/10"

One time I saw something on iFunny (I&nbsp;don't know why the heck it was there but it was...) about how people would beat up and kill tons of dogs untill someone would pay them hundreds of money to stop (except by then they would be as good as dead, and then like a month later they would beat them again for more money) and then they would start beating up the person who paid untill they died. Plus they would do it out on the street so everyone had to watch it... Freaking faith in humanity = lost

:DDD<br><br>Zinteka, its called the love of reptiles, reptiles can be domesticated.<br><br>I agree to what you're saying but I also disagree. I think the "Snakes" you're thinking about are HUGE pythons or venomous cobras and rattlesnakes and stuff. What I'm talking about here is a small python. Considered royal in egypt, and some parts of africa.&nbsp;<i>python regius&nbsp;</i>is the name, it is also know as the ball python, search it up, reasearch. Don't just say "Snakes are dangerous, blahblahblah"<br><br>...<br><br>.-.

Reptiles are awesome, animals are awesome. I don't know why anyone would torture an animal to it's deaths. I saw an abused wolf hybrid (which are illegal to own here) that could barely stand, being taken away from a man who was killing fish by making them stay out of water, or poisened water, hitting dogs until the couldn't walk, and kicking cats. :( All animals had to be euthanized, because they couldn't live anymore.

PokerFace_Legend, there wouldn't be any dogs or cats if humans didn't mess with the animals. Dogs and cats are domesticated, and were bred. Also if eating cows/pigs/chickens etc... is right, then eating cats and dogs, is not any different. I don't think any of them make any sense to be eaten.

Actually, people used to do that, especially in Mexico and Asia.<br>Heck, when my dad was visiting India, he would eat anything, so he joked around about eating monkeys too. People do that too. Honestly, it's human nature to try and eat what you can, one way or the other. But dogs were more useful in hunting, so they stopped eating them. Cats are good for keeping out pets, so people stop eating them. Of course, some people didn't have cows or other animals as readily available or as cheaply available, so they went with other forms, such as dog, cats, and bugs.<br>We raise a bunch of chickens at home, and goats and a cow, and while i enjoy having them around as pets there's really no other way to get eggs or milk, and we shouldn't have to buy goat meat when it's easier just to raise our own. So while i do love them, I would kill them and eat them if it means eating another day.<br>EDIT: by home i mean my uncle's home, where my dad's grew up. OFC i live in the city now X3

PokerFace_Legend, you need to think before posting, cats and dogs origionaly lived in the wild, they were domesticated. Domesticated means to change a plant or animal in a way to effect how they taste (plants) or how dogs and cats don't run from us when we go near. Or how they look or act. &nbsp;They can find their own food. lol.

I put ..... because that was a very simple and not thought out question.&nbsp;<br><br>Before dogs were dogs, they were wolves, foxes, etc. The Canines.<br><br>And before cats were cats, they were lynxes, lions, leopards, cheetahs, etc. The Felines.<br><br>It was through human intervention that these animals "evolved" into weaker and more passive evolutions because they didn't need to work so hard anymore.<br><br>If they were to be released back into the wild, they would be doing as their ancestors have been doing for thousands of years.&nbsp;<br><br>Please think before you post your question.

Cows, pigs, chickens are bred and slaughtered because of their meat quality (I think so, anyways.)&nbsp;<br>It is human nature to eat meat, because that's how we are, although we can live a mostly vegetarian life, and living vegetarian would mean less starvation because you need to raise the animal that eats 10 times more plants than the food if produces.&nbsp;<br>And in the American/Canadian area, more than 50% of our cows in stuff live in really bad areas.

Still animal abuse.<br>Hell, I'd fire my workers if they killed an animal, any animal. Not take it out of their pay.

First off, When getting meat from animals... its not abuse... Its what they are made for (cows, buffalo, chicken etc) Soo... but some animals like dogs are non meaty.. so if they get killed thats abuse :(

Vsplesk, thats completely hypocritical. Cows, buffalo, chicken etc... were NOT made to be eaten. Are you kidding me? People just decided to kill them and eat them. They aren't healthy to eat mostly, and just cause more death of animals/humans and pollute the land.

They are not "made" to be eaten...but humans seem to be able to digest them fine. People ate what they can when they could at first. Now we just eat crap all day everyday.

Dear lawd it was sarcasm.<br>Plus it shoulda been brought up already, considering Adam/Eve ate fruit, then when Noah saved all the animals God gave them to him as food, then in Christianity Jesus/God said that any meat can be eaten, etc.
