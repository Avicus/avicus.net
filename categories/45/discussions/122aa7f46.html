Happy New Year Avicus! 2014 has been an awesome year. From building maps on build servers to chatting via Skype,&nbsp; It is amazing working with such nice, kind, and overall amazing individuals. 2014 has had many positive memories and I wish for 2015 to have many more.

2014 was a very rough year for most of us, I'm sure. Enjoyment, hate, disappointments, happiness and sadness... Oh boy what a year it has been.&nbsp;<br><br>So what will you guys expect in 2015? More staff (development and moderator team), new features (a lot of updates). I will surely be focusing on improving the current state of the staff team. Over the new years break, I've been reflecting my work as an Admin and I came to a realisation that I've left and created holes within the staff team. All I will say for now is... Expect changes!<br><br>On behalf of the Administrator team, we wish everyone a safe and happy new year!

Good riddance... Hopefully 2015 treats everyone better than 2014 did! 2014 included some really terrible events... &nbsp;The 3 planes that crashed/vanished, the death of Robin Williams, the school shooting in Pakistan that killed 132 children, the rise of IS, etc... However, we also gained some interesting knowledge! As in the Rosetta Probe, and the gruesome US torture methods. <br><br><b>Heres to a better 2015!</b>
