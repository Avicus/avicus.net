Ever since that last thread I made I still havent heard from avicus about my ban appeal this is outragous that they take this long to answer a ban appeal thats if they ever answer my appeal this is one of the things that I dislike about avicus well.... hope someone answers my appeal (if they ever do) &nbsp;:/

Dont get what you're talking about, you say this is 'one' of the things you dislike.<br>What else do you dislike? the rules? because it seems you havent followed many of them.<br>I suggest you contact one of the managers or directors through skype. That way you can get a quicker answer. If not, you will have to wait it out.

If this is "one of the things" you dislike about Avicus then you can leave and go on another server.<br><br>If you've made 2 threads and an appeal for your ban then doesn't that say something about you? (Not the Avicus staff)<br><br>As stated above, resend your appeal or contact staff directly.

Many people have pros and cons about the server if someone doesn't like something about a server (avicus) you don't tell them to leave also why do you have to care if I made two threads about my ban appeal, it doesn't matter to you i know i made two threads about my ban appeal but they were almost a month apart its not like i made those two threads in the same week or something like that
