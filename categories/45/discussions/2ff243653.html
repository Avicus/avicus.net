I don't really get the point of some of the leaving threads. Most of them I've read are "I don't like this update, goodbye."&nbsp;<br>I can guess that those sort of threads are created by people who are going to come back.<br><br>On a total other side note, am I the only one that feels that leaving posts serve no purpose? If you were actually going to leave, why make a thread that just creates attention towards yourself?
