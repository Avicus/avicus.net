<a rel="nofollow" href="http://onlinesequencer.net">http://onlinesequencer.net</a><br><br>It's a little tool online to create your own music. I would like to see how creative the community is and what they can make. You can also add ?synth to the end of the URL to make it chiptune and you can also convert them to MIDI. Really fun and useful, post your creations below. :)<br><br>I'm the most proud of&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://onlinesequencer.net/34365?synth">http://onlinesequencer.net/34365?synth</a>

I know a program that is similar to this one, which is called Synthesia.&nbsp;<br><br>I'll definitely be giving this a try later!

How do you do offensive sequences? I think it's only music and so on .-.

Probably by spelling out profane words with the different pitches. Seeing as the interface is a grid, that'd be extremely easy to do, lol. That reminds me of the composer Shostakovich, who wrote a whole symphony for Joseph Stalin (by request).
