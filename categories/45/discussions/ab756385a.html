OK, so basically when most people shoot, the arrow goes straight, making it easier to bow. However, when I shoot it dips down. Any help?

Wait, what? All arrows dip down unless you have a mod or something that prevents that xD &nbsp;You just have to get the feel for the arrow and where it'll go. Like, trigonometry :3

If u compared mine and mc black snipers arrows, you'll see a difference.

Did you make this observation through watching other's videos?<br>If so, check your FOV settings (go to options and it'll be the upper left option.) If it's low, that may be why you think it "dips down" so much. Try raising it higher.<br>And if that doesn't help, just aim higher :P

Yes, Cinnamon may be correct. Wait, or would having high FOV make it seem like it curves more because there's more of a sensitive warp with your vision? I play at 87, so I don't have any idea. Also, may we see a video MCBlackSniper's arrows? That might help a little :3<br>Also, the arrow curves more if you don't hold down the shooting button very much. If you hold it down for .5 seconds, you'll make a weak shot that curves. It also appears to curve more drastically when making far shots. If I'm correct, the ratio of movement to curvature is about the same, except since it's on a bigger scale, it's more noticeable. Due to this, when you shoot someone near you, the arrow doesn't curve much because it's not traveling a long distance.
