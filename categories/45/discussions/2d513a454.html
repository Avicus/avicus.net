I say it's abusing glitches, which is not allowed. You have a glitch, and refuse to get rid of it. You are abusing it. End of story.

You don't know if you're invis, someone will have to say so but as it's not a rule at the moment, you can't do anything about it :´)

No, not <i><b>he</b></i> has the glitch, <i><b>Avicus</b></i> has the glitch. He should not be banned if he would abuse it, because it's <b>not his fault</b>. He <b>didn't do anything</b> wrong. But when you know you have to glitch, and you don't want to relog, then I'm pretty sure a Mod will kick you the first time for (Removing Glitch - Not an infraction).
