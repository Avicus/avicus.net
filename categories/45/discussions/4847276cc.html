I'm having some issues with images showing up on my profile. I believe I'm suing the right HTML coding (&lt;img src="insert.real.ip"&gt;) (without the brackets of course). One pic is showing but the rest aren't.<br><br>I need some help with this, thanks.

I forgot to blur out. But lots of other players have them up. Princezz_Dubstep also has hackusations on her profile, but does that make her immature? No, it doesn't. Honestly, that was kinda low tbh. Does it change me as a person? No it doesn't. I can take them down for now and thanks for reminding me but did you really have to make it that? Also it sounds like you're trying to act like your better than me tbh when you say that. If I'm immature, then you're disrespectful by adding a rude part like that.

I blurred mine out so their names aren't showing. Even if they reported.<br><br>As long as you have their names blurred out, or they are okay with you having them up there, it should be fine to have :)

What you said basically implies I'm immature. The comment sounded like you put yourself higher than others. "Your display of hackusations towards you is quite immature.". Yeah, that's kinda calling me immature you making yourself sound like and adult and me a little kid. That does make you sound better than me, no? Don't scold me like I'm two. It sounds overbearing and to be blunt, douchey. If you didn't mean so, then maybe next time&nbsp;check&nbsp;your wording before possibly offending someone. Call me what you want, but I'm looking out for the people who care more about what other people say.

As stated before, I have never placed myself above anyone else and never will.<br><br>Posting hackusations on your profile without blurring the names is quite immature because you are publicly shaming others without their permission so you can feel good about yourself.<br><br>Correct me if I'm wrong, but by doing this <b>you</b> are placing yourself above others.<br>Which is the one thing you are accusing me of doing.<br><br>As stated before, I am not calling you immature. I am saying that your display of hackusations is immature.<br><br>I did not call you as a person immature.<br>I called your act of publicising hackusations on your profile immature.<br><br>When it comes to the rules, I am assertive when I call out people that breach them.<br><br>It is <i>not</i> a personal attack on you, rather, a reminder that something you are doing may cause you to obtain an infraction which <i>I do not want to see.</i><br><br>I am not scolding you.&nbsp;<br>I am trying to prevent you getting an infraction from something you may not have known you were doing wrong.<br><br>I am <b>not</b> trying to be mean to you. <br>I am trying to help you.

This topic is spiraling out of control.<br>Due to the fact that the question has already been answered and this has turned to nothing but a flame war, I am locking this. &nbsp;Please discuss this somewhere else.<br><br><b>Locking...</b>
