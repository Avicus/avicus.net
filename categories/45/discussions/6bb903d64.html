Eminem is one of the best rappers in my opinion. His songs have so much meaning behind them. Actually, his song 'Headlights' made me teary. ..

Jozz Eminem is my favourite too :)<br>So many of his songs have passion and meaning!<br>Btw my favourite part of headlights would be:<br><br>"But, Ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan, yo<br>All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both<br>Foster care, that cross you bear, few may be as heavy as yours<br>But I love you, Debbie Mathers, oh, what a tangled web we have,<br>'cause one thing I never asked was<br>Where the fuck my deadbeat dad was<br>Fuck it, I guess he had trouble keeping up with every address<br>But I'd have flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus<br>Own a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas<br>Someone ever moved them from me? That you coulda bet your asses<br>If I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa, kidnap them<br>And although one has only met their grandma once<br>You pulled up in our drive one night as we were leaving to get some hamburgers<br>Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you<br>And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness come over me<br>As we pulled off to go our separate paths,<br>And I saw your headlights as I looked back<br>And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to thank you for being my Mom and my Dad<br>So, Mom, please accept this as a tribute I wrote this on the jet<br>I guess I had to get this off my chest,<br>I hope I get the chance to lay it before I'm dead<br>The stewardess said to fasten my seatbelt, I guess we're crashing<br>So if I'm not dreaming, I hope you get this message that I'll always love you from afar<br>'Cause you're my Ma
