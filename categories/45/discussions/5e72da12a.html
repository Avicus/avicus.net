Hey,<br><br>Seuth here, and I came to announce that I'm leaving Avicus for a short while, let me give you guys a brief explanation.<br><br><br>So, yesterday, my girlfriend broke (or almost broke) her hip during track, and this affected me and my life greatly, I have gone into somewhat of a depression, and wasn't very social or interactive for the rest of the day, she is currently in the hospital, and got x-rays yesterday. I can't eat, sleep, or do anything with the thought of her in the hospital. This made me decide to leave Avicus for a little and take care of her in the hospital until she's better. Yesterday I was talking to Keller and he said, "A girlfriend is better than MC", and this made me decide to leave, and I'll be sure to catch up with you guys when I'm back. I expect to be gone bo longer than 4 weeks, I just want to assure myself that she is okay and I'll return.<br><br>Cyas later

Hey,<br><br>It's unfortunate these events have happened, however these type of posts are not allowed on the forums (personal updates). If you wish to keep contact with your friends to tell them you will be inactive, use other social media platforms and keep mind of rule D7.
