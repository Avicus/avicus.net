First off, I know that 99% of the people reading this, especially the mods, won't give a shit about this post, but thats not the point.&nbsp;<br><br>I just wanted to make a goodbye post, and before people call me a baby for leaving after being demoted, be quiet.<br><br>I was demoted earlier today &nbsp;(being too strict), and of course, I got mad. I realized how silly I have been, my entire life, getting mad at a video game. That's kinda sad. It made me realize what humanity has come too.<br><br>I also realized that I take this way to seriously. I realized that this is a VIDEO GAME. None of this shit is going to matter in two years, life will move on. This will all be forgotten.<br><br>If this server still exist in a year or two, I might come back just for the laughs.<br><br>Thanks to my "mentors".<br><br>AwarriorVenom &lt;3<br><br>Koodalord &lt;3<br><br>Herobrine683752 &lt;3 &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>SomeonedoesMC &lt;3<br><br>JUBBINATOR &lt;3<br><br>calwhovian &lt;3<br><br>steven5703 &lt;3<br><br>and finally IvyCode &lt;3<br><br>It's been real guys. Keep it real.<br>&nbsp;<br>It is so hard to leave—until you leave. And then it is the easiest goddamned thing in the world.&nbsp;And I realized that there's a big difference between deciding to leave and knowing where to go.

Eventually, it won't matter, and whatever remains of video games will move on. &nbsp;<br><br>What's wrong with taking it seriously? It's a video game? So what?
