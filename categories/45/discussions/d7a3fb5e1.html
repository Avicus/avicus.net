So yea guys, seems like I have to leave because of the amount of hate I get when playing and due to the fact that I got banned. Lucky I got my prestige before leaving but for my 10000 kill, hmmm maybe when they unban me after millions of appeals I make. So peace out guys.

I have played with nerfgun2002 and he hasnt hacked once. Why cant you guys accept that there are some people that are better than you at pvp. In fact I know someone who can take nerfgun out easily. I think you guys just banned him because the people you never heard of before seem to be the hackers. Plus, there is no proof against him besides mere witnesses. What ever happened to "Innocent until proven guilty"

"he hasnt hacked once" If he had, he would have been banned then. There's always a first time, and that first time is hopefully their last time. "there is no proof against him besides mere witnesses" Isn't that the case with every banned player? What other proof is possible besides "mere witnesses"?

Avicus is NOT a community that falsely bans people,all the mods are fair,and if a mod is unexperienced with hackers,they would probably be delt with.Of course,there are some exceptions...

As I said, nerfgun was one of my friends, I couldn't believe he was hacking, so me and Ronloyd reported him,vans he got banned, he was good at PvP but chose to hack, don't blame the staff, if they see hacker they do their job and punishing him.

:/ That is highly inaccurate. Staff can tell the difference between skill and modifications, most of the time. There's always a first time for everything: nerfgun could've been legit before, but there's nothing stopping him from starting to use modifications. There isn't a jury. The moderator is the judge, and he/she decides whether or not he/she hacks, by him/herself, or with another/other mod/mods. Hackers are innocent until proven guilty, until a moderator proves him/her guilty in their eyes, and then they are banned. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of making such a flameful post, you can just keep silent while you silently urge nerf to appeal. ^-^

No. He was hacking. Do you seriously doubt that mods know what hacks are? A "good pvper" will never get banned for hacks. Unless you are dgb and ACT purposly as if you look like your hacking
