Hey guys!<br><br>Just yesterday, my trial version of Camtasia Studio ran out, and it was the only screen recorder I had that recorded both sound from the game I was running and my internal speakers. Does anyone know a good screen recorder like Camtasia that runs on Mac?<br><br>I'd go ahead and download a crack, but, people that know me understand that I very rarely click on links I know well.<br><br>So, thanks in advance!

Would you be willing to pay money for one or just a free downloadable one?

Since I'm a scab, I'd prefer a free one, or a cracked version of a paid one.<br><br>The cracked version would be my last resort, however :)

Doesn't the MAC come with one already? I believe it's called Quicktime or something.

Since I'm more of a scrub than most of you, I just use QuickTime ^ Just easy and simple. Might not have the highest resolution, but it's fine by me.

I recommend screenflow. I can give you a cracked version of skype if you want.&nbsp;<br>Quicktime for mac doesn't drop your FPS that much but the quality is generally shit.&nbsp;<br>Plus with screenflow you can do basic editing. Although with movie editing if you really want to go all out I recommend Sony vegas pro (but that's complicated asf)

Like what&nbsp;<b>Sho&nbsp;</b>said,&nbsp;<i>Screenflow&nbsp;</i>would be a good recording system for&nbsp;<i>Mac</i>.<br><br>Sorry, I'm using Windows, thus I don't know much :P

Personally, I use a potato adapter.<br><br>Basically, you can buy a potato adapter here: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/ID=PotAtoAd4pt3r!?/buy" title="Link: http://www.amazon.com/ID=PotAtoAd4pt3r!?/buy">www.amazon.com/ID=PotAtoAd4pt3r!?/buy</a>.<br>Once you have that, buy a sack of potatoes (Around $5-10) and plug in ONE potato.<br>You'll need 2USB's, 1 for getting data to the potato, one to export from the potato.&nbsp;<br>Alright, done that, here's some "benchmarks".<br>&nbsp;<br>30 FPS usual = 0 FPS<br>60 FPS usual = 0 FPS<br>120 FPS Usual = 4 FPS<br>400-100 FPS Usual = 50 FPS<br>Recording has never been easier, Carrots being developed as we speak.

With the potato adapter, I have 1440p videos (all at 60fps)<br>and with my GTX 980 I drop from 800 to 40-50 fps :)<br><br>And since the potato has an "auto-compress" feature, with 10 seconds of footage (2GB) can be easily converted to 1955 MB ;)
