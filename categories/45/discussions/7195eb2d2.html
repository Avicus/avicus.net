<div>Hello everyone! Today, Patchi have decided to open a SMP server, we wanted a few more players to come on and join us. We have limited slots, and we are accepting around 10 people (exceptions can be made). We have some ground rules:</div><div>Griefing will result in an obvious ban on all Patchi services (including TS).</div><div>Be nice! We want to build a nice community&nbsp;</div><div>Hacking will result in in a ban on all Patchi services.</div><div>And enjoy yourself!&nbsp;</div><div>If you’d like to join, please fill this application:</div><div>Age:</div><div>Skype:</div><div>Why you would like to join:</div><div><br></div><div>Thank you,</div><div>Patchi.</div>

In fact, the first server I regularly played on was an SMP server. It'd be pretty cool to play with other Avicus players, not to mention you don't want to miss my house-building skills :P<br><br>It'd be fun to have something else to get away from the repetitiveness of Avicus and OCN.
