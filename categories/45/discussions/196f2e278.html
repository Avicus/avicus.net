One of the first few members of the community I ever talked to, eleven months ago; one of the first few I chanced a unique, specific type of affinity for; one of the first few I learned was admirably musically knowledgeable (competent, rather), and for those reasons — among others unnamed — you were a personal favorite of mine, as player, staff, and person alike. Au revoir...
