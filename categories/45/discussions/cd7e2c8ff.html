Do you have any question about how things work in 1.8? Are you not sure what has been added/changed? I've been playing on the snapshots since the first ones were available so I'm pretty confident that I can answer any question(s) you may have! Not every change was listed in the change-log and a few things may need explaining! <b>Just leave your question below and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can!</b>

Question, Aren't the new doors just the coolest thing in the world? I wasn't sure so I wanted to ask you, you seem like an expert on the new version, and I was just wondering.

I have mixed feelings on the addition of new doors but overall I believe it will allow builders to be more creative with their creations! (I remember when they added different types of planks and I hated that not all planks looked the same xD)

No, name changing is still a thing but people never had a complete understanding of how it was going to be implemented. Name changing will be possible in 1.8 but Mojang wants servers to update so that players won't lose their items/data when they change their username. So<b> name changing is still going to be&nbsp;implemented&nbsp;in 1.8</b>

This is the first real* update mojang has done for a while, so people are just going to have to wait for plugins to update.<br><br><br>*By "real" I mean an update that really changed the features of the game. I consider all of the 1.7 updates (1.7.1, 1.7.2, 1.7.5, 1.7.9, 1.7.10) to all be a single update, just spread over a long period of time. Before the 1.7's, Mojang always had a normal update that had new features and then occasionally a sub update would be released to fix a bug or something. e.i. 1.2 and 1.2.5

By "lock entities" I assume you are talking about spawning in a mob with no AI (This means they will just sit there and do nothing) What you want to do is type <b>/summon Creeper ~ ~ ~ {NoAI:1}</b> &nbsp;- Just replace "Creeper" with whatever mob you want to spawn without AI. I hope this was what you were asking, but if not just ask me again!

</div>
place a chest, then put a command block somewhere. in the command block put:<br><br><b>/blockdata x y z </b>(chest coordinates)&nbsp;<b>{Lock"Name"</b> (any word)<b>}<br></b><br>now, any item that is named as the word you put in <b>"Name"&nbsp;</b>can open the chest. if anyone tries to open the chest with anything else, it'll say it's locked.

So name changing would be coming out in a 1.8._ update? Or would it be coming in some future update past 1.8?

Mojang's official statement is "name changing will not be available before 1.8". From what I've seen and from what I've found out, I have reason to believe that name changing will be available in 1.8 because everything needed for that to be possible has now been added in the game. Mojang wants to wait though so that servers have a chance to update. Once the servers are updated, players can change their username without losing any of their data.
