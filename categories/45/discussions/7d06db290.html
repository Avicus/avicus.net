Lol xD Avicus doesn't care many of these <b><i><u>IMPORTANT</u></i></b><i></i>&nbsp;ideas. I suggested chatting on forums too, and people suggested other things but seems like nothing has been changed.<br><br>I really liked your idea, but I don't think that they will add it. That's what they always do...

I believe chatting on the forums was turned down because it would be yet another area for the staff to constantly moderate.<br><br>Considering we already have three platforms + Skype for communication, I'm pretty sure it was turned down because it was unneeded as opposed to the staff just being lazy.
