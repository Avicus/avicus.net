First off, I don't feel like leading anymore or trying to, I expected the win as I did back on conquest thing tournament 5 o 4 , this team started like a normal team getting players that were mainly my friends I enjoyed playing conquest and this race to victory tournament, I am glad I got to know all the members, ginie1 was teh reason of us winning that guy is a fking legend? good run with everyone on the team old and new ones.<br>We are disbanding because neither me nor LFT want to lead, was a good oportunity to say good bye to everyone on avicus, I don't think I will be playing avicus more except if ginie creates Carthage here, good luck to every team and have fun playing tournaments.<br>Posighdun, n_e, juanno thanks to be in the team with me ;)<br>I'm doing this so everyone in HORIZON know why we are not doing more tournaments.<br><br>G_G

Wow that is a lot of teams disbanding.&nbsp; 2 within 2 hours of one another.&nbsp; Did this last tournament make a lot of teams upset?&nbsp; Understandable reaction to be honest though after all of the stuff that happened at the last one.
