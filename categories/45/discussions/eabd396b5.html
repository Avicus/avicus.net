So is davis going to help you write it? Or will he just be in th e story it self?
</blockquote>

He's going to help me a little bit; after all, he was the one who came up with the basic seed of the story. Um, what should I change the title to? I can't really think of something... and maybe it shouldn't be Minecraft related... Maybe something to do with real people... So.... Hmmm....

Thank you everyone so far who are supporting this! I know you're not doing too much, but it seriously means a lot to me! And we're not even halfway with character profiles yet!

You're my sister, Aegloswen. (even though this family thing still isn't going on I want to feel like I've got a sibling) How can I be annoyed at you? But I looked at the title and thought of a better way to say it than just a plain English Title. I envisioned it to be a story that everyone on Avicus (hopefully) will read and be like: 'I read this story called.... uhh... here, look at the title...' and then their friend or family member would look at the title, be puzzled, then read it. When they understand what and how the story unfolds, they're going to be like: 'Wooo! I read this book and it's called... uhh....' My daydreams.<br><br><br>

Yeah.... I just wonder a little bit why it's slow gaining spots. Maybe people don't like a fanfiction about school?

Thanks so much, Aegloswen; it really does mean a lot. I've decided that if no one else applies for an application, I'll substitute characters that I've made up.
