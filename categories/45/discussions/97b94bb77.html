Are we allowed to place blocks where we are not supposed to? Like block placing past walls with regions where you can't place a block, but will still be able to get past. The last time I asked Auratix, he said it's allowed. Can someone confirm this?

If on block place you get an error message and your blocks get removed, but due to lag it stays for a small period of time and you&nbsp;<i></i><b>use that amount of time the block is there&nbsp;</b>to get on top of it and go into places you are not supposed to / in a way you are not supposed too, then...<br><br>It's illegal

You are allowed to wall jump, but you're not allowed to place blocks if you get an error message in chat.

Since it's not in the rules section, I would say it's allowed, although staff probably claim it's not.<br>If it is a rule, they should add it to the rules.

It's considered abusing glitches, so it falls into that category. :p

Abusing glitches has always been illegal.<br>Also, try staying away from areas where the Map Developer has not intended gameplay to take place.

Yep, He's in your team.<br><br>According to Kylo, the same rules should be applied in Scrim servers, so that means he could get an infraction for it.
