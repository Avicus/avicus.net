Hey guys so 2 weeks from now i will be going to the USA for vacation!<br>I will be leaving on the 21 of june and then coming back on august 6. Yes i know its a long time but i need some away time from all of this. I will be on, here and there but mostly inactive. So i would like to thank you, all the staff for getting the update that everyone has been waiting for. I personally have enjoyed Avicore tons. And i think that this will bounce this server right back up in the most popular servers in MC. A thank you too all my friends that i usually go on teamspeak with. You have given me something i have never had before. And i am great full to be apart of this magnificent group of people that i have had a lot of fun with and. Also a special thanks to tel6331 he's been one of the awesome and kindest friend and guy could ask for.&nbsp;<br><br>Well thats that, time for some beaches and sun :D Thank you all be back on August 6<br>Regards Sunrise<br><br><br><br><br>Nows your time to pass me on the leaderboards (wink) (wink) :)
