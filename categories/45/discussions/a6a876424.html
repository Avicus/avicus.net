Do you think it is ok that when people are swearing in chat I tell them please watch your language. But a lot of the time players will start to say 99250 don't do a Moderator's job you suck up, your a noob, you suck. When players start to do that does that count as bullying?&nbsp;<br><br>Me: "Please don't swear!"<br>Random noob: "Stop doing a Moderators job!!!onee!1! It's a bannable offense!!!

I hate it when someone is cursing or something then I tell them to watch their language and they start hating on me saying stuff like "dude you're not a moderator don't tell us what to do." I just hate people like that.

This is definitely allowed, in my opinion.<br>Although you are not a moderator, you are still allowed to tell the rules to players, as it decreases their chance of being banned.<br>Keep up what you are doing, it is definitely not bannable.<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.avicus.net/rules">http://www.avicus.net/rules</a>

In addition to what I said, it states in number 7 of Section A in the rules:<br>If you are not a staff member, do not impersonate or act as if you are a member of the Avicus staff.<br><br>However, this simply means that you cannot say that you are a member, but I would think that it is encouraged to stop rule breakers.

99, you're doing a great job at warning players. If I were you, I wouldn't stop (therefore it's allowed).<br><br>I'll remove the images as they contain foul language and vulgarity.

There can't always be a staff on, so helping the server by telling people to not cuss or whatever in my opinion is allowed, as Jozz said. I try to do this and don't worry your not the only one who gets hate messages back xD They just don't like being called out.

In my opinion, I think it's great what you're doing! It's great that a player can always remind another player if he/she breaks a rule, if they're unaware! Keep it up!&lt;3
