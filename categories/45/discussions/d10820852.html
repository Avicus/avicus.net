Dear Avicans, or anyone reading this.<br><br><b><i>This post is only meant to share an opinion, and not meant to offend any group of people or an individual. Dear Staff, please excuse any racial slurs that might be posted in this, as it is only meant to be an example.<br><br></i></b><i><u></u></i><u></u><i><u></u></i><u>So i'd like to ask you.</u><br><b><i><br></i></b><i>Why should you think twice?</i><br><i></i>Surely we all have different opinions about this don't we.<br><b><i><br></i></b><i></i>I'd like to give an example<br><b><i><br>"Player1: Bruv let's go play some Nebula"<br>"Player 2: Fuck off, fuck no n*gga"<br></i></b><i><b>"Player1: Wanna suck me off before that?"<br></b></i><b><i>"Player 2: I'll fuck your mum"<br><br></i></b><i></i>So, why did this player respond like this?<br><b><i><br>1) He's 5 years old<br>2) He's immature<br>3) He wants to be rude<br>4) He's a troll<br><br></i></b><i></i>These are the common reasons someone must be rude to you, or else the person actually has a valuable excuse to show such behaviour &nbsp;for acting in such a way, offensive and immature.<br><br>Usually not.<br><br><b>Why did this happen in the first place?<br></b><br><b><i>1) He wanted to break the rules<br></i></b><b><i>2) He wanted to piss staff off<br></i></b><b><i>3) He wants to waste time<br></i></b><b><i>4) He's a troll<br><br></i></b><b></b>These are some of the most irritating reasons as to why the person has responded in such a way.<br><br>But you must think twice before you answer back. Why? because it starts flame wars.<br>Who wants flame wars? No one. Who wants to belong? Everyone.<br><br>So before you answer or question someone, think it through and don't be a jerk about it.<br><br><b><i>The only reason I made this is because no one in Avicus, and I mean no one has yet shown the maturity to think about what they're doing before they do it.<br></i></b><br>Gracias,<br>-Zal.<br><b></b><br><b><i><br></i></b>

Snow's comment is correct.<br><br><b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; "><i>"no one has yet shown the maturity to think about what they're doing before they do it."<br><br></i></b><i></i>Plenty of people have.

Just because you haven't found anyone who acted as the bigger man, doesn't attribute that behavior to everyone else.&nbsp;<br><br>In regards to the OP, myself and the whole staff team highly encourage this behavior, but as Zero said, it doesn't and can't ever work that way.

As a Moderator, I can say that I am able to kick, tempban, warn and ban players. I am not able, nor is it my place, to try change players how to act. It'd be nice if the world worked in a way in which someone makes a mistake, is told the right thing, then never acts up again. I'm sorry to say that, no matter how many players are punished, there will still be repeat offenders and even new players that continue to act immaturely.<br><br>Sadly, it's human nature. I'm unable to change someone else's actions, only you are able to change you. If everyone was taught or knew how to act, as I said, that'd be awesome.<br><br><i>"I'm not saying a certain individual, this is the general committee of the server."</i><br><br>Really? I thought the number of mature players outnumbered the immature here. Maybe that's because I come on at different timezones to you, though.

Or maybe the player is tired of being mature all day and decides to be immature in the place where it arguably has the least impact. I've seen it a lot

You can't stop people doing it. It's the internet.<br><br>Irl if someone was pissing you off by saying things like that, you'd walk away and just ignore the situation right? So why not the same here? Just ignore them or turn chat off.

Most of this is because of&nbsp;<b>gamers.&nbsp;</b>Before anyone tries to be "funny" and say we're all gamers because we play games, I mean serious gamers. The reason is because they take a block game so seriously and they rage. An example (no hate &lt;redacted&gt;i:P)&nbsp;<br><br><i>This occurred on teamspeak</i><br><br><b>&lt;redacted&gt;: I'm so much better than you *kills me as I'm typing*<br></b><b>Me: Lel type kill ftw<br></b><b>&lt;redacted&gt;: HAH excuses kid don't even try and say your better than me I can rek you ez kid.<br></b><b>Me: Ok<br>&lt;redacted&gt;: Badlion I rekt you Tiger.<br>Me: Yeah but Imma little bit rusty I didn't play mc for 2 days xD<br>&lt;redacted&gt;: Stfu your ez<br>Me: *Starts getting frustrated* <br>(At this time I realized that they really take this game seriously and they didn't realize I was joking. And I knew they weren't because they kept trying to piss me off)&nbsp;<br>Me: Hey &lt;redacted&gt; at least I can play a sport<br>Someome else in teamspeak (forgot his name lol): You don't play a sport &lt;redacted&gt;<br>&lt;redacted&gt;: Fuck off you can barley throw a basketball<br></b><br>Then shortly after, everyone left. See I'm saying this not because I wanna make &lt;redacted&gt; and &lt;redacted&gt; feel bad, but to show how stupid you feel after arguing over a stupid block game. Aren't we here to have fun? Why does it always have to be "your ez" or "I can rek you". Why does there always have to be someone who spoils the game for you with threats? (DDOS, False hackusation/Banning threats, etc) I'm sorry but I really want everyone to know from this post that overall, this is a game that people want to enjoy, not to feel bad from a simple game.&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;<br><br><br><br>I want everyone to know that this is not a salty nor hateful post. Just trying to give a message&nbsp;</b>
