Not to fanboy or anything, but GCheat did help with the accuracy of bans, so their ban accuracy must have been lower before GCheat came out and it's more difficult to tell if someone's autoclicking or using a Ghost Client when specing. Unless it's something that stands out a lot ofc.

FYI Stan admitted to hacking before judgement day, that's why he was banned. As for Pedro he's the kind of person who magically learns to bleeple or breezily bridge over night and PlaZa has claimed to be using DGBs client, wether being serious or not, he's dodgy as fuck anyway. Never talked to Trial so I don't really care or know about him. And I fully believe in GCheat, as hack developer have no way to bypass the plugin it is extremely accurate, plus they've used many hacked clients to make sure that it detects them.

I never said Pedro was a legit Breezily Bridger, I said PvPer. And PlaZa was joking around... &nbsp;<br>and I don't see how that vid looks sketch in any way...&nbsp;<br><br>Apparently you know nothing about Ghost Clients either... (Hack Developer Skillz)<br>GCheat is also NOT 100% accurate. That's a fact.&nbsp;<br>Dualzz used triggerbot for a short while and didn't get caught by GCheat, so It Is bypassable. He admitted to it and got banned, no GCheat detection.<br><br>And have you even fought any of these people? GCheat has falsely banned ItsTene a few times, after he's proven many times that he doesn't macro.&nbsp;<br><br>So don't say it isn't bypassable and 100% accurate, because that's bull. <br><br>So many PvPers have gone on BL and autoclicked/triggerbotted that weren't detected by GCheat and staff had to spec to make the bans. So don't act like GCheat is always right or always knows/detects.&nbsp;<br><br>Pedro is also the second person to learn how to Breezily bridge.

You call him ignorant but all he did was put out facts. LOL

Let me splice this down for you.<br><span><br><b>FYI Stan admitted to hacking before judgement day, that's why he was banned. As for Pedro he's the kind of person who magically learns to bleeple or breezily bridge over night and PlaZa has claimed to be using DGBs client, wether being serious or not, he's dodgy as fuck anyway. Never talked to Trial so I don't really care or know about him. And I fully believe in GCheat, as hack developer have no way to bypass the plugin it is extremely accurate, plus they've used many hacked clients to make sure that it detects them.</b><br></span><br>Literally the only thing he's right about is Stan lmfao. Gibbo doesn't know fuckall about how GCheat works and I've found a way to get banned by it without hacking (GBerry knows of this and has probably fixed this by now). "Never talked to Trial so I don't really care or know about him" That right there has a special name. That's called bullshit. Not to mention he didn't even spell the name right. Gibbo has talked to Trail and I'm pretty sure Trail has destroyed gibbo in a fight before. I also find it funny how he thinks I have a client of some sort, like, what the actual fuck is going through his head when he says that.
