<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So, I guess this is my goodbye. I’m retiring from both Referee and Translator, since I am pretty much done with the seriousness that you need to have in order to be a staff member, and I have other plans too. It’s been some great 7 months, but I really just need to take this pressure away from me. Leave me on the slack until tomorrow so I can say goodbye to everyone, and then please remove me. Thanks to everyone that has been really friendly to me on these months, and lucky to those of you who hate me. Thanks to everyone for giving me a fair shot at the team. It was a good run.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Message copied from slack.</span></p>

Their considered "Staff" policy wise, meaning we have to follow staff policy, otherwise no one else believes they are ranks until someone breaks a rule, then we are 100% staff.<br>I call everyone on the staff team a staff because that's why they are there tho xd
