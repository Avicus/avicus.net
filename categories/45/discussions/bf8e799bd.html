Hai ho<br>I think this has been done, but anywho..<br>If you've had multiple names, say the ones you in particular liked!<br><br>1) My first IGN was tonystark96, yes I was a bloody fanboy and that name really fucked me over.<br>2) Second IGN IS XxZalphinoxX, in pages there used to be a font called zalfino, and I changed the f to ph. Then I put Xx because back in 2011-2012 your name consisted of Xx(yourretardedname)xX. at least on xbox..<br><br>GO AHEAD!

I got Minecraft after my Prelims, so I was 12 then.<br>I played some pirated version of Minecraft which was like 1.4.4<br>My favourite mob was the blaze and is actually still is.<br>I wanted something weird and extraordinary, that's where Frozen came from.<br>And Da was just a fancy word I wanted to use instead of The, though now that I think of it, the sounds and looks better.

I'm really not sure, actually.&nbsp; The name "Storm" is just one I've always liked, but I forget how I got the 997.&nbsp; I think it was one of those "Storm is taken, try these!" kinda things, and it's stuck with me ever since.

<b>DaBaderMC (first and current for a throwback)</b> - When I first got my Xbox 360, I literally thought up "Da Badger" in 2 minutes. I tried using DaBadger for minecraft but it was taken, so I decided to go with DaBadgerMC. Since my older brother was the one typing the username, he botched it and forgot the g making it DaBaderMC. At the time, name changes weren't a thing, so I was stuck with it for awhile, but then got use to it. When name changes came out, I changed it to something COMPLETELY different which was...<br><br><b>Pyrocumulus (second) </b>I&nbsp;wanted a name that sounded cool, so I looked up "cool phenomenons" and a list of them came up. There was Aurora, which I originally wanted REALLY bad but it wasn't available, so I took Pyrocumulus. Basically, it's a fiery cumulus cloud or something. My next name was...<br><br><b>TheXiphias (third)</b> - I got tired of Pyrocumulus so I chose this. It's the scientific name for swordfish. I didn't even really know how to pronounce it, lol. Is it Zif-e-us? X-if-eas? I dunno. I regretted doing that right after I changed it lol. After that, I chose...<br><br><b>Rapturous (fourth)&nbsp;</b>- I wanted another new one so I looked for "cool words that mean happy" since my IRL name means happy. I found this. I liked it, but people started calling me Rapeturous so I changed it to...<br><br><b>Gallant (fifth)&nbsp;</b>- I wanted another name that sounded cool. I found this which is apparently a synonym to Valiant which I wanted originally. This name is kinda special since it's the name I had when I got promoted to Junior. It looked kinda dull though so I switched to...<br><br><b>Snoozin (sixth)&nbsp;</b>- I wanted a fun name, so I chose this. I actually really liked it and still do, but it's taken now, so yeah, that's sad. A few people still refer to me as this which is pretty cool. When I wanted to change it again, I chose...<br><br><b>Excellence (seventh)&nbsp;</b>- This name was cool and I was surprised that I was able to get it. Thing is,I realized that whenever my name was just a word I would end up hating it, so I started disliking this later on. When the next name change came out, I changed to...<br><br><b>Eako (eighth)&nbsp;</b>- I didn't come up with this, I actually asked some of the staff for some ideas and FrostedCupcakez gave me "Eako" which I really liked. I changed it, and kept it for quite some time. A lot of people still refer to me as Eako, but a lot of them can't seem to pronounce it correctly, haha. My next change was...<br><br><b>TheMysticalDream (ninth)&nbsp;</b>I got this one by inspiration. I took a look at an older YouTuber called Spoonerism and noticed his channel name was TheCampingTree. I thought that name was pretty dank, so I chose something with the same format. I liked this name a lot, and still do, but I wanted another change because I guess I have a fetish or something. I changed to...<br><br><b>PresidentBadger (tenth)&nbsp;</b> - One of my favorite names yet. I'm keeping it, I simply went back to this name for a little throwback. I wanted to make a YouTuhe channel someday so I thought "If I name myself something like GeneralBadger or KingBadger, I could call my fan base the Animal Kingdom or the Badger Clan!" Neither of those were available, so I switched to PresidentBadger. I was debating whether or not I should pick PresidentAnimal or PresidentBadger, and this name came out on top. Will I ever change my name again? Doubt it, but I'll have to see, I guess...<br><br><b>NuclearDucky (bonus)&nbsp;</b>- This was the first account I ever played on. It was a shared account which my older brothers, younger sister, and I played out. My two brothers quit minecraft a long time ago, but my sister and I continued. Now she's left and rarely ever comes back on, so it's kinda a deserted account, haha. Anyways, my oldest brother came up with it out of nowhere. This account was made many years ago, and I'm pretty sure he didn't mean to keep the name forever. It was just a placeholder, but it looks like it stayed. It's a dead account, but I'll keep it forever, even if nobody plays on it...<br><b></b><br><br><br><br><b></b><br><br><b></b>

Idk but it just sounds way better than Zegjita and then ever since transformice of 2010 where I used Zegita as my first username I've named everything since then :).<br><br>also many people have told me that zegita is a better name than zegjita xD

Warrior cats book series.<br>When I was younger, my friends and I used to play games where we all had OCs, and mine was named Midnightshadows. A year or two later, I joined an Instagram page and the leader told me to change it to something a little shorter. I kept the prefix "Midnight," and I looked through the books for a suffix. One of my favorite characters was named Sandstorm. I took the suffix, added it to Midnight, and that is how my name came to be.

<b>DaBaderMC (first and current for a throwback)</b> - When I first got my Xbox 360, I literally thought up "Da Badger" in 2 minutes. I tried using DaBadger for minecraft but it was taken, so I decided to go with DaBadgerMC. Since my older brother was the one typing the username, he botched it and forgot the g making it DaBaderMC. At the time, name changes weren't a thing, so I was stuck with it for awhile, but then got use to it. When name changes came out, I changed it to something COMPLETELY different which was...<br><br><b>Pyrocumulus (second) </b>I&nbsp;wanted a name that sounded cool, so I looked up "cool phenomenons" and a list of them came up. There was Aurora, which I originally wanted REALLY bad but it wasn't available, so I took Pyrocumulus. Basically, it's a fiery cumulus cloud or something. My next name was...<br><br><b>TheXiphias (third)</b> - I got tired of Pyrocumulus so I chose this. It's the scientific name for swordfish. I didn't even really know how to pronounce it, lol. Is it Zif-e-us? X-if-eas? I dunno. I regretted doing that right after I changed it lol. After that, I chose...<br><br><b>Rapturous (fourth)&nbsp;</b>- I wanted another new one so I looked for "cool words that mean happy" since my IRL name means happy. I found this. I liked it, but people started calling me Rapeturous so I changed it to...<br><br><b>Gallant (fifth)&nbsp;</b>- I wanted another name that sounded cool. I found this which is apparently a synonym to Valiant which I wanted originally. This name is kinda special since it's the name I had when I got promoted to Junior. It looked kinda dull though so I switched to...<br><br><b>Snoozin (sixth)&nbsp;</b>- I wanted a fun name, so I chose this. I actually really liked it and still do, but it's taken now, so yeah, that's sad. A few people still refer to me as this which is pretty cool. When I wanted to change it again, I chose...<br><br><b>Excellence (seventh)&nbsp;</b>- This name was cool and I was surprised that I was able to get it. Thing is,I realized that whenever my name was just a word I would end up hating it, so I started disliking this later on. When the next name change came out, I changed to...<br><br><b>Eako (eighth)&nbsp;</b>- I didn't come up with this, I actually asked some of the staff for some ideas and FrostedCupcakez gave me "Eako" which I really liked. I changed it, and kept it for quite some time. A lot of people still refer to me as Eako, but a lot of them can't seem to pronounce it correctly, haha. My next change was...<br><br><b>TheMysticalDream (ninth)&nbsp;</b>I got this one by inspiration. I took a look at an older YouTuber called Spoonerism and noticed his channel name was TheCampingTree. I thought that name was pretty dank, so I chose something with the same format. I liked this name a lot, and still do, but I wanted another change because I guess I have a fetish or something. I changed to...<br><br><b>PresidentBadger (tenth)&nbsp;</b> - One of my favorite names yet. I'm keeping it, I simply went back to this name for a little throwback. I wanted to make a YouTuhe channel someday so I thought "If I name myself something like GeneralBadger or KingBadger, I could call my fan base the Animal Kingdom or the Badger Clan!" Neither of those were available, so I switched to PresidentBadger. I was debating whether or not I should pick PresidentAnimal or PresidentBadger, and this name came out on top. Will I ever change my name again? Doubt it, but I'll have to see, I guess...<br><br><b>NuclearDucky (bonus)&nbsp;</b>- This was the first account I ever played on. It was a shared account which my older brothers, younger sister, and I played out. My two brothers quit minecraft a long time ago, but my sister and I continued. Now she's left and rarely ever comes back on, so it's kinda a deserted account, haha. Anyways, my oldest brother came up with it out of nowhere. This account was made many years ago, and I'm pretty sure he didn't mean to keep the name forever. It was just a placeholder, but it looks like it stayed. It's a dead account, but I'll keep it forever, even if nobody plays on it...<br><b></b><br><br><br><br><b></b><br><br><b></b>

I also used it on my alts name for a short time period. I decided to switch my name to that, and am still currently in debate on whether or not that should be my new permanent name.

Hmm I'm pretty sure that the two Co-Owners still own the server. I can't recall seeing anything in slack about Cubist (last_username)&nbsp;becoming owner when the admins were revamped.
