I find the amount of youtube videos to help with exams extraordinary, helps a lot :D usually actually enjoyable/bearable unlike 'normal revision' of reading from a book.

I went to Pakistan for 2 months to visit almost my entire family, and got bit by some tiny 15 year old corgi thing. I had to get 4 anti-rabies vaccines.<br><br>A science teacher at my school got severely injured, nobody is really sure how. Some say they heard she slipped and hit her head on a bathtub and cracked her skull open. All we know is that it was head trauma or something. She still isn't back, and the staff have said nothing about her. My brother thinks that she maybe hit her head so hard to the point where she can't even walk, let alone remember the science stuff she taught, bringing an end to her career somewhat early. Other people think she might be relearning, or still recovering.

Went to Gaspesie (east of Quebec) for a week, it was like a 2000 km road trip. Had fun, but was tired af almost the entire time. Got sick for a night there as well. Ate a lot of poutine xD (French fries, gravy and melted cheese in case you didn't know, only in Quebec).
