Well where to start , I've never had the chance to tell you guys how much i actually appreciate this community. To think i've nearly been here 3 years , on some block game. I would have left about a year ago if it wasn't for you guys. &nbsp;All i every try to be is positive/happy because it's all i want others to be. The community &nbsp; helps with so many personal problems without realizing , and i just want to tell you guys , thank you. We may not have 1000 players anymore but as long as this community is here everyday to cheer me and others up , i don't care. When you stop and think , players from all around the world all sitting down together playing a game , it really does feel special. Sure i might not be who you want me to be , but you guys have always been what i wanted you to be. I can't not imagine &nbsp;being part of this community now. One day i'll look back at this blocky game called 'Minecraft' and remember that small server &nbsp;'Avicus' and of course , you guys. I would make a massive paragraph about each and every one of you but you've all been part of this community to me in one way or another. I hope you guys remember &nbsp;, every single one of you are amazing , never forget that.<br><br>Ok cringe over.<br>Love you guys , I'll be here until the end (Even if that means just posting on the forums). I'm sure this community won't die anytime soon though , would take a lot for all of &nbsp;this just to vanish. :)<br><br>Before anyone even asks , no i'm not leaving xD&nbsp;<br>I just simply feel like I've never managed to try put it in to words how much this community means to me.

I think the amazing community we have is what holds Avicus together. Pizza, you're an amazing friend and I wouldn't have had such a fun time on this game/be here without you &lt;3

The Avicus community is what keeps this server together and I personally cant thank everyone enough for that. What Pizza has said here is absolutely true and thanks for that. &lt;3 you guys.
