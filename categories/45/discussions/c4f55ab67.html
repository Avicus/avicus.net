What would these awards do? What would players receive?&nbsp;is the award for only joining the first time on the forums or overall activity?<br><br>I like this idea regarding awarding players who register for the forums but you'd need to be less vague regarding how this would work :P

nope. Like how would the system be? someone is just gona type in random words in many topics and then get the reward(s). I want people that actually care about the topic to comment, rather then ppl I know just is there for the reward.

A leveling won't happen unless Keenan changes his mind.<br>If you've heard or prestiges, that is a leveling system that Avicus used to have that everyone loved, it got taken away and quite a few people quit Avicus because it got boring and now Keenan keeps on saying that he won't re-implement it regardless of what the community wants.

Pretty much this. Before, every prestige had a unique badge/symbol. It would be too difficult (nigh impossible, actually) to add a badge for immeasurable numbers of prestiges.

But what is the point of an acheivment? No one is going to want to work for something that's just a personal goal that doesn't give you a any benefit. Something in-game would give a reason to work to get an award. Something that you can show off, an enjoy expressing about yourself.

Eh, tbh increasing credits wouldn't work, as it looks like the Admins are trying to increase what you get by donating. Removig credits pretty much kills the rest of the donor ranks as you don't get much anyhow.<br><br>Prestiges were always the best, it gave a personal goal, and would also get a lot of the server to compete to see who can get to the highest prestige. If unlimited prestiges happen, I guess it can go for who can sustain the highest prestige.
