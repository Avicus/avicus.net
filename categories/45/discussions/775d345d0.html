I saw one of these posts and thought I should probably make one aswell. I'm aware that I can rage alot when it comes to gaming and screens, but I'm trying to stop and I think I'm a bit better now. However I can't erase the past so I just want to say sorry if I have said/ done something bad or rude towards you.

You have :O<br>Also, it hasn't much to say in my opinion, that you do an apology post just because someone else does. Cant take that half as serious:/

I wanted to say sorry, but I didn't know whether I should do it in game or what. But when I was someone else do it, I thought it might be a good idea. I'm sorry if you don't take it as seriously but I just want to say sorry for being rude to people.

You have to learn to forgive people. See the first thread created a ripple effect. This ripple make people do the right thing. If you were him you would do the right thing.

Well,hello there jerk.<br><br>Jk xD<br><br>I remember a couple days ago when you blocked me while I was breaking the monument.I didnt rage,but told you not to do that since its against the rules,but you didnt listen and told me straight up that yoy wer there first,even though I had made the bridge in the first place (at least started until someone.shot me...)and I was STILL there before you,I reported and everyone raged at you,and you ignored them.To me thats the worst thing you can do (after hacks) to break the rules and lose the respect of the player that you did it to (in this case me).<br><br>But the fact that you came to say sorry...<br><br>APOLOGY ACCEPTED :OOOOO!!!!111<br><br>Thanks for coming clean about this,I hope we be friends in the future :D.<br>-Sevo<br><br>PS:And yes,I did rage in my own little world :P

It's k. From personal experience I know you're really cool and it shows you're trying to change. Believe it or not I used to be a rager as well...I hate CoD now...not worth the anger and bull**** tbh. But it takes some guts to say sorry and you don't deserve hate. Everyone has two sides to them.
