<b>Now before I begin this post, this only applies to SOME high ranked people (not naming).<br><br></b>Hai everyone :D<br><b><br></b>So the other day I saw someone who had recently gotten prestige 1 treating other people really poorly, like calling them "noob" and "hacker."<br><b><br></b>Today, I got called a hacker by a gold ranked member (not prestige).<br><b><br></b>Do some people think that being a high rank allows them to suddenly be jerks to the other players? It's almost like they're rubbing it in our faces.<br><b><br></b>This is just a small rant and bit of truth, I believe.<br><b><br>I also don't really report these players...<br><br>Much love, Midnight.</b>

I wouldn't quite call a Gold member or a prestiged player a "high rank", they're still a player. &nbsp;I thought you were talking about senior staff or something.<br><br>In which case, you should just report them next time.

I'm sorry if feel that higher ranked people are rude towards the lower ranked people, but ranks are pretty much only a title. Not all people are jerks when they are high ranked but many do act cocky. But yeah, as Sulo and Pete said above... Report them next time :)

i agree with sul that a gold member/a prestiged person shouldn't be considered having a "high rank". But anyways, I've only noticed that the ranked people being jerks are mainly just the new premium players. I see all the time new Emerald, Gold, and Diamond players saying bad stuff and hackusating. But possibly after a few weeks, I bet that these ranked people won't be jerks anymore because either they'll be punished or they'll change their behavior. :P

True, but I feel that prestige players should get a little harder punishment for talking sh*t to non-prestige players, unless the non prestige player starts sh*t talking then I feel that he or she should get f*cked.

I do presume that there are some people out there who buy the rank and feel some sense of power (which they really don't have). They may feel like they are the king of the server and feel the sense to push people around like they're obsequious peasants.<br><br>Really if you see this again, report them. Don't let them bully you, or anyone else, like this. They have no right to do this just because of a donation.

The thing about this server doesn't matter what rank you are you gain respect and are treated equally, unlike Hypixel if your an VIP/MVP they treat you rude. &nbsp;If some rank decides to change that idea they should definitely be reported

This is a reaaally crappy aspect about donator ranks, I mean, you can expect rudeness from anyone but donators should specially be careful about how they treat fellow players as they are in many cases very involved and active in our community, I say, when you purchase a donor rank you should vow to be respectful &nbsp;and friendly, a good sport, not like a term or condition but some sort of symbolic oath

I really don't think many people think they have more power because they donated. (Although some do.) Some people, whether donor or not, get frustrated while played and feel the need to take out their anger on others. I had a particularly bad day on Avicus today and felt like raging alot, but I think I held it together pretty well xP

As stated above in the previous posts, you can always report them for harassing/bullying. As we will take care of them! ^.^<br><br>People with ranks/prestiges/Mod Prefixes, are all the same. No one is superiour than others. We are all equal.<br><br>Remember, if you feel offended/harassed in ANY way that makes you feel uncomfortable, feel free to contact one of the Staff with evidence (Report works just as well!), and we'll help you! ^-^

I can see where you're coming from, but try not to be prejudice. I'd say there are the same amount, if not less, donors who are jerks rather than normal players. They just kind of stand out more because of their rank. Some donors can be kind of spoiled, though, so yeah.. It bugs me, too :c

I have to admit I used to do this when I first got prestige but then it kinda means nothing after prestige 3 then today I got prestige 5 lvl 50 then I was siked but it is the phase everyone goes through it and just to be honest everyone here donor or not has rubbed it in someones faces either because they got it before someone they were virtually competing with or that they hate and want to rub it in soon it will be to die calm down I don't think this is a reporting matter until this gets to swearing and threatening then feel free to report or contact me on skype [Cezbla] And Ill come screen shot it report it on the forums and I am sure the staff would be glad to help anyone getting threatened or seeing someone getting bullied, bullying is a big thing in this world so i think if someone can stop it I think they would try best regards<br><br><br>Cezbla
