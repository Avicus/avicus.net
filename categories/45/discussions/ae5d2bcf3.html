You're on Rendezvous and it's red vs blue. You are on blue team and you quickly make a skin with red leather armor.<br><br>I realize those skins almost never work, but you never know.

But your going to spawn with your team's coloured armour, but if you are naked it may seem your on the opposing team. Like a fake diamond armour skin for HG's, your name's give it away as well.<br>Just play by the rules and have an appropriate skin and everything will be just fine.

I think it is allowed, because it's not your fault if people think you are with them, you should be allowed to change your skin to what you want. (except naked skins, you know what I mean lol)

Its not necessarily cheating, but I think it would be pretty easy to figure out that you are on the opposite team. I would say go ahead and do it, but you will probably will be noticed

I'm with rileguy on this. They are most likely allowed, but probably won't work most of the time.

Skins that aren't allowed are naked ones, for obvious reasons, And in my opinion, Armour skins are pathetic and don't look good at all. But yes, they're allowed!

Not breaking any rules, and it is just a tactic, so yes; they are allowed.

If it's not naked, Hitler, naked Hitler, or something offensive then you should be good.

You wouldn't want a 7 year old playing with his mom next to him seeing a person with a naked skin. It's common sense. :P
