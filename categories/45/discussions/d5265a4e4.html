My Demotion and Temp-Ban.

</h1>
I'm going to try to explain what happened without needing to answer too many questions.&nbsp;<br><br>Before I actually start, yes, this demotion and ban is legitimate and there was no bias involved.&nbsp;<br><br>I was on 5Zig 1.7.10 and enjoying my time, and I heard some complaints about 1.8 have problems so I switched to LabyMod 1.8.8 to see if I noticed any extra lag or anything different than before. (I didn't notice anything for those wondering.) When I downloaded LabyMod I had the option to add Damage Indicators to it. I did, because it is allowed on some servers, and it can be pretty useful for them. Somehow I didn't notice they were on, and I was just moderating like I always would. I recorded a few people, one of which appealed. I put the evidence on the appeal, somehow still not noticing that Damage Indicators was on. I had a Senior Moderator approach me about it, and I was honest with him. I told him what I'm telling you guys now, just in a little bit of a different way or course, and with more detail. The Senior Staff talked about it and this is the conclusion they have come to. I told them from the beginning that whatever they decided I would stick with, and I would respect whatever they decided, so I'm going to stick with that.&nbsp;<br><br>For those that don't know a lot about me, or rarely talk to me: I am a big fan of a good mindset about everything. Anytime something goes wrong, or could go wrong I try to look at the positive, and keep the mindset that everything that happens has a reason. Whether it's good or bad, we can't control that. Sure, we can try our best to not make mistakes and put ourselves into a position to get into trouble, but you can't stay away from it forever.&nbsp;<br><br>I won't be as active anymore, on the forums or in-game (obviously) so I'm going to take a paragraph or two and just encourage everyone, and hopefully help whoever I can.<br><br>I'm going to start with the question: "What is&nbsp;<b><i>your</i></b> &nbsp;goal?" Personally my goal is to become a Preschool or Kindergarten Teacher. I can't necessarily do that now, because I need to get a degree in Early Education first. But that doesn't mean I can't work towards it, and do things now that will help me in the future. The past 2-3 years I've had this mindset of "I can't do anything right now to affect my future." Well just this past couple weeks that has changed. I've realized that I can take Early Child Development classes now in High School, and &nbsp;it will not only help me get into a College but it will also look very good on a resume. I've also been helping more in the Preschool classes at my church. This won't go on any form but it will give me more experience and I will know what I am doing a lot better than I would if I didn't help at all or very little. I want to encourage everyone, whether you like school or not, or like taking harder classes, or don't want to take time out of your week to practice something, do it. With whatever you want to do when you're older, start now. There are classes you can take, and things you can be apart of that will help you a lot in the future. Not only will those things help you now, and as you are learning, but they will also help you later when you are applying for a job, and while you are doing your job. I know it doesn't sound exciting to learn about these things now, but it will really help you in the future.&nbsp;<br><br>-If you got nothing from this, at least take this piece of advice.&nbsp;<b>Don't let your mindset stop you from believing in yourself, and doing what you love.</b><br><br>If you have a question feel free to ask down below, I'm not going to be offended by anything you say. I made a mistake, my fault.

Very humble about all of this. It says a lot about your character. And although I disagree with the decision, I appreciate your mindset after all of this.<br><br>A lot of people could learn from you and how you've dealt with this situation.<br><br>You were one of the better Moderators, you were always active and I couldn't always rely on you to get things done.<br><br>You leave with dignity and respect, not everyone does when faced with this similar situation.<br><br>Fair play to you mate :)

Not a huge deal, but I don't want to answer the same 5 questions from multiple people.&nbsp;<br><br>I also can't say I agree with a 7 day temp-ban. I don't mind, but I feel like it should have been longer. According to the rules I was hacking. Anyone else and that's a permanent ban.

Okay, I understand that you are just stating your opinion but please don't bring it here. There was nothing wrong with what happened. The Seniors were easy on me imo. I broke a rule, that's what happened. I didn't get demoted for no reason, or very little reason. They had every right to permanently ban me and not give me a chance to re-apply for Moderator, at least for a while. They did the exact opposite. They encouraged me to come back and made it pretty clear that they didn't want to do this. If they didn't it wouldn't be fair to everyone, and that would be biased.&nbsp;<br><br>Take the negativity somewhere else please and thank you.

it's clear you've been brainwashed by the system if you really believe that this was the correct reaction. the facts are that there are like 5 or 6 less mods today than there were like a week ago in a time when the server seems to be constantly under assault by hackers. in these troubling times, one of the (better) mods makes a tiny (and seemingly brief) slip-up where DAMAGE INDICATORS of all things (which EVERYONE knows improve your PVP by 1000% and give you a huge advantage) were turned on for a bit (and not even really used in a pvp match, at least based on what you wrote). the worst thing perhaps is the fact that there was no malicious intent at all in your use of the damage indicators, it was just a small oversight with barely an effect. i mean, it would be one thing if you were deliberately using them, but come on. there's a reason that in many legal systems you will get punished if you sock some dude in the arm and break it, but you won't if you accidentally break the dude's arm dragging him out of a burning building (in this case "breaking some dude's arm" is far more extreme than what actually happened, but the dragging-out-of-a-burning-building thing is helping people out, just like moderating).

I can't believe the Staff 'Team' demoted you for an accidental thing that changes fuck all and gives you next to no advantage, furthermore you weren't even applying it in a game so I have no idea why this has happened, you shouldn't respect it at all imo but well done for taking such a shit decision so grown up and in an accepting way.<br><br>I could make loads of complaints about the staff but I'm just laughing so hard rn at them, not at you.<br><br>Thanks for everything anyway :p

Lmao I love how the active staffs get ban for a little problem and the ones that are not on since 1985 and just get on a sec don't.<br><br>And this is a problem that the devs should prevent, updating and upgrading the anticheat or just adding an anti damage indicator it's easy as that

Obviously I or another member would ban a fly hacker, but damage indicators don't really help the player and I feel a warn and no temp ban would have been satisfactory due to it also being an accident.

One of the reasons I left the server is bc of these bullshit rules. Like holy shit you can see his hearts big fucking deal. Who even cares just tell them to turn them off. Honestly you make a big deal over the smallest thing. Instant demotion and a tempban. God the staff gets more and more retarded by the second. Miqah I hope you become a teacher and hope you stay if avicus staff get their chromosomes back.

Now someone explain to me... what would you say if you knew he used an illegal modification and wasn't demoted nor banned. That would be bias, and I would agree.&nbsp;<br><br>His demotion, for much of a better or worse moderator he could be, is 100% correct. He was supposed to make the rules be applied, not to break them. The fact that Avicus has few active moderators has nothing to do with this.<br><br>Also, to the ones saying he wasn't using it while playing he even said that himself lmao

I don't really think this is necessary, I'd be one thing if he fly hacked or used kill aura but damage indicators? Come on. Not sure if there's a staff warning system in place now like there kinda was when I was a staff member but he should some sort of a warning to never do it again, not a full on demotion.

Unfair, you should receive a second chance if it was accidental. Like what profbananaslug said. You should be allowed back onto the staff team. You were not pvping or anything, so you were not in anyway affecting others game-play, and you even switched over to LabyMod to help other players.

Whatever the outcome was it was not going to be a good one. With this information out now, we had a certain group that wanted Micah to receive a punishment for what he did while there are others that didn't want anything to happen. We knew with the information, there was going to be a backlash.&nbsp;<br>That being said, I don't believe there is anyone in the senior staff team or in the staff team with bad opinions of Micah. But, we needed to make a hard decision based off facts alone, not feelings. There are guidelines and rules community members must face and so do the staff members with only one person who is able to go around these guidelines. With only one recorded incident of this happening in the past, we decided to do the same punishment. This was just following guidelines and rules.<br><br>Now, the rules and guidelines themselves will come under conversation in the next few days as I will be changed going off the information that was given to us by a few people. We want to make sure people are not using an illegal modification by mistake and is punished by it. Hopefully, this brings a positive change to the ruleset and guidelines.&nbsp;<br><br>Anyways Micah, you were one of the chillest mods here. You did a fair amount of work and got the community to like you for who you were. After your temp ban and you do decide you want to try to come back, I would have a huge feeling it would be very easy for you. Thank you for all your work Micah. Please stay as mature as you are now.

Not sure you understand. I know the rules. The difference is that I just simply didn't notice that damage indicators on. It wasn't intentional, but it was against the rules. Therefore I got a punishment for it. I still don't see anything wrong with it.&nbsp;<br><br>-@Half the people in the post.<br>I. Used. Them. While. Playing.&nbsp;<br>This wasn't just while I was spectating, I used them for a good 3-4 hours, playing, spectating, afk, etc. Over half these arguments don't even apply to what happened.

Pretty well put to be honest. Regardless if Micah was a good moderator or not, rules are rules. If that was a different mod then he/she would be punished the same way, or it would be bias.
