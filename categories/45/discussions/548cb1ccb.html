<b>OH YEAH BOOOYYYY!!! THIS IS DEDICATED TO REMY!<br><br>Me, Myself, and I</b>

<b>&nbsp;</b>

<i>I stand facing something worse than
fear. Actually it is fear. I can’t move, and all I can do is stare. I thought
this would turn out good, but it just made it worse…</i>

<i>&nbsp;</i>

I am scared of the thing that stalks me at night. Everywhere, I
look I see it. It’s always there, it’s like it is a part of me. I see it in my
reflection on the window and mirror. It can be described as a crawling devil.
It has the red eyes, and he walks on my walls. He’s just like me; I always
wanted to walk on the walls when I saw those action movies. Oh well, a child’s
dream doesn’t last.&nbsp; Then the nails, they
are sharp and long. He’s just like me; I used to have long nails when I was a
kid. I liked them sharp, but now they are short. 

&nbsp;

I realized he knew all my secrets, like the most embarrassing
moment in my life. And the first lie I ever told. He would always tell me it, and
remind me of how bad it was.

&nbsp;

There is something that scares me even more. I have a secret that
we both must hide. The “thing” killed my mother. She died when I was 12 years
old. I saw its big smile, as it stabbed my mother’s face. &nbsp;However, instead of telling anybody or the
police… I kept it a secret. There was something that told me not to tell
anyone. 

&nbsp;

The exact same thing happened to my father, but I still kept it a
secret. I couldn’t tell anybody. No one could know. I have been living in the
same house with the bodies buried in the backyard. 

&nbsp;

So I have been going through 8 years of this madness. It stalks
me, it annoys me. I have kept it for so long here, and now… I am going to get
rid of it.

Night falls and I fall with it. I am fast asleep, my eyes filled
with darkness. It feels like forever until I awake in an endless hallway oblivious
to my surrounding. I walk through the hallway, and find doors. I open some of
them, and find my memories. Some of them are bad and some of them are good. I
walk for what seemed like years going through doors of memories, until I reach
the present.&nbsp; I walk ahead and only see
pitch black. 

&nbsp;

That’s when I hear a stomping sound. I quickly look behind, and
see the “thing” crawling faster than ever. I wasn’t afraid though. I ran to the
beast and swung my fist at its cold blooded face. It squealed and took a large
knockback. I see it on the ground about to take a jump. And oh boy, it sure
took a jump. It jumped 50 feet in the air, and landed its entire body on mine.
I cough out blood, and then punched it in the face again. My rage made me punch
it multiple times as the chunks of its cheek fell off. It made another
disgusting squeal, and fell back. It ran away, but I chased it. I kept running
and running till it actually stopped. I give it a kick in the stomach. When it
fell onto the ground, I stepped on its face, and tried crushing it. Then it was
barely alive. I prepared my foot to step on its face one last time. 

&nbsp;

<span>Before I could get the last hit, I woke up in my bathroom. I was
in shock cleaning myself up. I walk over to get my towel, till I look in my
mirror. I couldn’t move though, the sight was too shocking. My reflection wasn’t
me; it was the monster standing right there.<br><br>Hopefully, you guys enjoyed this!</span>
