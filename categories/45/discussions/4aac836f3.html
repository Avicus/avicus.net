I agree with this. Just because my team has 4-5 staff members doesn't mean we're good. Just as how a donator rank doesn't <b>necessarily</b> mean that he/she is a very skilled player the same applies to staff.

Staff members are overrated, players with badges are overrated and just those people who simple are mentioned the second they join the game.&nbsp;<br><br>Just because they have a fancy coloured badge, have certain powers (staff positions) doesn't mean they deserve more attention than others like a few of us never get people saying hi where as those people like JK (no offence) get mentioned the second they join a game!

A lot of people is overrated tbh.<br><br>Like some people rate a normal avicus player 9/10. You're like as good as DGB, Dualzz, Stimpy if you're a 9.<br>Me myself would easily be able to like kill those avicus players, and still I'm like 6 or 7/10.

When i see someone with a badge I don't think "Oh that person must be good" or "They are probably overrated". I just think 'Oh that is a nice badge' and keep playing. Honestly, I don't know what the thing is with badge people being overrated.

People consider me good at walls but in all honesty, I suck pretty bad. So me and like others have said, just because your staff doesn't mean your good at the game.<br>Staff requires completely different skills, not actual minecraft skills. A lot of people don't realize that for some reason, now that doesn't mean a staff can't be good at pvp but it isn't required to be a staff member

Asking for an unban doesn't gain you the chance of that happening.

uwot<br><br>@OP (ayy you made the topic), I'm actually somewhat overrated in terms of moderating, rather than pvp. Some people expect me to be godly because of my.. ehm, experience, even though I actually have no idea what I'm doing half the time~<br><br>or maybe I am godly you never know o3o

I think most staff are overrated, just because they are mods or whatever. On most servers all the noobs come and target them :P At least on Avicus most of the staff members are actually pretty based at PvP.
