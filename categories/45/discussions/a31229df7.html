This is a thread from OCN, I found it very helpfull so I decided to share it with you guys :D . I take no credits for this. Original creator:&nbsp;Tonyfamous<br><br><span>Well, Breezily bridging is probably the fastest and hardest bridging technique out of all the bridging techniques. So I'm here to teach you, exactly, on how to Ninja Bridge the proper way.<br></span><br><span>If you do not know what is ninja bridging, it's basically a shift-unshift bridge, where as you unshift all the way until the edge of the block, and shift again, etc.<br></span><br><span><b>Step 1: Understand your technique of normal shift bridging</b><br></span><br>You need to understand the shift bridging&nbsp;placement&nbsp;in order to work on the ninja bridging. Average people presses A+S and move to the right side of the block, which is what most people do. If you use D+S, don't worry, you'll still be able to work on it. Some people which uses the normal and classic way of shift bridging, which is pressing S individually. By pressing S individually, it is slower than pressing A+S or D+S. In fact,&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbM2K4s8f7U">here's</a><span>&nbsp;a speed test made by the name 'failerkin'.<br></span><br><b>Step 2: Timing</b><span><br><br></span>&nbsp;Bridging with the ninja bridge is all about timing.&nbsp;If you did it correctly, you should be going at the speed of 6-8 cps (clicks per second) and sps (shifts per second). It is as fast as the Breezily bridge, but way more flashy. Also, do not spam click your mouse. It must fit the speed with your shift's. After you got a couple of blocks going on, practice again and again. Remember, don't struggle, it doesn't help you. By the way, you think this is hard? Well, a bunch of people are struggling way more than this on practicing Breezily bridging.<br><br><span><b>Step 3: Remain your pointer's position</b><br></span><br>Your pointer must be on the side of the block, and while you bridge, you click it again and again. Try not to move it. If you do, you'll lose your rhythm of the clicks and you'll fall. Also, after a while of bridging continuously, you'll find yourself moving to the side that you're pressing, (A+S = near the right, D+S= near the left). If that happens,&nbsp;Do not<span>&nbsp;press the third button to position yourself back while having the rhythm. Stop for just a second, and re-position yourself back. If you did it fast, you'll be as fast as Breezily bridging.<br></span><br><span><b>Step 4: Practice again and again in Singleplayer</b><br></span><br>I recommend you not to practice on public servers, because you'll probably make a mess, and nobody's gonna clean it up, unless they feel generous. Practice in Singleplayer again and again, and you'll be as professional as Breezily in no time. In fact, if you get shot to the back, try to shift as soon as you reach the edge of the block, and continue the rhythm. This is good for sky-bridging if you need to bridge really fast.

I'm garbage at Breezily bridging, but I've mastered fast staircasing &nbsp;and shift-unshit bridging. I'm not sure if you're thinking about the same thing, a video would be helpful :3

Could you add maybe a description of what exactly ninja bridging looks like? I learned a technique where you press and let go of shift with precise timing, while keeping the mouse button down, but no idea if it's the same thing. It's definitely not as fast as Breezily though

Yea but it completely ruins the fact that it's only for people who really strive to improve. It's a good thought but think for two seconds. It kinda completely ruins ninja bridging and the fact that only a few could do it. As I said. Good intentions. Just think before you post. People don't go running around telling everyone this for a reason...

I could've burned you so hard. But I choose not to. (In case you were wondering, I would've said "Not like it made anything worse than it already is.") But I'm not going to straightup say it. You can look at out of curiosity. But what would've caused such brain damage??? 

This is why I always win flame wars xD

I get where youre coming from, I still think this is a positive thing with good intentions. I do see why someone might be pissed if they ruined your "secret" but shit happens and it doesnt always go your way, its also a pretty easy thing to look up.<br><br>to yoshi,<br>&nbsp;I didnt call him&nbsp;a "dick", I said, in response to what he said to notal, that if anyone was being a dick its him as he was trying to keep tactics secret. I didnt actually call him a dick or think he was a dick, all i did was compare him calling notal a dick to himself .-.<br><br>and on the thread about your ban i was answering canuck's question abd finally you got banned twice for generally being a dick, harrassing people<br>etc. (You know why, not going into anything)

Thanks Roman! Btw, you do need to practice, I can't breezily, but.. I can bridge without shifting, and the method I made was tough, but it paid off, I basically removed my shift, so I used to play without a shift and was forced to bridge without a shift key :D

Yea there is. You're just ignorant of the fact that there is. You don't have to always be facing one way or use the same methods. There is a way. I've been practicing it a bit. It's even more difficult than Breezily, but faster.

Why I am is because as I've stated. People don't walk around telling everyone how to for a reason. Yes, I respect the fact that someone is trying to help. But it makes something that was supposed to be only for people who really tried, who would go through all the trouble too accessible. The technique isn't too difficult, and people know what it is, but not many people care enough to put in the effort of finding out from videos and such. What separates the average, decently committed player, from the people who are trying really hard. It makes something that's supposed to show hard work and commitment worth practically nothing. It's what I use to bridge a lot because Breezily is quite difficult and inconsistent. Even though I like this server very much, I have to admit, the average OCN player is better than the average Avicus player. Practically half the people on OCN know how to ninja bridge which means a forums topic about ninja bridging on OCN means a lot less than something that few can do here. I really do appreciate the fact that someone's trying to help. But at the same time I feel like it kinda spoils it for others.&nbsp;<br><br>You can say it's exclusion, that it's not fair to others,<br>but it's unfair to the people who take pride in their bridging and the people who care.&nbsp;<br><br>I have nothing to be jealous about. I have other techniques, none are as consistent, but I don't see how I would be jealous with a couple more tricks up my sleeve. The issue is that ninja bridging is a main source of movement for me sometimes, and others. IT's not something anyone who knows how to really wants getting out

Why I am is because as I've stated. People don't walk around telling everyone how to for a reason. Yes, I respect the fact that someone is trying to help. But it makes something that was supposed to be only for people who really tried, who would go through all the trouble too accessible. The technique isn't too difficult, and people know what it is, but not many people care enough to put in the effort of finding out from videos and such. What separates the average, decently committed player, from the people who are trying really hard. It makes something that's supposed to show hard work and commitment worth practically nothing. It's what I use to bridge a lot because Breezily is quite difficult and inconsistent. Even though I like this server very much, I have to admit, the average OCN player is better than the average Avicus player. Practically half the people on OCN know how to ninja bridge which means a forums topic about ninja bridging on OCN means a lot less than something that few can do here. I really do appreciate the fact that someone's trying to help. But at the same time I feel like it kinda spoils it for others.&nbsp;<br><br>You can say it's exclusion, that it's not fair to others,<br>but it's unfair to the people who take pride in their bridging and the people who care.&nbsp;<br><br>I have nothing to be jealous about. I have other techniques, none are as consistent, but I don't see how I would be jealous with a couple more tricks up my sleeve. The issue is that ninja bridging is a main source of movement for me sometimes, and others. IT's not something anyone who knows how to really wants getting out

LOL, no. Sorry to ruin your moment, but you did not invent "Ninja Bridging", it was originated in OCN by many players, using different methods to create one efficient method.

Since when can you ninja bridge faster than Breezily bridging? Not shifting at all is always gonna be faster than pressing down shift at intervals. If you can "do it correctly", I'd like to see, but from your videos, you don't bridge as fast as Breezily bridgers.

It's not fair to exclude people from learning a technique. Also, I wouldn't say that ninja bridging is too much of a secret.

As I've said before. People don't run around telling everyone how for a reason. For example, if you had a great PvP combo that worked really well you wouldn't go around telling everyone how to do it. If you say you would I'm pretty sure that's a lie. Same concept. You could also say you're disregarding the people who want to keep it lower key's opinions and feelings. And how is it exclusion? Anyone who cared could've done research. Everyone had equal amounts of accessibility to start with. It just showed you put in the effort before.

This post's purpose was to help others who WANTS TO KNOW how to Ninja Bridge, not to the people who doesn't care and is just jealous that others know how to do it. Care about some other people... jeez.<br><br>EDIT: Breezily bridging is the fastest bridging technique, and the 'faster one' that you mentioned is probably auto-place or something.

I said I invented shift bridging, not breezily bridging, but i'm not 100% sure no one had used it before, but I had never seen anyone do anything of the sort, so I did learn it by myself without having seen or heard about it. And it's only after I started using it and showing some of my friends that it started appearing, so i'm pretty sure I was the one who invented it. Again, there might have been someone who had done it before, but since I didn't see anyone doing that before I started doing it I'm going to assume I invented it.<br><br>So yeah, idc if you believe me or not, but this is my reasoning for believing that I invented it.
