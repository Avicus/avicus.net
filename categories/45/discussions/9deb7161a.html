I'm getting older and more independent. I've been driving for a while and now need a way to pay for gas. I found a job at a local grocer and am now making a small hunk of cash.&nbsp;<br><br>What's your first job?<br><br>For those who don't have a job, where do you plan to work for a first job?<br><br>For everyone, what's your ideal job?<br><br>My ideal job would probably be something like a firefighter. They seem cool and badass. Or armed forces, like a sniper or AirForce pilot, cuz those are badass as well.
