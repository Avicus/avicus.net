Look, I'm not sure if this has been suggested before or not, so I'm going to suggest it anyway. Staff members, (more specifically Mods) should use an alt account to get what evidence they need to catch a hacker from time to time. Because I'm sure we all know most people hack when they think no staff members are online at the time. Anyway it was just a suggestion to help get rid of the hackers - things like <i>/vanish</i> or <i>/disguise</i> could help too.

Back in the day we actually did this. Some of the staff would have two accounts open at the same time, worked pretty well. Not sure if staff are still doing this.

Some mods don't have alt accounts, unfortunately. I for one didn't have one and I wouldn't spend more money on another account when I have one already.&nbsp;<br><br>Mods just need to be more active.

Yeah, I'm not asking mods to buy another account for this I'm just <u>suggesting</u>&nbsp;it for the mods who do have another account, and personally I think the mods are active enough and if they are not online just record the hacker and report them on a forum post, it's honestly not that hard :P.

<div>This is something that I already do I currently own about 6 or 7 alts and with the money that I get paid from making YouTube videos (yes I do actually make money) &nbsp;I use them to purchase morals which I use in either account giveaways or I use them too moderate Avicus.<br><br>Also useful especially for those hackers that like to toggle the clients or toggle the hacks I can easily log off log on with an alt and then I'll just decide hey there's no staff member on I can do whatever I want and get away with it when I'm actually on my old spectating the guy and recording him.</div><div><br>I do like this suggestion and I know that some people don't have enough money to buy alts but it's a good suggestion<br></div>

Not really neccesary I feel. You, moderators, could just go into spectator mode and most hackers won't notice you or think they're afk if they see your rank on the tab list or do /staff.<br><br>If you use an alt it'll take little longer time until you can ban the hacker if your computer is slow and you need to open a new window or if you already have two windows open you could lag while recording and maybe it won't be good as evidence then (if you once again have a bad computer). And it costs.<br><br><b>Note that I did just play before and don't know what /vanish did when you read this:</b><br>Rather have commands that can "remove" your moderator rank. Like your name doesn't show on the staff list (/staff and not the forum) and neither does the rank show in chat or the tab. If it's possible.

That's not a feasible answer, in a way it's avoiding the problem, because even if the mods are more active the hacker can just wait for one not to be on because there's no way there will always be a staffy on. It would probably be more effective to get people like that with something like /vanish, disguises/nicks or alts because it would seem as though there isn't a staffy on and they would be more likely to toggle, which in turn would make them easier to catch

I fully agree, which is why I propose introducing shifts to the team, i.e. one mod moderates for an hour then another takes over. This can be done by releasing a checklist of sorts whereby a mod signs up for a slot or two every day.

That's an idea that could work but it might be harder to execute (like getting the mods for the time slots, things could happen and they might not be able to be there, and similar things)

Agreed, but it would have the added benefit of revealing which mods are pulling their weight.
