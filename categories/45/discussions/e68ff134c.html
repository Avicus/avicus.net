I would understand if you were banned by accident, but you are banned on Avicus, Overcast and Badlion for hacking. I would like to know how it can happen <u>accidently</u> three times?

When you get banned on Teamspeak, your IP and your unique ID will be banned. He can't use the teamspeak server then. I'm 101% sure because I have my own teamspeakserver and I know many stuff about it.

Well, I don't believe you and I think that the staff won't either. You fucked your reputation with hacking and this is your 'reward' for that. Deal with it or get another router.

Look on the side and click on 'Appeal an infraction' if you post a story why they should unban you than they will look to it. And maybe even unban you. But take some time in writing the appeal. And DON'T be mean/cocky to staff. It won't help you for sure!<div><br></div><div><br></div>

If you filed an appeal, it won't be. If you're unbanned or where the appeal is accepted/"appealed" (from which I assumed) it'd be shaded green.
