I'd go for Gold. Having an alt seems much greater than it is.

If i get GOLD, my sis and bro will also be using the kits and such.... and may run a risk of one of them spawn camping cuz they think theyre doing so good.... but &nbsp;an alt has cons too.....

If you share your account with your sister and brother then you should get a new account so they don't get you banned.

If you want to support the server, then donate and get gold :)<br><br>If you buy another MC account, &nbsp;you donate to MC which helps run the game, which helps run Avicus, which techinacally supports Avicus.<br><br><br>Win Win bro :)

yeah get an alt<br><br>since you have siblings you might as well get one so you can give it to them. although that's not really fair that they get something and you don't....on your frikin birthday. tell them that you get to pick the name and they have let you hit them how ever hold you are times in the butt, back, wherever....

I don't see a point in an Alt unless it's just simply for a better name.<br>I used to want one so bad, got one, and never use it.

Alt is a great idea! If your siblings know your account they could get you banned or abuse the powers of Gold rank. Alt is love, alt is life.
