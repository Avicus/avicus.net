Now a lot of people may say "oh they donated so they deserve it because they donated" yes I know they donated and I respect them for that but I am sick and tired of going onto a nexus match and seeing every single donor on one team. Now some people may not think this is a problem but one thing I've realized is that no matter how good you are you will always get killed by a team of barbarians in nexus. It's ruins it for us non donors who may not have barbarian ( I know I do but some people don't).<br><br>This could be done by making sure that there's at least one donor on each team before another donor could join the same team as another donor.&nbsp;<br><br>Please just say -1 if you don't agree and don't be a complete jerk about it :p

They donated for the perks, therefore they should do what they wish with it; as long as it doesn't break the rules.<br><br>Team stacking is discouraged, but rarely seen.

The TeamSpeak crew can commonly be found "stacking a team." The teams even out in numbers pretty quickly. It's not against the rules that one team may have a large population of very good PvP'ers though :P

+1 Its somewhat called boosting, ( XP ) if another team is winning they leave their team and join the other team just for +5Xp, which I think is kind of plain unfair, but they did not break the rules, so its kind of useless..

Yes most of the donors are good at pvp but if you've got a donor team full of good pvpers and a non donor team with 1 really good pvper then that one really good non donor player will be unable to do anything due to them being grouped on by donors, who all have op classes.

That really stinks and I think there should be a rule for this ):<br>The worst thing is when you're on a TDM map like Titans and there's a 5v7 with 2&nbsp;donors-- there's just no way for the 5-person-team to win. I think the best way to fix this is to make a system where donors can't change the amount of players on a team by /join *team* by any more than 20%. This means if there's a match with 5v5, if you and your donator friend tried to join, both of you couldn't because you're changing the amount of players on that team using /join *team* by over 20%. If you're transferring 5 to 6, you're increasing 5 by 20%. This means when you're /join *team*ing, you're changing the player amount by 20%. Your friend then has to do play on the other team because if (s)he /join *team friend is on*, she'd increase the team amount by 40%-- you're going from 5 to 7. This can also be shown as an inequality. (If the amount of donors using /join *team* is x, and the amount of players on the other team is y,) x&nbsp;≤ .2y. If there are 5 people on a team, this means only 1 can join (1&nbsp;≤ 1).<br>I don't exactly know which side I'm on, though, because it's fun to be with a lot of your friends but sometimes it can be unfair ):

@Ironsoldier But if you leave the match there's no other nexus servers to play on because all the players flock to one server. And by saying that you are giving me the impression that donors have priority over non donors, which they do to a certain extent but the way you phrased it by saying "if you don't like it leave the match just sounds a bit mean. I know your intending to be mean or rude or anything but that phrasing does give that impression.

easiest way to get round this if your against a stacked team focus the crap out of one person e.g. sunrise, he gets annoyed because his kd is going down and he joins your team, all the donors follow and then your sorted with the new winning team.. simple :)

It's not really the amount of players that causes the problem..the teams even out eventually. For me it's just that most of the good players tend to be donators, and fighting a team with glitchy, gonzo, ducks, sunrise, and D00ZIE (it has happened a few times) is just as fun as putting a taser to my ass.
