Hi. Lets begin shall we?<br><br>Okay, I'm just going to cut to the chase. <br>I want to earn some money, I'm 16 and have some free time, kind of.<br>I don't want to involve my friends or family because what I'm going to do may be slightly illegal.. ha.<br>On Avicus, because i believe this community is cool enough to hear my out and don't really know where else to post this.<br><br><b>TheFreeTVProject (Its a work in progress)<br></b>&nbsp;Basically, the site would be driven off adverts and thats where our pay comes in.<br>We host upload movies to google drive and host in off the site, no money involved.<br>However, i don't want to waste time on a project knowing it would go to waste.&nbsp;<br><br>What i need...<br><br>1) Supporters<br>Tell me what movies you'll like to see. Share this project and respond to tell me you're interested<br><br>2) Partners<br>People who would help me upload vids to gDrive and share it on the site. You get a slice of the pie (money)<br><br>3) Haters<br>Please feel free to tell me I will free you can also feel free to fuck off.<br><br>Thank you for reading. Admins please feel free to take this thread down if you feel it is inappropriate.<br>Sorry if i don't respond immediately, having exams for the next few weeks. ("Have free time, kindof")

maybe a few 100s monthly at the start, then work our way up. I have earned money online b4, if we get the views advertising will pay and getting the views is really not that hard if we have the content and quality that no other site can match. Cause really at this moment, other sites are really sucking

Probably last question before deciding if I would ask to join or not. What are the chances that our ip can get flagged or we get in trouble for doing this (police and shit). Or is the worse that can happen is that the site gets taken down?

I don't think it would be serious enough that the police gets involved, becos there are other sites doing it and we'r hosting the vids off 3rd party hosts. But if the receive a warning i will take down the site.

Where would the warning go? Would it go to the person's email who is hosting the video? To the internet provider?

So... you have to download a movie illegally and then upload it to your site illegally?<br><br>I know for a fact there can be a $250,000 fine.

This thread promotes illegal activity, and the forums <b>certainly </b>do not support this.<br><br>I highly suggest that you do not proceed with this; if you wish to earn some money, find a legal way to do it.<br><br>Good luck.
