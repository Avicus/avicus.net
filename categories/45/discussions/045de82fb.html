Hey,&nbsp;<br>I was just wondering if the upcoming Tournament is planned to be streamed on platforms like Twitch or HitBox? It might be cool to bring a bunch of commentators to live comment on the games.&nbsp;<br>This will be the first tournament that I will see, so I don't know if this has already been set up or is planning to be. Moreover this also could be used as a promotional strategy to bring in more players to the community (just a suggestion) - haven't seen that being done yet on Minecraft streams.&nbsp;<br><br>Thanks<br>Regards<br>-hera

My channel is soccermaster89 on twitch. I will be streaming in this tourney and hopefully commentating matches with some other media ranks. So to answer your question, the tourney will be streamed with every match available to watch.
