Hey everyone.<br><br>Recently I've been receiving a little bit of negative feedback, regarding myself, and the Event Committee not "doing anything". Honestly, I can see why it would appear that way. But I just want to clear a few things up.<br><br>I made a post about an official UHC. That, is still going to happen. Along with that, more events are being planned between myself and the EC. However, I decided to hold off on hosting any more Community Events until the Nise Update is released. I don't remember informing any of you about this, so it is entirely my fault for some of you to assume that we're not doing anything.<br><br>In a nutshell, there is a lot of planning going on behind the scenes. However, I won't be hosting any more Community Events until the Update is officially released. So entirely, I hope for those of you that are convinced that nothing is happening on the Community Side of Avicus, we are working pretty hard.&nbsp;<br><br>So if you notice that no events are taking place for a little while, this is the reason why. I apologize for the confusion.<br><br>Regards, -Jake

You could tell us about your "planning" so that we are better informed. So we know that things actually go on.

Still...&nbsp;<br><br>But anyways thanks for the update on things. One thing I have to ask, is when are ref apps opening? Not for me, but for others, it's a week after they were supposed to be put up =_=&nbsp;<br><br>Anyways, thx for this, really :)&nbsp;<br><br>In case you didn't get it, I was joking about ref apps.
