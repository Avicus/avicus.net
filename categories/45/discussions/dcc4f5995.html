So recently some junk got onto my computer somehow.<br><br>AVG found 1 out of 2 of the junk to be a virus.<br>I researched the other crap to find out that it was some what of a PUP.<br>The junk was called "iLivid" and I want to know if I should remove it or not.

In the PC World, a PUP is a Potentially Unwanted Programming, such as adware, toolbars, and browser hijackers.<br>Not as dangerous as a virus but still can cause a bit of damage.

iLivid somehow was downloaded on my computer some time ago, that's when adware and unwanted toolbars started to popup. I recommend uninstalling it completely.

Whenever I click a download button on MediaFire, I usually see my file save that I wanted to download, but also a separate window with iLivid saying it will install in "this amount of seconds"

I've had a couple of experiences with iLivid, on my clients' computers, and my own as well. I would recommend you uninstall it somehow, since it does lead to a ton of ads popping up everywhere.
