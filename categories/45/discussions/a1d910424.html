So where I live in Minnesota it will be -40 and they still won't cancel school!!!! I mean what does it take to cancel school? People will be standing outside waiting for buses getting frostbite all over the place!!! So anyways how cold or how much snow do you have to have to have school off?

I'm pretty sure schools need to cancel if it's -40, the road will freeze over, and I'm not sure how safe that is for little kids. School is canceled a lot here in Stanley, Idaho, when it's -30, as the roads freeze over. :3

Basically, Winter is Summer weather and Summer is Winter weather over here. Or sometimes the weather is just completely random like when its 90 degrees one day then 50 another.

Anyone see the tweets about "FCPS"?<br>lol i live in that county and it was crazy today. It snowed, and the roads weren't cleared so a lot of buses got to school really late. I heard that even a bus tipped over but im not sure it's true. I also heard some parents were suing them for having school today, but rumors come and go.

My guess is if there is a blizzard. But, I live in one of the hottest parts of Australia in Summer, then for some reason, we go down to the coldest parts in Winter XD
