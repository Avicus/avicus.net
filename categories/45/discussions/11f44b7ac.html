Now my school have just made it official that we can bring our own laptops in next year. Now, I am really excited about this but I want to make sure I don't make the wrong choice. So, if you guys could help me find the ideal laptop it would be appreciated. Now there is no price limit, but just keep it realistic. I'm looking forward to your responses and I apologize if someone has done a similar thread.

I would recommend the Lenovo W550 if you want to be able to play games, as well as do school related activities, or the Lenovo Y50 if it is just for gaming.

I have an ASUS something or other with an i5 core, and it's worked beautifully running minecraft, cs:go, ect. ect. Pretty much never had any lag (except for things in minecraft that make even the bestest of beefy desktop computers lag) except for ping-lag.

If you're just going to be using it for school, buy a cheap laptop that you wont regret too much about getting into accidents with it.&nbsp;<br><br>Like RoyalCurry said, a chromebook is a good choice

I'd suggest getting a new laptop... the consequences for a battery that overheats too often is catastrophic to your health.<br><br>Let's... just say that the battery is Lithium Ion and when those things overheat they'll turn into balloons before expanding then venting Lithium Ion particles. <b>(Which all that gas immediately turns to fire in open oxygen)</b>.<br><br>Though not as deadly as Lithium Polymer, it can still cause harm to your lungs with it's horrendous smell and the way it first makes an object it's in too hot to touch <b>(A samsung melted through this one guy's pocket and burnt his legs) </b>then the battery inside explodes and turns it's object into a thing surrounded in flames.<br><br>Please. Get a new laptop as soon as you can with great heatsinks or&nbsp;<i>try&nbsp;</i>to build a laptop... I guess.

Actually, I've heard that Windows 10 is really good, but Windows 8 is about the same as Vista. I feel like every other major Windows release is good, like XP, 7, and now 10.

One side of my computer gets really hot, like Vlad's computer, but my battery always stays at room temperature because it isn't near where my laptop gets to 200 degrees.

It must be some other component of your computer then. However, it's best to not risk it as first of all,&nbsp;<i>that&nbsp;</i>is an extremely hot temperature and it can potentially heat up the parts connected and it can create a reaction where the temperature spreads slowly.<br><br>I mean, that's like...&nbsp;<i>really hot...&nbsp;</i>

Well, I might have been exaggerating a little bit, but once I actually tried to toast a piece of bread on it and it got toasted pretty quickly and saved electricity. Also, It's not really a problem once&nbsp;I put one of those laptop cooling pads under my laptop, trust me they cool it <b>A LOT</b>. In addition, I've had my computer since 2009 and it's never had a problem before, therefore I think I'm good.

I own the Lenovo Y50, and BY GOLLY it's amazing. As well as I use it for gaming, such as I can run GTA 5 on High-Very high graphics, and Minecraft at 60fps with full graphics, plus loads of other games such as Watch Dogs and Sonic Generations, EVEN WHILE RECORDING.&nbsp;<br><br>I sometimes use it with Photoshop, Sony Vegas, After Effects and obviously, Microsoft Word and that magic.&nbsp;<br>I personally think it's worth the £800 I paid. But I am aware I can build a VERY GOOD PC with £800. I guess you pay for the portability of power -_-.<br><br>I'd recommend the Lenovo Y50.
