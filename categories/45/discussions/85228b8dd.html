You know they can easily tell if you are ban evading right? So if you are, saying that in this topic is really stupid.

._. What do you think? Is: When you are banned in [x] account, and for the goal of enter to the server, you enter with other [x] account. okay?

This is hillarious, executive thinks that he has turned into some kind of badass troll. Well new is you haven't. You have just become a dick. (Well more of one) You were being racist and abusive. Also if you think announcing that you are ban evading makes you funny and badass it doesn't. It is just stupidity. You are a confirmed knob and everyone here thinks so. You are not helping to change that image so please just leave the forums, archive this post or whatever because you are just embarrassing yourself further. You remind me of those attention seeking idiots at school, have you been neglected as a child, adoption? They are usual causes to make something as ridiculously stupid as you. Good day.

&nbsp; &nbsp;Do not make threads on the forums when you're banned. (Decreases your chances). Publicly telling people that you'll attempt to ban evade is not good for you, unless you don't want to get unbanned. Be patient with the staff and actually appeal your punishment so they can look at it and make up their minds (Staff is very considerate with players so they'll show great amount of understanding).&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; Also to all those guys swearing and all, we could've explained it simply to him so he wouldn't have continued.

Your reply would be mature and the correct thing to do in most circumstances however executive knows what he is doing wrong and he thinks it makes him funny however he just looks pathetic. He has a bone to pick with Avicus apparently and he has just turned into one, messed up, pathetic ruin. So what you have done is right but please don't try to help him out.
