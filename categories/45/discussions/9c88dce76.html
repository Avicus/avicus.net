I'm a little confused here. Is it actually in rotation on a different server or was it just made on a different server?

I tried to warn him that your not allowed to use a map from avicus and submit it to another server, he already made the post then "deleted" it... He proceeds to not believe me...

I don't see why it wouldn't be allowed then as long as you get a working YAML

It's not avicus's property until it's in rotations. Right now it's his map, he can submit it to a different server if I wants to in pretty sure.

If the creators want to submit it to other servers, they can. It is their map. Avicus uses it because the creators gave it to them. The creators can give it to other servers too.

If it's in the Avicus rotary, you're going to have to take it out before having it on another server.&nbsp;<br>If you created the map initially for Avicus and it hasn't been accepted or you never posted it to the forums you can do whatever you want with it.

You can, but keep in mind it will most likely be removed from Avicus' rotations.<br><br>Source: Asked ParaSpider if I could submit Palm Rust to OCN xD
