I am on stage crew for the upcoming production of&nbsp;<i>Grease</i> at my school. &nbsp;For the next 6.5 hours, I am trapped in a stuffy auditorium and I am not allowed (for the most part) to talk. &nbsp;My boyfriend refuses to respond to texts so I am utterly alone. &nbsp;Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to respond to this post and just tell me about yourself. &nbsp;I am not in game much so this is pretty much my method of learning who the prominent members of the community are. &nbsp;You can also ask me anything. &nbsp;I will literally answer any question, even if you don't really want the answer, so be careful. &nbsp;And have fun!<br><br>UPDATE 17:20:09 EDT: My boyfriend is currently responding to texts again.

Conscious belief that one race is in some way superior to another. &nbsp;I say conscious because I believe that subconscious emotions aren't easily changeable and the only thing that someone can really do to change their behavior is to change their conscious thoughts. &nbsp;I won't judge someone on their subconscience.

So if I am making fun of someone's immaturity by saying "You're, like, 12," don't be offended. &nbsp;You're the most mature 12 year old that I know.

I am Tanpiku. Former moderator and head mapdev of the server and a current official/livestreamer/mapdev, I partake in a lot of stuff behind the door that isn't usually too much known. I've been on Avicus for over a year now and a year by now being a staff member. With ups and downs, I've made many friends along the way and have done work with the others in shaping up the server. Being a member of the map committee back in the old server, that is when I made my first debut eventually becoming the first map developer (being the user rank, heh). <br><br>My first map here was Serenitox and I found out this server first by Avalanche Network, then secondarily to make me return some people accusing Avicus of ripping off OCN. Checking it out, I actually got hooked in with it really quick. The moment I cherish most is being interviewed the first time and having the doors open to me for all the opportunity and friends I could make, and the moment I cherished the least is when I abused a glitch, ending up in a half-retirement half-demotion.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;I don't like going too in-depth of my IRL, because it's boring and is more trouble than it's worth, but if you want my Avicus history then yeah. First joined in MCZone, and got teamspleefed on Senex II the first time I joined :()

Actually Lieutenantpants told me not to do it and continues to remind me how much "better" OCN is. &nbsp;This was all me. &nbsp;Before my friend group found OCN, all they did was AVN and so I did too (a little). &nbsp;I learned from someone that they only had one developer and so I thought that that was too much work for one person so I decided that I could help. &nbsp;I sent an email asking to be a developer before developer apps were even open :P

Do you think if something happened at Avicus you'd be interested in giving it a shot for OCN? (If the opportunity was there, of course.) I probably have asked this before but forgot the answer!

I'd be more than willing if they'd be willing to accept me. It's a little more strict at OCN so I'd habe to get used to that but I think I could.

Winter, but i like summer very much though<br>For me, i like frozen dead trees, frozen ground with meters of untouched snow.<br>It's also very calm during winter, no bugs, and for me it has the best landscapes.<br>Also i like the cold.<br><br>For summer, i love not having to suit up on heavy clothing, and i just feel more cheered up<br>Also, summer holidays.<br>The bugs and the extreme heat is pretty annoying tho, it sometimes takes me 4 hours just to fall asleep from the heat.

Winter, but i like summer very much though<br>For me, i like frozen dead trees, frozen ground with meters of untouched snow.<br>It's also very calm during winter, no bugs, and for me it has the best landscapes.<br>Also i like the cold.<br><br>For summer, i love not having to suit up on heavy clothing, and i just feel more cheered up<br>Also, summer holidays.<br>The bugs and the extreme heat is pretty annoying tho, it sometimes takes me 4 hours just to fall asleep from the heat.

Yeah one of the things I don't like about summer is the heat. &nbsp;I get really bad migraine headaches that are aggravated by heat.

I LOVE moonlight sonata. &nbsp;Have you heard Angel Eyes by Jim Brickman? &nbsp;That one is really beautiful and is in C major except this one part that's in G (I think) so it's fairly easy to play. &nbsp;Have you heard Étude Opus 10, No. 3 by Chopin? &nbsp;It's amazing and my next big project.

Hell yeah! &nbsp;We had no money when I was little so that's all we had for like the first 9 years of my life. &nbsp;I was a boss at Super Mario 64. Which we now have for the Wii because the N64 broke and ruined my life.

Hey, pavilion and&nbsp;Enflaming!&nbsp;Hope you guys don't mind, but I wanted to give some insight based on my personal experience.<br><br>I'm bisexual, or I'm attracted to both males and females. There's some things I like about females, and some things I like about males. &nbsp;I don't know why I am, I just... am. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯<br><br>I first discovered that I was "different" in sixth grade. At the time, I didn't even know that liking dudes was a thing; like, no idea it even existed. When I found out, I was like "...Yeah, this might be me". To me, body parts don't matter, it's the person itself that matters.<br><br>My family... hmm. I think they knew something was different about me, but they couldn't prove it because I've never dated anyone. Only my mom knows, and even though she's fine with it, I still get the feeling that she wants me to be with a girl. It's kinda hard, but it's not like I chose this, you know?<br><br>My friends, it's a different story. See, I go to a charter school, one that focuses on the arts, so you're going to see a lot of "out" people. My friends are perfectly fine with it. It's almost like it doesn't matter, and it shouldn't. Those are the people that you should be around and I'm glad they're in my life.<br><br>It wasn't as much as a surprise, but I was definitely&nbsp;scared. There's a part of me that never wants to date or marry someone because I feel like it's going to make things very complicated. I even tried to make myself asexual, but that didn't work out. Right now, I'm just going to focus on school. But if someone makes me feel something different inside, I'm definitely going to see where it goes.

i'm bi also :)<br><br>i've only known it for about a year now, and right away i came out to most of my friends and family. i knew they would accept it and sometimes my parents have trouble with understanding that kinda stuff but they are great about it 99% of the time.<br>labels are hard, i thought i might've been gay at one point, then pan, and also aro for a bit. i came out to everyone i know in october last year, and of course everyone was awesome about it<br>i think some people felt weird about it cause they knew me before and they never thought i experienced attraction to any gender other than female<br><br>actually, the worst i've faced is on the internet where people have called me various slurs and other nasty stuff

It's so awesome to see people that are out and proud :D<br>And something that people seem to often forget is that, while there's nothing you can do to change your sexuality, it is fluid. &nbsp;It can change just as your interests in other things change.<br><br>Nasty slurs are the worst. &nbsp;I really don't care, words mean nothing to me, but I still am on a crusade to eliminate such slurs from the Internet because I know that for some (maybe even most) people, those words are hurtful, whether the speaker knows it or not.

For programming, my favorite was probably 1.2.5. &nbsp;I literally have no clue why. &nbsp;I just remember that MCP (Minecraft Coder Pack, for those who don't know, is a program that makes the Minecraft code readable) worked really well for that version and I didn't have issues. &nbsp;If it wasn't 1.2.5 it was 1.2.something. &nbsp;For playing, I like the game as simple as I can get it (within reason) so I miss beta 1.8.1. &nbsp;That's where I started playing. &nbsp;I'm a bit late compared to most other people I talk to but I really liked that version and sometimes I still play it for nostalgia purposes.<br><br>I used to do client side modding but I really have fallen away from that for one reason or another. &nbsp;I just don't really use it. &nbsp;I feel like server-side coding is much more rewarding. &nbsp;I can't really explain this so well, but in my mind it's cleaner and feels more like it's something that is supposed to happen. &nbsp;Just one of those things that doesn't really fit within the constrains of human language.<br><br>Thank you, I'm sure lucky too :3
