Just start by casually talking to her about school or something, then move on from there, talk about something that you both have interest in or both have in common, and guide the conversation along. Keep her attention, and if it becomes awkward or something just change the topic and keep talking to her. That's a first step, at least based on my experiences.<br><br>Also, always remember:<br><br><img alt="" src="http://2damnfunny.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/If-Internet-Explorer-Is-Brave-Enough-To-Ask-You-To-Be-Your-Default-Browser-Youre-Brave-Enough-To-Ask-a-Girl-Out_208x208.jpg">

Be confident and nise, it's okay if you're nervous to talk to her, she might be too! Have small talk and make her laugh &amp; smile. Find some things in common and get to know more about her. Just make sure you don't lie about liking/disliking something just because she does. (Bonus points if you sing/serenade her! :P)

Once you're ready, go for it. You might not get an opportunity like this for a while, it's good to seize the day. Just say screw it. What is the worst that could happen? Everything is only temporary. Just pep talk yourself into it. That's what I do when I do this kind of stuff.

1. Make sure she's single and straight. Girls will friendzone you if she has a man or if she isn't straight.

2. Just say "Hi, what's up?" on the bus. Slowly become her friend. But don't be obsessive! Show that you aren't creepy or a loner by talking to your friends, too.

3. Ask if she wants to hang out some time, but only if it's going well. You do NOT want to be that random guy who asks random girls out.

Got yourself a gf.
Ask for her number and continue.

Just a quick tip:
Nice guys don't finish last. The cocky ones and the non confident ones do. Take care of yourself and be confident in perfect doses.

As you said you haven't talked to her before, I would say a "Hi" is enough. Try to be confident in yourself, even when it's the first time talking to this girl. No, you don't ask for a number at first, you should especially not sing to her or tell her you like her before you've even talked to her once. Ask her stuff, tell her stuff about you, girls like it when you show them you are interested, when you actually listen. <br><br>Good luck my friend :)

Ebirdy, ebirdy, ebirdy... Let HER talk. Girls like it when people listen to them. If she isn't comfortable with telling you things, make small talk. Getting a girlfriend is no easy thing for guys who aren't... "Hot". We have to work for it. And as for confidence.... Dude, trust me. Don't be scared, just walk up, and introduce yourself. "Hi, I'm (name). What's your name?" Then make small talk. &nbsp;Good luck dude!

Well you're younger, so you got that to take into account. Unless you LOOK the age gap, it's gonna be mostly personality/ conversation based. And about the waiting game, see, you can become her friend, but if you stay too long in the friend zone you're gonna get stranded. Miss your chance, she moves on. Ask too early, you might make things awkward. Now, don't do anything different cos of what I said if you honestly think that's the way to go, just bear in mind you gotta time things right.

A girl or guy who doesn't like you for who you are isn't worth it, you should never change for someone. Don't be nervous around her, talk to her like you could tell her almost anything. Be yourself, be confident and remember to breath. You don't to rush into anything, just act like yourself. And also remember that most of the time guys or girls get friend zoned because they don't tell the other person that they like them. So stay strong, be confident, be yourself. Make sure you're ready for a relationship if she likes you back though, and make sure you treat her like a princess when you get her ;)<br>EDIT: I added guy/girl for anyone who wants advice, so xD Yeah.

Just start by casually talking to her about school or something, then move on from there, talk about something that you both have interest in or both have in common, and guide the conversation along. Keep her attention, and if it becomes awkward or something just change the topic and keep talking to her. That's a first step, at least based on my experiences.<br><br>Also, always remember:<br><br><img alt="" src="http://2damnfunny.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/If-Internet-Explorer-Is-Brave-Enough-To-Ask-You-To-Be-Your-Default-Browser-Youre-Brave-Enough-To-Ask-a-Girl-Out_208x208.jpg">

<b>ebirdy9</b><br><br>From my experience with girls and love. This is the best help I can possibly give you: <u>Be yourself</u>.<u></u> You may find talking to that girl or just approaching her nerve-racking, so? It just means you like her, if you stutter when you talk to her, than just calm down, don't get embarrassed. I stutter when I speak, I am not very self-confident, but I don't care. People have said to me, right in the face, and I just said: "So what?". It's part of you, who you are. If you get off at the same bus stop, then just walk along side her, and just ask how her day went, nothing to much. Day by day you can progress, ask something more personal, start to make jokes, make it a 'thing'. That you and her walk from the bus together and have a nice chat. If you only see her at the bus, then occasionally say something 'Nice day today, eh?' something subtle, just so she knows you notice her. Every relationship is unique, and I can't help you anymore unless you give me something to work with. You may feel asking for help on the forums can seem better, but it's manufactured by us, stop. Think. What do want to do? What would you do? And that's what you should chose,&nbsp;<b>your</b> ideas. What's the harm in trying?<br>This is 100% true, the first proper relationship I had (I'm only 13), started by me just picking up her pencil in a test, she smiled and whispered 'Thank you', and that sparked our friendship.<br><br>Take it easy, Jack.
