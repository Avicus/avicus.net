I guess it's rude to keep you guys all in the dark. Firstly, I'd like to say thank you so much to the staff team for giving me this wonderful opportunity for bringing me in! I've learned so much, like, no kidding. I've also met so many new, wonderful people that I will never forget. I guess the reason why I left would be because I'm starting to have a bunch of work piling up on me. It has nothing to do with any of the recent senior staff promotions. Really, it's about what else life has to offer for me right now. I just don't think that I will be able to commit as much time as I did in the past in the upcoming future.&nbsp;For the recently promoted, congratulations to you! Make me proud by bringing up the name of Avicus.&nbsp;<br><br>Cheers, boys and girls.

You've got to be kidding. This...is way too much to take in one day. Stormz, you were one of the nicest people I've ever met. Along with that, you were also able to do a great job as a moderator. I respect you for that. Good luck in life.

I've already talked to you on skype, but you will be missed very much. You were so great in helping me with my situation earlier this year and I am so glad that you helped me. You basically saved someone's life and I thank you for that! Hopefully we can get back together again sometime. :]&nbsp;<br><br>&lt;3
