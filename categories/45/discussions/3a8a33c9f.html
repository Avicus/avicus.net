Hello, I'm John a new Junior Moderator for Avicus and I would be happy to hear more from the players of the community. One way I thought would be interesting and fun would be through the explanation of the story behind the creation or adaptation of your Minecraft skin! I would love to read how you came up to getting your skin and to get to know you better as-well. :)<br><br><b><u>**PLEASE LEAVE APPROPRIATE OR COMMUNITY FRIENDLY RESPONSES</u></b>

I was considering giving a full bio of my skin, but I decided against it.<br><br>So basically I like mages, so I got this skin, just a lighter blue version. However a manager at Fyreuk had the same skin as me b/c of Mianite, so I just changed to this sexy dark blue. :P<br><br>Thats the benefit of having 4 different backup skins.

The story behind my skin is very simple.<br><br>I liked Sunset Shimmer, I picked Sunset Shimmer. :P<br><br>I liked her due to her character (Bronies will understand if they watched the 2nd movie). Though sudden, I welcomed it warmly, and it just grew on me.
