Wake up 20 minutes before school starts. Go to the bathroom and browse Avi forums and 9GAG. realize There's 10 minutes till school starts. Wipes ass, gets out of bathroom and gets dressed, brushes teeth, eats breakfast and prepares lunch in 5 minutes. MOM STILL ISNT READY. I'm late for school. Teacher screams at me. Go on with my life. School finishes and I go home. I eat, then do homework. Then I secretly play MC because my parents are paranoid and don't let me play during weekdays (I dont get bad grades btw). Thats on a weekday.<br><br>On a weekend day, I get up, go to karate, get back to house, take a shower and get dressed. Binge MC for 4 hours then go to an Armenian activity (where we learn about our history and stuff. Its the only activity I'm excited to go to).<br>Get back home, and do homework. On sunday exact same thing except for no Armenian activity
