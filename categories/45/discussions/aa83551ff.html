Yeah, I understand the massive difference Avicus has to a Prison/Faction server but then again I wrote my response poorly.The point I was trying to make is so Avicus could branch out more with a diversity of games to bring a wide contrast between people. I remember when McZone was bustling with people and now we have a couple of servers here and there. I just want to see more people on Avicus that could truly see how much Avicus has to offer the community.

I can't really envision myself managing a server, but since we're just speculating here, and talking about implausible deeds by the same matter, I'd try to work with what we currently have in our hands, and enhance it somehow, then slowly expand with more gamemodes and options, including whatever that would yield enough profit.

NEVER add Prison/Factions. They aint&nbsp;minigames. Plus hypixel&nbsp;owns the skywars&nbsp;community rn. I would like it if my friends were dragged over to Avicus's&nbsp;SKYWARS&nbsp;rather than DTM :( &nbsp;I have seen other servers run skywars, even mineplex, but none have a good feel to it, unlike hypixels's

I would bring back Avicus' version of Skywars and rename it "Ragnorak" or Onyx.<br><br>I would advertise more and try to get direct player feedback and more involvement with evolution of the server.<br><br>I would base moderator promotions on how well the moderator communicates with players AND how well they're able to deal out punishments.<br><br>I would base the punishment more on a gray scale moral system instead of a black and white one.<br><br>I would NOT add prison or factions - too common, need more originality.<br><br>I would be more active in staff-community relations with weekly map-testing events, staff vs community "Tournaments", or do as OCN sometimes does and add "Mutations" to maps and world edit...<br><br>Mutations allow map devs, admins and owner to edit a map with certain attributes like mobs, blitz, higher XP, higher credits or etc...<br><br>In general, it would be a pleasant atmosphere that will be more lenient to players and ensuring that their experience is fun whilst making sure that those who TRULY deserve punishment deserve it.
