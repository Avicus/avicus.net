So recently, there has been&nbsp;<b></b>rant(mainly inloc) but over if Puredogs gets their "prize money". they have made posts about this, but have been a bit too toxic about it(reminds me of mys-). I am wondering if the Puredogs will get their money, or the staff will get new toys and such. SOrry about the tags, but there is money involved, and you made a promise.&nbsp;<img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/22eb178f7bc34a68bd617e94f4220194?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/Posighdon.html" style="color: none">Posighdon</a> &nbsp;<img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/1c74c43029a0471fb30bcc2d9031ebcb?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/Tazz.html" style="color: Gray">Tazz</a>

It's too late now, but when this first happened it should have been reversed.&nbsp;<br>Meaning:<br>- Team DQd.<br>- Replay other games.<br>- Finish the tourney.<br>It blatantly says in the rules that this team should have been DQd, therefore I don't even know why there was a vote in the first place, but whatever. It's too late now, although I'm not sure that the money should go to anyone. The team that won shouldn't have even been in the final round according to the rules.&nbsp;<br><br>Imo the money should go back to whoever sent it in. The rules weren't held up, making the event flawed. (This is my opinion, it probably won't happen.)

They voided their right to the money when they broke the tournament rules and cheated. As has been previously stated, the people who donated the money should get it back.<br><br>Also, fine Kyoal.
