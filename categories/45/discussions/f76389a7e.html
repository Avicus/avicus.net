Most likely when I did my first interview, sure I didn't get accepted but the nervous breakdowns were real xD Another cool moment was learning about this: ^_^. That one face lead me to interviews lmao.<br><br>There was also some really cool moments in TeamSpeak, Nebula, Elimination and Control The Hill☻ Just can't pick a favourite though.
