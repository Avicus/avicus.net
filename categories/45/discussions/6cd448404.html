I was just thinking a minute ago while browsing the forums what lasted impact I had had on the community when I realised how much of an impact and how important MC Zone &amp; Avicus have been. The things I learnt, the people I met, the memories made really didn't compare to anything else I was doing at the time. As small and insignificant a minecraft server is in the grandness of the universe, this community has had a lasting impact on so many.

I probably wouldn't have a Minecraft life. I would probably be a much more productive person and I would get a lot done, and have a different life style. But as small as Avicus is, in the grand scheme of things, I've learnt so much from so many amazing people. 
I heard of one guy (can't remember who it was) who split up with his girlfriend because he wouldn't stop playing Avicus. Hardcore dedication right there...
