my minecraft is crashing every time i try to make it full screen, and i am only getting about 30 fps. this is a new problem since windows 10 installed itself when i went to eat dinner last night. I have completely uninstalled minecraft and tried various versions of the game and the problem still occurs. can someone help?

You need to make sure you have a <b><u>64BIT VERSION OF JAVA!</u></b><u></u> for any of what I say to work.<br>(this is for anyone that gets that problem still)<br>if your using the traditional Minecraft launcher you have to load it up and edit the Minecraft profile you have your Minecraft account on. go to the very bottom of the edit profile page and "JVM Arguments" will be there check the box and edit the line next to it to look like this:<br><br><br>-Xmx3G -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:+CMSIncrementalMode -XX:-UseAdaptiveSizePolicy -Xmn128M<br><br><br>if this doesn't work then you dont have enough system ram or a powerful enough graphics card. You may need to buy more RAM.

When you use 64bit versions of programs, then you surely already have enough RAM.

Actually if the only reason you have Java is for Minecraft, uninstall it. Java has been known to have many bugs and issues, and Minecraft has a built-in version of Java now so you don't need to install it at all.
