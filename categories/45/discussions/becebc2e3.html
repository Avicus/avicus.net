Um.. recently, i've had things happening such as friends leaving like AwarriorVenom. I feel like a distraction or not wanted on avicus for some reason. I'm getting a bit bored of playing this same mini-games over and over again and not really accomplishing much. I feel like I don't have many friends and feel like im not wanted. I feel like I caused trouble and many more things. Everyone's getting mad at me for some reasons that I don't wish to say. I've had some problems just with some friends and "stuff" going on. I just feel like I don't belong on Avicus.<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://avicus.net/Slicorn?tab=about">http://avicus.net/Slicorn?tab=about</a><br><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/nDFslgE.png"><br>Wow, my skin has some colours missing on the hair .-.<br><br>Team Envy, ill still be running the team, managing and helping out!<br>And for Paraspider, and Evocal. I just wanted to say thank you guys soo much for inspiring me to start building and getting me this far. I haven't gave up on map building, ill still be making maps of avicus as some day I may come back, so don't hold back on map dev &lt;3<br><br>Some day I might come back, but for now Adios Amigos &lt;3<br>#RipSliccy
