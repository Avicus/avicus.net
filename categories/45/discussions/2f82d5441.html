No this is not a goodbye post for everyone to see, so keep your tears away for this. Yes, I am getting tired of avicus, hell this is a really good server. But I can't forgive myself for not thinking back to Mczone and how fun it was compared to Avicus. I know one thing that the server did wrong.<br><br><br>Why did you guys fix things that weren't broken?<br><br><br>When avicus came out:<br>Why did we remove Nexus?<br>Why were the kits changed in HG?<br>Why aren't kits purchasable by themselves, rather than just ranks?<br>Why were some maps removed from Nebula?<br>Why aren't maps randomized in HG?<br><br>When avicore came out:<br>Why were the kits changed in Nexus? (Except tank and heavy those are just retarded)<br>Why in the love of GOD are TDM matches are happening in Nebula? Just make them nexus.<br><br><br>And many more.<br><br>I'm just saying that I want to keep going on this server but all I see here is frustration.

Well, Nebula needs TDMs for maps like Rapture. The way the map is designed, it wouldn't play well as a DTM.<br><br>Other than that, i agree with everything else here.

You don't get it. Nexus is TDM with kits. TDM is just TDM with block placing and breaking.&nbsp;<br><br>I plan on making a TNT map that's just like that. Just gratuitous explosions and TNT being hurled at the enemy and you not being able to build in the void!&nbsp;<br><br>The only way to cross is to Icarus haha!<br><br>Anyway, i went off topic there, yeah, pretty much what i said on the first two sentences.

Yeah, I don't see why Nebula TDm is a problem..<br>I love how you can break and build blocks to your advantage and how everything is fair due to no one having better kits than you because they've played for longer.<br>I feel like Nexus should have a TDM where you can't break blocks on one wall and a TDM where you can on the other.

I remember you were a wizard at mini game suggestions. You had some nice stuff before Avicore.<br><br>What happened? Why did you stop? We have 2 empty places in the lobby, 1 probably reserved for an old McZone game (which better be the same as it was before Avicus).&nbsp;<br><br>Pls more games

Stop thinking about the old days. Guess what? They're gone. You can't get them back. All this nostalgia is pointless. In 6 months you'll be looking back and referring now to the good old times.

Senex 3 and Rendezvous 3 only focused on aesthetics.<br>That's why the sucked so bad.
