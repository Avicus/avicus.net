People always sound suprised that compaines do this. They're a company to make money, not make sure you get your daily reccomended amount of calcium.&nbsp;<br><br>Sausages only need to be 5% meat in Ireland.<br>Pork sausages only need to be 10% pork

"Organic"<br>"Organic products" are only required to have 70% organic ingredients in the US. That may seem like a small allocated percentage (30%) for non-organic material, but it's a matter of what that material is.<br>Also, hey aux :D

Mc Donalds say that their chicken nuggets are made from 100% chicken, not quite. Lets just say you could get very sick if you only ate Mc Donalds chicken nuggets.

I wouldn't be so concerned with the percentage of "chicken" in the nuggets so much as what they're passing off as chicken.&nbsp;
