We had an MCZone throwback lobby a few months ago for a month or two. It's sort of an annual thing, I believe. Besides, the current one looks better.

Keenan says that he started the minecraft server when he was 14, and he's around 18 now. It's only been 4 years.<br><br>Anyways, I like this! And I do remember that lobby, but I don't recall the Enders portals. At the time, I played on Tiny render distance so maybe that's why.

Correct me if I'm wrong but, mczone was 2011/2012 and terrascape was before that. So technically it has only been 4/5 years of mczone and like 6/7 for terrascape, or whatever it was called back then.
