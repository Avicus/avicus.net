Clicking speed

One thing I've noticed is that many good pvpers tend to click very fast. What I'm wondering is what is a good enough click speed to be able to do decently against good players. All help appreciated :)

A lot of people say 6 cps is the same as, say, 12 cps. However, I've noticed that when I get 10+ cps it is much easier to get opponents into a combo. While you can only hurt a player twice per second, not all your clicks will register (mainly due to connection) so the more clicks you give, the better chance of you connecting more hits to your opponent, as long as you aim properly.<br><br>I've heard that 8 cps is the sweet spot in terms of clicking speed.

7cps or higher. It is very hard too click fast, you have too either jitter click or use Stan's vibrator.

The max clickspeed of minecraft I believe is 4CPS. But if you try to only click 4CPS you might time it wrong and will not click when you can, hard to explain :P. I believe the higher you click, the higher you have a chance to click max speed, I also believe clicking at a number divisible by 4(ex:8,12,16,20) you will most likely click max speed. But I don't &nbsp;know if I'm right...

8 CPS is basically like using an auto clicker because of how minecraft can't register too many clicks.<br><br>EDIT: Using and auto clicker that has its settings with maximum values.

Really? I've heard of plugins that can track the CPS of a player. On one Soup server, there was a moderator who banned someone because he could tell that person was using autoclicker, i.e. getting 100+ cps.<br><br>Of course, I don't have any confirmation on that, but I'm sure Minecraft can detect more than just 8 cps.

That player could not have been using an auto-clicker because auto-clickers are programs outside of Minecraft and cannot bypass the limits encoded in the mechanics. Only mods and clients can avoid those limits and go at higher clicks per second. <br>Sorry forgot to add some info onto that previous statement;<br>if auto-clickers were set onto their max click rates then Minecraft only registers about 8 CPS. It might be able to get more by reducing the click rate values.

As correctly (wow, it actually happened for once!) stated by somebody above, 12 cps is better than 4 (the limit) because unless you time all of your clicks with your connection, you'll miss hits.

Good theory, but I think it's just about your internet-connection, you can hit people faster with a better 'Ping'...<br>It's maybe the Java-Engine who makes your clicks slowly

I have to applaud you for knowing how this works. Most people just say that the damage cap means that you only need 4 cps. The higher the better. There is a point where it doesn't matter but if you can hit 16 in pvp, you're golden.
