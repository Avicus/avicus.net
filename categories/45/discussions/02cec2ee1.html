Apparently sitting in a lawn chair on the side of the road eating ice cream and listening to dubstep is "dangerous" and "bad" come on man, I was just having some fun :P<br>(Yes, this actually happened around 10 minutes ago)<br>An all black Sudan drives by me and turns around... Turns on his lights and pulls in next to me and says:<br><br>Cop: Whatcha doing?<br>Me: Hanging out...<br>Cop: You're too close to the road.<br>Me: I'm in my driveway next to the road... (Dubstep still playing)<br>Cop: Well move in closer.<br>Me: Uh, okay sorry.&nbsp;<br>Cop: Have a nice day.<br>Me: Yeah... Thanks you too. ._.<br><br>I ended up dropping my damn ice cream, too. Seriously?<br><br>Thats my afternoon as soon as I got home from school.

So true xD I've had multiple confrontations with the police like that before, but might as well live while you're young &lt;3

That's when you simply throw the ice cream at his car as he drives away and you make a run for it.
