<b>Owners</b>. Their job is the hardest. They have to pay to keep the server running. Control the console. And advertise. Have ideas and devotion to the server. And more<br><b><br>Developers</b>. Their job is to code. Do all the complex stuff to make a server what it is. Use plugins or even create their own. You can't learn the skills over night you study them.<br><b><br>Map Developers</b>. It's all in the name<b><br><br>Administrators</b>. Same jobs as mods just higher up. A lot of pressure and expectations. They have to use their powers wisely.<br><b><br>Moderators</b>. Their job is to help. Help and support. Help, support and create an enjoyable experience and community for a Minecraft server. One of the most wanted places on a server. Wonder why?<br><br><b>Players</b>. That's a majority of you. And you have the hardest job of all: Being online. What's the point of a server full of staff and no players? So many people say Mod is better, but they can't help unless you play! Players, everyone single one of you, are the most important factor of a server.<br><br>Now, just because you don't have powers like the people above you, does that mean you can't do their job as passion. You can't tell a player what's right and wrong? What's good and bad? Well, servers are different, so they have their own rules. Can you act as a mod, just without the powers? Just like a Map Dev.<br><br>An Avicus player_

The Administrator subtitle is misleading. We don't "use" our powers. We guide and administrate the server.&nbsp;<br><br><i>Owner has been removed and where is Senior Moderator?</i>

Thanks for posting this; however, I would like to point something out. <br><br><i>"</i><b><i>Administrators</i></b><span><i>. Same jobs as mods just higher up."</i><br></span>To my understanding, administrators typically do not moderate as much, but instead, they look over the staff and the entire community and make sure everything is smooth sailing, and solve any server problems they can within their power, as long as it doesn't involve the console. Feel free to correct me though.<br><br><b>Edit:</b> basically got ninja'd by Fluey

Everyone is allowed to help out, of course! What do you do when you /report? You help, and that's always greatly appreciated. We're one big community, and we all look after the server together, in our own ways. :)

Although there are some things that could be fixed, I like this thread. I made one on the old Avicus forums a while ago that was somewhat similar, and I still go by it. Players, whether donors or not, moderators or not, have a huge impact on the server, with all of their actions. Join the forums, make one (good quality) forum post; You've made the forums a better place. Log on the server, join a Nebula game, report a hacker; You've rid the server of a hacker, making it a better place. The little actions go a long way. If you make 1 valid report a day, and make 1 good quality forum post, you're having a large impact on the server, especially considering it's a fairly small server, so we don't get a ridiculous amount of reports and forum posts.<br><br>Think you're not great, just because you're not staff? Just because you're not donor? Think again, the server can't thrive without the constant support of the players. We need you, just as much as the server needs an owner, needs admins, needs map developers. You're all great.

every rank here is important<br>we all work together to create the server. you can argue all day about what there wouldn't be if there weren't admins, or if there weren't map devs, or there weren't players. and you'd be right, because they're all equally important and are all needed for a server to function. it's like an ecosystem. if you take this animal out, then this animal can't eat. but if you take the eater out, then the first animal will grow in population and take over the ecosystem. there's a balance.
