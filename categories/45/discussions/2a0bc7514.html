It's either your internet, your computer, or YouTube, or even a combination of multiple reasons. I have fairly fast internet so a 3-4 minute video takes around... 8+ minutes to upload. A normal video (15 mins+) usually takes up to 2 hours.

It's possible that you quit/stopped some applications/programs which allowed your computer to focus more on uploading. It may also be that no one else was using your internet, so your upload speeds were faster.<br><br>Or hey, it might be YouTube :P Technology is weird and tends to do unexpected things ;)

I recommend using an application called Handbrake. Handbrake compresses for 900 MB to 300 MB or whatever and makes the upload so much quicker. There is tutorials about the download and how to use it, and plus it's free!&nbsp;<br><br>I hope I could help :D

My upload speed is very slow as well.&nbsp;<br>Years ago, YouTube allowed you to upload multiple videos at once, and much faster than&nbsp;<b>1 video</b> uploads today, but because there are more and more YouTubers, and more videos being uploaded, YouTube cannot handle this large amount of videos being uploaded at the same time, so it processes them slowly.<br><br>Sorry, but this happens to everyone, trust me, I know. :/

I would recommend using VirtualDub:&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.virtualdub.org/">http://www.virtualdub.org/</a><br><br>It compresses videos extremely well while still keeping good quality.

Vesplesk101, this happened to me and MiningFlamingo a very annoying amount of times, my 15 - 20 minute episodes take around 9 hours of leaving my computer open on the upload page... MiningFlamingo downloaded an application .- HandBrake, where it compresses your video to a smaller size, but doesn't do anything to the length or quality, although about 40% of the time you may have to make a few attempts, but yeah, that can make a 10 hour upload reduced to 60 - 80 minutes, if it works properly :)

I never trust how long youtube says it will take to upload a video. Within 3 seconds it can go from a 1 hour upload to a 3 minute upload and back again. Typically, uploads will take a while and tend to slow down your computer while the upload is in process. I suggest just turning off your monitor and letting the video upload over night. That's what I do.
