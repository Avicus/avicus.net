nope, not possible, skype isn't related to Avicus in any way except use of communiction with the community. Nothing that goes on from skype can affect anything on any of the avicus platforms

You and Rilo shouldn't have provoked him, joke or not.<br>He has every right to block you on Skype.<br><br>But that's as far as he can go.&nbsp;<br>Considering Skype is not an Avicus related service, and considering that this has no relevence to the website, he cannot web ban you.<br><br>That still doesn't excuse your behaviour though.<br><br>Don't annoy people.

1. Who gives a f*ck who's in the wrong, it's not avicus related which means it doesn't matter in this case<br>2. Res prob was joking and removed it because you'd do something like this with a screenshot of the message attached.<br>3. Get this shit off the forums, if you're gunna report him then email support (Gl with no evidence).
