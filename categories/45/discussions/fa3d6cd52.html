Depends on what you wanna play<br>For PotPvP itself, kohi. For ranked matches like mcsg or iron OCN I would choose badlion.<br>Also I'm not sure if this topic is Avicus related ;c

Kohi for me is the better one in pvp grinding and badlion for better forums and staff members. It's good that badlion has more gamemodes than just pot pvp, but i still feel like kohi is the way to go for pvp.

Badlion community is better and the Anti-cheat is 95% accurate, plus all the separate ladders/gamemodes I like, but I disllike the fact that if you play unranked that it's either just not a challenge, or people who play wayyyyyy over-aggro.&nbsp;<br><br>If you play ranked, everyone ultra-tryhards and you tend to get matched with people WAYYYY out of your elo, and even if you feel like tryharding the day away, only 10 matches per-day. A good example of ridiculous matching is me going into ranked Kohi ladder on BL and getting matched with StanMPL 3 times in a row. (1400 vs 2000 elo?) not to mention getting matched with people at 1700-1800 constantly, even though I never play ranked and am sitting at just under 1400 because I never play it anymore, obviously due to the reasons previously stated (not to mention some of the maps are trash on BL).&nbsp;<br><br>Kohi's community is worse, but I just ignore the chat. Ranked Isn't as stupid in matchmaking as BL and if I choose unranked I have more of a chance of getting a somewhat challenging fight on P2.&nbsp;<br><br>P1 I like, as I can use it for warm-ups and if I just want stomp matches/practicing new techniques and jitterclicking.&nbsp;<br><br>P2 Is also a great option for people with PCs that don't get great fps, as the maps aren't laggy, with the exception of one or two. P1 has more laggy maps than P2.&nbsp;<br><br>Kohi's maps are also better, but the anti-cheat is awful.&nbsp;<br><br>For me, I enjoy playing on Kohi more. <br><br>Edit: I also like the teamfight system on Kohi more than BLs. &nbsp;<br><br>Frustration-fueled Side note: I could be sitting around 1600, maybe even 1700 elo if the matchmaking on BL wasn't so stupid and If I actually went on BL.

I don't really play it for soup, but the question was Badlion or Kohi, not something like MCteams or Kohi. MCteams would easily win. I don't do pot PvP.
