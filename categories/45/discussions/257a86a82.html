Legit Players?

</h1>
I have not played avicus for a shit on of time as it is not my " main server" I was thinking of moving to this server but then noticed something, The amount of un-legit players on avicus, ITS A SHIT TON and guess what, few of them are " KNOWN &nbsp;PLAYERS " . So my question is when is avicus going to come up with a decent anti-cheat? At the moment you can't even detect a simple autoclicker. The " nodus days " are long gone, you need to build a better anti cheat or this server is going to be full of hackers. If you cannot build a decent anti cheat, which is understandable as finding people who can do so are difficult to find. Partner with some other server, badlion, kohi, something like that. Those servers have very good anti cheats, in fact kohi even screenshares players as ghost clients are difficult to detect, which brings me to my next point, Start screen sharing people. I understand that the current avicus staff team will not have any experience in doing so but its required and you can always learn from youtube or people who do know how to do so( gods like me xD ) Why is it required? Ghost clients at the moment are only detectable by badlion, from the huge number of minecraft servers out there, badlions anti cheat is the only one which can actually detect ghost clients ( not talking about the shit ones ) , This is for the better of avicus and if any of this doesnt take place, I guess ill start revealing the players when I have time c; ( ill go nikeboom v2 on u ) .

There aren't really that many hackers and high enough player count to take the time and develop such a PlugIn. Most people are only using Killaura, x-ray, forcefield or fly hacks anyways. &nbsp;A Autoclicker detector is actually in the making. If any well known player is hacking then just record and report them

We have a AntiCheat plugin, but it's only deployed on CTW01 and DTM01 for testing purposes.<br>When Avicus updates to 1.8 it gets deployed on all servers.

I guess if there isnt a high player count we could just go for partnering a another server with a good anti cheat.

Avicus anti cheat is turrible. Idk what it does atm but when I was mod it only told us about fly hackers. There are a few decent staff members but even when they get a good catch, if its not blatant it will get appealed. Not to mention certain staff members arent legit themselves.

There are other methods of screensharing. Idk mabye he meant skype. Its also rather common for servers to demand a player screenshare.

Some of the staff is currently getting trained for screensharing. We will be using join.me instead of skype though people will probably not give out their skyp.e

Nope. Not letting someone I met over the internet look through my computer. Plus, some people hack on other servers so they have clients, its kinda like saying "what you do on other servers will get you banned on avicus".<br><br>As for the anti cheat, yeah that would be good

I really agree with this in about the last two months i can know name many MANY well known / popular players who are now cheating but like said we need a good anti-cheat to stop this or mods who are more willing to ban for hacks/macros and who are more confident over making decisions.

Regardless if its a valid excuse or not, what does screensharing prove? It may prove that someone possess a hacked client, but it doesn't prove that they use it/use it on avicus. What you do on other servers shouldn't get you banned from avicus
