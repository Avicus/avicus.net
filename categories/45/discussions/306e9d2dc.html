I got 2v1'd by someone and won, once...<br>Yeah, really, though, I suck xD<br><br>Oh, wait, actually, today I was playing Nebula and someone knocked me into the void and while I was about 50 blocks or so below him/her, I shot him/her off of the 1-block-wide bridge and (s)he fell into the void with me. Other than those two, I can't actually think of any xD

Avicus:<br>Jumped off a skybridge onto a platform with 7 people on it, all guarding a monument. Managed to kill them all (most via void) and went on to break the monument.&nbsp;<br><br>In general: Won a survival games match by killing one guy and then shooting the other finalist from a long distance. When he went in for the kill, I managed to take him out with half a heart remaining.

Playing on survival games, I had a wooden axe, bread, leather tunic and two cobwebs. Two opponents came towards me (one with stone sword, near enough full leather armour and the other with iron axe and a little less armour).&nbsp;<br>I thought I can't be bothered to run away, and luckily enough for me they came in two phases about five seconds apart. Mr iron axe ran towards me, I trapped him in a cobweb and proceeded to attack the other dude. I beat him, then with half of my hearts left, the iron axe dude got out of the cobweb and I went on to combo him and kill him only losing 2 hearts...<br><br>I then went on to come second (disappointing, I know...) but the dude that killed me had iron armour and a diamond sword...<br>GG

Me and a full diamond guy on Zalidor were fighting with bows. Then I gave up and was gonna try to know him off the edge, then I quickly changed my mind when i was brought down to 2 hearts. I decided to make a pillar strait up and looked down to see him coming up. He kept placing walls then block stacking. I decided to shoot 1 down at him. He apparently was at low health. So, I shot atleast 30 arrows down on his roof then he broke it, then i see his stuff fly everywhere. XD

Actually, once upon a time in &nbsp;Fantasy(or something like that), Orcs normally win and Dwarfs loose. So I was a Dwarf. So I defended the monuments with wood and when I ran out, I went on offense. So I joined this moving convoy across the map and the two Orcs attacked my teammates. I evaded them(narrowly) and went on to the monument undetected. Then, with the monument nearly unguarded, I slowly broke it(never built a wall around me or anything) and we won. Not much though cuz I play as engineer statues most of the time

I was playing the walls on Minecade and this one guy named UnbreakingIV was killing our whole team. Me and a surviving teammate decide to hurry to a ruin were we would seek refuge. He soon see one of our name tags and he blows a whole down the ravine where we were hiding. We scurry over to a corner and I box in, he then blows that with tnt and he is knocked into the lava, he comes out with half health and I kill him, he had full iron and i only had a chest plate. We went on to win that game.

Well, justice is the best killfarming map(my opinion)... so.... not that great<br>I was playing justice(full iron, op bow)&nbsp; and I was alone in the middle, with the opposite team swarming across the bridge... I shot 5 of them dead..(2-3 hits :)) and then two iron guys came.. I hit them, but they got across, I shot one at point blank to death, then killed another with a sword... by then I was at, like 4 hearts ;p <br>and of course... someone in full diamond came... so I ran away from the middle, and escaped to base with 1/2 a heart... o-o (almost died from fall dmg)

Well, this was a server that I won't say because of "advertising" and 3 diamond dudes were teaming on me while I was in iron with a iron sword. I shot the first guy 3 times, he knocked back, then I hit the 2nd a couple of times to knock him back. While they were trying to come back, I shot the third guy and then knocked him off the world, he died! After that, the guy who I bow-spammed came back and I strafed him, I got 2 hits on me while I got 10 on him, he died! The last guy came behind me and tried to surprise me, I ender pearled away, drinked my appropriate potions, and then the diamond dude spawned next to me (ender pearl). I then got 3 shots him while running backwards, I then ran in doing block-hitting, I got 8 hits on him then I jumped up, and then hit him, he flew backwards and he died, the Tale of Ingigo being teamed on done! xD

It was an elimination match before Avicore, there was a 6 guy team, 2 of 6 guys had arrows and a bow. So 4 of them came charging at me and i managed to kill 3 of them until i got a 3 hit combo on the guy, but i didn't get the kill, because his teammate who was cowering a distance ahead was just shooting arrows at me along with his other teammate, instead of hitting me he hit his teammate in his head, killing him and saving me xD. It was quite funny how it just hit in his temple without him knowing wat dafuq happened. i still remember that moment when the arrow straightly fled at him, hitting him and then turning into a pile of stuff. I remember it being near to one of those huge trees that are a pain to destroy, having logs in it's leaves. Unfortunately i died from an arrow while going for the other 2 guys. But still that was one of my best if not the best moment in pvp.

Going to a monument while on of the 4 defenders was throwing out his diamond I killed him while a guy in full iron did not notice, then covered myself up halfway and started to break the monument. I also killed another guy and u didn't put the Diamond on because I didn't have Time. I was called a hacker :P
