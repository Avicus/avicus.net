It's hard to think that one year has already gone by.<br>I've learnt so much this past year.<br>I've made a ton of friends and have laughed more than anyone should.<br><br>If you told me a year ago that I'd be a staff member on here, there's no way I'd believe you.<br>The fact that it's my job to help others is amazing.<br>At times it's a lot of hard work but it's very rewarding.<br><br>Thanks for a great year Avicus, it's been a honour.<br><br>Here's to another awesome year!

I always knew you'd become staff, Snow. Even before you applied, I knew it was your line of work. It's a pleasure to have known you for such a long time, and please. Keep in touch alright? You're phenomenal, bud. Keep it up!
