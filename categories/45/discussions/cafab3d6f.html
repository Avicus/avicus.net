<div>First off i dont even know how to start this off i mean its been a great 3 and a half 4 years with everyone on the server and i will rememeber each &nbsp;and every person on this server. Im not gonna rant on and on about everyone that ive known or will miss the most cause honestly theres just way to many to name but you all know who you are and ill probably message you later. Ive had such a good run on the server but i just dont have that energy and passion ive had towards this game anymore and when i get on it just bores me and i just dont enjoy playing it anymore as well as with school starting back i just dont have the time for the game as much as i used to which is the second reason im leaving the third i dont really wish to name but its has something to do relationship wise and i have that to worry about now but im not going into details on that. Just a few thanks to the avicus community itself for making this such an amazing expirience and thank you to everyone on the server &nbsp;for giving me a chance and letting me be part of all of this glory...Also thank you to all of the competetive teams that gave me a chance to grow as a player and person so thanks to&nbsp;</div><div>Cronus</div><div>Team rocket</div><div>Horizon on being my first tourney win</div><div>and Apollo the one team i feel welcomed and have alot of fun with some pretty cool people&nbsp;</div><div>Now i will still be active on ts and discord if u want to get a hold of me ask me anything or just want to talk then my discord is&nbsp;<b>Mylk#2781</b></div><div>im not one for decent goodbyes so this is kind of hard leaving everything behind and hey maybe in the future ill come back but right now i have more important things in my life i have to worry about and this block game isnt one of them. Ill probably be back around during the summer but thats kinda far away and im not promising ill come back i guess we'll see depends on if avicus is alive by then stil.<br>Everyone in this community was amazing and again ill miss everyone dearly and i appreciate everyone the community has done for me as a person and as a player. Also big thanks to all the mods that kept avicus semi clean and some what still playable keep it &nbsp;up!&nbsp;<br>Id also like to formaly apologise to anyone i may have been toxic to its just the kinda of player and person i am but i never really meant any of it just a thing with my play style.<br>To finish this off id like to say goodbye to all of my old friends on the server and goodluck in your lives...If we were close enough then ill probably stay in touch with you on a personal level. To all the new people joining the server hope u have fun idc what others say it was a hell of a server and still kinda is. It was fun but cya around everyone! Hope all is well and gooooodbye :D</div>

Avicus brought us here, and it will take us apart,<br>You meant a lot to me, we were friends in the heart.<br><br>You're leaving so soon, it's hard to believe it.<br>But maybe one day, we will look back and laugh and just oversee it.<br><br>You got banned for hacking,<br>I knew it was true...<br><br>But you ban evaded so happily&nbsp;<br>and no one caught you!<br><br>We have had some great times, like TNT tag<br>Playing UHC's daily and screaming over lag.<br><br>Haliea brought troubles,<br>but so did steven.<br><br>I hope you aren't angry<br>and that we are even.<br><br>You won a tournament,<br>Bravo to you.<br>We lost our streak,<br>I still blame you.<br><br>But mucky oh my, how much I will miss you.<br>Have fun in life, and don't get the flu.
