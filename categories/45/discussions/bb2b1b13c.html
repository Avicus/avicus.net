So dismorning i went out to the shops and bought the Razer Taipan for $94 on special :D It was a bit pricey so if you after a budget one this wont be your choice (Maybe a logitech G series mouse)<br><br>But after playing with it for a few hours i found these things&nbsp;<br><br>The clicks are very east and smooth<br>L E Ds You dont need them but they look cool. XD<br>The side buttons are very responsive I set mine to a optifine zoom<br>You can go from 400 to 8400 DPI and the side grips are good<br>Its light weight if thats what your looking for but it has no adjustable weight.<br><br>Overall its a very good mouse<br>Sorry for a lack of detail ive only had it for a few hours

Nice! I'm planning to get the Razer Deathadder soon and before I was going back and forth whether to get the Razer DA or Razer Taipan but I chose the Deathadder because it looked like it had a better palm grip and just a better shape for my hand.
