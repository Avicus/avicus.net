<span>For those of you that haven't heard about what's going on in Ferguson (It's a city in Missouri), I'll give you a link that summarizes what happened:<br>&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Michael_Brown" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Michael_Brown</a>.<br><br>&nbsp;I'm pretty sure that the officer lied about what happened so he could get away with it. There are multiple witnesses that say the officer shot Michael while he was still in his cruiser and Michael was not. The officer says that he tried wrestling the gun from him but I'm calling BS on that. <br>After this incident, the officer that shot Michael was put on PAID leave. That sparked people in Ferguson to protest. Then, the police put the city under lockdown, preventing people from entering or leaving the city. They also used tear gas on protesters to try to get them to disperse them. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><a href="http://globalnews.ca/news/1507260/in-photos-heavily-armed-police-face-down-protesters-in-ferguson-mo/" rel="nofollow">http://globalnews.ca/news/1507260/in-photos-heavily-armed-police-face-down-protesters-in-ferguson-mo...</a>&nbsp;This went on for about 4 days or so.&nbsp;I just found out that the tensions are cooling down now because the governor gave oversight of the protests to the Missouri highway patrol. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><a href="http://www.ctvnews.ca/world/ferguson-shooting-officer-did-not-know-teen-was-a-robbery-suspect-1.1960951" rel="nofollow">http://www.ctvnews.ca/world/ferguson-shooting-officer-did-not-know-teen-was-a-robbery-suspect-1.1960...</a><br>&nbsp;So, what do you think about all of this?<br>&nbsp;Discuss pls. <br></span>

What. American media is known internationally as being biased, with each news station being heavily influenced by political parties. International broadcasting companies such as the BBC do not 'love' the US, and diversity isn't really an excuse when you have the rest of the world to be reporting on.

True, but plenty of people assume diversity is another word for combined chaos created when ethnic groups combine to form a country, not saying other countries are without diversity, just pointing out that America is the first global superpower since the Roman Empire and the whole world has their eyes on us.

America has 0 power when you take away it's allies. I'll also have you know that the British empire was more recent than the Roman empire. The whole world has it's eyes on everything, don't think that you are special.

You are taking this way to personally broski. I was refering to the term "superpower" in the loosest deffinition of the phrase. I quite honestly am not a fan of what goes on, and its not my fault. I'm at least tryin to rep my country a little. Lets drop this before we start cursing each other out.

Well shit like this is sadly very commonplace in other parts of the world, where cops are corrupt as heck. I don't think protesting will do as much as awareness though, and surprisingly little people know about this in my area. I think it'd be better if they tried to figure out a way to work the law to their favour and punishing incidents like these more severely.&nbsp;<br>Actually, is there even a guide to dealing with things like these? Like, are law enforcement officials trained to recognise traits that'll lead to this and stop it?
