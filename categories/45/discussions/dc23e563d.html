Please email <a href="mailto:support@avicus.net" title="Link: mailto:support@avicus.net">support@avicus.net</a> and provide evidence that you own both accounts<br>Also if I'm correct GrapeSmoothie already talked with you about that and that rank switching is currently broken.

How can rank switching be broken? It's an infinite rank. Just delete it from one account and put a fresh diamond rank on the new account

Dev should add possibility to present your rank to other player. Then you would just present your runk to your new account :)

Here's the issue. We can't delete PURCHASED donor ranks from accounts. We can do that with staff ranks but all we can do with donor ranks is assign them. Now again, sorry but it isn't working right now but we will happily do it when devs get around to fixing it. Disregard what the moderator said because that person may not have known of the bug.
