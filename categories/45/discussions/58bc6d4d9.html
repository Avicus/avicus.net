Hey guys, yes im back and ill explain about my leave/break but for now im actually having issues w/<br>the Minecraft Launcher.<br><br>I just got my new laptop afew days ago --<br><i>SPECS:</i><br><ul><li>Lenovo G40</li><li>Intel CORE i3 processor</li><li>AMD Radeon 2G Graphics Card</li><li>500 GB HDD (internal)</li><li>2G RAM</li><li>14 inch LCD</li></ul>and recently ive been getting all my things setup ofc and everytime i try to run Minecraft after<br>downloading the Minecraft.exe file it keeps rollingback/buffering back to 0 MB after it reaches like<br>0.8 MB or 2 MB then after it rollbacks a couple more times it stops and this message pops up<br>saying "<b>Unable to update Minecraft Game Launcher</b>" and so i tried w/ the Minecraft.msi and the<br>same thing happened again, and then i tried the Alternative Minecraft.exe file and still it wouldnt<br>work (and it also doesnt allow me to download the exe file itself fully)<br><img class="image__pic js-image-pic" src="http://i.imgur.com/WUnEfn7.png" alt="" title="Image: http://i.imgur.com/WUnEfn7.png"><br><img class="image__pic js-image-pic" src="http://i.imgur.com/wOu1gTo.png" alt="" title="Image: http://i.imgur.com/wOu1gTo.png"><br><br>Is there any way of fixing this? if there is pls i rly wanna see how much fps i get on the game w/ my<br>new laptop and if i do get like 100 fps or more i can play w/ maybe some HD texturepacks and maybe<br>even record some vids on avicus on my free time, also i recently got a new skype but i will only add<br>ppl who i can trust to say the least (e.g. ppl who i play w/ alot / friends)

Reinstall Java. Whats your java bit? 32 or 64? Try 64. ( if you don't have it)<br><br>Don't download much junk on your computer too judging by it you might slow it down with a lot of files. Makes sure to annually clear it out.

Something on your computer is probably interfering with the download of Minecraft, try adding the launcher to your firewall and anti virus exception lists.

Redistributing Minecraft binaries is against their EULA, although you can probably use your account on another computer to download the files and then copy it over to your current computer.

You don't need and don't want to disable Windows Defender entirely. Just add the Minecraft launcher as an exception in Windows Defender.

Does downloading the native launcher/ launcher require a decent internet connection? cuz i checked the nativelog .txt doc and it said <b>Encountered</b>&nbsp;<b>internet exception 12002: The operation timed out</b><img class="image__pic js-image-pic" src="http://i.imgur.com/DOBmkl7.png" alt="" title="Image: http://i.imgur.com/DOBmkl7.png">

I did a quick search on Google, and I found <a href="https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCL-3404" rel="nofollow" title="Link: https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCL-3404">this</a> page, I think it would help if you disable your anti-virus/firewall. But you should also enable it again after, so you don't have to run your PC without an anti-virus. Because this might just be the firewall blocking the download, so if you're lucky it's just the launcher download.
