</h1>
so there have always been leaving threads and their becoming more of a pain every day because everyone comes back. If people are leaving for good everyone should be showing sympathy and help. But so many recently have been fake and it's beginning to make people mad. There should be a stop to this. Maybe a longer punishment to enforce this. It's becoming a thing that people do for attention. As a lot of you may know, a member (not stating the name) came back literally 2 hours after. It's becoming too far. Opinions on this?<br><br><br><br>EDIT: After 5 times no one believes you anyone so we all know who those people are. There's a limit

They already do forum punishments for this but I believe that they should get a perm ban on the forums and in game.

Um, then they would have to leave. So then it isn't fake... Really, a temp ban is better, because then they will think twice, but if they get perm banned, then they have to leave, lmao.

I understand where you are coming from with this, but there is a thing that causes this to happen; regret. Sometimes people think it's the right thing to do, some others get put in a situation where they believe it's something that will help them if they leave. When everything works out for them they regret leaving and decide to come back. It's annoying that this keeps happening but I don't feel a perm ban isn't the right thing to do, maybe if they've done it multiple times that can be the punishment.

Man that's cruel. People need time to think, even after they posted something. So, that's not fair at all.

Pretty sure Dawson just needs time to think, it's best for him, not syaing it n a bad way, but punishing them even more won't change his decision either. So, yeah like i said, those punishments won't make it better, and it also shows that they actually want them out of the community.

It's completely fair. If you're thinking about coming back then don't make a leaving post, instead, set it as your skype mood message that you're leaving (to inform your friends that you're leaving, but also so you can't get banned on avicus)

Yeah, because that makes a lot of sense. People need to THINK. Like if you were doing drugs and you went to jail, and you were charged with 3 months in jail, you dont get any time to think about what you did because you're already in a bad position.

It does make sense. Why would you risk getting banned when there's a simple solution just to tell your friends on skype? Also, your analogy makes no sense. You're told in school constantly not to abuse drugs and the consequences of using them are drilling into your head.

You see regarding fake leaving posts Dawson's just needed a little bit of air to think and get away I can understand that, but others <b>e.g.&nbsp;</b>Rilo, he repeatedly continued to post leaving posts and what happened about a few hours - 24 hours later? He came back.<br><br>So in my opinion regarding leaving posts it should be a one time thing not like other people making multiple leaving posts or even just straight out fake ones it really needs to stop and a punishment must be put in place.

Honestly, I think that they should have to clear leaving posts with staff before they are made. It'd give the chance for staff to remind them of the consequences if they are fake, and that they should list that it might only be temporary.

Change is never a step but a process - anyone who thinks they can just go and leave Minecraft forever with a couple of deleted files and a leaving thread is either inexperienced or unable to learn from their mistakes.&nbsp;<br><br>Successful cases are rare - and the person probably moved on to another game, or had an amazing amount of self control.<br><br>It's why all these leaving threads, because people are busy with life, motivated to quit gaming, whatever the reason may be, are all complete bs.<br><br>I thought I could quit Minecraft like that - many times failed miserably, a couple of times came close, one time almost completely succeeded - but in the end I'm still here. I have definitely weaned off a lot and am able to control my playing time but it took me over half a year.

Perma ban is way too harsh, when I had made mine a while back, I didn't expect to come back, I said that there might be a chance I would, and I am back, if I was perma banned just because of that, that's pretty dumb. I understand the flat out fake ones, just to get attention, but the ones that are legit shouldn't be punished, even if the person does come back.

Leaving posts are meant to inform the community that you are either departing from Avicus or Minecraft as a whole. I feel a lot of people just post a leaving thread for attention or to be noticed. If you are making a leaving post, you shouldn't care that you are banned, you have left anyway. Leaving for a temporary amount of time is different, no need for a whole thread about a temporary departure.<br><br>I think people just seek attention when making these "fake leaving posts" is what I'm trying to get at here.

I mean, you get people who leave for a longish period of time (6-12 months) who make leaving posts, but when you get someone say theyre leaving and they come back unless than a few months it just seems like you're trying to get attention.

Leaving posts are meant to inform the community that you are either departing from Avicus or Minecraft as a whole. I feel a lot of people just post a leaving thread for attention or to be noticed. If you are making a leaving post, you shouldn't care that you are banned, you have left anyway. Leaving for a temporary amount of time is different, no need for a whole thread about a temporary departure.<br><br>I think people just seek attention when making these "fake leaving posts" is what I'm trying to get at here.

Exactly. First or second time ok I get it. 3+ your just an attention seeking joke. Honestly they should be perma banned at least from forums or temp banned for 2 months cuz I mean some people just return in 2 hours

You have made a lot of leaving post tbh. I made this mistake when I first started. If you want to leave just leave. Don't need to be a drama queen about it. Honestly people won't remember you anymore. Probably only close friends here.

They should suffer the death penalty.<br>Or at least there should be some Leaving Posts section on the forums so it does not bother people trying to read other types of posts on the forums. I think some misunderstandings may lead people into a not-deserved ban, because sometimes people leave because of extreme schools and that stuff but hey, do not permanently ban.<br>If FightToWin would eventually have the time to come back and rejoin, would you ban him? I think it's unfair.

I was decently mature at your age. I don't about you. I don't wish to return to my former self and never will. I suggest you change before you get banned. Or make the same mistake I did.
