Reducing ban evasion

So yeah me and junr came up with a way to reduce the amount of ban evasion by I'm guessing quite a lot.&nbsp;<br><br><a href="http://m.imgur.com/a/kRZYS">http://m.imgur.com/a/kRZYS</a><br><br><br>Basically what it is is<br><br><br>You would have a blacklist of ip's and a whitelist of accounts<br><br><br>When a person is logging on it would first check the ip blacklist, if the Ip is there than it would check the account whitelist, if the account your logging in with is on the whitelist it would let you log in, if it isn't on whitelist and your ip is on blacklist than it wouldn't let you log on....&nbsp;<br><br><br>A staff members brother was hacking on the server so this would be a good way of stopping his brother from ban evading if he ever gets an alt, but it would allow the staff member to log in cus his name would be on the whitelist (keep in mind you don't have to add everyone that's not banned to account whitelist because it will only check for you of your IP is banned, or is on the blacklist)&nbsp;<br><br><br>This obviously won't stop all evasion but it will reduce by a lot considering how small of an amount of people that could probably change their ip.

Yeah but most hackers are young and have no idea about them, again it's not completely stopping them, it's to reduce it

This was brought up many times before. The only problem is that we don't know who is who. Like you stated, this staff member's sibling is a frequent ban evader. Even if we had an "automated" sorting system, it's not going to thoroughly filter everyone out. This is why IPchecks are done manually by seniors. The seniors need to be trained to tell how to filter people out. It may sound good (believe me, i've suggested this before) but doing it manually is always the best solution.<br><br>oh and vpns<br>those are very common these days<br>not that hard to use

I really don't like how the staff take the sibilings situation into account wayyyyy too much<br>I'd rather have them ip banned and even if they have a sister or brother that play avicus well too bad for them they shouldnt have hacked, also most players find that excuse rly easy to abuse so icould get banned, bs that was my brother and there we go. also dont tell me that i need to get on ts i woudlve easily gotten a friend or my dad xd to say something and there we go<br><br>I'd rather use IP bans, plus the public vpn blocker that kohi used to use.

Yes<br><br>its not the servers fault that they broke the rules, and its should be a policy in the server that you need to be responsible. i know it sounds not fair but again, id rather have these situations and they will be less and not abusable by ban evaders. also as i stated every other server other than avicus does it and it works well

And even if someone doesn't has such a great router, it would take like 5 minutes to unplug the router wait some minutes and plug it back in to get a new ip.

Pretty much this. Unless there's a counter for dynamic IPs, there's not much chance of this method succeeding.
