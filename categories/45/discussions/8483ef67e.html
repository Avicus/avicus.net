I go to school every morning by car. I go back home by taking the train or public bus. Back when I was in primary school (middle school), I used to take the school bus home, but now when I'm in secondary school (high school), they do not provide bus services anymore.

I get driven :P Walking would take me about an hour and a half, and I'm not a huge fan of buses. For my Highschool, we don't have "School buses", we have to take the city bus. At my old school, the bus would come by at 7:45, since it was the third out of 7 stops. The bus would get to the school by 8:10. I'm not sure what time the city bus comes by, my guess is around 7:20-7:40.

Everyone listens to hard-core rap, on which the 'lyrics' are always about having a big penis and lots of weed,  and because of my age, I have to sit in the middle of them. Then, they all throw things at me and scream in my ear.The only kid who sits next to me is annoying as all hell, because he moans at me for 10  minutes to go on his phone, and he screams at me if I die on Temple run. Then when he wants it back, he says " Oscar, pass me my short, hard white thing". Then, the bus arrives. As I go to get up, the younger kids behind me punch and kick me until I get off.
And that's a good day.

I'm surprised the U.S. is one of the only countries to have school buses. Anyway, my house is about 2 miles away from my school (in a straight line), but there is a giant hill up, and a giant hill down, so it would take my forever to get to school by walking. My bus arrives to my stop at 8:00, and gets to schools at about 8:05, and is filled with lots of my friends!
