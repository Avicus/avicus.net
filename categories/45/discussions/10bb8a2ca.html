Yep, I really can't be asked anymore, I'm off.<br><br>And before you ask, it's not just because I got banned for a bit, it's many reasons.<br><br>I have school life and GCSE's to get on with, amongst other things.<br><br>It's been a whizz of a 2 years here and I've had a really good journey here, made so many friends and had so many fun times, especially on Nex and CTH. I feel my time has come to end and I don't see my place here anymore.<br><br>Personally, I think the Mods are biased and have a crap system but I'm not gonna elaborate cos I'll start a war, no disrespect to anyone.<br><br>I'm gonna thank some people before I say bye, and I believe this is permanent. I can't see myself coming back for a long time, if ever, and if I do, do what you want, cos this post will be technically redundant.<br><br>This is who I would like to thank:<br><br><b>Zlik / Mihan -&nbsp;</b>You have literally been my closest friend here on Avi and although we haven't talked much recently, I can literally tell you anything and I remember when we had hour long chats on Nex and stuff, too funny xD thanks man and best of luck &lt;3<br><br><b>Midnight -&nbsp;</b>I know you've become staff and gone through the ranks meaning we haven't talked much recently but you were my best friend here and we can stay in touch on Skype / Instagram and I wish you the best of luck, remember the good times on Neb and Nex and hope your Admin life goes well and the future for you. &lt;3<br><br><b>iManMachine -&nbsp;</b>I know this is shit to come back from Australia and see this but I done it for a number of reasons and I will sincerely miss you and the times we had on CTH &lt;3 I didn't wish to leave you like this but best of luck for the future &lt;3<br><br><b>myworld6 - </b>we've also had good times on Avicus and I'll miss you as a friend on here, best of luck as Mod etc and for the future, you are a genuine person and really nice &lt;3<br><br><b>Unequalz / aFgt -&nbsp;</b>you are the person that has kept me going through Avi in the last 6 months, ever since we started playing CTH we bonded and became really close friends &lt;3 we've literally had the best times ever on Avicus and #avicu*t was our thing xD sorry to leave you like this but you've been such a genuine guy to me and so nice and I wish you the best for the future too &lt;3 I could tell you anything and say anything and you would just laugh, love you <br>man &lt;3&nbsp;<br><br>Also thanks to feflopizer, Budah_, Arigenn and neonlent and others for caring about me and making my Avicus experience fun &lt;3<br><br>N.B: Arigenn, if you read this, I would like to remain part of the committee as I don't fully want to leave Avicus if this is okay, I may need to discuss it with you.<br><br>N.B 2: Patrik, I want to remain with Jalapenos in case, but I don't mind if you kick me. I will not be participating in the 3rd tourney for definite, however.<br><br>Thanks everyone, I'm out, probably never to return, certainly not for a long time.<br><b><br></b><b>Myv / _Za / iBiZa.<br><br>P.S Yes, I will still be active on forums.</b>

=( Goodbye. Good luck in the future and with your GCSEs.&nbsp;<br><br>You were one of the people I played with frequently and I'm sad to see you go, but in the end it happens to us all.<br><br>Hopefully you'll return one day. I'll always remember the fights with the demo kit on CTH and when you told me about using the TNT to launch yourself into the air xD. Good times.<br><br>Goodbye! :(
