Awsum movie.<br><br>One of the best movies I've ever seen.<br>Sci-fi FTW.<br><br><br>It's true-ish. The possibilities are actually possible, the human brain is very advanced and intelligent.<br>Some monks up in the mountain of the himalayas, actually have gained telekinesis.<br><br><br>Have you ever watched the show 'superhuman'?<br><br>There is a man who can control his heart-rate, doing this, he can stay underwater for 25 minutes.<br>There is a samurai named, 'isao machii' who can slice in half, shot bb bullet.<br>His hand-eye coordination is not human.<br>There is a man named, 'wim hoff' Who believes there is a sort of "Thermostat" Device in the brain. He can control that, He can run without a shirt in unbelievable cold temperatures.<br><br>I think the human mind has more to what we think.<br><br>(A bit of innapropriate content, pace yourselves)<br>Trailers:<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVt32qoyhi0">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVt32qoyhi0</a>&nbsp;&lt;--- Trailer 1<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icYxjolQUs4">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icYxjolQUs4</a>&nbsp;&lt;----- trailer 2

Watched this a while ago, still remember it&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r331mHLncyE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r331mHLncyE</a>&nbsp;It shows the two you mentioned and eight more. From what I saw the last person was proved fake for what he did but the others remain to actually be like super humans.

Lucy was a terrible movie and I didn't even need to watch it. We can already use 100% percent of our brain, it's just that we're too lazy to.&nbsp;<br><br>Using 20% of your brain will give some massive power? Hell no. Just because you can use 1 fifth of your brain doesn't make you like the most talented person ever. We are just evolved apes that were lucky enough to get smarter and use fire and stuff, and we are now as weak as a adolescent chimp and is generally more stupid than your normal monkey, it's just that we have brains that rely on technology and everything.&nbsp;<br><br>When you first said that Lucy was awesome, I thought that you were sarcastic :/<br><br>Small Spoiler alert<br><br>So when you reachs 100% when we already can, she is "everywhere" and is sentient of whatever? Wow.

This is all my opinion here. People can have greatly varying tastes.<br><br><b>Spoilers Ahead</b><br><br>I thought this movie was terrible. I was at the drive in with my friends and this was the best option we had. The first 1/4 of the movie was quite interesting. It seemed pretty decent for a sci-fi movie that I originally thought was just going to be god awful.<br><br>I continued to stay tuned and followed the movie pretty well. As it progressed, it just seemed to get worse and worse. During the final shootout, it simply couldn't have been done worse. Literally. Having a flying magical genie appear would have interested me more than the ending. As she morphed into what seemed like a heaping pile of horse crap, my friends began to riddle insults. As she turned into some sort of cyber dragon, we figured she had settled in Jupiter or something crazily stupid. They should have just stopped the movie halfway and called it quits forever. The idea of the movie is great. It's a solid concept if you can actually throw in some nifty stuff and interesting plot points. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The entire process seemed extremely rushed and there was no time to really think about what was going on. Once I could understand one concept that was terribly thrown in, something else supernatural would happen and it'd be completely absurd.<br><br><br>PS: Writing this from my phone. I may make some edits as it may be terribly written.
