Hey Avicus,<br>So recently my YouTube Channel got spotlighted on my MCN's Main Channel <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ou5fmAGVyI?t=6m40s" rel="nofollow">here</a> and so that had me thinking of making a channel tralier and what other awesome people to ask then you guys!&nbsp;<br><br>By Channel Trailer I mean when a person that is not subbed to my channel then they will see a little 2 minute video of my channel thats a channel trailer<br><br>What video should I feature in my channel trailer? (Must be one of my own)<br>(Also add timestamp of when the feature is)<br><br>Those who I accept there channel trailer ideas will be credited in the description of the video<br>So fire away and I will probably close this channel trailer ideas in about a week or so!<br><br>As they say in my hometown of Australia!&nbsp;ハッピーオーストラリアデー！

Hmmm an Avicus gameplay thingy perhaps? Maybe?<br><br>By trailer I'm assuming you mean your intro to your vids. Diversify man, if you know how to model then make an animation dealing with Avicus or any server/gamemode you're gonna play.<br><br>DTM? A guy mining a monument and getting attacked.<br><br>Walls? Self-explanatory.<br><br>If you don't want that or you don't know how to model then try animating if you know how.

Alright.<br>Basically for a trailer I'd do a sort of montage of all the games you do, or just some type of "best moments" compilation. The point of a trailer is to make your channel look good and stand out to people, so if they see funny clips in a trailer, they'd be more attracted to your channel than just a video with boring stuff.<br><br>I made a channel trailer a while ago and you can check it out on my homepage if you're not subscribed to me, or you can just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2Mh-2pkb8k" rel="nofollow" title="Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2Mh-2pkb8k">click here</a>. That's pretty old though and I should be making a new one soon, but I hope you get some ideas from it.<br><br>Anyways, good luck with your channel man :D
