<b></b>Please don't hurt me. &nbsp;I know that this was done on OCN but it's still a good thing to have, and if Avicus does have one, then it hasn't been posted on in more than three months.<br><br>I have all sorts of experience in tech. &nbsp;I've worked on computers since age five. &nbsp;I haven't yet met a computer that I wasn't able to fix. &nbsp;Here, I will help you through technological glitches, common or uncommon. &nbsp;It doesn't have to be directly related to Avicus, or even Minecraft. &nbsp;I can help with software and hardware issues. &nbsp;Anyone that knows what they're talking about is more than welcome to help me out; I'm a very busy person in real life as well as on Avicus so I won't always be able to reply to all issues right away but I will certainly do my best!

Definitely the blue. &nbsp;I don't have those exact switches (I have the Razer BlackWidow Chroma and they engineer their own switches) but moving from non-clicky to clicky has improved typing in general and I'd never go back.

Nice! If you need any help with Macs, ask me as well. I can fix most software issues, but hardware is a bit of a trouble for me. I also work in Tech Support for my school. I only work with Macs.

If you go on Ebay, people have "buy it now" Logitech G602s and Logitech G700S's for around $50. They're refurbished, which normally is pretty good. I don't own either, but from what I've heard the G700S seems to perform better, but has an awful battery life (I'm told around 6 hours.). However, it can go wireless or wired. It goes from about 250dpi to 8200dpi.<br><br>The G602 has much better battery life, clocking in around 250 hours; however, there are fewer programmable buttons, and it only goes from about 240dpi to 2500dpi.

1. &nbsp;All you need is any power supply 300W or over. &nbsp;I recommend this:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817182076" title="Link: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817182076">Rosewill RD500-2SB</a>&nbsp;<br><br>2.  RAM actually has very little to do with Minecraft lag.  Of course, it's always helpful to have more RAM, but you'll really see improvement with a better GPU.  I understand that for many people that's not an option, and for laptop users it's generally impossible, but that's what will give you real results.  4GB of RAM is more than enough to run Minecraft successfully.  Other than that, the best things you can do are a) close other open programs, and b) make sure that your computer is set to "High Performance" (Start-&gt;Control Panel-&gt;Power Options).

When designing my second, I decided to scrap the software buttons and instead add three capacitive buttons for the OS navigation, and three tactile buttons for the volume rocker and power. I connected my capacitive touch sensor pad to five GPIO pins on my CPU, which picked up the signal fine. I couldn't seem to figure out how to make this trigger such OS functions as volume and power, though.<br><br>Any help would be greatly appreciated. I feel like I'm gonna give up :c

A good build. &nbsp;And technically, you&nbsp;<i>can</i> overclock it, but it's multiplier isn't unlocked so you can't go very far at all.<br><br>And yes, people need to be made more aware that it's not as daunting as task as it may seem to build a computer.

It's actually smart&nbsp;<i>not</i> to take a BIOS update unless something is going wrong. &nbsp;BIOS updates are dangerous in the fact that if they go wrong, you're basically out a motherboard (unless you have a dual BIOS system).

15-20%. Not that much of a difference in most games, usually about 10 frames, but in games that use more VRAM, the 2080x has an extra gigabyte on top of the 960 which helps in those games.<br><br>It will perform better in nearly every game, albeit by a small margin.

Good choices.<br>One last thing is that if you're looking at the 970, also be sue to check out the 290. Has a few advantages as well as disadvantages, either of which could impact you.

Correct me if Im wrong.<br>Minecraft is kinda based on the processor, not saying you don't need a good GPU to run it, but the processor does some of the main things, saying that, ram is important, for minecraft I think 4 will be fine, but 8 is probably your best choice.<br><br>That computer is still nice for a budget build :P

If you have a GPU, the GPU takes over some of the processing that would be done by the CPU in its absence. &nbsp;The CPU has a miniature GPU in it (called integrated graphics), which is good, but if there's another GPU, it will take over as it will almost certainly be more powerful. &nbsp;Having a good processor is really only a necessity in this case if there's no supplemental GPU. &nbsp;4GB of ram should be fine.

I'm very aware of how Minecraft works. What I'm saying is that processors today work at much faster speeds than most programs can realize, and the best investment for a Minecraft machine would be a mid-range CPU and a mid to high-end GPU. It only becomes more important to have a high end CPU if you don't have a separate GPU to help it.

Macs make your FPS in Minecraft usually increase. It's good for gaming because it has a face camera, recording software and a microphone(not really the best). It's good for PvPing but if you like block-hitting, I'm afraid you can't with a Mac Mouse. You can jitter click as well. It takes a while to get use to it.

The USB port problem sounds like a driver issue, open up Device Manager and see if there are any warning signs. You can try cleaning out your keyboard to see if it fixes the key sticking thing.

Well there's your issue, you lack chipset drivers which is why your system does not recognize most of your ports. Try finding your motherboard manufacturer's website and install the correct chipset drivers or your external devices will not work well and might start having weird issues.

Well, hard drives do eventually wear out as they become older. You can try using CrystalDiskInfo to see the status of your hard drive. Laptop storage replacements are not exactly the easiest thing to accomplish, but there are plenty of tutorials on the internet that you can watch and follow along, and learning how to work with computer components really doesn't seems too hard to me.

My mic did the same the wires in the mic got damaged somehow by the movement, yet the headset still worked with sound. Maybe try returning it? If the warranty is still valid.

It could be the microphone jack on your PC. Maybe try plunging it in and seeing if you can select it in the options.

Your CPU is probably not very strong, along with Integrated Graphics instead of a dedicated GPU. Laptops tend to have these problems, which is why they usually aren't made for Gaming, even in a block game.
