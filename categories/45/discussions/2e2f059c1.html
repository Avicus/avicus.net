Since you are just starting I will suggest OBS for recording and windows movie maker for editing. OBS is the lightest and best recording program out there ATM. As for movie maker its not the best but for starting its a great learning tool. They are also both free<br><br>When you get more advanced and get to know editing more then I would suggest something like Adobe Premiere Pro and Sony Vegas but these aren't free.

what matic said^<br><br>I use Windows Live Movie Maker and VSDC but VSDC isn't really fancy and it is a bit hard to use but it gets the job done.<br><br>I recommend Wondershare but its like $40-50 :/ If you are starting to make good vids, invest in Sony Veags if you want

I'd suggest Camtasia studio if you're running a PC. For Mac, go with the default iMovie :)

I've heard that Action significantly lowers your FPS, so you'd need a really good computer in order to use it.<br><br>Also, I recommend using either Fraps or Camtasia Studio to record, and Windows Movie Maker or iMovie to edit (These are beginner programs. Once you learn how to use them, I would recommend editing in Sony Vegas Pro 12 or 13.)<br><br>Also, with Camtasia, you can edit your videos using the Camtasia Studio Editor (which is used for both recording, and editing, which makes it very useful in that way).

<p>Almost all recording programs lower your "FPS", I can't really tell since my custom is too op for doritos, but Fraps lowers it too. But yeah I'd probably go for Fraps if its a Laptop.</p><p><br></p><p>Edit: I'm guessing not many people know how to use Cam Studios for free so technically, after 30 days of free use, it'd ask you to purchase a "Key". *DISCONNECT YOUR INTERNET FIRST* If you're using Cam Studios 8, it should give you 3 options, press the 3rd option: I have a software key, type any random name, maybe your name, and for key, enter in: 4CMYC-JKCM4-CVK5D-AGGHD-Z36D8 .&nbsp;Don't connect to your internet just yet, Cam Studios will frantically search for your Key, once you're back into editing, you can turn back your internet. Later it'll say that it couldn't find your key so it'll give you 5 extra days till it finds it or until you fix your key. You can just do this all over again after 5 days. Your welcome? 1 like = 1 prayer and support. amen</p>

Camtasia Studio 8 is life &lt;3<br>It's such a simple yet powerful editing software c:<br>I remember I tried to switch to another, but it was so relatively bad, I switched back the next day &gt;_&lt;<br>It's completely free and has doesn't have any time limit.. with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dVQEsaYbjY&amp;list=FLufDgYExmmatP2xj-HzOXBQ&amp;index=2" rel="nofollow">this</a> ;3

LMAO, SO WRONG<br><br>Action is actually one of the best recording softwares out there, cracks are hard as shit tho. Literally recording at 60 fps doesn't lower FPS much more than 5 - 15 LOL

Although I doubt you have it, if you have a NVIDIA GPU, you may be able to screencap with NVIDIA ShadowPlay for free. &nbsp;That's a gorgeous software.

Exactly why not? They are perfectly safe as long as you have an anti-virus (I do understand Anti-viruses don't catch most stuff you download, but still)
