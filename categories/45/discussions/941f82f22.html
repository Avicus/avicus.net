I don't think you should even comment on anything related to any sort of infraction, ever.

Well Harry, it was really nice being a staff member with you. <br>Me and you have definitely been through a lot together, going to miss seeing you around. <br><br>Thanks for being a good friend to me, contact me on Skype if you ever need anything okay?<br><br>You can always appeal as well, remember that.

Bye Harry, you're amazing person, fun times on Teamspeak. Hope you're staying with the Island Clash group. Good luck and have fun with life. I don't think that petition is going to work xD.

Aww :(<br>Maybe you'll be unbanned if you appeal in 8 months...<br><br>A tip of the overpro-ban-evader: <b><u>Don't</u></b> ban evade.

Well, you know that you did a big mistake. People make mistakes. I've never used a hack client, but I can understand what you feel. But you know, it's not allowed. My opinion is making your ban shorten. I mean like 2 months. Cuz hacking should cost something =/

Seeya man! Please please please appeal 6 months from now, since that's around the amount of time you have to wait to get an accepted appeal for hacking. I'd love to have you stay. :)
