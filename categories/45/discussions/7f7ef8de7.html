So, it's been what, a year and nine months after I first joined this community? <br><br></span></span></span><span>Well, I've been lacking on being able to fulfill my duties as a staff member. Life is just being a pain in general, so I just want to take the time to inform you all that I'll be resigning from my position as a staff member. Avicus has been a wonderful experience, a second family to me if you will. It has truly given me memories that I'll forever cherish. Thank you to&nbsp;everyone.
 The entire staff team, and the community. I wish you guys all the best.<br><br>Goodbye, I'll miss you guys.</span>

Negative you say? towards the thread?<br><br>You can't possibly expect me to say my farewells to him, that is for my own accord.&nbsp;<br>Think about other leaving posts, or posts of inactivity.<br>Those normally get deemed as attention seeking, or locked for "inactivity posts are not allowed", so why wouldn't those same factors be attributed to this given the same circumstances?
