I just want to share my observation<br>Recently, before I joined the 
server avicus, I saw the words "downloading terrain" and it is still 
pops up until now whenever I join. This is happening more often<br>than before. And sometimes, it takes around a minute before I can get in the server.<br>Does this happen to you? Or is it only me?

It happens. I usually just get impatient and quit, then reopen Minecraft.

Happens to me all the time. I also get disconnected often, even though my internet keeps working. In fact I got disconnected 7 times in 30 min. Very frustrating, especially when I'm about to get an obby

This happens to me quite often, but not that long that I have to restart minecraft. It's probably something on our side. Of course we're working on a fix.

It's my ADHD that makes me restart Minecraft, but otherwise it takes a minute or so to load.
