I realised it's banned on OCN, and after asking and getting some answers, I'm still confused.<br>It gives you an advantage, but I don't really get what.<br>So if someone could help answer this with some evidence that would be cool.<br><a href="https://oc.tc/forums/topics/56a751825f35b9376c00005a" title="Link: https://oc.tc/forums/topics/56a751825f35b9376c00005a">https://oc.tc/forums/topics/56a751825f35b9376c00005a</a>

Toggle sprint allows you to bind a key also that when you press it you'll start sprinting. As the name suggests you can toggle it on or off when you want to sprint or walk.<br><br>Considering vanilla Minecraft basically has this feature (not the exact feature, but something similar with its sprint key) I don't understand why OCN bars it, perhaps that's something you should ask their support team about.

Actually, it's a client that makes you sprint without double pressing w or pressing w with sprint button that you set. It's allowed on Avicus, but I don't know how it works on OCN. But anyway, I don't think that it's an advantage. That's why I don't have that client. But if you play MC only for PvP, that's a great idea tbh.

They are saying that it reengages sprint faster than vanilla, but I've yet to find evidence.

Bring it up with an OCN Admin, they'd have probably answered this question a few times in the past, given the server's unique stance on it.

Not even going to bother, it was kind of expected, it's OCN what do you expect. Already has a horrible impression of OCN a few months back.

Pretty much the same as holding down the sprint button. I don't understand why they are not allowing.-.

According to the people on OCN<br>1. It takes less effort<br>2. It reengages sprint earlier than normal vanilla sprinting. This is in the interesting one.

I think it's less the sprint factor and more the togglesneak, as this gives a significant advantage and if you are allowed to have a togglesprint yet not a togglesneak when they are in the same mod it's still going to lead to a higher number of people togglesneaking if you get what i mean.&nbsp;<br><br>By banning togglesprint it gives significantly less togglesneak users as players are less likely to use the mod.<br>I think it's a perfectly reasonable ban to be quite honest.

You are allowed to toggle sneak for say bridging however you cannot go into the GUI whilst sneaking. For example, if somebody was mining to the core and he was not found and he was sorting his inventory whilst sneaking that's impossible to do in vanilla Minecraft because you have to press your inventory button rather than the shift button. <br><br>basically what tazz did in avicus tourney 1 if that helps :)

The actual HCF mod has BetterSprint and ToggleSneak - ToggleSneak where you can sneak at all times. However, BetterSprint (the mod) means you can only sneak when you can in Vanilla minecraft.

It really doesn't. They only ban it there since they think it's a big of an advantage to be able to sort out your inventory while sneaking.

I'm talking about Toggle Sprint, not Sneak. Based on what I read on OCN, it's banned because it gives you some sort of advantage and I have yet to really understand.

Well, I have actually being talking to some Moderators on OCN(Eudaldca/Abusa3) and they both think it should be allowed.<br><br>If you really want to, bring it up to an Administrator.

I've heard it gives you better know and makes it easier to combo but I doubt it's true.<br><br>Really, the only "unfair advantage" is the extra finger you get. Doesn't really make much of a difference but at the end holding a key for sprint is annoying, hence the ToggleSprint mod.
