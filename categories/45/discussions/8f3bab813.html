Hi there,<br>I am doing a software development project that goes for 3 months - and firstly I need to come up with a solution to develop; with any programming language (preferably with Ruby (and Rails), Java and/or .NET. The issue is, I don't know what to do. It's quite sad that i'm approaching a community online for some ideas, but I am required to seek potential "clients".&nbsp;<br><br>Catch: it can't be an opportunity, the program/service needs to be a solution to an issue. I want it to be useful too!<br><br>Cheers

What sort of issue are you taking about?<br><br>I was thinking about online security, password theft, etc. That's not really one issue, since it's got a lot of different "branches", and you could write a program that is a solution to one of the branches of the problem.

when i go on avicus in spectator mode and fall down there's always these weird potion bubbles that appear near where my crosshair is pointing. alm said he tried to fix it but couldn't figure out what it was after a lot of effort (hour or so tops, probably) so i'm sure you could find out what it is with 3 months, although i do think it might involve myphp or something.

So a client has approached me; let's say - and he/she requested I created a program based off their needs (the issue would be that other products are not suitable). For example, an inventory system... but that's too mainstream!

An anti cheat, like a combat logging plugin?

You could try browsing through google extensions and maybe you'll find an idea you like.
