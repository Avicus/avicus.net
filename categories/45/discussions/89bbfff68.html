I suggest adding a plugin that when someone kills somebody and they log because they got knocked in the void. If you add it, it would make the player have it count as a kill, and they would have a death.&nbsp;<br>(I edited the 2nd one out)

I agree to the first but having disquise is pointless for because its not like we have anyone who actively plays here with more than 10k subs afaik... and just because you're donor doesnt mean you're famous (well it kinda does but not to an extent where you'd have to hide yourself from the community)

Omg1!!!!1 itz steven! im ur biggest sub1!<br><br>@OP I agree with the first part as it would eliminate the need to punish people and save time. The second isn't really necessary. The media people only have ranks so they can record for the tournament. They aren't necessarily large youtubers (except steven he has 5,703,000 subs). I don't see a need for premium ranks to have it as a rank =/= huge popularity
