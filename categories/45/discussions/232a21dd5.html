&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When I'm playing, I've noticed so many skins that just seem so,&nbsp;<i></i>random. And I often like to think why they chose that random frog or that giant mash of pixels to be their skin. But to save me the brainpower of thinking, you could just tell me!<br><br>As for me, my younger self wanted to look cool, so little James chose this. (Up and to the left a bit)<br>And now I'm just to lazy to change it.

Started out on a server where I first got my name (My old name MumbleGod). It was the admins nickname so I also took his skin :P (The admin once tp'd me to him, then fireballed me, spawned mobs on me etc. as a joke because of my name and skin xP). I then ededited the skin to my liking and have kept it ever since.&nbsp;<br>This all happened about 2 years ago,

Kycrafft you put the most thought into your skin as anyone on this server. xD<br><br>Anyway I got a creative spark when I was made this and I put a lot of thought into the design. I can't remember what I put on the front of my body but I put a key on my back and the crown was the thing that put the skin over the top.

Well, I was in the mood to change my skin, and one of my friends had a squirtle skin. To even it out I got a fire-type pokemon as my skin (charmander), and that's how it happened. Also, I started a clan called the Charmy Clan, and this was the skin for us. That's why Avicus_Owner has this skin as well.

The current skin, and username that I have right now actually fit me perfectly.<br><br>My username comes from the time when I brought my laptop in to Best Buy to ask if there are any ways I can make it run faster. They said "Well, if anything your graphics card is probably outdated. Actually, your laptop might not even have one" Hence the name "GraphixError".<br><br>My skin has a sceptical on it's right eye (left if you're looking at it, right if you're being technical) and I actually have a stigmatism in my right eye, making it really hard to see out of. I'll be getting glasses for that soon.

My skin on the forums hasn't updated, but it's a Squirtle skin that I made a while back, and I decided to use it again. I'm not an avid Pokemon player, but my brothers were when I was growing up, so it's kind of had an influence on me x)
