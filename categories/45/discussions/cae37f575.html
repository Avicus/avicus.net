If this is a real thing I would expect it to be more professional.<br><br>You didn't write any background info on your team or provide any examples. You said you built for youtubers. Which ones and what builds?&nbsp;<br><br>So please provide some examples of your builds. We could assume that the best you can do right now (without examples) is make a dirt house 4v4 without a roof.

I'm sorry, I can't be bothered to take this "team" seriously anymore.<br><br>You've also given us a bunch of useless projects to work on, let me remind you that:<br>a. Gizzy didn't even use the map we sent him.<br>b. You guys literally worked your ass of on a lab for DanTDM that was half-decent in aesthetics and was a waste of time.<br>c. You told us that you "knew" these people, yet I don't see it.<br><br>P.S. I recommend you try and improve your building skills so you have something to present and make it seem like you are capable of leading a "professional" build team. &gt;.&gt;

You of course.<br><br>You stated before when doing the Gizzy map that you had contacts with him. I thought you actually shared contact details with each other. Hell, you even talked about him like you knew him personally. AND you asked for his mother's name. :/<br><br>The fact that I actually thought the mofo was gonna use the map was the reason why I actually helped build. Then, on the day of the deadline, you tell us that he MAY OR MAY NOT USE IT. I want straight answers so I can be sure I'm doing something that is worth it.<br><br>For DanTDM, you made a lab for him. I never helped a single bit because I new it would all go to waste. AND WADDYA KNOW, IT DID. All I can think about your projects now are just ambitious and far-fetched attempts to get youtubers to use builds from a team that doesn't even have a foothold in professional building.
