Ok so as some of you can tell, I haven't been on lately. This is because my Minecraft hasn't been opening for some reason but today I got it fixed! <i>(surprisingly)</i>...... sadly the only issue is that whenever I try to login to the server using Hypixel's Skull Client <i>(the only client i feel safe to use because I got banned of servers for having Labymod and I don't use 5zig because it doesn't allow you to use togglesprint)</i>, it closes my game and says "It looks like you are using an unsupported modified version of the game....the game crashed while tesselating block model" and so this is what I need to know:<br><br><br>- Is this happening for any of you?<br>- If not, what version are you using and are you using something like Forge or Labymod?<br>- any suggestions to clients for 1.8? (not asking for hacked clients)<br>- Clients I will not use: Labymod because of it not being allowed on some servers, 5zig because it does not allow you to use toggle sprint, Forge because it is too laggy for me.<br><br>If you want to help out ya boy, it'd be nice! I will give previews to my pack to those who give any suggestions that help me out :)

L<br><br>ok seriously you can probably use the skull project client its essentially like labymod&nbsp;but kinda edited for hypixel.<br>if not you could wait for cheatbreaker to come out but its 1.7 and I'm not sure if you want to play on that version

I can, but it just crashed my game, as for cheatbreaker I have heard news that it will be in 1.8 also. currently im temporarily using labymod and hoping i dont get screenshared on any servers lol. I was using skull previously so I most likely wont be going back to that. If it ends up being in 1.7, ehhhhhh itll be laggy but if the "double you fps" thing is true, the it shouldnt be an issue

Henry this happened to me before, when i was using forge 1.8, what I did was delete forge and just install labymod, and it worked just fine, and I didn't crash after that.

As I said, I would use labymod but I would rather use a client I can't get banned for on other servers than use a client that is bannable on other servers. I would use forge 1.8 if it wasn't laggy (fps wise) for me.

I would use forge if my laptop was good enough :P and yeah some servers are weird with compatibility with clients.
