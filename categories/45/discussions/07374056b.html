So, After thinking about this decision for A long Time, I have decided I will be leaving Minecraft. There are some Personal Reasons that i really do not wan´t to share, And Others, Which I could share, But, i would be surpised if someone cared. If, By the end of this week or next, I do not get Replied by Mango, It´ll be the end for me on the most amazing block game of History!<br><br>Avicus, I love you. Even since i joined, The fact that the community was&nbsp; Ripped in pieces, In some Occasion´s, And So Joined in the others. I have lived with Avicus great times and Bad times, But I have been able to overcome the Bad ones with the help of an Amazing community. There are Always people that Hurt you, But there are People that actually defend you and help you out when you have problems. I would like To Name out some of this People, But please, If you are not included in this list, Do not worry! Because I still consider you, Yes you!, As part of my family as a whole.<br><br>List:<br><br>- MLGPorky: Great person. Ever since I met him, He´s been really friendly towards Avicus as a whole, And, If I am not wrong, He has always done so. Thanks for all the Help Porkyy! Really appreciate it!<br><img title="Image: https://lapitar.lapis.blue/helm/100/028806860da44ac3a62343369c73afb1" class="img-rounded" src="https://lapitar.lapis.blue/helm/100/028806860da44ac3a62343369c73afb1"><br><br>- Awesomerp: I met him recently, But He really does seem like a Great bloke. He´s spontaneous, And, Generally says the first thing that comes into His mind. He helped me to Overcome the Ban, And In a way, Helped me out with another problem I had, Not related to Minecraft, And I will keep that as a secret.<br><br><img title="Image: https://lapitar.lapis.blue/helm/100/59d434b54cc449b4a69643476ddf09ed" class="img-rounded" src="https://lapitar.lapis.blue/helm/100/59d434b54cc449b4a69643476ddf09ed"><br><br>- SnowSX3: I know this might sound weird, But he is like my twin. We share same opinions about most of the things,And most of the community Agree, He is happy most of the time, And Helps you out with everything. Snow knows things about me that even my Parents don´t know, Since I really trust him, And I really do Hope He continues like that.<br><h1><img class="img-rounded" src="https://lapitar.lapis.blue/helm/100/c58188cb25d84d4497b111a598917f1b"></h1>&nbsp;<br><br>There are Many More! Vlad, RileGuy, Lavish, Pavillion, All members of Liquidators and more!<br><br><br><br>I Have written this post at least 7 times, Since I didn´t have enough forces to do it. I have cried and Laughed writing this post.<br><br>Appart from Exclusive people, I would like to thank the community as a whole. You always receive players with a Charming welcome, And I really appreciate it.<br><br>These where the best 5 months of my Life

ToggleControl. Let me tell you. Most of the staff moderating Avicus sucks, <b><u>only some of them.&nbsp;</u></b> Avicus staff really need to brush up on their skills. If the moderator sucks at pvp or his FOV is like quake pro, they may think someone is reaching from far away.

LOL.

FOV Affects because you may not be able to judge how many blocks. Besides, you appeal on the forums now, and I don't plan on getting unbanned because avicus is not the community for me.

But you said staff my think a player is hacking by player's FOV, correct me if I understood wrong?<br>If player's FOV is Quake Pro, it won't affect the staff that is watching the player. Also it won't affect staff because there is nothing called Reach Hacks, they don't exist. Altough there is an option where you can set your Aimbot/kill-aura reach but it just sets it to the max minecraft reach which is around 4 blocks with a sword. All above 4.5 blocks are fake.

You are wrong!<br>I googled for minecraft hacked client, clicked the first match and downloaded a random hacked client.<br>"Installed" it and tested the killaura thing in a survival world with creepers in gamemode 1.<br>And it looked like that 6 blocks are quite possible.<br>Btw I'm not naming the hacked client and I "deinstalled" it (deleted all files and stuff) right after my "test".

Could be possible. Never said something other...<br>I just said that it's quite possible to use a hacked client to hit a player/mod from more than 6 blocks.<br>And I tried the hacked client on a survival world so my ping doesn't matter.
