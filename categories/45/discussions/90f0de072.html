For the people asking, I was demoted for posting an Instagram post without permission, I did so thinking it was a fairly decent post, after organising the making of the post with Koja, him setting the map for me, and spending about 10 mins trying to get the perfect shot lol. (Despite I had been told in the past not to post without permission, but I did not think it was bad).&nbsp;It was mainly because people could not see the text, but me being colour blind and still being able to see the text meant that for me I thought It was fine.&nbsp;<br>The post :D -&nbsp;<a href="https://imgur.com/a/58rdI" title="Link: https://imgur.com/a/58rdI">https://imgur.com/a/58rdI</a><br>fyi- I aint perma leaving or mod retiring for lyfe

Well, you posted something without permission. Just because you think it looked nice doesn't mean that you didn't violate one of the rules you were given. The whole point is to consult others or see if it is fit for the instagram, in which case yours isn't. I can't actually read any of the text on the Instagram posts, they should have a shadow behind the text for all of them.<br><br>Also, you<i> really</i> shouldn't post that document.

Xtra, I'm sorry but you handled this in a really immature way. You didn't follow Kord's instructions to not post without his permission, and you blew it way out of proportion when you got demoted by retiring from mod. That really isn't how to handle those situations... Also you could have asked the graphics team for help with the post if you are color blind, so I'm not sure why you didn't...&nbsp;<br><br>The thing I would do if I were you is try to learn from this and move on from it.

Yeh It was mainly a mistake of my own, just I have asked the graphics department once before for help on a post, and I got not response or content, so I took it into my own hands to try something, and when you have worked hard on something and they just burst your bubble it doesn't help. It seemed I couldn't seem to do a good job with any of the stuff I seemed to produce anyways, 70% would be turned down, and most of the posts I did not need to ask for consent for.<br><br>And&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">immature maybe, but I do have important things coming up anyways which I do need to focus on, so if anything, this has helped me</span>

I am not going to hide my problems. Yes, I am struggling to lead this team and focus mainly on advertising, yes I was not the most&nbsp;active person with you and maybe I could have been more active when discussing things, but I was active enough to respond to pings and give feedback when needed. This isn't because I dislike you are like you,&nbsp;when you are under me making these posts you represent me, like you would in any work situation that you market yourself. I am not excusing my mistakes and you shouldn't either. The most important thing we do after a mistake is to learn and take precautions to learn from them. I am doing that myself every day and it's why I am still here even after my flaws. You said it yourself this isn't hurting you because this is Minecraft&nbsp;but this is still an experience so I will give you this advice. Do not blame me for this action, assess the situation, learn from it and take precautions&nbsp;to make yourself a better person in the line of work because you are going to do the same mistakes and the same consequences&nbsp;will sadly happen. Thank you for all the work you have done until now, you held Instagram when no one else was there for a while. It wasn't easy and up until today, I was proud of you being on my team. Please promise me you will learn from this.

Yes, because you obviously shouldn't listen to people who are in the same exact team as you, and who warned you prior and who are working towards a common goal! The problem is, you didn't listen to anyone in the first place.
