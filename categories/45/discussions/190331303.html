<div>Edit: Thank you so much for the support, I love you all :)<br><br><br>So the time has come. I'm officially leaving the Avicus Network.</div><div><br></div><div>Prepare for a long thread, but don't worry, it'll be the last one I make. Oh God, I just realised how bittersweet that sounded xD</div><div><br></div><div>I've basically been inactive for over 2 weeks now, I've only really still been active on the forums these days and I feel with university kicking into full gear, my forum activity will start to decrease as well.</div><div>Because of this, I feel that now is the right time to make this thread.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>During the past 2 years I've had the most fun here that anyone could have. I've laughed probably more than anyone should and I've had the privilege to meet and play with some of the most incredible people in the history of the world.</div><div>I've also grown as a person over the past 2 years and because of it and I couldn't be more grateful.</div><div><br></div><div>My time as staff was an incredibly humbling experience, I had so much support from so many people going into it, I just hoped I did them justice.&nbsp;</div><div>Being a staff member for me produced some of the best and most challenging moments I've ever had on any minecraft server, and I appreciate that so much. I got to work with so many talented people and I got to help people and that's something I wanted to do since day one.</div><div><br></div><div>I have been at the end of so many jokes it's been hilarious.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I never ever thought that test banning myself after my commands stopped working one day would ever be used against me for months and months after it happened.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I also never thought that by simply helping Petlas tease FrozenSolstice one day on a shipping thread, that it would create the weirdest ship ever in Snowlas.</div><div><br></div><div>I've loved every single moment on this server and could be more appreciative of it. Good or bad, I've cherished every experience.</div><div><br></div><div><b><i><u>Personal Thank Yous.</u></i></b></div><div><br></div><div><b>Petlas</b></div><div>Petlas! We've had some amazing moments together over the past few months. So many inside jokes have been made, I've actually lost count. You're my closet friend here and I couldn't be more thankful for that. You've listened to every single one of my rants when things would go wrong on the server and you're always keen to talk to me even at 2am and I've appreciated every moment. We laughed over so many things and have so much in common it's hard to think that a year ago, I barely even knew you, if at all.&nbsp;</div><div>Thank you for being there for me, thanks for laughing with me more than anyone else and thanks for being such a great friend.&nbsp;</div><div>All shipping jokes aside I couldn't be more thankful for the bond that we have.<br>Thank you. For everything.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Sessp</b></div><div>Baaaaaaa</div><div><br></div><div><b>FrozenSolstice</b></div><div>Hey Sky, I'm probably the only person that still calls you that xD</div><div>You're one of if not the first real friend I made on this server, and you've been with me all the way. We got promoted to Junior Mod and to Mod together, I still remember us trying to get our heads around everything the day we were both Juniors. You were with me from the start and now you're here at the end. Thanks for all the laughs, talks and rants. And thanks for all the fun times on TeamSpeak! Those were some of my favourite moments.</div><div>Good luck with Moderating, show the staff what the S team can do! lol</div><div><br></div><div><b>Jozz</b></div><div>Jozz maaaate. When we were on the staff team together you were such a role model for me, when I was a Junior Moderator I always looked up to you because you knew everything. Working alongside you in the staff team was a blast and the quality banter that was had was top notch! I am so fortunate to call you my friend because you're always so awesome towards me and we got along so well. Thanks for everything, in and out of the staff team, thanks bud :D</div><div><br></div><div><b>Jake41901</b></div><div>Jake! Back when we were both staff you've always been a role model of mine , and still are. Your friendly nature and general laid back awesomeness was so inspiring. You were always so easy to talk to and I sincerely appreciate the cape you gave me. And the reasoning why you did, I will always appreciate that.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Tynvale</b></div><div>Tyn! I love your banter and your sense of humour is on point. I enjoyed every one of our TeamSpeak sessions because the amount of banter that went on was always extreme. You're a really cool guy who grew so much in the staff team and it was always awesome to see. Thanks for all the laughs!</div><div><br></div><div><b>Porky</b></div><div>Porky mate! You were one of my favourite staff members and are still one of my favourite people. We agree on everything and anything. I wish we hung out more but timezones are a bitch.</div><div>You're a really cool and chill guy Porksta! Keep being awesome!</div><div><br></div><div><b>Et477</b></div><div>Et! You've always been a great friend towards me and know how to create some top quality banter. I know one day you'll get staff, you're always helping other people and expect nothing in return and I always respected that about you. Thanks for being a good friend.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Venomous</b>&nbsp;</div><div>Talking to you about anything on Teamspeak has always been fun, thanks for all the chats, they've always been something I've enjoyed. I hope one day you'll come back to the staff team if you're still interested. You were always one of the better Mods I felt. Keep being awesome man.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Cyanide</b></div><div>Welcome back to the staff team Cy! If last time is anything to go by then you're about to become one of the best Moderators on this staff team. Good luck, and keep speaking your mind, I always loved that about you, you and I were never afraid to speak our minds, and that's something you don't see often in the staff team. So keep doing it.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Sayah</b></div><div>Toggle! Good luck with the Override Network man! I know you'll make it great! It sucks that you never got staff here but I look forward to seeing what you can do on Override. You definitely have the potential. Thanks for the opportunity over there and thanks for being a real cool friend.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Sessp</b></div><div>Sess mate, you've been such a great friend to me, and that's such an understatement. We've been through a shit ton together and you've stuck by my side through it all. I don't think I've met a funnier person than you, I totally appeal to your sense of humour, it's fucking golden xD&nbsp;</div><div>You've worked so hard to get to where you're at and I know it's only a matter of time before you become an Administrator. You deserve that much.&nbsp;</div><div>Thanks for being my best friend, thanks for working with me, having a laugh with me and putting up with me haha.</div><div>And hopefully next time when you retire it'll be longer than 22 hours xD</div><div>Thanks for everything brother.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Cacalmarin</b></div><div>#SnowCarries</div><div><br></div><div>And to anyone else who I may have forgot..you're just so awesome that your name escapes me as I write this... Yea that's it xD</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Oh crap, I nearly forgot.</div><div><br></div><div>Seniors, if you could do me a solid and promote <b>sessp</b> to Administrator, that'd be great. He's the most deserving out of all the Senior Mods and will make an excellent Admin.</div><div><br></div><div>Oh, and while you're at it, if you could also promote <b>Vobaseball12</b> and <b>FrostedCupcakez</b> to Senior Moderator, that'd be the best goodbye present ever. Because all three of these guys are weeeell overdue a promotion and I would know, cause I've been watching the staff team for a while now.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>So thanks guys, for making me truly enjoy this blocky game,&nbsp;</div><div>thanks for making me laugh more than anyone else on the server and thanks for just talking to me, whether it was just shits and gigs or if it was to debate on the forums,&nbsp;</div><div>it's been such a fun-filled ride and I've appreciated ever positive and negative moment.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I <b><i>don't</i></b> plan on losing touch with anyone, I'm <i><b>always</b></i> a Skype message away if you want to spin a yarn. My Skype, SnapChat and Instagram is SnowSX3, so hit me up and <i>stay in touch</i> &lt;3</div><div>As far as Avicus goes though, it's not a priority for me anymore.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>This thread doesn't do me justice, I know I've forgot to say some things but at the end of the day, I love you all.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Thank you so much. I wish you all the best in whatever you choose to do, in Minecraft and in real life.</div><div><br></div><div>I mean, if you can put up with me and my crap then you can do anything so you'll be fine xD</div><div><br></div><div>Regards,</div><div><b><i><u>-William.</u></i></b></div><div><br></div>

Well, the second i saw the "Goodbye and Thank you" i thought, this is just going to be another regular which i never really knew. Then i looked down and i saw your name, and i flipped the hell out XD<br><br>I don't know where to start XD I'm stuck for words right now. Well lets start off with something,<br><br><br>


No,
<h1>Thank you</h1><br>You have no idea what our friendship has meant to me. You were the second person i ever met on Team Speak and i remember quite well what happened, Dylan non stop tunnelling and he kept coming up and recking you.<br><br>&nbsp;From then on we started to know one another better. I was still very shocked to not see you get Senior Moderator. But slowly our friendship grew and by June i had been promoted and we tackled the rule breakers together!<br><br>&nbsp;You were my role model, especially throughout my early mod career, i looked up to you and to be honest no matter how many times you banned yourself you were still a great moderator :^) .<br><br>We had a lot of fun, you banning yourself, me retiring for 22 hours before i decided to return (and i was glad i did :P ) and lets not forget those voice changers XDDDDDD "FISH AND CHIPS!!"&nbsp;<br><br>We would both be no stop calling out the Seniors on Team Speak, i remember this like it was yesterday, good old banter. Eventually i had a "talk" with a couple of seniors and they made me aware of my place (Thanks Mr.Zeusy). Then, 2 months later, Jozz approaches me and promotes me to Senior, i remember that very well. After they trained me and i got moved down, i think you were happier then me XDDDDDD.&nbsp;<br><br>From then on, we would help one another and we still ranted together, but not at the Seniors XD. Between then and the end of december we both had work, and our timezones made sure we didn't see each other too much :(.&nbsp;<br><br>Then came Christmas, this was probably the worst thing i ever did as Senior, it's the thing i regret the most. I was instructed by the Admins at the time to demote you, i completely disagreed with the demotion reason but i was told to do so and i did. To my amazement you weren't pissed (at me XD), you accepted it. This never ruined our friendship, you pretended like it never happened. I am very very very very very very very thankful for that.&nbsp;<br><br>From then till now, well, we haven't seen each other that much. Timezones and work have meant that by the time i get back from Uni, you are already asleep XD.&nbsp;<br><br>Seriously though, thank you. Thank you for all the laughs, the fun times, the drama, the salt and thank you for being there and supporting me all the way. If it wasn't for you, i would have retired long ago (and it would have been longer then 22 hours XD). You and me are like brothers. I hope, i really do, that you are still able to come on Team Speak from time to time,i will certainly be messaging you over Skype non stop. I think i have a few tears in my eyes right now.<br><br>Thank You.<br><br>- Peter

You finally used your name... :')<br><br>Snow, you were one of my first friends on Avicus. From the times we mini-modded together, to when we were promoted, and essentially throughout our whole Avicus journey. I won't forget the times on TS where I was begging you not to sleep, even thought it was probably 3am there.<br><br>We had our ups and downs, when I felt bad you were there to help me. I hope I repayed the favour.<br><br><br>I don't want to sound sappy, but I'm sure nobody will forget you. I sure as hell won't, either.&nbsp;<br><br>Ill still message you over Skype, Will. ;D<br><br>...And let Snowlas be a warning! Ships will start if you tease me on the shipping thread!

Despite me not often communicating with you, the few experiences I've had with you have been enlightening and very good. You're a very nice and honest person who isn't afraid to give criticism and feedback.<br><br>Several months ago when that fiasco happened with me in the staff team I came to you for support and you gave me sound advice. Despite my demotion, I've felt that our talk had an impact on me. I don't respond so negatively and openly to insults anymore...<br><br>However you worship as a deity, may they take you on a grand journey through life... Give you excellent degree in University... Give you a great and eventful&nbsp;<b>(The fun and safe kind of eventful)&nbsp;</b>career.&nbsp;<br><br>I'll be sending you a Skype request, I feel that me and you should've communicated more. Sort of feeling lukewarm now that I've realized how much you've helped me...<br><br>Huh... Have a good one Snow &lt;:)

Lately I haven't been checking any minecraft related stuff at all, yet today I decided to take a look. <br>The first thing I see is this, posted today... on the one day I check the forums. Coincidence? I think not!<br><br>So, I actually don't have much time because I have 2 exams tomorrow and I should be studying but I'mma do this anyway!<br><br>You were such an excellent person. You were very friendly, talkative, funny, helpful, and ahhh just about everything you can think of! You were a good friend of mine while I was on avicus, and played a huge role in how much I enjoyed the server. Not only were you a good friend, you also helped me a <b>tonne</b>. When I first became a Jr.Mod and later Mod you gave me some incredible feedback. You were the <i>only </i>mod who gave me good and helpful constructive criticism. I mean others did help me out as well, but you stood out <i>far </i>above them. So pretty much thanks for everything you've done for me, and all the time you put in as a moderator for the server.<br>I'm sure you will be greatly missed by everyone here.<br><br>Good luck with everything! &lt;3

Snow, you are one of the people I knew very well and talked to on occasion. However, I know that you were not just an amazing staff member, but a great friend to everyone here on Avicus. The times we had were just amazing! I wish you the best of luck in life buddy, its sad to see a great person like you leave Avicus. Just remember, you can achieve anything if you put your mind straight to it. Once again, goodbye William and I wish you the best with your life ahead! &lt;3 :(

Here's your present.<br><br>

Will, mate. There are absolutely no words I can say to describe exactly how much you mean to me. As I was there for your 2am rants, you were there for me too. Always willing to listen. And that's an irreplaceable quality in a friendship, particularly ours. <br><br>

As concise as this is, appreciate the shortness of it. For all you've done and all the moments we've shared, they sum up my appreciation. I believe I've even changed as a person just by learning and looking up to you.<br><br>

So thank you. For everything, really. You will be missed. <br><br>

I also believe this is going to be my final post (or one of my final posts, depends on the necessity of making another post) here for a while. <br><br>

Sayonara, ciao, au revoir. Whatever you guys aspire to achieve in life, I wish you the best on your journey. :)<br><br>
