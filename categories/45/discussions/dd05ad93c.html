<b>SPOILER, TURN BACK!&nbsp;</b><b>SPOILER, TURN BACK!&nbsp;</b><b>SPOILER, TURN BACK!</b><br><br>Hey! One of the greatest Star Wars movies ever created came out recently. Many fans have been aggravated by the death of one of the most symbolic characters of the franchise, Han Solo. In my opinion, his death was extremely saddening and i almost, ALMOST cried when the camera showed Chewbacca see his best friend get speared. Luckily, Kylo got his ____ shot off, and got his legs and face cut up which helped a little. To be honest though, it was a nice touch having such a big character (whose actor doesn't even like being Han lol) be killed off. I loved the hell out of him, but all legends must come to an end. I hope next movie, Kylo goes insane due to "hearing and seeing and feeling" his father's presence. Have him become a monster-lunatic. :D<br><br>What were your opinions on the death of Han Solo?<br><br>What do you rate the movie?<br><br>Predictions for the next movies?<br><br><br><b>Fun Fact</b>: Disney has decided to make another prequel to Star Wars "A New Hope" for those who don't know. The movie is going to be about the rebel team that retrieved the Death Star plans, which will then lead into the oldest of them all, A New Hope. Hype!

Good job with the spoiler alerts &lt;3 I don't believe Han Solo is dead though... if you think about it, they never showed his death. And do you know how much HYPE it would bring if he came back? Star Wars has also pulled some stuff like that before, Darth Maul wasn't really dead, etc.&nbsp;<div>10/10</div><div>Luke is gonna die, Han Solo will come back in 8th or 9th</div>

I had to watch the movie 3 times 3 days in a row since the 17th lmao rip<br><br>Han Solo's death wasn't that disappointing for me.&nbsp;<br><br>1 thing that annoys me is that Rey literally masters the force in 3 minutes and then beats a trained sith in a light saber battle with 0 training. Chewbacca also saved the plot completely by shooting Ren and wounding him cos Rey and Fin would've both been shmoked if Ren didn't fight them whilst wounded (even though he should've beaten them EASILY when wounded).

<b><b>What was your opinions on the death of Han Solo?</b><br></b>It was needed for Kylo Ren to have character development. He had to die for Kylo Ren to completely turn over to the dark side, to knock off all ties related to him and his family for him to become a true Sith.<br><br><b><b>What do you rate the movie?</b></b><br>9.23/10<br><br><b><b>Predictions for the next movies?</b><br></b>REY IS LUKES DAUGHTER. When Kylo Ren<b> was </b>torturing Rey for the map of Luke Skywalker, it showed the island you later find out about where he was. And he says this: "Han Solo. He's like the father you never had, he would disappoint you." Why did he talk about fathers? Who was on that island? Luke Skywalker. And he said that to Rey, who, would be Luke Skywalkers daughter.<b><br><br><b>Anything else?<br></b></b>Kylo Ren lost to Rey because 1. He was shot by Chewbacca after Han Solo was stabbed to death by Kylo Ren. 2. Finn got a few hits on him. If it was a normal fight, Kylo Ren would of won.<b><br><b>ALSO<br></b></b>Han Solo is DEAD. After he fell down, Leia sensed him being killed. And yes, it could of been from Kylo Ren completely turning over to the dark side. But, Leia sensed him being killed.<b><br><b>ALSO<br></b></b>When Rey touched Anakins Skywalkers lightsaber, she got memories.<b> </b>There you could see the Knights of Ren as they killed a padawan who had the tube hat on his head. I think Kylo Ren got other padawans to help him destroy the Jedi Order, who are, the Knights of Ren.

All of those people were strong with the force. Qui Gonn was a jedi master on the council and he still did die, Anakin was extremely strong with the force to the point he was thought to be the chosen one, Darth Maul was trained by Palpatine who was trained by a sith who could stop others from dying.<br><br>Han Solo is a smuggler

Although it may not be canon, Maul was abused EVERY DAY OF HIS LIFE by Sidious as part of his training. He was tortured so much the Force Lightning would do nearly nothing to him (but the opposite happened in the Clone Wars series...)

Could be true, there was a scene that showed Luke flying away from her when she was young (going to assume it was Luke as she even has his pilot helmet). Even still she shouldn't have force mastery as a child.&nbsp;<br><br>Btw I would love it if they made movies on the non cannon stuff, I'd love to see character development for sith lords such as King Adas, Naga Sadow or Darth Nihilus.

When Kylo Ren<b> was </b>torturing Rey for the map of Luke Skywalker, it
 showed the island you later find out about where he was. And he says 
this: "Han Solo. He's like the father you never had, he would disappoint
 you." Why did he talk about fathers? Who was on that island? Luke 
Skywalker. And he said that to Rey, who, would be Luke Skywalkers 
daughter.<b><br></b>

Good job with the spoiler alerts &lt;3 I don't believe Han Solo is dead though... if you think about it, they never showed his death. And do you know how much HYPE it would bring if he came back? Star Wars has also pulled some stuff like that before, Darth Maul wasn't really dead, etc.&nbsp;<div>10/10</div><div>Luke is gonna die, Han Solo will come back in 8th or 9th</div>

Han Solo is dead.&nbsp;<br><br>People like Darth Maul and Anakin Skywalker were able to survive being killed by feeding off the dark side energies.

The ships did work, how else would the Falcon have been able to fly? :P<br><br>Rey was a scavenger who found all sorts of things on her adventures such as broken down or even running ships so it seems fitting. :P

Not to mention there are sith lords with teachings literally showing others how to become god with the dark side (king adas), then you have Han Solo who has to talk his way out to survive from a club of chinese men with axes

I give it a 7/10<br><br>I actually enjoyed it better than i thought.<br><br>Issues:<br><br>I felt like it was episode 4 all over again:<br><br>*Droid on desert planet with secret plans(surprised it wasnt Tatooine personally)<br><br>*"Piece of garbage"-Falcon(C'mon thats a bullshit reference)<br><br>*Those octopus things that look incredibly like the thing in the garbage chute from episode 4.<br><br>*Boba Fett V2 or Captain Phasma, whichever you prefer. What happens to her. Is she supposed to be some Elite person? Cause she goes down like a chump and then gets cut out of the movie because..... Screw it, we ran out of funding to add another scene of her in?<br><br>*They bring back Akbar and that bloke who was with Han in the Falcon in ROTJ simply because they want you to be like, "OMG its them again!"<br><br>How the Falcon stays in one piece when Rey takes off is beyond me. AT first I was expecting a glass window to break, or maybe some wires/ parts/ maybe something in the cupboard to fall over or break but then I gave up thinking that stupid realistic idea.<br><br>*I love how the Falcon is just sitting there-the power of convenience.....<br><br>*Ok, so we learn later the OP pilot dude survives and was ejected from the crashing ship. But he lost his jacket? Um how was he stripped of his jacket and thrown miles away?<br><br>*The little floaty ball that Fin chucks away(The thing luke practiced with in Episode 4)<br><br>How the fuck did Han and Chewie find the Falcon?(Han said that he knew who stole it, ok maybe he didnt know who stole it from who when, but he was flying around the planet when they were flying away. So...... Too hard to steal back when its just sitting in the open, fuck it wait till its moving and could leave the planet when we're not watching?)<br><br>*That stupid 1000 year old woman who is there simply to advance the plot. What happens to her? They forgot to add a scene where she died or escaped, they just cut her out of the following shots. I feel as though her back story wouldve been more interesting.<br><br>*More on the old woman, how did she find the lightsaber? She left the bar to go get it herself? She knew where to go? I doubt that. Ok it implies that she knows the force, lets go out on a limb and say she is force sensitive. Ok, she trained herself? She could sense an object so.....imbued with the force? If she could sense it WHY DID LUKE OR KYLO NEVER GO AFTER IT?!<br><br>*The Rey learning the force bullshit annoyed me. They did that to Luke a lot in the original movies, but he had the duration of 3/4 years throught episodes 4,5 and 6 to master the force, as well as the help from Yoda and Obi Wan. But all she had to help her/hint her was the fact that Kylo Ren was having trouble sensing her thoughts. How did she know how to mind trick, come on. 30 minutes beforehand she just realised that the force and Jedi were true. Where did she learn about the Jedi, the only relationships she ever has were to the woman she cleaned parts with and the food for parts dude.<br><br>*AND THEN SHE SMASHED KYLO?! That would be like saying that Darth Maul would lose to a youngling. And the youngling would have more training with the force than her.&nbsp;<br><br>*The stormtrooper said that he had been taken from his family to become a trooper. Didn't his family give him a name? I dunno....Steve, Jacob, Mitch?<br><br>*Finn Lives?! Yes with a massive gash down his back and multiple stabs. Well Kylo survives this as well i suppose. But if this is the case with all lighsaber wounds, why didn't those 3&nbsp;<u>Jedi Masters</u> with Mace Windu that Sidious killed just get back up and be like "Bitch, that weapon can't keep us down"<br><br>I could go on as there were so many cheap scenes, references and continuity errors, but to me the only things that could set this apart as a movie with as high of a reputation as Star Wars are:<br><br>Rey's character introduction-They introduced her well, how she lived, how she has come to live here, her determination, where she fitted in to the society. It made me care about her character.<br><br>That final scene where you see Luke, the scene and the iconic soundtrack- ok that is probably the best set up for the next movie i have ever seen<br><br>And Han Solo carrying most of the movie-Great acting, dialogue and where he fits in and what he does throughtout the movie and yes he is dead, as mentioned before-Leia senses it.

Rogue Squadron is NOT Episode 8. It is in the middle of 3 and 4 of how the Rebels got the plans to the Death Star.

Honestly, I thought the movie was brilliant, but something about it means that I still prefer the originals.<br><br>There are implications that Rey is Luke's daughter. The fact that the scene where she took Anakin's lightsaber (in the exact same way Luke summoned it - minus an angry Wampa), the fact that she was able to overpower Kylo Ren (who had one force sensitive parent - Leia - while Rey has at least one force sensitive parent and potentially 2. Finally, in the Disney Infinity game, Kylo Ren refers to Rey as "cousin". Interpret that as you will but to me that indicates that she's Luke's daughter. Therefore, I'm not particularly surprised that Rey was stronger than Kylo Ren, considering that Luke's connection to the Force appears to be - for the moment - stronger than Leia's.<br><br>I was a bit disappointed by the choreography. It felt way too slow and simplistic after the prequels. Even the originals had faster fight scenes, especially when it came to lightsaber fights.<br><br>Honestly, I had a feeling Han Solo was going to die. They showed him so much in the movie, and Harrison Ford wanted Han Solo to die after episode 5. I'm not really surprised.<br><br>What annoyed me about the film was that they took the plot directly out of one of the books. In the now non-canon lore, Leia and Han had three children (Jaina Solo, Jacen Solo, and Anakin Solo). All of them were Jedi, and Jacen turned to the dark side.

Actually, there was a game that came out a few years ago called "Star Wars: Lethal Alliance". It's too long to explain so look it up, but it involves a Twi'lek going after the Death Star plans and getting them back to the Rebel Alliance.<br><br>You should try it out. It's on the DS and PSP, but it's actually a great game.

Having Rey as Luke's daughter would be stupid, as they've literally already done the same for Kylo and Han. We don't need anymore of that. I'd much rather have it that she was powerful in the force and the sole survivor of Kylo's purge and she got her mind wiped to make it harder for Kylo to find her.

That's left to speculation. Qui Gon Jinn and Mace Windu were stated to be good friends, and there's no proof that Windu COULDN'T manifest himself. Perhaps he just never chose to.<br><br>And The Clone Wars left so many plot holes in regards to that. Last I checked, it would be a bit difficult for Obi Wan to travel to the planet that Yoda learnt how to become a ghost on, considering he sold Grievous' ship for safe passage to Tatooine and he couldn't exactly go around the galaxy, nor could he easily travel to Korriban. I know that Obi Wan is one of the most powerful and skilled Jedi (only surpassed by Anakin, Mace, and Yoda in power/skill), but I highly doubt he'd be strong enough to resist the Dark Side on Korriban.

<u>Opinion on Han Solo's death</u>: LAME. I'm sorry but it was obvious that he HAD to die by his son's hand. So there's that. But why was it so obvious when Han went to&nbsp;Kylo Ren on the bridge, and Kylo said that he wanted to get away from the dark side, that he was lying? I saw it coming from the moment that Han walked onto the bridge. And when both Kylo and Han had the saber in their hands, it didn't surprise me that Kylo faked and turned on the saber and killed Han. And they way he fell into the pit underneath was a bit better, how it showed that he still loved his son, even after he was impaled. But the parts leading up to Han getting killed were obvious, a bit too obvious. Still, like AutoHit said, it was needed for Kylo's character development. But I thought that there would be a bit more to him killing his father, not just a classic fake.<br><br><u>Rating</u>: 9/10. Some things (like ^) were a bit disappointing, but over all a great movie. And that ending tho.<br><br><u><br>Predictions</u>: Idk. I just want to see it xD.<br>

If someone blows up, and they have clearly died without any possibility of them surviving, then they're dead.

The lightsaber battles really triggered me, considering that both of the people that were fighting the sith weren't officially Jedi. Did Rey have the force? Yes, but she had no training and was not identified at all as a Jedi. It's been said before that people other than Jedi really can't fight with a lightsaber, so I don't know why Finn was flinging it around, or how Rey could beat Kylo in a battle when she was untrained and he was conditioned to be a Sith lord.

Actually, he was very important to the prequels. It was Windu's constant mistrust in Anakin that influenced him to seek advice from Palps, who as we all know is Sidious.

Lightsabers are described as being a conduit for a Jedi or Sith's power.

Dooku was also one of the greatest lightsaber masters the Jedi Order had ever produced. He was a master of all forms (like Mace Windu and Yoda) but preferred the style of Makashi. Most of the Jedi that Grievous killed fairly wouldn't last more than a few minutes against Dooku at best. In addition, Grievous had 4 lightsabers, so it'd be nigh impossible for a lightsaber wielder to best him without the Force.

Never said they should kill or that it's the right thing to do, read over it again. I said they tried so hard to hit sabers instead of going for disarming maneuvers. And no, you're wrong, if you look at WookiePedia you'd know that going for apt he ankles or neck is a dishonorable and illegal(?) move for the Jedi.

Hm...interesting. I just doubt it since the planet crumbled to nothing, but maybe he could've gotten away. I don't think Phasma would have a change of heart though.<br><br>A bit off topic, but anyone notice Phasma didn't shoot a single laser in the entire movie?

Never said they should kill or that it's the right thing to do, read over it again. I said they tried so hard to hit sabers instead of going for disarming maneuvers. And no, you're wrong, if you look at WookiePedia you'd know that going for apt he ankles or neck is a dishonorable and illegal(?) move for the Jedi.

I may be wrong, but I remember them showing the lightsaber sticking through Han's upper body. He's definitely gone. He's not Superman, even the second most awesome character in Star Wars couldn't survive a fall like that. Luke had an excuse, because he was, you know, force sensitive.<br><br>@ X_Redstone_X: This is the same woman who was fine with killing men, women and children in a small village while they were unarmed. I highly doubt she had a change of heart. Sorry =(.<br><br>Although, Ford is in the cast for the next movie, so it's possible.

As per the Jedi's beliefs, everyone should have a fair trial and criminals must stand trial regardless of the damage that must be inflicted.<br><br>Ford wanted Solo to&nbsp;<b>die</b>, he never said he wouldn't star in the new trilogy. =D

Han Solo is not alive, he fell into an endless pit and if that didn't kill him, he blew up. I don't understand why people are still conspiring about this.

If Han Solo really is going to be in the next movies it's going to be flashbacks of him with Kylo when he was younger. His actually character is bound to be dead though, IMO.
