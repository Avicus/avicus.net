&nbsp;

Dear Diary,

&nbsp;

The only thing I can do is moan and cry. &nbsp;I’m trying to live
these last hours I have until I cease from existence. &nbsp;I feel as if I am
in a living fire. &nbsp;Even though I have a perfect amount of gold, it won’t
matter now. &nbsp;Besides, it took almost Death to get it. &nbsp;Bandits beat
me up and stole my treasure. &nbsp;I got shot in my left leg...but worst of all
I found the gold in the ravine. &nbsp;

A few hours ago, I found an enormous ravine. &nbsp;Out of
curiosity I peeked and looked. &nbsp;I saw bits of shiny, yellow rock.
&nbsp;The only thing it could be was gold, so I did what anyone would do, I
climbed down. &nbsp;I was barefoot so my feet were in terrible pain. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;As I went down, I thought this would be a good day for the
first time- at least, until I slipped. &nbsp;I fell and grabbed the nearest
branch, I held onto with my life. &nbsp;I looked down and saw that the ravine
seemed ten times deeper. &nbsp;When I thought things could not be worse, the
branch broke. &nbsp;I fell to what I thought would be my death, and for this I
wanted to die. &nbsp;I did not want to suffer and feel the after effects of the
fall. &nbsp;For sure, death would be next. &nbsp;I woke up still alive.
&nbsp;“Why?” I asked. &nbsp;“Why am I still alive”. &nbsp;I could barely move
and everything was numb. &nbsp;I could not hear anything and I saw the blood
around my body. &nbsp;

&nbsp;

However, I had just remembered about the gold stuck to the wall.
&nbsp;I looked at the gold and realized I did not bring my pickaxe. &nbsp;The
only thing I had was you, my diary and a pencil. &nbsp;

&nbsp;

Now at this moment, I hear the voices of the loved ones I will not
be able to see no longer. &nbsp;”Come back,” the voices say. &nbsp;The gold
though, what I came here for, I will never be able to get it. &nbsp;Bye bye
Diary, I shall meet you in Heaven as I lay here dying, I know I will meet you.

<span>&nbsp;<br><br>Hope you like!</span>

We either have to make a story or a history model, not a DNA Model yet
