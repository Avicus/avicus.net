Well, this is a bit late, but what are your favourite things before and after the omega update. This will also contain maybe a couple of improvements.<br><br>(Note: I have searched and found no sign of a previous post like this.)<br><br>My favourite things so far:<br><br>Omega:<br><br>Badges. These provide a good thing to work towards and are fun to see.<br>Credits. After they took away experience, credits came, I am thankful.<br>New Gamemodes and reviving of previous gamemodes. This was great to see. Gamemodes like TDM and Nebula, CTH and SG were revived, while CTW was added.<br>Credit Sounds. I believe this is a excellent small implement that Avicus has. People can also have the option of staying with the old-fashioned 'ding'.<br>Enderchest. Wonderful, just wonderful to see a type of backpack been able to keep all your things you bought.<br><br>Improvements:<br><br>Leaderboard. Yes I know it's back, but it was sad to see it go in the first place. I know CTW was added and it might have been a pain to change, but it was something a lot of players were walking towards.<br><br><br>Before Omega:<br><br>Prestiges. As soon as I realised what a prestige was, I was instantly trying to get it as quick as I could. This was great.<br>Leaderboard. As I mentioned earlier, this was added back, but it was great to see something like this on Avicus in general.<br>Maps. I know this might get some comment about this one, but the old maps in my opinion were better than the new maps. Maps like Broken world and Luar were just more enjoyable than maps such as Sunbeam Temple and Mute City(renamed King's Fortress).<br><br>Improvements:<br><br>None that I can think of, the old avicus was almost perfect.<br><br>That is my Before and After Omega Update.<br><br>What's yours?

The map developers were looking to open a "Throwback" server with all of the old avicus maps such as Fantasy, Broken World, Luar, Mystic, Volcano, etc.<br><br>Still need to approach Kylo about it, he liked the idea. Possibly a merge between MCZone and old avicus maps, or 1 mczone and 1 oldvicus?

So basically avicus might have 3 servers, one for the oldest, MCZone, one before omega and the current one.<br><br>If we can fit that into the one server, it would be an excellent thing, but if we can't, it's still fine with most people.

I agree. The commands and the profile layouts were better but I prefer badges to prestiges.

I really liked prestiges too, and they should've been kept, the server and website are a lot better imo because of the Omega Update, but some stuff should be brought back.

Wrong :P<br><br>MCZone &nbsp;was famous for CTW and I believe it was here at the start of Avicus. Maps like Rendevous II...

True, I do think they should have given something in replacement for the prestiges you had earned

Yeah I like the badges idea though. Not only having that one&nbsp;* in different colours is nice. But everyone that had a prestige should have been given something like 10 - 50k credits depending on which prestige they had.

Before Omega Update-<br>Lots of amazing features that fell into a state of disrepair from lack of upkeep.<br><br>After McZone: Great gamemodes like CTH, Nebula and Walls along with Elimination and Avicade (which broke shortly after). Prestige's came great addition for people that played a lot during this time. Amazing maps from G_SKIPPY and ParaPenguin really made Avicus feel unique and special. Forums looked great also having a very active community at the time helped. <br><br>Avicore (which was the second update if I recall?): Much needed update that really made the server one of the best again, fixing lots of bugs and bringing more players. Also revived a lot of old gamemodes CTH &lt;3 had lots of great staff members working on the server at the time. Great maps from Para/Tan, Merlinmaster and resepignev/Flo made the server more modern in style and ascetics. Only bad thing that came from this update was the block lag and the failure to keep the success gained with player counts.<br><br>1 year/Prestige update: Didn't really enjoy this update as much because of all the bugs that came with it statistic wise. So many glitches the maps started to become oversized lag fests with more map makers turning to ascetics over gameplay. Also the at this time the player amounts had went down from lack of maintenance.<br><br>Omega: Overall I'm not amazed with this update, I listed the pros and cons to sort it out but I can't say it was bad or good.<br><br>Pros: <br>New gamemodes (CTW and SG)<br>Awesome website (Friends, better layout of the forums &amp; and simpler looking)<br>Credits<br>Fair gameplay<br><br>Cons:<br>Every type of server lag known to MC<br>Lack of players<br>Stats pages changed<br>Poor maps gameplay wise
