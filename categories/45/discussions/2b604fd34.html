Well, I want to say that I know I have made a lot of leaving posts but this one has a somewhat decent reason for it. |<br><br>I'm joined Avicus&nbsp;Febuary 2014 because my irl friend (cadeknuth21) told me about it. I played with a lot of my in real like friends and we loved to play walls. I always remember that I thought nebula was terrible. Basically, I started to love the server and I got more walls kits. That's when I wanted to buy Gold rank. I bought gold rank and I was pretty happy. Then all of my irl friends stopped playing Minecraft in general, and it was just me playing it. I had no one to talk to on skype, because I didn't want to talk to "strangers". I finally overcome that fear and added StormzInvader and avumbaca&nbsp;(Avy) on skype, and I talked to them. Avumbuca&nbsp;told me about TeamSpeak, so I joined it and met some new people. After getting involved on that side of the community, I joined the forums, and I was pretty much a forum spammer, but I didn't do it intentionally. I donated to emerald later that year and got banned on the forums. I waited it out and then got appealed, and realised I had been invited to a team. I joined the team (CrookArmy), and it was a walls team. I started enjoying nebula in 2015 aswell. Crookarmy was my first ever team and I loved to muck around in their fun scrims. That later disbanded so I made a new team named Xenarch. We never actually won a match but we were really close friends. Glesmon and I got into a fight and everyone started to leave breaking our friendship up. For like 2 months being disbanded I created a new one and named it Xenarch, and Cake later joined. This means cake and I are the only Xenarch players left. I also donated to diamond. Then 2016 came and there wasn't anything special about that.<br><br>Thank-Yous:<br><br><b>Xenarch</b> - Thank you everyone for being amazing teammates<br><br><b>Nathy&nbsp;</b>- Thank you for making me get into CS:GO and actually being a good moderator<br><br><b>The actual decent staff&nbsp;</b>- Thanks for being decent staff<br><br><b>Ryzinq -&nbsp;</b>One of my most closest friends on the server thanks<br><br><b>Dawson -&nbsp;</b>Thanks dawson for being a really good friend<b><br><br></b>I have probably missed a lot of people and I'm sorry for that.<br><br>For the main reason on why I am leaving, it is just that I don't have ANY interest in minecraft anymore. It is getting so boring, and I just prefer other games. I have really enjpyed avicus and Im sorry for being toxic on the forums lately.<br><br>Goodbye avicus.<br><b><br><br><br></b><br><br><b></b><br><br><b></b>
