I am wondering if I should leave avicus and minecraft. There are a few reasons why I think I should leave.<br><br>1.I am no help at all toward avicus<br><br>2. Many people have anger against me on avicus<br><br>3. I should do more than I am doing with my life&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Now my question is should I leave avicus and minecraft or should I stay

You should stay! I'm sure lots of people are appreciative of you, whether or not you help the server :3

You should stay because of these reasons that i answered:&nbsp;<br><br><i>1.I am no help at all toward avicus<br></i>Ans: Avicus is a server that you can enjoy, play not to actually help the server the best you can. You can just enjoy your game in the server, and you don't actually have to worry that you didn't actually helped avicus at all. You can just have fun!<br><i>2. Many people have anger against me on avicus<br></i>Ans: Well, if people has anger upon you, there should be a reason. And you are the person who know the reason very well, so you work hard to fix that problem and become friends again with your enemies in the server, that would solve this question.<br><i>3.I should do more than i am doing with my life&nbsp;<br></i>Ans: Minecraft is a game that you can enjoy, not to destroy your entire life if you play it. I know when you think about it, game is not the entire life but it is just a part of your life that you can have fun with. And perhaps, who knows? You can have fun with Minecraft!

Because if your around 12 (Guessing here) what do you expect to do at your age?<br><br>You go to school then go home.<br><br>That's it. There's literally nothing else to do so just play minecraft.

The staff are always there too.&nbsp;<br><br>3. You can do more with your life. You don't have to leave, just play less.&nbsp;</span>

You can go play guitar, or swim, or read. If you ever don't want to do those, hop back on the computer. I'm sure you can balance it out.
