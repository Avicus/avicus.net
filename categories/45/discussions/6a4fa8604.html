You can get Adware sometimes by browsing the internet and they sneak it in to your download.A regular virus scan should get rid of it.

I have some kind of "computer cleaner &amp; fastener" virus on my comp, and i can't seem to get rid of it. I made a new account on my comp and haven't gotten any effects of the virus on this account, so that's an easy way to get rid of it.

Search up control panel<br><br>Programs&gt; Uninstall a program&gt; Get rid of all the crap that you don't need. Some may trick you that they're intel drivers but they're actually not. I've experienced that on my sister's laptop.

If you have any issues with viruses, malwares or adwares you should not scan your computer with your anti-virus program as the virus is always one step a head of you and it will hide, I promise. When you start your computer, every system, program and even some files will run automatically, by starting your computer in safe-mode (you boot into safe-mode by holding F8 as soon as you start your computer) not a single program or file will be able to run(it's why it's called safe-mode). It's when you are in safe-mode you should scan your computer.

Here is what i did:<br><br>Deleted The following:<br><ul><li>Check Me Up</li><li>Super Scanner</li><li>Wajam Internet Inhancer</li></ul>Now that i have done that, You may or may not lose connection/Mess up your proxy.<br><b>How i fixed it:</b> Create A second account on ur PC (If you have one already go to it), In your Search bar type "Proxy" &gt; Hit enter. Go to "LAN". Remove the any numbers from 'adress', Type in the First 2 numbers of your WNK (Wireless Network Key) In the 'Ports' Section. Congratulations, you have safely restored your PC. (Type that in your first account, not the second one).
