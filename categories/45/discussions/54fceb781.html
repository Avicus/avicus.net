I rather not see this.<br><br>If someone is harrasing you and such you should deal with it by reporting the player not running away and hiding. The player will continue on other accounts or go after other players if a person ignores them. If the player is banned he won't be able to continue doing the same thing.<br><br>Don't run away from the problem. DEAL with the problem (by reporting).

i want to be able to report them and ignore them.<br>people can be potentially scarred for life by things that others say to them online. people have said some things to me on avicus i wish i could forget, that actually fucked me up for a while. i could've used the ignore then.<br><br>sometimes it's 100% necessary to "run away".

okay, seriously? people have events in their life that are absolutely horrifying and when you say something that brings it up again, it can set off a trigger and really fuck you up for a bit. saying 'scarred for life' may have been a bit much, but it has happened before. i'm just saying that some people need to watch what they say instead of telling the victims to get off the internet. it's pretty simple, just don't be an asshat to people. i'm not gonna switch servers, avicus is unique and has a community i've gotten to know.<br>if you haven't been in this experience, you shouldn't be talking. you haven't seen or felt what people can do online if they find what hurts you most.

There was already a Suggestion like that...<br>I only remember that it can get very annoying if some players ignore 1 person like bullying... so -1<br>(PS: Wrong account, I know....)<br>(PSS: You never will know who I am! &gt;:D)<br>(PSSS: If someone tells them who I am, I ignore you, even without the command)
