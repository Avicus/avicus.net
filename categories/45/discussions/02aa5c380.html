Hello, I was wondering if anyone here could suggest some desktop gaming PCs. Since I barely know anything about computers I don't know what I should look for. I want a desktop that gets extremely good FPS. Is able to record, big memory. Lets just say like a perfect one for gaming. If you have any suggestions you are more then welcome to post them on the thread. Give me what is positive about it and what is negative about it. Thank you, and have a good day.

What ever you do, make sure you have balanced PC specs, not a very expensive graphics card and everything else cheap.

OMG, The 970 is so overrated.... The R9 290X is (shouldn't say WAY better but you get the point) better, and is the same price... I mean the 970 has a hard time pushing 4K with that. and the 290X is the SAME as the 780Ti... Even tho it runs hot, Put in a fan in the case... the Stock cooler at AMD Sucks balls, but Just customize the case a bit and place a fan or something in it to cool it...<br><br>So Idk, but you better get knowledge of PC parts

It is, for recordings and if you have a bid library of films etc..<br>I didn't brag, I just said him that my PC is good for recordings? ok? Is this too hard for you to understand?<br><br>3TB is like 132$, this is not money wasting, it just would be if you are poor.
