I was just wondering when the server would decide to fulfill it's promises of bringing walls back. I've heard from staff that it was suppose to be soon after Atlas. I just want to see the game mode that made the server, actually be on the server. Now, not to fire shots or anything, but why do we bring in all these game modes that are played for about 2 days, or that are played 1 day every 2 weeks? Correct me if I am wrong, but we removed some servers because of money issues, but brought things like frenzy and Skywars that are hardly ever played. I am not trying to start anything, so please do not get any type of undergarments in a bunch. It is not like walls would go untouched, a decent amount of the walls community still plays on the server for some reason.&nbsp;I am not trying to start anything, so please do not get any type of undergarments in a bunch. If you do bring walls back, please fix the kits that were messed up completely by a certain staff member. Also, if we were to have a particular staff member help run the show for walls I would suggest Bogoh. Thank you no salt pls :( I am not the only one who thinks this, I just can't stand playing dtm over and over again with the same rot with maps that no one likes. DO NOT TELL ME TO PLAY WALLS ON ANOTHER SERVER WHEN THIS SERVER HAD THE BEST WALLS.&nbsp;I am not trying to start anything, so please do not get any type of undergarments in a bunch. &nbsp;Thank you

I wouldn't exactly say that walls is dead. Bringing walls back to the server would actually bring people back. If you refer to the team that I am on currently, out of the 30 we have, about half are inactive. A majority of the team were walls players and went inactive around the time walls was removed. I haven't been around the server for very long, but I do know this server could use more people.

This isn't meant to fire shots at you, or anybody. But they have just been bringing back the wrong things. Walls is what made this server in the first place.

I don't know if you played on this server a while back, but Walls was the limelight of this server. A lot of people played it, and correct me if I am wrong, hardly anyone plays frenzy and skywars. Skywars was hyped for about a week after it's release, and then went down hill. Nebula has nothing to do with this, since it is the only game mode keeping this server alive at the moment. Also, Skywars didn't bring any new or old people back on to the server, it was the same people from nebula just asking for just enough players to start it. What I am trying to get at is bringing walls back will bring people too.

what? i don't recall ever seeing anyone mention walls let alone ever play it when i've been on the server. avicus should focus on what's "unique" around here, which is nebula, before they go off and try to make the "best" version of that hypixel twat's dime-a-dozen gamemode

Don't you think people get sick of playing the same game mode with the same rot? Avicus walls was unique compared to other server's walls. We should not have just one game mode keeping this server alive. What if people get sick of it and want something new? You can only add so many variations into one game mode. All I am saying is if you are going to bring in all these new game modes, why not bring walls back?

The quotes around "unique" are very necessary. Avicus was given hope when OCN was going to shut down. We were overjoyed about the death of another community, as it meant for a possibility of us gaining players. Once that backfired in out faces, we started adding gamemodes. I am not saying that nebula should be neglected, as I very much enjoy it, and think it should get attention, as it is the main gamemode. I just think that rather than adding gamemodes like skywars and frenzy, they should add something like walls. Especially when people are asking for it&nbsp;<u>BEFORE</u> they announce it. People only got hyped about skywars and frenzy when they announced it, because they hoped that the gamemodes would be a way for avicus to grow again, and look how far they got us. And I know you are going to say something along the lines of "how is walls different from any of X gamemodes", but it is because people&nbsp;<i>actually</i> want it. There is a whole community of people that left this server because walls was removed, and many of them would come back if it was readded.

You're missing the entire purpose of this post. I am saying Walls should be brought back instead of game modes like arcade, frenzy, and skywars. No where in the post did I say walls should replace nebula, nor am I hating on it. In fact, I have no idea how Nebula was brought into this topic, apologies ig amirite

I agree with you in certain areas like the fact that without walls we wouldn't have gotten the exposure we received years ago. However it's pretty obvious that Nebula is the real MVP, even back then when we did have Walls the majority of the players came because of Walls and then found Nebula and Walls hasn't really be the same. I know for a fact that if we did bring Walls back there would be people playing but it would still be inactive majority of the time. I think we need to work on the gamemode that we know is popular, which is Nebula, and rather than try to make new gamemodes we should be making Nebula better. And even if we did bring Walls back I doubt it will be the Original version, if that makes sense. In regards with when, where or even if it is being re implemented that's probably up for discussion but what I can say is that if we do decide to bring it back, it will be a 2017 project.<br><br><b>Disclaimer: Not promising anything.

I agree, but I am trying to say that remove frenzy or Skywars and add walls back. It's just hard to see these game modes going unplayed, when I know people would come and play walls. Even if it was a bit inactive, it would be better off than some of the servers we have currently. I appreciate the feedback :-) I do agree Nebula should be the main priority at the moment, we have just been waiting for walls for so long, to only be let down. Thanks my dude

I don't know why people keep bringing up DTM and Nebula. We are by no means saying that those should be put on the back burner. I&nbsp;<u><i>COMPLETLEY</i></u> agree that both of those are the main selling point of avicus, and they should be the main priority. Sky wars did indeed not work because every other server has it, and you can argue the same for walls, but Avicus walls is different. Its different because it was kept simple. It had unique kits, and nothing fancy or different like Hypixel or other servers. It had a community of players who made maps, and were able to put their own loot tables into them, allowing for each map to be different, not having the same loot tables for every map, and to have special items revolving around the community. People put time into being able to get as stacked as possible in the maps.&nbsp;<br><br>Even if walls isn't added, I don't get the point of trying to add all of the other different game modes at all. If you really think that DTM is the only thing for avicus and that it should be the main priority and have the focus, why are you adding all of the pointless game modes in the first place?

People put time into being able to get as stacked as possible in the maps.&nbsp;<br><br>Even if walls isn't added, I don't get the point of trying to add all of the other different game modes at all. If you really think that DTM is the only thing for avicus and that it should be the main priority and have the focus, why are you adding all of the pointless game modes in the first place?

+1<br>Walls was the first gamemode I played on avicus when I joined and it's the reason I stayed and created a whole bunch of new friendships. I think it just needs a little boost or some sort of event to show people the glory of it. Back when it was still good and not ruined by unnecessary changes we would get atleast 20 people on for games. And I agree with some of you by getting rid of the useless game modes and adding something people will play on a regular basis like walls, I played it everyday when I woke up and before I went to bed

I haven't read much of the conversation that has happened but the small part I have read it seems like an opinion against bridging Walls back is that it is not going to be any different from Skywars or other gamemodes that were removed long ago and brought back recently. I agree to a point with this comment, but not fully. I think that if Walls was brought back with the help of the community and people who played Walls before it was removed it could become like it was before. Walls was very popular a couple years ago, and I think it still can be. There are just a few things that were "fixed" a while ago, and they were problems, yes, but they were fixed in the wrong way.&nbsp;<br><br>Some of the problems were kits, height limits, and maps. Two out of three of these were "fixed". <br><br>Height limits were "broken" because the kit Stomper was too overpowered. In which I think that instead of lowering height limits they should make Stomper not do as much damage, or no damage to other players. This was a huge problem, and I understand trying to fix it, but it was done in the wrong way. In my opinion the best way to fix this problem is make Stomper not do damage to other players, but simply not take fall damage.&nbsp;<br>-Just to add to this though, height limits can be lowered, but not the the extent that they were. For a long time the height limits were 256, which is the max height limit in Minecraft. We can move these down without making them too low. 100 blocks from the highest point on a map seems more then fair, honestly. Especially if the kits are fixed in the way I've mentions below. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Kits were "fixed" by re-creating the kits with less overpowered kits, and trying to balance them. Good idea, but the kits weren't balanced. There was still kits that were just overall better. I don't disagree with having an overpowered kit, but there needs to be one or more kits that can contradict that kit and have their own overpowered item or perk. There's not a perfect way to make this, unless you take some time to make the kits perfectly, and test them. But kits like Stomper that have no weakness need to have one. Make a kit that doesn't take damage from Stomper, while it also has it's own perk. And make a kit with something to fight that kits perk, as well as having it's own. It could make a circle basically. Kind of like the Water Cycle, a way to make everything work without any major problems.<br><br>Maps were never the biggest problem. other then that there weren't enough maps being submitted to make less of a knowledge gap between old and new players. The only way to really fix this is for the community to make more maps that work well with Walls. Another slight problem I've seen with Map Devs is that sometimes to a person that has played Walls the map looks amazing, but to a Map Dev it looks really bad. I understand that Map Devs are trained to know more about maps and gameplay, but if I'm completely honest a person who has played Walls for a long time knows if a map will be good or not better then a Map Dev does. Map Devs have the final say, but really I think that unless a Map Dev has played Walls consistently they shouldn't make a final decision.&nbsp;<br><br>-Just a note, this isn't to criticize the Map Devs at all. You guys are good at what you do, but you don't know the maps like Walls players do. You guys deal with DTM so much that it's much harder to tell if a Walls map will have good gameplay or not. I'm simply asking to take that into consideration when you look at Walls maps. Maybe look at the comments from Walls players to see what they think. We (Walls players) can work on commenting what we think of maps and why, but we should start making maps as well. Lol<br><br>-My opinions, if you have any questions just ask. I'll read this post and keep up with the comments. Thanks,<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-Bogoh/Micah

I agree with you in certain areas like the fact that without walls we wouldn't have gotten the exposure we received years ago. However it's pretty obvious that Nebula is the real MVP, even back then when we did have Walls the majority of the players came because of Walls and then found Nebula and Walls hasn't really be the same. I know for a fact that if we did bring Walls back there would be people playing but it would still be inactive majority of the time. I think we need to work on the gamemode that we know is popular, which is Nebula, and rather than try to make new gamemodes we should be making Nebula better. And even if we did bring Walls back I doubt it will be the Original version, if that makes sense. In regards with when, where or even if it is being re implemented that's probably up for discussion but what I can say is that if we do decide to bring it back, it will be a 2017 project.<br><br><b>Disclaimer: Not promising anything. We'll talk about it at our next meeting and see where we go.&nbsp;</b>

</div>
Not to completely shut this down or anything, but Walls went unpopular due to a few changes that were needed but they were made in the wrong way. I've stated these in my original post, but I think that if we brought back the old Walls, with a few updates that were needed, then it would become popular again. I personally have always loved Walls more than any other gamemode, but I stopped playing because of some updates. And I know I'm not the only one that stopped because of those, because Walls died within a month after those updates came out.

Sorry but this whole post is wrong. xd I enjoy DTM/Nebula as much as anyone, but Walls really did create Avicus. Even Keenan has said that Walls was the first gamemode on Avicus, and it started MCZone/Avicus.

I couldn't agree more, and that's the whole point of making this. The people who support and want walls back, well, they&nbsp;<i>really</i> do. I just hope that the people who are able to make a change with this listen to this community, and are able to at least put something into action. And I completely understand that they are already working on many changes for the entirety of the server, which will obviously take priority over this, but hopefully seeing how passionate the community is about this will impact what they put after all of the changes that are clearly above this.

Boom. Perfectly said. You hit everything that there is to hit really. This is the main reason for us vouching for you to be one of the people who would be in charge of changes if walls were to become a thing again. You have a say, you were a part of the old community, before the changes you said in your post happened, and you have connections to a lot of the walls community. You are a great voice of and for the walls community to the people in charge, and I hope that your voice is heard by them.

Well if the community wants walls over skyways,avicade,nexus, or frenzy..why not give it to them? This is my main problem that I talked with staff today about, not listening to the community on what they want, it's obvious these people want this more than other game modes

what if we bot a petition going and got people to comment as a sort of signature? would that be a possible way to advocate for bringing it back? if we got &nbsp;say, 50 people to say they would want it back since the most I see on avicus recently is around 50-80 people would you bring it back? I feel like that is a fair way to demonstrate how many people would prefer that walls be brought back asap as well how many people would utilize it once it went back up.

that legit won't do anything<br><br>it's up to the development team to create a plugin/xml module for Walls. While it can demonstrate players wanting the gamemode, it's all up to the development team's choice.<br><br>It's like skywars. Players asked for Skywars and signed petitions/responded to posts with a positive feeling. Now nobody plays it even though players wanted it. I doubt the devs would want this to happen again.

It probably won't attract new players, but it will attract old players that left the server due to the updates and the removal of walls. It also has a better chance of attracting new players than all of the other servers they keep bringing in, if you refer to what Tobizik said, Avicus walls was unique and the community is great.

We (the Walls community) need to realize that this may not happen. And instead of complaining, let's give some ideas. New kits, new maps, new ideas in general. So far I've seen a lot of reasons to add Walls back, but they all include "Walls was bad before, we can fix it and it will be fun again." How about we give some ideas to help fix those problems. Make the problems clear,&nbsp;<b>and</b> give ideas to fix them.&nbsp;<br><br>Yes, a lot of people want Walls back, including people who are disagreeing with this post, but it has nothing to do with the gamemode. It's the fact that DTM and overall server problems need to be fixed first.

Well i know for a fact that a lot of people responding on this forums page only want to play walls and joke about how we should get on avic to play walls, but on wait, they ditched it. I think that its worth the effort to try and bring it back with the development team because its another attempt to boost the sever back to its potential. Its just food for thought.

Walls on Avicus has really lost its touch anyway. The kits and maps were ruined by map developers that didn't care enough about the gamemode. I love Walls but it's really not worth bring it back at this point.

Pirates Cove was removed, but Posighdon was nerfed a ton so that it wasn't overpowered. There was no reason to remove Pirates Cove after that. It's maps like this that had no reason to be removed but were. A lot of really good maps that everyone enjoyed was removed, and without any real reason or even a warning. They were just gone.
