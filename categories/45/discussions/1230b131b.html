Hello! If you watch my channel, you'll know that my video editor (iMovie, yeah...) is unfortunately unusable due to some unknown reason that I have yet to find. Thus, I've been trying to find a reliable and decent quality video editor for Mac, and so far... no progress. It might just be the insane learning curve from iMovie to other software, but even then it's not that great. Everything's either too simple or too complicated. I could look more into trying to learn more about the complicated applications, but if you guys have any suggestions, it'd be greatly appreciated!<br><br><i>tl;dr</i> | Suggest some video editing programs that can be used for Mac. I'm willing to pay money, but anything over $200 is pretty obnoxious...

"iMovie is unusable", what do you mean? If it shows the "do not enter" sign on top of the icon, then do this:<br>- Go to Applications<br>- Right click iMovie, and show package contents<br>- Go into Contents -&gt; MacOS<br>- Open iMovie.sh (or whatever the file is called)<br><br>This is what I usually do, since it doesn't work normally for me either. I also used Final Cut Pro.

Whenever I open iMovie, it replies as "Application not responding" and it does not open whatsoever... I'll try your method though.

I don't need professional software, I only do light editing on my videos. Anyways, iMovie seems to be working again so I'm fine.

I'm not sure but I believe pinnacle studio 17 works, its made by the same producers as sony but its $200 less. it is $100 in Canada. Only problem for me is that I had to change a setting in bandicam so it won't glitch out and convert the video if it is short enough since bandicam doesn't record .avi files properly. Not sure for any other software. But if you do get it (which I recommend) and you are having a problem that your long videos randomly have the end cut out in the timeline but not in VLC it means you have to convert the video (preferrably to the same format). I use it and it works perfectly fine except for those 2 little problems that are fixed easily.

Use ScreenFlow.<br><br>You can record and edit videos, you loose little to no fps when you record too.

Final Cut Pro is the most professional and is very simple and intuitive. Don't bother buying it, go to torrentz.eu/thepiratebay.se and find the latest version. (Final Cut Pro&nbsp;10.1.3)

Like what a few people already said here, use ScreenFlow. It's a great software! You can edit your videos on there. It also records games pretty well.

Screenflow is literally 100 dollars for a copy that isn't pirated, I wouldn't spend that type of money on something like that on a computer.<br><br>Either way, iMovie is extremely easy to setup, and it's not hard to learn either
