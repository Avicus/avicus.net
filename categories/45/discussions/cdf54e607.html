So im not very good at this PVP thing and i can get very salty and toxic at times. I was just chilling and enjoying my game when i couldnt kill this one player. Him and his teammate were sat upon our spawn and we couldnt kill them. I got hit off and i called him a hacker( He wasnt hacking i was just toxic) and then as i spawned he killed me again and out of anger i shouted a racist word which i am not proud of and i do not think being racist is funny either. I am not a racist person and i have nothing against other ethnicities.<br><br>Just enjoy my reaction..<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ju_nPdIuJU&amp;feature=youtu.be" title="Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ju_nPdIuJU&amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ju_nPdIuJU&amp;feature=youtu.be</a>

Well my friend has been playing this server for multiple years and has just decided to quit today and i wanted to see why he enjoyed playing this game so much so i hopped on the server and started playing and i get angry very easily so when i died from the same player multiple times i had to release my anger and it was my phone that took the blame... I know i've only played for 8 minutes but i was only showing everyone what i did over a game on the internet...

gotta love angry brits<br><br>pie is a really good player tho (the&nbsp;4Chil1Chees3Fry guy)<br><br>And also you could have just ran away, there's no need to actually go after the guys sitting on top of your spawn.<br><br>While spawncamping is allowed, spawnkilling isn't (so if one of them went into your spawn / shot into your spawn, you can report them or submit the recording on the report forum and they will be punished if valid).
