I remember when I used to play, the Atlas repository used to be public and it's description said that it was going to be open source, but now it's become closed source. What are the reasons for this and don't you want the community to help develop it?

Why would we have the main plugin public, and then invite anybody to come and make their own server to challenge Avicus?

The motivation for the plugin was a public plugin, and you could make a required plugin and give it only to contributors.

A decision was made to make the plugin closed-source since we are extensively writing complex features that we would prefer to keep in house. <br><br>Also, as Tazz said, it would be easy to take the plugin and make a complete copy of Avicus.&nbsp;<br><br>We have a number of open source projects that you can still contribute to, so feel free to help out on those fronts.&nbsp;<br><br>ALM
