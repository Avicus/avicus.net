What was it like on your first day on avicus/mczone/terrascape whatever it may be. My friend gave me the ip, and I said It looked boring. I then played it on my first day, and just quit for 1 hour, then went back on and it was so much fun xD

Avicus was my first ever server. I hadn't been able to get access to a functional PC for over three years, and when I finally did (for Christmas) I instantly got minecraft, looked up some server IPs and added a cool looking Skywars server: Avicus. I think my first map may have been Quintus or Fantasy, and up until a week or so later I had no idea where the monuments were so I just ran around and explored with my friend Beggstar.&nbsp;<br><br>I thought the monument was the middle block of the spawn until someone told me..<br><br>EDIT: rooty44, Meganlovesmining and Kennedy123, my babes, I still remember our walls gang. &lt;3

Older brother played it, I believe Ternio was the first map he/we played. He made a bunker and sniped the hell outta the enemy. :D I got super hyped for the server, and when it was my turn, I played for 2 hours straight (which isn't really that much anymore)

My friend gave me the ip and we played walls together. Then I went into this game mode called nebula, and saw some crazy assortment of sky bridges on Quintus. I instantly fell in love with the server and began to play more and more often :) By the way OCN has the same gamemode and its called Ghost Squadron. Never really understood it :/

I played minecraft offline, because we had limited internet (10 gigs a month, rip) &nbsp;but then we got unlimited so i looked up how to play walls online, because my friend showed my a walls video. &nbsp;And it sent me to wallsmc.net, my first ever server, i joined and i had no clue how to join a walls game, so i took the tutorial at spawn, and i learned about Elimination and played that for awhile and i found it fun :)

My first day was when I was at a friend's birthday party and we all hopped on Minecraft (there were like 5 of us) and someone showed us this server. I kind of felt left out because all of my friends were hacking and trying to get me to get hacks, but I didn't want to (and didn't know how). We played a bunch of walls games and always won because of them! Fun times, it feels like it happened yesterday in fact.

Everyone from McZone was very hyped for the release and a group consisting of FTW, Cow, CocoLatteSauce, and other mods and players were waiting for the launch (I don't remember if we were all at the mczone lobby waiting for the release). I got to meet so many new people after the launch and we immediately started talking on Skype to one another and played pretty much the entire day! It was fun...
