OCN RIPO-<br><br>I mean...<br><br>Yeah, I'd like this. Since some of the Seniors are almost impossible to contact on Skype. Then there's the problem where conversations literally only last two minutes for one reason or another. Anyway, I think it this was implemented it would be a much easier and efficient way to contact staff.<br><br>+1
