<div><b>This thread is not to flame, it is to get opinions from the community. Maybe I'm just being salty so lmk what you think.<br></b><br>Recently I played in the Avicus Tournament, Race to Victory II. Apollo were versing Team Rocket on Sub Urban Remastered. We both had a cap each and we had a touch of the other wool. Whilst on sky, FLIMBI ground rushed Bloodoh's wool. He went outside our spawned, pillared up to the barrier blocks placed for the sole intention to prevent people from jumping into the wool from the spawn. FLIMBI boxed himself in, placed a boat to get above height limit and jumped into the wool.&nbsp;Whether that's a map error or a minecraft bug, it simply should not be allowed.<br></div><div>The rules clearly state; "Do not intentionally take advantage of server exploits that give you an advantage of other players. Doing so may result in a severe punishment, depending on its severity". FLIMBI did this but hey because no ref or official or streamer decided to spec someone pushing the wool, they apparently can't punish.</div><div><br></div><div>In this clip there is no visual evidence that FLIMBI did it but listen to what Ryan is saying. He clearly says before FLIMBI actually did the boat glitch that he was going to do it. Let it be known that there was an official and a ref in the Apollo chat. Surely if the official and ref were listening and did their job (no offence) at least one of them would have tp'd to see what FLIMBI was doing. Instead it was completely ignored and it didn't help that the streamer was afk.</div><div>Link: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A18VQdRmRYs" title="Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A18VQdRmRYs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A18VQdRmRYs</a></div><div><br></div><div>After the fact, Ryan asked for an official over 10 times and it was completely ignored. Bloodoh went to FLIMBI's pillar and tried to replicate what he did. Bloodoh died in the void. Apparently, according to the officials I spoke to this was a huge advantage. Last time I checked dying in the void isn't an advantage, getting into the wool is though.</div><div><br></div><div><div>Although FLIMBI didn't actually cap the wool, he placed safeties which Matilaina picked up and capped. At first the argument was that because both teams "blockglitched" they couldn't do anything but let's be realistic here, Bloodoh only did it to see if it was legitimately possible because FLIMBI did it. As well as that, Bloodoh died to the void, he didn't get into the wool which resulted in a cap.</div><div><br></div><div>So apparently because we didn't record FLIMBI actually doing it there's nothing that can be done. I understand that the officials need evidence to show Team Rocket when they complain/try to appeal but why should it basically be a requirement to record all matches? If you can't be everywhere at once get more refs, get more officials. It's simple logic. The official staff team was incompetent which ultimately led to Team Rocket beating us.<br><b>This thread is not to flame, it is to get opinions from the community.

FLIMBI went in front of our spawn to the left a bit. He pillared up to on top of the barriers to the side of spawn which were put there to prevent rushers like FLIMBI to easily jump from our spawn to the woolroom. He used a boat to get above height limit that isnt possible to bridge on and got into the wool. If this isnt a server exploit it's at least a mapmaker error imo

Getting into the woolroom is by no means as easy as getting to spawn. You can't expect the defender to shoot him mid-air because he glitched.

well spawn has this little thing going where if you happen to die you end up there plus there's the nice central location<br>and as a professional bow breaker i believe i am qualified to say that yes, minecraft generally tends to be reliable enough when it comes to shooting entities as long as there's no excessive server lag or ping going on, and that you are way exaggerating the difficulty of shooting people in boats midair, especially considering the fact that a boat with a player in it is a pretty sizable target. even if you don't hit the boat, if you hit the player i'm like 95% sure that that will kill any momentum and leave them tumbling into the void. plus, we've also got to consider the fact that we aren't dealing with your average minecraft player here, we are dealing with people who have practiced landing bow shots on people and things for hundreds of hours who should definitely be able to hit a big ol' boat

Be that as it may I can like 99% guarantee that if you asked Fouled if he intended for that to be possible and ask him the reason for putting the barriers there it'd be a different story. I genuinely don't care too much about the loss at this point, it's more the fact that the officials changed their reasons why they wouldnt do anything like 3 times. Just made it seem like they had something against us (minecraft rivals XDXD)

There's a reason map testing is done. I know for a fact that Apollo found a way to get into the wool way too easily on one of the maps and it was fixed. If that was fixed I don't see why this shouldn't have been, unless you decided to keep it on the dl to abuse it in the tourney

There's a reason map testing is done. I know for a fact that Apollo found a way to get into the wool way too easily on one of the maps and it was fixed. If that was fixed I don't see why this shouldn't have been, unless you decided to keep it on the dl to abuse it in the tourney

Be that as it may I can like 99% guarantee that if you asked Fouled if he intended for that to be possible and ask him the reason for putting the barriers there it'd be a different story. I genuinely don't care too much about the loss at this point, it's more the fact that the officials changed their reasons why they wouldnt do anything like 3 times. Just made it seem like they had something against us (minecraft rivals XDXD)

That's exactly why it is a good strategy. The best strategies are the ones that are so random that even map makers who work hard trying to perfect the map and rival teams, who do everything they can to keep their opponent from winning, cant predict them.<br><br>Examples of other such strategies from OCN: the elytra strat on wallop 2 that arguably won KFC for Fussion. Punishers' nearly un-cannonable SSB icarus that brought them into the finals, etc.

Honestly yeah fair point. Although this situation seems kinda more glitchy that the examples you gave there's not much I can argue to that. Like I said, I made this to get other opinions because shockingly enough Apollo weren't the happiest. There's also the point that the officials agreed with Apollo that what I described to you and them was "glitch abusing" or whatever, it's just that they didn't have evidence so yeah

I mean not to sound critical while saying this but I would like to voice my own opinion. &nbsp;I just don't think name calling on the forums is the best place to do this. I know at that moment no referees were paying attention to his block glitching but you could have instead went to someone and dmed them afterwards with the evidence and told them personally. &nbsp;I know you personally as an honest person whom I know would not lie about this (and you have evidence you shared anyway) but I personally just disagree with how you handled this. &nbsp;You could have voiced criticisms of the referees voicing your view that they are not doing their jobs. &nbsp;Specially calling out individuals to use for your intended purposes of reporting on this broad issue of abusing glitches and non-spectating referees is just not a way I would personally go about handling this. &nbsp;I agree with some of your points here but it just doesn't seem the right thing to go use your post to go about and name call others. &nbsp;Just my 2 cents and I remain neutral on this issue as it doesn't concern me.

The audio evidence could be used still. &nbsp;What I was saying was that it was unnecessary to tell everyone on Avicus about this situation. &nbsp;He could have made it more private, handed over the audio that could be used to a staff member, etc. &nbsp;He is bringing massive amounts of attention to the scrimmage issue he discussed. &nbsp;It could be inciting harassment against the individuals. &nbsp;That is why /report is used in games. &nbsp;To make it more private so the person being discussed and the witness are not known. &nbsp;That is just an example. &nbsp;He could have gone on discord and said "Hey fouled these people abused glitches in the scrimmage" instead of going on the forums and saying "Hey everyone these people abused glitches and these individual scrimmage refs are lazy too."

Yeah to be fair I did a horrible job trying to explain it. Obviously I didn't see it so "<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">FLIMBI went in front of our spawn to the left a bit. He pillared up to on top of the barriers to the side of spawn which were put there to prevent rushers like FLIMBI to easily jump from our spawn to the woolroom. He used a boat to get above height limit that isnt possible to bridge on and got into the wool. If this isnt a server exploit it's at least a mapmaker error imo" that was probably a trash way of explaining it sorry.</span>

Just because Ciaan is the one whom posted it does not mean that this thread shouldn't be locked. &nbsp;This thread is one that obviously is in the wrong place, has a misleading title, is full of making accusations, etc. It is a lockable thread. &nbsp;This is no different from a thread in the discussion "Avicus Lounge" making a hackusation post. &nbsp;For someone who was staff for so long he should have known better then to post this on the forums. &nbsp;He knows to go and discuss his issue personally with a member of the staff. This thread is also causing a lot of unnecessary upheaval and flaming as well. I request a lock on this thread please for the reasons stated. &nbsp;He might as well have titled this thread ("FLIMBI cheated during the scrimmage and the refs weren't doing anything!" Since that is essentially what he is saying, though he changed the title to something more misleading "I played at an Avicus tournament"). &nbsp;Gee, I wonder why he changed the title to that innocent sounding name "I played at an Avicus Tournament" instead of keeping the good ol" "FLIMBO cheated during the scrimmage and the refs did nothing"? &nbsp;It's obviously not because he didn't want this thread to be instantly locked. &nbsp;No way that could be true in any sort of manner. 100% false and implausible.

First of all, this is not a misleading title. I did play an Avicus Tournament - I don't see the issue.<br><br>I spoke to many officials and gave them plenty of time to make a decision. The officials told us that the FINAL answer was that there was nothing they could do about it. I figured I was not going to let an incompetent official team screw another team over once again and let it go about quietly. The community deserved to know what happened and it seems most of it agrees that this decision is ridiculous.

I saw the title as very vague misleading is not the correct term there. &nbsp;I just didn't agree with individual name calling with the glitches. &nbsp;You could have reported individual players through another medium. &nbsp;Flimbi need not have been mentioned in this, as that is something that should have been reported and not told to everyone here. I see rant posts all of the time and that is olay. &nbsp;You could have said "This player was exploiting glitches and they did nothing" without explicitly calling out a name. &nbsp;I agree you are doing a good thing calling out incompetent officials. &nbsp;It was just that part that should have been edited our in my view. &nbsp;I disagree with just that portion nothing else. &nbsp;Just that could unintentionally incite harassment against FLIMBI. &nbsp;You could do both that private report and the given the community a warning. &nbsp;One giving out specific names and one giving a warning to the community against the corrupt and incompetent officials in general and general unnamed cases of abuses.
</blockquote>
</div>
It's not like it's some big secret that Flimbi did it. I don't understand what you're trying to say by that, you're trying to start something for no reason at all. Have you even played a tournament? He said who did it to explain the story, and so far i've seen more people congratulate Flimbi for doing this than bash it.

LFT Can, which is the head of official team. the final conclusion after a long disucssion was that what he did if we described it correctly according to our defenders, was illegal, and if there was evidence we wouldn've been granted the win and FLIMBI would be dqed. however since there was no evidence, a rematch needed to be done. LFT said that they came to the conclusion to rematch after i complained, but it was way too late into the match between u guys and pureblox. so again, a team suffers because problems with referee/official team.

You're all right my apologies. &nbsp;I know now to not involve myself in discussions I have no understanding or context of. &nbsp;My apologies. &nbsp;Will refrain from doing so again without some context first. &nbsp;Hopefully I did not create any enmity between myself and others.
