Anyway, if you killed yourself, what would other people feel, they will need to clean up the problems, they will need to get through themselves, think man, think.

Suicide; people just generally want the pain to stop. There is a way out but attempting to harm yourself and lead your way out of the world by killing yourself is not the proper way out of the problem. You go with what can make you happy, you can try to block out the world, you can get treatment. Anything to save yourself and you're not only hurting yourself, you're hurting others. There is help out there and there is no sense in killing yourself as it's a permanent solution to a potentially temporary problem. It is unfortunate how life can be sometimes, how the world can seem like a cruel place. But you have to hold on and do your best to get by.<br><br>I'm sure nobody wants you maimed or you yourself; it's a mask that shades yourself out from people who bully or treat you wrong. You need to take off that mask and try to grow stronger. I am not one with wise words as I have gone through these problems myself, but please don't leave by hurting yourself. Whatever intention this thread is generally or for you directly, you have a role in something. You're appreciated and loved. While your family may not be a family, you can stay in our home. Avicus is the largest roof and from this perspective, we can do our best to shield you away from the dangers. Video games may not be a logical way to escape safely, but whatever truly makes you smile, go with it. We are a family, and I learned that myself. You just need to avoid the hazards.<br><br>Family, if it's that big of an issue that persists like that, I recommend if you attend school talk to a guidance counselor or a staff member there and I'm sure they'll do their best to support you. Keep your chin up, your shoulders high, and stay strong. You'll find a hand to pull you up.

I have about the same problem, the only think keeping me from possibly doing it is Avicus. All my <b>REAL</b> friends are here and, I'd rather stay with my <b>REAL</b> friends than go to my shitty home live.&nbsp;<br><br>Zombiesblood12:<br>He was my <b>BEST </b>friend. We played MC and related to each other in one way or another. I went to his house a couple of times. His 5 and 8 year old brothers were swearing all the time. The only games his <u><i>Dad</i></u><i></i> would let him play were MC and GTA. Seems great right? His&nbsp;<i><u>Dad</u></i> smoked, cussed, slapped, and was always pissed as Zombiesblood for something. Zombiesblood's real dad is still in prison, and his mom is a truck driver and, can't spend a huge amount of time with him. But near the end of the school year he was taken from his <u><i>Dad</i></u><i></i> by DHS. HE stopped answering texts, skype, and facebook. I still haven't heard from him sense.&nbsp;<br>He could have done it, but he didn't.

Sorry to hear about your friend and your own struggles.<br><br>while I myself haven't had bad depression I have had many friends that do/did. In my experience, the best way to deal with it is talk to someone, preferably a specialist like a doctor, or even a friend or family member can be a great help. It's important to surround yourself with positive people too I have found as thinking positive thoughts can do wonders.<br><br>Remember: Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.

Suicide is <b><i>never</i></b> the answer.<br>1. Sorry for your loss. D:<br>2. Call the authority, I'm sure your dad can be arrested for emotional abuse.<br>3. Your siblings aren't successful at ALL if they make fun of you. A successful person would respect someone for who they are.<br>4. You fail at everything? Get better! You're not a failure at being nice and a good friend. :)<br>5. Looks don't matter, but if you want to look better,work out, eat well, etc. If you have acne, water actually helps clear the face.<br>6. All ways of death hurt, whether it hurts during, or the feeling of regret when you're done.<br><br>Please think about if you really want to do this. There is always a light at the end of a tunnel. :)

<u>Ignoring isn't always possible.&nbsp;</u>That has to be kept in mind as when someone is for instance getting bullied, they don't care if you're blocking them out.

This is a Minecraft server forums! Why do you post this on a MINECRAFT forum? Maybe it's hard to know that a friend killed him self, I don't have experience with that, but that's not the right place for this. Please remove this. PS it's a MINECRAFT forum.

C'mon resepignev hes asking for serious advice, show some heart!<br><br>Anyways I have also gone through depression when my dad had died. &nbsp;The best way to go through these situations is not alone. &nbsp;I'm glad your opening up about it because there is people who understand you. &nbsp;You should open up with someone about how you feel and it doesn't have to be a type of doctor. &nbsp;Believe it or not but even a teacher could be good to talk to and your friends of course.

Im not saying this is you, but I've seen people online claim to suicide, but they never do it. If you aren't serious, I'd suggest you just archive this, but if you are serious, there are 24/7 phone numbers that can help you in the problem to prevent suicide. Just google some if you want, and try calling them, as we are only kids on the forums *teen* and hardly any adults I don't think, so you can't really take what we say.

Already been posted. I kinda don't really think it'll help change his mind or remove his depression... doesn't look like OP has that kind of mindset at least at the moment. He probably knows.

Oh boy. I'm not sure if I'm qualified to reply to this, but I'll go ahead...<br><br>I've had a pretty easy life so far... The only family member I've lost is my grandma but I knew it would happen months ahead of time, I have at least a couple good friends, not the best looking, but not the worst either. It's all the luck of the draw, man... but that doesn't mean you have to sit and go along with it! If you think you're ugly, you probably aren't. There are so many things you can do to change how you think of yourself for the better. Having a mean family must suck; as someone else said, a school counselor is a great option. Just ask them to not mention it to anyone and they won't. Believe me. I moved because my mom got a new job and I had lots of problems making new friends. The counselor helped me tons with that.&nbsp;<br><br>If nothing seems to be working, there are always other options. If you feel like you are doing things you don't want to be doing, stop. There is nothing in the world keeping from pursuing the things you and you only want to do. Whatever that may be, there are so many things you can do to begin. Maybe it's just me, but your story reminds me a bit of Matilda (the book), and that had quite the happy ending, didn't it? If you feel like you've reached a dead end, you don't have to stop. Make a U-turn in your life. Get back on track. Your track. <br><br>What do I suggest you do now? Well for one eat bananas&nbsp;<span>^_^ No, I'm serious. They can help depression. Whenever you can, taking a walk in nature totally cheers me up. I don't suggest you set a time limit or goal though; I just walk as long and as far as I feel like, and feel much better. Also bubble baths are amazing... being girly is ok sometimes lol. Unless you're a girl, in which case it's a bit hard not to, I guess.<br>Laugh at something every day. Laughing is the cure to everything. It's a scientific fact.<br>Trust me, I'm a scientist.<br><img alt="" src="http://www.quickmeme.com/img/8c/8ce42182fbd5ac09a617ac2a62942a56fdf47ccc978eb78b7eda81187b9b8cf0.jpg"><br>Anyways, the cold hard truth is that no one can stop you from ending your life. All I can do is say that all problems have solutions. Things will get better one way or another. It may be a long, hard journey, but it will get better eventually, and that is a promise. I might not even know you, but I'm with you all the way. Good luck, and may you have a happy future however it may be.<br><br>&nbsp;</span>

I'm very shocked by reading this, but I feel the exact same way. I have two older brothers who are better than me at everything, and they always pick on me, being the youngest. I feel sometimes like my parents favor them more than me, and it's heartbreaking. I recommend just trying to get out as much as possible, and spending times with your truest of friends. This has been working great for me, besides the fact that I feel like I am breaking away from my family. Friends are truly the best people in the world, and they have helped me out so much. Theres a place in the world for everyone, even outlaws like you and me &lt;3 And I just want you to know, you are a great friend, and I am sure everyone on the server appreciates what you bring in to help the community, no matter what you look like.
