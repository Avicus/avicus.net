Hmmm in the past few days I've been playing on Avicus at this time and there were always hackers and very rarely a staff member online... This is kind of a bigger problem, we probably need more australian staff members, or whoever plays at this time.

The hacker issue has been an ongoing problem for a couple days now, and we're trying our best sort the issue out. We do apologize if there are times in which no staff are online when the hackers are running amuck, but I can assure you that we are trying our best to deal with the players.<br><br>I would highly recommend reporting the players on the website if you can. This helps us immensely, especially in times like this where there are no staff ingame. In the meantime, we'll be trying our best to come online as much as possible to take care of the issue as best as we can.

Yah those hackers can get annoying at times. Just report them on the forums or if a mod is on then do the /report command :D

Since the hacker has been dealt with, I'll be locking this thread from further replies.<br><br>If there is another hacker online with no staff, please gather as much evidence as you can, and use the "Report A Player" section on the forums. Thanks for letting us know. :)<br><br><b>Locking...</b>
