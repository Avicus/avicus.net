<b>*NOTE*</b> This is not a thread to have a go at the staff I was just throwing out some ideas of ways to improve.<br><br>Staff are always leaving and coming back. I don't really think this is fair as they make leaving/retiring posts then they come back within a couple of weeks.<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/YWhOung.jpg" title="Image: http://i.imgur.com/YWhOung.jpg"><br><br>Not picking on Para here but he has retired and is now back as a staff member. Since the staff members are always up people for not making false leaving posts, I feel that this is not fair either. Again, not trying to have a go at anyone, I just feel that maybe an explanation could be provided.<br><br>Thanks

&nbsp;He retired as a MapDev, and yes he made the choice of coming back because he's helping us out. We've gone through 3 admins and we've lost 3 senior mods in one week. He's lending us a hand, that's how I see it honestly.

I know for a fact there are tonnes of people in the avicus community that would love to be mod, myself included so why did u have to bring back para not that I have anything against para. I am actually a fan of para and I think he is great but if u leave u can't come back.&nbsp;<br><br>Much like whittleby I do not wish to cause flame wars or affend anybody

Para is one of the best staff members on avicus, because he doesn't think like people who can't change.

But he never temp retired. His post said he retired.<br><br>If you retire you retire. It's your decision and it's final. You shouldn't be able to feel free and ask to come back to the staff team without going through any application process or interview.

I imagine, however with few personal experience, that normally when you retire you never know when you'll come back, if you ever do. You either feel burnt out, a serious family issue, some friend of you died, school work is starting to pile up, and the list goes on and on and on.<br><br>In my opinion, the "temp-retirement" definition is the same as "retirement" except its end, that isn't infinite Hence, any retirement can easily turn into a temporary one by just ending it before. Para temp-retired, and that's a fact, he left and he came back; you really can't call that infinite but temporary.<br><br>Obviously, those rage moments that make you say "who cares" and step down, even if the next day you were already regretting your decision, used to happen way to often leading to the headache of various senior staff members who had to handle the promotions/demotions log, give the rank ingame, teamspeak, maybe some kind of training or trial, etc. That's why it got limited to one, though I guess it's more of an indication for people not to temp-retire a lot rather than a severe "you are not getting mod again". We all know life can make us go through rough patches several (and some times, not so spaced) times. If someone lost a family member and decides to step down, because he can't keep up, then some months later decides he can step up again, then loses another friend or whatever and he really can't carry on with it, I really doubt we would be such a dick as for to say "nope, we are not giving the rank back to you" when he feels ready again. But it's really useful for people not to "rage-quit" for a couple days, at least by the looks of it.<br><br>If the player has already shown he is capable of being a mod, and has the required talent for it; but it's just that he decided he had to step down, we are not going to make him go through applications and hand-picking and all that, obviously.<br><br>To me it's very understandable, though I can see where you are coming from.

The only reason I returned (and yes, I knew the risks of this) is because I just saw tons of seniors and admins drop like flies, and it's continued. The prime reason I joined back was simply because I wanted to fix things again so they're smooth, it obviously hasn't worked out.<br><br>I didn't want to return, and the last thing I wanted was to look like I wanted attention, but I only did it to "fix" things. This is the reason also why I'm not a ref/official/mapdev anymore. I dropped the other ranks.<br><br>Even if it's hypocritical, I don't like how people do it either, but I had reason behind it other than leaving then coming back. If you want to talk to me in TS about it, I'll gladly (and encouragingly) do it. I have a lot on my mind.
