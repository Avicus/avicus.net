Just like Every other social shit on Youtube, it's fake.<br><br>Or&nbsp;<br><br>They obviously dont care about the homeless, they are the ones making money of the video.

Can't take it srsly when there are ads on the video. I'll guess it's fake, as Robin said<br><br><br>btw the music they used just made you cry, I'm sure with muting the video you wouldn't have cried.

It's disappointing to see what our society has become to, a police officer slapping a homeless man and a man pouring food over him. It's also funny because both are able bodied people who can find a job lol, yet they refuse to help the man and only help the boy. :/

I really found that video helpful to make people understand how poors feel. I wish there wouldn't be any sad, homeless or hungary people. But I think that we should respect, help and understand them. Anyways, maybe these guys are doing this video to earn money, but they give him money, make people understand how they feel. If the guy who made this video made me cry, or simply understand them, THIS IS A HELPFUL VIDEO TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEY FELL.&nbsp;<br><br>-Yeah, they can apply for a job, but it doesn't mean that We'll not help 'em.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me see your ideas...

One for the homeless, 20 for the youtuber.<br>This is the perfect example on how giving homeless SHOULD be. <a title="Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8mfIumbHuo" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8mfIumbHuo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8mfIumbHuo</a><br>Not like in the video he linked.<br><br>This mainly explains how I think: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_qePqppbdQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_qePqppbdQ</a>
