It doesn't matter if you're bullying someone over the Internet because you can see there's something wrong with them or because they made one comment you didn't like, either way there's a person behind that screen, just like you.&nbsp;And if they do anything to hurt themselves or worse, if you made a comment then you are partly responsible for what happens and if it's serious enough could face legal action. So please don't be an idiot. This isn't aimed at anyone, I'm not saying any one of you would do this... This is just a reminder that the Internet isn't all a happy place where you can have fun, have a laugh and make friends... some people could be very sensitive over something which is said to them. So think before you start bullying someone, cause before you know it it could be too late to say sorry. Thanks.<br>R.I.P Adam Smith :(

Seriously, What the hell. Internet is suppose to be a fun place where you can hang out with friends and be happy in general, People like these, who bullied him, were fucktards. They must have really high fucking blood pressure, and a (oopsy). People just think they fucking sit in their chair with their fat asses clogging their chairs, and breaking it atom by atom, and all they do is post fucking comments of him having a dis ability, they can go along with it. And nobody will find them... because they're a fucking asshole! Seriously this is why humanity makes me sick these days... RIP Adam, I hope his family will get better :(

Honestly, screw anyone who thinks it's okay to cyber bully. No, bully in general. This bull crap makes me so, so infuriated. To anyone out there who is contemplating their next victim to bully, you better take a look at this. And just know that you will not be forgiven. It's horrible malicious, and and downright destructive. No one, not even yourself gets anything out of making a human being do that to themself. Nothing. So this message goes out to everyone. If you ever get that sudden urge to pick on someone in any way, shape or form, you better shut the urge down. Because if you pull through with it, you never know the results.. Until it happens. Don't put yourself or anyone else in danger. 

To anyone who's ever lost their lives to this cruelty, Rest In Peace.

You are basically hurting your own self, you are BOTH human... Its not like the other person has nerves of a fucking computer?! Again anyone who thinks bullying of any kinds is ok.. I'm just going to kill myself... you realize you're actually hurting humanity.. Now think about it. Adam who died. He could have invented a Teleportation machine or something... If he didnt die... or suicide.. But nope that chance is gone because of these people.... This is just pathetic...

IIRC, they were pretty upset that he plagiarised a fan fiction or something, so while the bullying was uncalled for they DID have the right to be upset. And when people get upset they get mean, it's like that for many people. So maybe they weren't really "thinking" when they were doing what they do, at least not at the level we usually think at before we do anything.&nbsp;<br>Then again, I could be completely wrong, any edits needed would be appreciated.

Everyone gets upset, you have a point. However I don't know a single person with the&nbsp;<i>right mind</i> that would intentionally harass someone with a disability(s). They can't help it, they were born that way. And the fact that those kids were maliciously insulting him about his speech impairment, as well as his love for a TV show is absolute bullshit. Excuse my language, but it's true. Harassing in general is bad, whether the person has a disability or not. This can happen to&nbsp;<i>anyone.</i> And considering the fact that these kids were right around 18-19 years old (The victim's age when he committed suicide) they are old enough to know better, and to know the consequences of their actions.

You call that a justifiable excuse for bullying. That's like saying "hey I totured someone but hey atleast I didn't kill him." Also how do you know for a fact that you haven't bullied someone to the point of suciding.

No but we can do something. If anyone is being bullied by friends, enemies, internet trolls, etc. Talk to someone you trust. Parents, siblings, teacher, relatives, anyone like that. They need to realise they're never alone and they don't need to be ashamed of what they've written or what they are. If they enjoy something, who are these monsters to say it's wrong?

You're right there, but he didn't really care because he thought the trolls didn't know or care that he told someone in real life since they're behind a screen possibly thousands of miles.<br><br>I think we need a fear factor kind of thing. If someone hurts or kills themselves because of a large group of people hating on him, then every individual who wrote an offensive comment should have their IP tracked and they should have their broadband access taken away or something. That might sound harsh to some, but right now we have no punishment in place or anything like that to prevent something like this happening, even though the evidence is right there in front of us. People can, quite literally in this case, get away with murder on the Internet. We should clamp down on who uses the Internet and who doesn't, cause right now it's like the Purge for anyone who's seen the movie, but all the time :P

People always talk about how bad IRL bullying is but TBH I think online is worse because people think they can say what ever they want to say and get away with it. but in this case, these people are never getting away from this. This is something that will haunt them the rest of their lives. Its a lot easier to say things threw a screen, but in person its harder to say because no one wants to get beat up. online bullying is 100x worse because most of the time people can say almost anything and forget about it and never have to worry about it again.&nbsp;As I said before sometimes, your not getting rid of it. these people who bullied Adam are never getting away from this guilt they have.&nbsp;They basically just murdered someone and got away with it.&nbsp;At least&nbsp;they got away form other&nbsp;people. They are never going to escape the guilt that they have for this. Sometimes bullying&nbsp;is more then just saying mean things to someone or pushing them a little bit.&nbsp;Bullying kills people. A LOT. R.I.P Adam &lt;3 all hope goes out to family, friends, and even the bulliers. for them to relies&nbsp;what they've done wrong and help as many people as possible stay&nbsp;away from bullying and&nbsp;to fight against it with us. Not with it.
