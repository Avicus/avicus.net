The Canadian federal election was yesterday, and the Liberals won. That means Canada is now led by Justin Trudeau, and I honestly think he will do a good job. The Liberals got a 58% majority, and the Conservatives, as in Steven Harper, is the official opposition.&nbsp;<br><br>Good luck to Trudeau, I wish him the very best! :D

No one can say if Trudeau is good or bad, he's only been Prime Minister for a day xD. Btw 99, 54% of Canada disagree &lt;3<br><br>I honestly think he'll alright, but you can never be sure. The only thing Harper was good at was economy, other than that he's an asshole. Tom Mulcair would easily lead us into a economic crisis.<br><br>But I didnt know Trudeau smoked weed ;-;.
