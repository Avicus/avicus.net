I'm going to have to leave the server, and I don't know for how long. <i>It could be a week or it could be a few months</i>. <i></i>My life is a train wreck of problems with suffering grades (pretty much borderline failing classes), sadness and other things. Avicus isn't something I can afford to prioritize. <i>My problems aren't related to Avicus, but in order to get back in track, I'll have to leave.</i> It will become an obstacle for&nbsp;&nbsp;me if I don't leave now, so I'm trying to stop before it gets out of hand. I believe that I can change things but it will be a while before I fully get back, if ever.&nbsp;<br><br><br>As for advice, don't get to the point where you have to start dropping these things. Play Avicus in moderation and put other things in priority. MC is nice but don't let it get in the way of other things, or you'll regret it a lot. A place where people all around the world can have fun together is an amazing place. Don't ever get to the point where you will have to leave it. Do whatever you can to use your time wisely.&nbsp;<br><br>I'll be on the forums to check in. I might be on a little bit for the Nise update but it all comes down to when I sort my problems out.<br><br>I would write more but I don't have time, sorry.

Well... I don't know what to say. I mean you were the one who taught me my first world edit command, you were the second person who I ever talked to on TS, you had the greatest secrets to maps ever, and you are a cool guy to be around. It really sad to see you go. Hopefully all will work out and I will be able to talk/play with you again. If you ever need help feel free to ask. You will be missed friend. &lt;3
