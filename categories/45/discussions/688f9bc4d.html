As a (revert) Muslim who studied Islam (Quran without Hadith btw) I will answer questions about the meanings of the Quran, the moral behind it and science (written in the Quran).<br><br>I see it as my task since Islam in general is getting lots of negative attention.<br><br>notes:<br>I don't know everything since I am a human as well, but I will try to learn about the matter/verse and provide an answer.<br>I interpret and translate the Quran by using the names of Allah/God (the most merciful, the beneficent etc) and reasoning.<br>I got a 34 - 38 hour work week and won't be able to answer directly<br><br>Also I dont want this to make a which religion (or atheism) is the best thread since it isn't part of QA

ISIS claims to be muslim, and most of its members are but they are tricked into it. Islam tell us to not hurt any living thing unless it has a harm to you, or if you think of the ottoman empire, it took over cities but its only reason was to spread islam and they didnt so it by force, infact they let all religions live and pray inside the empire.<br>So ISIS got to the non-muslim point when it started hurting people to convert to islam...

Do you see LGBTQ in Islam being morally and socially acceptable? Or rather, do you think the current prejudices will change in Islam to prevent discrimination against LGBTQ soon?

If you could tell me some more information about LGBTQ in Islam, I'd be happy to know.

<br>30:32) (Do not fall in idol worship,) like those who divide their religion into sects; each party rejoicing with what they have. <br>42:14) Ironically, they broke up into sects only after the knowledge had come to them, due to jealousy and resentment among themselves.

You can't be a Muslim and an Atheist at the same time.<br><br>I read lots of books/articles about the Quran telling us the story of mankind without errors (from big bang to the end of our evolution as homosapiens). After I researched it and tried to debunk it I became a Muslim :)

Its an Islamic saying. Also, it means Allah is greater..

If I recall correctly, it can mean anything along the lines of God is the greatest, God is great, etc..

What does Islam say about Deists (people who believe in a god due to scientific and cosmological evidence but don't believe in a specific religion)? Would they be treated as believers or heretics? I'm a Deist, so I'm curious what Muslims think about us, as I already know what Jews and Christians think of us.<br><br>Why is FGM (Female Genital Mutilation) a practice in the Middle Eastern branches of Islam? Shouldn't it be considered haram as it involves harming the woman?

Why do people relate Allahu Akbar to Muslims and terrorists? At least that's how my friends use it. Isn't it just God is Great in Arabic or something?

They basically see anything to do with praising a god as meaning that you're a radical or religious zealot. It's quite an ignorant viewpoint, to be honest.<br><br>I don't think it has a literal translation in English (just as French and German don't have), but it roughly translates to "God is great" or "God is the greatest".

I can believe in parts of Christianity and Judaism as well as Budhism or even Manichaeism since the Quran tells us that every nation has his prophets telling people to be Monotheist. I can also believe in things as evolution. My view towards traditional religions has slightly changed.<br><br>I don't know the disadvantages next to people judging me by my faith.

You can still learn a lot.<br><br>I'm studying the Quran because I believe it to be the word of god. I study it by myself with some help of people online at Quranist forums. I would love to start a Quran alone masjid somewhen. But till then I will keep studying

What does Islam say about Deists (people who believe in a god due to scientific and cosmological evidence but don't believe in a specific religion)? Would they be treated as believers or heretics? I'm a Deist, so I'm curious what Muslims think about us, as I already know what Jews and Christians think of us.<br><br>Why is FGM (Female Genital Mutilation) a practice in the Middle Eastern branches of Islam?

Do you see LGBTQ in Islam being morally and socially acceptable? Or rather, do you think the current prejudices will change in Islam to prevent discrimination against LGBTQ soon? I know a majority of muslims find it okay/tolerate it in my district, but I'm curious to know your stance on it.<br><br>Or, I could be uneducated about this topic. If you could tell me some more information about LGBTQ in Islam, I'd be happy to know. Hopefully it's not a touchy subject, but it's a gray area to me (I don't know much about it other than the laws in the Middle East).

Ik 1 thing, Islam's rules never change NEVER. Allah sent Quran to tell us how to live our lives. There isnt a reason for it to changed, because Allah knows everything that has and that will happen. Quran is not to be change, which is why it is very special, Allah just will not allow that, this is said in the Quran itself.<br>Ik some people that converted to Islam because of this, there are no records showing change. If humans tell other humans how to live their lives its just not right because there will be an influence. Besides its not them who humans are praying for its god or Allah in Islam.<br>I hope this clears up some stuff for you : &gt;

Hello 1BJ, I only speak English unfortunately so I know I will not be able to fully experience the Quran as it was meant to be read, but do you have any recommendations when it comes to translated Islamic texts that i can learn from? I am a non believer though I absolutely love the Abrahamic religions, yet I have noticed that English translations of the Quran and related documents seem to vary widely in quality and accuracy.

<p>The best translations are Quranist translations.

read the thread nowhere in the Quran does it state to kill pegans homosexuals or non believers.<br><br>IS does it because they read medival story made up by persians.<br><br>I already showed that the Quran doesn't say the people of Lut were homosexuals.

Look man as I said before, I could honestly care less about whatever false interpretations (as a response to my answers) or personal remarks as a response to what I clearly said. This thread brought the topic up of ISLAM and homosexuality specifically NOT CHRISTIANITY, therefore I don't even know why you would even go there with me with the bs. So you can take your BS apologetics somewhere else. And if answering questions truthfully incites ignorant irrational people to behave irrational, then that is not my problem And I DON'T CARE.

Saudi Arabia is Saudi Arabia and so is Egypt. Many Christian countries have absurd laws and many US states have absurd laws that make no sense as well.<br><br>I will admit that those Middle Eastern countries do have a special brand of stupid though, but not because of the religion.

I never lumped you into any category but I guess thats your problem, you can't seem to stop misinterpreting my words and TELLING me what i'm trying to say. Anyhow you still seem to make obvious fallacious statements by equating my Words as some sort of "Christian" agenda when I would Say the same thing about any Major religion, but for the sake of staying on the topic of the thread, I chose to specify Islam. So why don't you do yourself a favor and stick to the topic or if you would like to make a thread asking questions to Christians (or any other religion), then go ahead. Anyways, I do not wish to constantly refute your logical fallacies any longer because I think that you may or may not be possibly trolling me, but I will ask this last question to you my stubborn friend. Why is it that most countries with secular institutions do not follow any of the practices such as Honor Killings, Stoning, Refusing to allow women to drive, Female Genital mutilation (African Islamic States), Homosexual Killing/Incarceration and others? Is it really not due to False beliefs ingrained into people since they were young, or is everything just a mass conspiracy?

Just saying, but you don't call it "Islam's Bible" since Bible is a word for another religion. It's called the Quran.

[2:256] There shall be no compulsion in religion: the right way is now distinct from the wrong way. Anyone who denounces the devil and believes in GOD has grasped the strongest bond; one that never breaks. GOD is Hearer, Omniscient.<br><br>It clearly contradicts the stuff the Quran is telling us.&nbsp;Quran is compiled by the friends of Muhammed 0 - 30 years after his death.<br><br>But then the Hadiths tells us Muhammed killed people in order to convert. Hadiths are like 70 books (Bukhari only) next to Muslim, Abu Dawood etc. Compiled 250 years after Muhammeds death by 7 different people all from a persian zoroastrian background.&nbsp;<br><br>Now tell me, which scource about Muhammeds life is better? The scource you, Daesh/Islamic state and most Islam skeptics are using or the Quran?

As I said, Sometimes the truth hurts. This all ties in to admitting the fact of indoctrination In certain religions and how they can cause otherwise peaceful people to become violent. All this Bs ties in to the major Abrahamic Scriptures as they are all based off of the same literature for the most part. My problem comes where you have somebody who claims they're intelligent enough to read quotes from the Koran Decides to either deny the terrible verses existence or try to apply some sort of incorrect translation. I get this isn't a debate and all that but you have to understand that just because I disagree with ISLAM as a whole, doesn't mean that I hate muslims. Of course I don't because most of my recent disdain for religious law was brought up from me knowing a lot of religious people. These people (muslims/Ex Muslims mostly) Who were kind of conflicted with the religion to begin with, told me the truth about everything from jihad, Housewives never amount to shit, stoning, women in our allied state not being able to drive and much more. From a rational Stand Point, why would you find it so hard to believe that a book written so far back when wouldn't have sections incompatible with all secular societies?

This is a pretty stupid argument, first of all you placed the verses out of context<br><br>[2:194] the sacred month is for the sacred month, and for (all) violations is legal retribution.<b> So whoever has assaulted you, then assault him in the same way that he has assaulted you</b>. And fear God and know that God is with those who fear Him.<br>[2:195] And spend in the way of God and do not throw [yourselves] with your [own] hands into destruction. And do good; indeed, God loves the doers of good.<br><br>So we are only able to kill annyone if they killed as well 2:194 says. Then 2:195 tells us its better to do good then to fight. This is next to the fact that 2:193 also told us not to transgress when they cease except against the Az-Zalimum which is translated incorrect.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.abc.se/~m9783/qd_e.html" title="Link: https://www.abc.se/~m9783/qd_e.html">https://www.abc.se/~m9783/qd_e.html</a><br><br>Secondly Fitnah doesn't mean disbelief, its a small part disbelievers sometimes do. It means&nbsp;persecution

"Once again you fail at your argument".<br>Curious, I failed at an argument again even though this is the first time I've gotten involved in weeks? If you can't even remember who you've been arguing with, then there's no point to your posts.<br><br>"I don't care about Christianity nor do I have respect for the things in the Bible".<br><br>Okay, let's slow down here. You do realise that many of the western laws are based off of the Bible's Ten Commandments, right? Not everything in the Old Testament is senseless hatred.<br><br>I never understood the bigoted hatred some atheists felt for religion. I detest it because of its corrupting and narrow-minded views, but I admire religious believers (I'm a Deist, if you're wondering) for their faith in religion and I ackowledge that religion is capable of wonderful things, e.g. a German priest during World War 2 took the place of a Jew as he was about to be gassed to save his life, all because he believed in his god and his religion. If that's not commendable, then I don't know what is.&nbsp;<br><br>"I am a man of science and reason". Okay, please don't refer to science as if it can answer everything. It can't, &nbsp;and this is coming from someone who used to study scientific blogs and papers for fun. Science can't explain what came before the Big Bang (and therefore they can't prove that God didn't create it), nor can it explain why the honeybees are dying out. I love science, but to claim that it is the only true path is no different from worshipping a religion, making you a hypocrite.<br><br>If I disagree with something in religion, I have a sensible discussion with them. I don't shout about how awful religion is and cite negative quotations from the Bible or Quran. For every negative comment ("as for the thief, both male and female, cut off their hands; it is the reward for their deeds, an exemplary punishment from Allah") there is a positive comment or command ("fight against those who fight against you in the way of Allah, but do not transgress; for God does not love trangressors). If you're going to be arrogant enough to dismiss me as someone who piggy-backs off someone else's arguments, then that shows me that you're clearly not mature enough for an actual discussion.<br><br>P.S. Sorry about any spelling or grammatical mistakes. I typed this while on my phone.

As I said, Sometimes the truth hurts. This all ties in to admitting the fact of indoctrination In certain religions and how they can cause otherwise peaceful people to become violent. All this Bs ties in to the major Abrahamic Scriptures as they are all based off of the same literature for the most part. My problem comes where you have somebody who claims they're intelligent enough to read quotes from the Koran Decides to either deny the terrible verses existence or try to apply some sort of incorrect translation. I get this isn't a debate and all that but you have to understand that just because I disagree with ISLAM as a whole, doesn't mean that I hate muslims. Of course I don't because most of my recent disdain for religious law was brought up from me knowing a lot of religious people. These people (muslims/Ex Muslims mostly) Who were kind of conflicted with the religion to begin with, told me the truth about everything from jihad, Housewives never amount to shit, stoning, women in our allied state not being able to drive and much more. From a rational Stand Point, why would you find it so hard to believe that a book written so far back when wouldn't have sections incompatible with all secular societies?

Care to explain your bullcrap regarding Science leading people to believe the earth is flat? &nbsp;Also the witches part. Because god damn bro you seem to just be making shit up at this point just to appear to make X11400 look foolish. I don't also understand how you're considering science to be some sort of belief system when it is NOT. Just because you may be an Atheist does not mean you are a scientist but i'm waiting dude.

Also elaborate on where you got that bogus statistic regarding a majority of religious people considering 42% of people in America alone believe in creationism. Also elaborate on how many of those people are also Practicing theists.

Deism and Atheism are COMPLETELY different.&nbsp;So, perhaps you care to explain where you got that preposterous idea?<br><br>As to my comment about witches and the Earth being flat, the people of that time, fuelled by religious teachings, conducted tests that their scientists insisted confirmed their theories. These included throwing a witch into water while strapped to a barrel. If she stayed under, she was innocent. If she reached the surface, she was a witch. Now I will not be so ignorant as to assume that Christianity had no part to play in this, but it is certain that science had a part in this, no matter how small and seemingly insignificant.&nbsp;<br><br>As to your second point; I never said that about Americans. In case you haven't noticed, I'm neither American nor am I quoting statistics at this point in time. I'm keeping this as a purely hypothetical debate. I also never said that most of the people mentioned in that statistic are practising Theists. Once again, you've confused me with someone else, and this is starting to become worrying. Kindly stop assuming and refer to the context of what I said, instead of calling me out for what you assumed from my posts.

Once again you have proved that you don't know what the heck you're talking about because those people living in New England were not Scientists they were Puritans. I don't see how you would in your right mind classify them as scientists because its not like Benjamin Franklin would agree with the methods Used at that time. Like bro i'm sorry but that's still not Science plain and simple. There were people who were Scientists who happened to live in the 1600s who even disagreed with these religious atrocities. Try again though. And also, another problem with irrational people is that they are willingly ignorant of cold hard evidence even when they are presented with said evidence. Just because you disagree with facts doesn't mean you change what happened in the past.

Another thing, you cannot possibly be serious about debating me about inaccurate hypothetical assumptions and call yourself correct. You automatically just lost because you Established that you aren't directly quoting some sort of peer reviewed study that would support the claim of "the vast majority of religious people believe in the big bang". Also tell me how you came to the conclusion of Science proving the Earth was flat.

What does me making a rough observation have to do with science bro? You still keep trying to do the same thing and its clearly not working. If thats honestly the only point that I made that you say is unscientific then what was the point of your input to begin with. Your opinion is entirely subjective and not based off of Facts posted in any Scientific literature.

And once again that outrageous claim was not fact at all. It was just an untrue exaggeration based off of subjective interpretations. And you still can't answer my two questions that I asked you.

Dude you do not know what you're talking about. This whole monstrosity is laughable. ANYBODY can be a scientist. Being a Scientist isn't a profession!

Yeah, you're sad. Why don't <b>you</b> stop "jumping the gun" yourself and re read what my Statement said regarding my authority because I specifically stated originally that my authority doesn't validate my stance, only facts. Like bro are you really that damn arrogant and self entitled that you think that every false statement that you make is fact? Just stop arguing bro and admit that you were wrong already. One of us is completely incorrect and there has to be one. I will just admit defeat after you disprove that you are an incoherent human who cannot clearly read what was stated, as well as just answer my final two questions instead of avoiding them and changing the topic, which is what you clearly are doing...

I also stated that I was mastering in Chemistry due to the fact that you claimed that I wasn't a Scientist. Which of course was another fault/loss to you. Also why do you keep trying to inform me of your "knowledge" when you knowledge is irrelevant in a formal discussion which requires more than just Authorization. You need to provide evidence instead of an emotional subjective opinion on "how well" you know Theology/Science. I was also raised a muslim myself, however the relevance to the discussion is negligible considering that is nothing more than a personal anecdote and no evidence to the contrary. Also please explain how me begging you to substantiate your claims is "immature" when Children argue without using evidence to substantiate their claims?

I also stated that I was mastering in Chemistry due to the fact that you claimed that I wasn't a Scientist. Which of course was another fault/loss to you. Also why do you keep trying to inform me of your "knowledge" when you knowledge is irrelevant in a formal discussion which requires more than just Authorization. You need to provide evidence instead of an emotional subjective opinion on "how well" you know Theology/Science. I was also raised a muslim myself, however the relevance to the discussion is negligible considering that is nothing more than a personal anecdote and no evidence to the contrary. Also please explain how me begging you to substantiate your claims is "immature" when Children argue without using evidence to substantiate their claims?

I haven't the time or the patience for this anymore. This argument has just gone completely downhill in its maturity (through both of our actions).

You're trying really hard to convince me of falsehoods. But to add, we never evolved from monkeys. We evolved from a separate lineage. We have a common ancestor with monkeys though down the line. Also, don't you find it quite ignorant to say that only the verses in the Quran that YOU disagree with are some how anti religious fabrications? What explains Mohammed's marrying of a 9 year old girl as well as his war on non believers/Pagans (Zoroastrians others,ect.) &nbsp;The plain reason why you are being fraudulent is because you stating that only things that you disagree with are somehow falsehoods and the other aspects that you happen to agree with are not. The Quran was written by men just as the other "Holy" Books have been and they are subject to man's contradictions/Lies in the exact same way.

Its only misinterpreted by you but not by 1 billion Muslims since they dont use this verse to fight others.<br><br>It clearly said when you meet them in battle.

Stop placing verses out of context, religionofpeace you're using is pretty good at it but that doesnt mean you have to do it yourself as well. If i said I killed someone but it was at self defence. Would you then ignore the self defence part as well?<br><br>[9:4] <b>Except </b>for those with whom you had a
<b>treaty </b>from among <b>those </b>who have set up
<b>partners </b>if they did not reduce anything
from it nor did they plan to attack you;
you shall<b> fulfill their terms until they
expire.</b> God loves the righteous. <br><br>[9:5] So when the restricted months have
passed, then you <b>may </b>kill those who
have set up partners wherever you find
them, take them, surround them, and
stand against them at every point.<b> If they
repent, hold the contact prayer, and
contribute towards betterment, then you
shall leave them alone.</b> God is Forgiving, Compassionate.<br><br>[9:6]&nbsp;If one amongst the Pagans ask thee for asylum, grant it to him, so that he may hear the word of Allah. and then escort him to where he can be secure. That is because they are men without knowledge.<br><br>So this tells us that we may fight people who have set partners during a peace treaty but only after the peace treaty expires. But if they repent we shall/ so have to leave them alone. If a civil (not muslim in this verse) is in need of help we will have to grant him both a secure escort and a secure new place.<br><br><br>Hahahaha this one (25:52) made me laugh. Its fun how your website religionofpeace translated the verse different in their own Quran translation then at the website you looked at. Press the link&nbsp;<a class="pages" href="https://www.thereligionofpeace.com/quran/noble/sura25.html#52" title="Link: https://www.thereligionofpeace.com/quran/noble/sura25.html#52" style="color: rgb(105, 122, 103); text-decoration: none; font-family: Calibri, Candara, Segoe, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Optima, Arial, sans-serif;">Quran (25:52)</a>&nbsp;yourself and see what THEIR correct translation is.<br><br><b style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Calibri, Candara, Segoe, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Optima, Arial, sans-serif; ">52.&nbsp;</b><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Calibri, Candara, Segoe, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Optima, Arial, sans-serif; ">So obey not the disbelievers, but strive against them (by preaching) with the utmost endeavour, with it (the Qur'an).<br></span><br>Also you may include verse 25:51.<br>[25:51]&nbsp;If We wish, We could send to every
town a warner.*<br><br>They don't know about the Quran since they had no warner. Therefor we have to preach about with the Quran.<br><br><br>What does strive means? It can mean struggle, tryhard, rival or fight. And even if it ment fight. We muslims are still not allowed to fight unless its out of self defence.<br><br><a href="http://www.masjidtucson.org/submission/perspectives/striving/wars.html" title="Link: http://www.masjidtucson.org/submission/perspectives/striving/wars.html">http://www.masjidtucson.org/submission/perspectives/striving/wars.html</a><br>You can't deny these verses.

Stop telling me that my argument is so "wrong then" especially since you have not debunked any claims using any empirical evidence.

Unless you haven't noticed yet, I've stopped with this childish argument. Stop tagging me as I'm not bothered about this anymore.<br><br>The reason why I haven't used any empirical evidence is because I'm done arguing this. If I provide more empirical evidence, this argument will just start anew, and that's the last thing I need at the moment.

I can answer that.<br><br>Islam worships the same god, but their god is called Allah and not Yahweh.<br><br>Moreover, Muslims believe that Jesus was a prophet but not the son of God.<br><br>I know that this is a pretty basic answer, but I hope it clears the most obvious differences up for you.<br><br>As for the second question, I'll let him answer that. =P

Why are there tensions between the two religions if they worship the same god?<br><br>Over one prophet? They might as well be different sects within eachother since it's the same god...

It's not so much that the specific religions dislike each other but branches of each detest the other because their beliefs are different. For example, Evangelical Christians are exclusivists, which means that they believe that there is only one correct interpretation of one god, and that their interpretation is correct. In contrast, Liberal Protestants are a lot more understanding towards Islam (religious pluralist).<br><br>I agree, but alas that will never happen.

It's a&nbsp;<b><u>lot</u></b><u></u> more than just one Prophet. Quite a bit of things are different, actually. Matthew and 2 other people from the bible who I forget aren't anywhere in the Quran.
