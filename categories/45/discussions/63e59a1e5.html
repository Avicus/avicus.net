I was browsing through a f*cked up website/forum that made me sick and I just wanted to say something.<br>I know most of you are around 13 or 14 years old maybe younger maybe older, I just wanted to say something that I wish someone had told me when I was your age. Be f*cking careful out there, by out there I mean in the real world. There is a lot of really wired f*ucked up sh*t that happens and people see it as ok. There's are alot of wired stuff out there and like I said f*cked up shit, especially on the Internet. Be careful stay safe.

I suppose you went to the dark web, so you kinda know what to expect... but it seems people feel more safe on the internet than IRL (due to parent sheltering, local issues, and basically every stranger is evil) however on the internet, you aren't in too much trouble unless you give out personal info and don't know what sites you should go to. Web safety was basically taught in every curriculum I know of.

In real life, in some cities, it's really dangerous for women in Australia, but obviously not as much as say other places. The Internet is even worse for both genders. Be careful, or take risks if you know the consequences and what you're doing.<br><br>@Element: Some sites are depressing, doesn't mean they're screwed up. :/
