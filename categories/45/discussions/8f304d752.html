I'm going to be straight here, I'm not a fan of these posts. But, I feel as though this is all I can do to get my thoughts out.&nbsp;<br><br>The Avicus Network is something special. Don't ever think you can find something similar anywhere else.<br><br>The community is a family. We care for each other greatly. Every single one of you is special. You all make a gigantic impact. Don't think different. You're all so great.<br><br>The staff team is just amazing. The chemistry and cooperation is just something else. It's so great. You guys all do a real great job. Every one of you works to the best of your ability and makes sure the Avicus Network is the best it can be. You keep the server clean and safe for everyone to enjoy. You guys are just phenomenal.&nbsp;<br><br>The only reason I'm retiring is because I want to move on. I could stay on this server for years and years because of how great it is. I need to push myself to greater things. This is only a stepping stone. I was beginning to cut out time with friends and family to just sneak a few hours in. I finally had to confront myself and know it was wrong to do so, and I had to change it. I will definitely still hang around the forums and TS. &nbsp;It was a really amazing opportunity to receive staff again. I encourage all of you to apply once applications reopen.&nbsp;<br><br>I've gained a lot of friends here. Glitchy, D00ZiE, NolanDalton, DoctaPop, and really so many others. Those 4 people have changed my life greatly. These guys are just so damn perfect. I have the best of memories with these guys and I'm never going to forget them. I really love you guys.

Jesus feels like yesterday loads of people were promoted to Mod and now lots of them have left..<br><br>Anyway I respect your decision greatly. It takes a lot to look at yourself and be honest with yourself. Real life &gt; any videogame everytime. Best of luck with your life!

I'm glad you made the decision to spend more time with friends and family.&nbsp;<br><br>Video games and having a staff rank isn't everything. It won't change anything in life. Think about the past, and ponder about the decisions you've already made. You can always change the outcome of any decision you've made, only if you make the right choices in life.<br><br>Mooch, I wish you the best of luck in life, and I'll miss you coming to reports. :')

It's a shame seeing you retire so early on (Well, your second time as a staff member).<br><br>You've been a great staff member, in both MC Zone and Avicus. Good luck with life :)
