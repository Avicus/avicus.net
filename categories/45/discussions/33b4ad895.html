I don't know if the key logger hacker has got my passwords, I changed them, but I typed them (forum account). Why? Because the fake thread link didn't load, and I don't remember who said that it maybe means it installed the key logger.

yes it is, if their skype or any account of them is hacked those accounts should be disabled as fast as possible and their passwords should be more sthrengh and shouldnt click in any link they see in the web, as staff members they should pay more attention.<br><br>That's my opinion but if you disagree with me, I respect it.

Also I clicked on gyazo link but it's very unlikely that I've been hacked because 1. I didn't enter any passwords 2. I've never heard of trojans on a mac. I did run a virus scanner for like 47 minutes but no infected files detected... I think I'm safe.
