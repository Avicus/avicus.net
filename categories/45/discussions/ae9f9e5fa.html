So recently I've been full of emotions (in real life reasons) and I need to find some way to calm down and relax, and I've tried all the things my friends have told me but none of it still works. I was hoping you guys may have some ideas on what I can do and it would mean a lot of you'd share them ^_^

Turn off your computer. Stop your addiction to minecraft (not trying to be rude, just saying minecraft tends to make some people mad). Sports also help me. Go to the gym or play football and use your anger in that to let it out. Always works for me.<br><br><br>Good luck

Speaking from experience...&nbsp;<br>Go read a lot of books. Do stuff to help out in your local community. Sleep. Talk to family members. Write short stories. Shop. Volunteer your time. Watch movies. Become more religious. Go on trips. Sports events. &nbsp;Explore areas outside of your comfort zone. Video games are still ok just learn jot to rage as much.

I was referring to how you were continuing to argue with Frosted. Two wrongs do not make a right, and therefore you should be mature enough to put aside any arguments you have had with GungLao in the past instead of making inappropriate comments that have done nothing more than cause offence in such a sensitive topic.<br><br>Now please; stop this.

Nova, I get it, you don't like him, I don't either, but you're being&nbsp;<b>extremely</b>&nbsp;rude, and he just asked for help... And you've been asked multiple times to stop, and you don't. I understand, you dislike him, but he asked for help, why don't you be nice for a change and try to help him, even if you do dislike him. He's still a person.<br><br>OP: Try reading, playing a peaceful game, sports, just running around outside, even if it's not to get stronger, it helps me clear my mind and calm down, don't do anything that's competitive and fast paced

i swear you post so much but oh well to the main point<br><br>just ignore it - easier said than done but it's the best thing to do; possibly do something that entertains you or distracts you from what you are feeling which is sadness. watch a bunch of films, please do not eat a bunch of junk food that is just bad and will make you fat seriously that will make you depressed even more :P.

When I have a crap ton of stressful things happening in my life (always) I sometimes take a walk and listen to some motivational music (or at least something that'll pump me up) If I'm angry I'll take deep breaths (tons) and just walk, If need be, stomp it out on the ground. One more thing, if you're angry or just feeling really stressed/sad, if you can, go to the gym. I do, and for the time I do, I pretty much forget about everything else and put all my energy to lift/run/exercise as much as possible. When you come home, you're tired and you want to relax. It also releases certain chemicals in your brain that raise your mood. If not that or if you want to do more, play a sport. If I really don't feel like being with anyone, I just play hard by myself and focus on playing the sport, nothing else, I would honestly recommend playing with friends though as they help raise your mood and you have some competition that'll boost you to player harder, further taking your stress of your mind. One more thing that I usually do is set goals for myself. I like to imagine myself with my goals completed, and that motivates me to do things rather than sitting idly.Hang out with friends you trust, and really really try to be nice to others. Do something that's very thoughtful and once you do, you feel so good that you did something nice. Don't do it so you get something in return, but just because you can. It honestly makes me feel really happy and great. Maybe if someone is having a bad day, cheer them up and listen to them. Give your parents or friend a surprise, or just help out someone you see who needs help. That's what I'd recommend to do.&nbsp;<br><br>Also, don't forget about your stress unless it's a thought about yourself or about someone else (like a bad thought ex: you hating yourself/hating someone else). If the cause for your pain is something else, a family matter, try finding a way to fix it. Don't let it overwhelm you either. If the cause is a problem, try fixing it as it may come back and bite you again, making your situation much worse. (don't know if I was able to elaborate and properly explain what I exactly meant)<br><br>I hope this helps, feel better and have a great day! :D
