If I were staircasing&nbsp;on a map, and I reach height limit. Not knowing that I have reached height limit, I continue building, so I'm block glitching. Do I jump off because I block glitched? Or am I allowed to jump back?

Related question: Is placing water past the height limit allowed? Liquids aren't affected by regions.

@Dafrozenblaze Technically it is block glitching, but it's not something i personally would punish for nor expect you to jump off. I'd be fine with you just jumping back. That might depend on each mod tho.<br><br>@Wulfacaspice I'll ask and get back to you.

Because you had no intention of abusing a glitch and didn't continue abusing it when you found it, you shouldn't get punished for it.

lol once compendium did like the walls except TDM in RNDZV 3.5. And i almost made it to the top of the wall by using the water trick. Then he took the wall away spawned a couple withers and turned into an ender dragon to knock me of my water like 220 blocks up. I then proceeded to spam kys then was soon banned for suicide encouragement for 2 weeks. But yah know its almost over so no point in repealing. I was able to get a map done in 4 days because of that. And you know...<br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/l1ffb.gif" title="Image: http://i.imgur.com/l1ffb.gif">
