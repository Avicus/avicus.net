Well, I am thinking of starting YouTube, I have everything to start it... But.. I don't really know what to do, I would love to Vlog as it is the summer and I have lots of spare time.. Or should I do the obvious "Gaming" as I am alright at PVP, but it doesn't have to be minecraft or anything related.. I got also do music as I play the drums and people say I could sing :L... Can you guys help me in what to choose or generally tell me if I should do YouTube! <br><br>Thanks for reading!

The most popular videos are videos of people getting hurt. I would start with your musical talents because not many people play the drums

It's not hard to find clips of people getting hurt. 60% of the people in this world are dumbasses. The other 40% are even more dumb.

The 40% are the people who are dumb enough to watch the people getting hurt and then laugh at those hurt people o_o' &nbsp;The rest of us watch cute kittens and our heads explodes o_o'<br><br>So I would suggest begin with perhaps your drumming ability, there are a million videos of gaming you could join that but it will probably get drowned out by the many other people who post gaming stuff also.

you should start off with something that doesnt have much competition, such as your musical skills. Or if you have something else that you do, that you could post tutorials about. Also, if there are some songs that you like, you can create lyrics for them. Once you have a good amount of people who watch your vids and keep track of your channel, you should create a vid where you say you might be starting another topic... Gaming then go into anytype of gaming and soon go into minecraft gaming. Probably when gaming in minecraft, get a certain group of people that you might post vids with.&nbsp;<br><br>As i always say... ITS WORTH A SHOT :D&nbsp;<br>dont stop believing<br>you can start a channel and i will suscribe and watch! :D

If you do gaming, <b><i><u>do something unique!</u></i><i></i></b><i></i><i></i> I can't emphasize this enough. If you do something that everyone else is doing, all the popular channels will be looked at before yours, meaning that your channel won't get as many views.<br><br>So, for example, DON'T do Mario Kart 8, because it seems like everyone and their mother is making videos of that.

Most people start off doing something everyone else does. If you do that, you're not gonna get very far on YouTube. You want to do something original and different. My YouTube channel is unoriginal, but I do plan on doing some more stuff that's not unboxing tech videos or Minecraft gaming videos.

Try to be original, even if it is Minecraft related.<br>I think I was (one of) the first regular to post a Rage (one hit kill gamemode) montage on oc.tc.<br>Posted it on the forums about a year ago, currently got 857 views ^_^
