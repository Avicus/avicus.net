I've been watching a let's play of Pauseunpause play Everybody's gone to the Rapture and it's a beautiful exploration game. I was gonna pick it up but because I know what happens story wise it kinda ruins the game.<br><br>So I was just wondering if anyone has any suggestions of any good exploration based games?<br><br>Chur bros.

Wow is cool but the monthly fee stops most people from playing it. Just curious what Realm do you play on?

Ever played life is strange? Its more narrative driven than exploration driven but I think might be what you're aiming for.

Ikr, I had way too much fun playing it. Which ending did you choose (NOT TO SPOIL ANYTHING BUT YA KNOW) Did they drive away or not. That's not spoilery.

I actually watched a Let's Play of the last episode due to IRL time restrictions. Honestly though, I would have chosen them driving away but I definitely enjoyed the other ending a whole lot better.

No shame in that. I chose them driving away for selfish reasons mostly. No way would I want to lose someone that close to me.
