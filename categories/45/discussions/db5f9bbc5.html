Falling from a hills edge head first.&nbsp;<br>I could have been paralyzed or dead but i got out with a slight nosebleed.<br>I once fell down a couple feet straight to a long nail, luckily it was the blunt side, if not it would have pierced right through me.<br>Having a falling heavy bags hook hook onto my shirt and dragging me to the ground. If it would have been a little to the right it would have ripped my throat out.<br>I have cheated death so many times, i don't have the time to tell all of them.

I was skating down my enormous, steep driveway on my skateboard when my truck (part of the skate board) got too loose.<br>Thankfully, it swerved into the grass and I just kinda slid head-first, unharmed c:

I was climbing a mountain (which was very steep) and I slipped backwards and fell. I would have fallen 1000+ meters, but I managed to grab a ledge and stop myself.<br><br>Another one was where I was walking along the street then this Rottweiler went all aggro and bit my leg, arm and my lip. I managed to escape though.<br><br>The last one would be when I had pneumonia, one lung filled up with liquid (idk what) and the other one was half filled. They couldn't treat it because it was an "unusual strain" and I was supposed to die in 24 hours. Finally, after 16 hours they found a treatment, and I was good.

I was doing parkour with my friends (this is IRL parkour BTW) and I accidentally slipped off a VERY high ledge, but my friend grabbed me just in time before I died.<br><br>I was riding my bike down the hill next to my elementary school, I crashed into it. At least I didn't break any bones. :P

I have been in a couple of car accidents xD I can only blame myself as I drive like a maniac sometimes, nothing serious has happened yet so I feel pretty lucky. <br><br>When I was a kid, around 3 - 4 years old my parents was shopping and a retard grabbed the shopping cart I sat in and just ran, my parents was paying and turned around a second and I was gone. As I have been told, a guy ran after this retard and grabbed me. <br><br>When I was around 12 I thought my head was like a bowling ball, I used to say I could break anything with my head and I tried it out a couple of times. I even got in fights where I used my head instead of my fist a bunch of times. xD I have also fell and landed on my head so many times I can't even count. <br><br>I will be cheesy now and say I'm lucky as I got to know the most perfect girl in the world, we joke about it quite often and about the fact that I would be nobody if it wasn't for her, but it's true. I got my girl, my job, money, a car, everything I could imagine. I'm lucky indeed.

I almost died in a car accident last year. A car was coming straight at the passengers side of my car but a pothole was in it's way and the other vehicle swerved to the right only damaging the front of our car. The officers said I was VERY lucky!

My appendix almost burst, which can be life-threatening. Luckily, we got to the hospital fast enough to get me into surgery in time ^-^ A few months ago, I was riding my pennyboard on the sidewalk of a busy street and hit a hole and flew out into the street. Luckily, there weren't any cars coming and I managed to leave with two scraped knees and a bloody elbow xD

My brother and I were walking one day when a truck suddenly swerved in front of us, if both of us hadn't stopped, we would have likely been hit.<br><br>When I was a a baby, my mom fed me food that was kinda hard to chew, and I ended up choking on it. 10 years later, she's telling me this story and said that my face was blue and that I had been choking for around 10 seconds.<br>THANK GOD SHE SAVED ME &lt;3

I call the need for you to put a can in it plz and let people have fun :).&nbsp;<br><br>1) I was riding my Bike fast down an asphalt track around a soccer field when my laces got wrapped around the pedals and I fell w/o my helmet and somehow managed to not harm myself besides scratching my knee.&nbsp;<br><br>2) I was playing Soccer on the asphalt on the playground when someon made a late tackle with their leg literally completely blocking my left leg and sweeping in front on my ankle on my right. Thank everything i have a good sense of balance, because if not, I would have probably seriously injured myself from the fall (I was running max speed and I was one of the fastest runners in the Grade so you can imagine that would've hurt). I somehow managed to skip over his leg out of instinct (like when your mind goes blank and you just do it and remember nothing when you were in mid-event) and was fine :P.

I passed out on the bus, woke up in a hospital. I've had 2 concussions and no serious brain trauma yet. I met a girl and things are going well in my life. I also got to spend almost 2 years of my life meeting and socializing with great people I've met on Avicus throughout my time. I'm fortunate for the things I have, I have loving parents who I take for granted a lot. I've learned that all issues can be solved and how I can go about solving these things. I know it's not much, but I'm thankful for what I've been given.

When I was younger, about 4, I fell of my bike in the middle of the road. There was a car reversing out of a drive way. If it had continued, because the driver didn't see me, my legs would have been crushed. Luckly my mum was there and managed to get the driver to stop.
