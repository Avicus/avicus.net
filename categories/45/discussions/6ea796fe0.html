<span><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-align: center;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';   font-weight: 700;  ">Greetings, a lot of users make posts saying fix block lag or vote for avicus on all these websites thinking these methods are the way to save the server, in truth the server has reached a point where only something hugely drastic will save it from closing, or becoming deserted in the near future. The changes you see below are changes I made and received approval from: Michael, Peachy, DoctaPop, GilletteRacer, Zeusy and Jozz (I was also in contact with Howsie, the one thing that he didn't like was removed but he fell out of contact with me) along with this the senior staff were given permissions to help me create this document, despite me recieving these former and current admin's approval and me personally presenting this to Kylo, nothing to little has been done. It is this that prompted me to make this document which I hold complete ownership of, to the avicus community. Enjoy, hate but most of all express your opinions.</span><br></p><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-align: center;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial;  font-weight: bold;  ">
</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial;  font-weight: bold;  ">Donations</span><br></p><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);    background-color: transparent;">Every major server runs off of donations. At the end of the day the key to securing donors while following EULA is to make something that is actually worthless worthwhile.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;">-Crates- Items should be given in crates. Donors receive higher percentages of receiving rarer items.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;">-Aesthetics- Everyone likes pretty things. I suggest we overhaul what we think we know about how avicus should look. </span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;">-Base Colors- Most maps give at least some leather armor. Allow players to receive “Base colors” which would modify the colors of any base leather armor they receive. A lot of players just remove the armor when rushing or gear up in iron/diamond when kill farming.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;">-Custom Name Weapons- We should write a warning along with receiving a weapon that warns against inapropriate names. Receiving a “Weapon Rename” allows them to rename their bows and swords to custom names.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-align: center;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700;   background-color: transparent;">Staff &amp; Related</span></p><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);    background-color: transparent;">Staff are the backbone of any truly good server. It’s also the most critiqued area of most servers. By figuring out a good staff system we allow ourselves to maximize our potential and create a better community for our players.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;">-Staff Promotions- Promotions should be earned. There shouldn’t be an expected number of Sr. Mods and Admins. Rather their promotions should be based on their own merit rather than the lack of a better solution.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;">-MapDev Reassessment- It needs to happen. MapDevs need to be entirely relooked. MapDevs have become bad at creating nebula gameplay and the community has suffered due to this. I love certain MapDevs and I hope that quite a few stay but even for those that don't get demoted hopefully this serves as a wake up call.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;">-An admin most likely Jozz should be given permission to run the server as a whole. Jozz needs all permissions if he is expected to run the server. Jozz is forced to run the server with his hand tied behind his back because of his restricted perms. The reason why Admins hold MapDev ranks so often is because so many perms are missing from the Admin rank.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-align: center;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700;   background-color: transparent;">Gameplay</span></p><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);    background-color: transparent;">Good gameplay is what every player searches for. In the best cases of an arena or minigame minecraft server it is seamless and feels as natural as an actual stand alone game.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;">-One hit-kill TDM- Instead of a simple ping battle people should survive a hit from a bow or sword if they are blocking with their own sword (Taking a bit more than half health). This adds another aspect to the fight allowing for a more skilled or strategic player to get the win over a player who has better ping.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;">-Host- The host needs to change. At times avicus becomes unplayable under the current host. Without a new host avicus community won’t grow, in fact it will continue to shrink.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;">-Team style gameplay- Avicus could use a gamemode that emphasizes teamwork. Nexus used to allow players to purchase health pots for their teammates and increased the warmth the average player felt towards the community.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-align: center;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700;   background-color: transparent;">Tournaments</span></p><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);    background-color: transparent;">A major attraction, tournaments are capable of giving avicus a better or worse player count depending on the results.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;"> -Officials should be appointed by the admins. The officials should be present during the games and should also be responsible for providing a clear and simple rulesets and information. Tournament info and rules should have their own place in the Competitive&gt;Tournament tabs.</span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;"><br class="kix-line-break"></span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;"><br class="kix-line-break"></span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;">-Board of teams- The founding member or a member of a team who is permitted by the founding member should represent their team which participated in the previous tournament and didn’t no show in a group that is consulted on tournament ideas, rules and information.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;">-Better prepared maps- This runs along with the MapDev Reassessment. The maps in the Omega tournament were poorly prepared, often changed and had bad gameplay.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-align: center;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700;   background-color: transparent;">Rules</span></p><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);    background-color: transparent;">The foundation of the morales and environment of every server.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;">-Create a solid ruleset which includes specific details on Teamspeak and in game infractions including their punishments.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;text-align: center;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700;   background-color: transparent;">Demotion Reassessment</span></p><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);    background-color: transparent;">Probably the most controversial point of this, but it is a necessary.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;">-Every staff member willing to try again should receive a relook. A lot of mistakes have been made over avicus’ time but we need to step up, admit they took place and try and fix them.</span></p><br><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);    background-color: transparent;">Thank you for taking the time to read this and I hope you will consider all my points. I believe that only all these points used together can save avicus from closing

I disagree with everything you said about the different armor colors or name tags for weapons. No need to make the game more kiddy and gimmicky with, honestly, some foolish ideas for donor perks. The 'join full matches' and badge are already good perks. And if you want to add more perks, the things you mentioned are NOT the way to do it.&nbsp;<br><br>Especially the 'let people choose their own base color' thing. Each person having different color would . . just. . be terrible. Imagine a 2 team match with 10 different armor colors. It would be chaos.<br><br>Definitely agree with what you said about staff and maps, Avicus needs some fresh maps that have good gameplay and aesthetics.<br><br>Aside from the first part, good post, agree with the rest of it.

Yes and no. Yes if we had more tournaments, we can gain a higher player count. No, it takes a while to plan proper official tournaments (maps, event-staff...etc).

Indeed. I agree. It does take a long time, but I want to shorten the time period between these tournaments, so rather than 6 months between these tournaments, 3 months would be better, and 3 months I believe is a long enough time period for the organisation of a tournament.

Avicus has to get gimmicky. OCN already dominates the competitive aspects of avicus/OCN gameplay. The only time avicus is viewed as competitive at all is tournies which I wrote about how to fix. Plenty of people naked rush or get iron/diamond anyways. This is also one of the few donor perks that doesn't violate EULA which is something kylo holds dear.
