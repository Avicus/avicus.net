I've been working on doing parkour xP<br><br>Me and my friends have been wanting to spice up our usual walking routines around town by climbing just about anything. Poles, brick walls, fences whatever it is. We get the occasional bump and bruise here and there, but it really changes the way everything looks.

Errr.... Well.. Academically I'm not half bad. When I was In third grade I took this test and they said that if my parents agreed to it, I could move up to 6th grade (3 years up) we didn't do It though. I'm not a half bad drawer, I can ride my bike no handed basically anywhere. I'm a good singer and actor, and have played the recorder (a clarinet like instrument) I've played orph instruments and am good at playing them same with the recorder. I'm humorous at times, and many people that know me say I have a very strong sense of logic and am very good at arguing a point using that logic. Erm.... For sports I'm good at posting up. I also play soccer and am alright at it. I also started playing baseball this year on a team. I'm good at crafts such as origami, and making items such as foam swords and many other things. Im also just a fast learner.

What I meant by reflexes, it's that I could react to an incident/event in a flash and no would notice me doing it because I moved really quick.<br><br>I remember at school we played diamond cricket and someone just hit the ball with full force and it was just below the ground. Yet I just leaned over and I caught it. Just imagine it in a flash. The teacher was shocked how fast I caught the ball. His face was like :O
