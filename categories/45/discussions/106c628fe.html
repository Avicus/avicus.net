If there is a conspiracy then it doesn't exist anymore, it has been made public, they most likely changed to another place or something if they actually did exist<br><br><img alt="" src="http://ct.fra.bz/ol/fz/sw/i56/5/10/8/frabz-of-course-911-was-a-government-conspiracy-i-saw-it-on-youtube-d964cf.jpg"><br><br>Jk bro

1. Why was he airport made for no reason? Actually the other airport couldn't meet traffic demands and had less runway space so yeah<br>2. That a pretty shit swastika and wtf do swastikas have to do with illuminati again?<br>3. The murals could very well be depicting past events and only the artist knows their true meaning<br>4. AU and AG = gold an silver. And it's on a minecart. If you didn't know that's a minecrat then....go play mc. Also the Australian antigen is not AG AU it's HBsAG look it up.&nbsp;<br>5. There is a New World Airport commission actually. It was what founded the airport,but I guess it didn't last long. Also the Americas used to be known as the New World, which is just as valid an agrument as the ilumanti. Sorry. iloominatey&nbsp;<br>6.&nbsp;<b>Sorry. The video was to stupid and I couldn't even bring myself to watch part 2. Also FYI they legalized marijuana in Colorado so...yeah...<br><br><br></b>if you want to read this it provides some good counter arguments &nbsp;&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://skeptoid.com/mobile/4194">http://skeptoid.com/mobile/4194</a><b><br><br><br></b>
