<span>So I want to open up to you guys a little bit, seeing I can trust you, I have mild&nbsp;aspergers, bad ADHD, and severe&nbsp;tourettes, and severe&nbsp;anxiety. I take medicine but my tics still show, my ADHD still shows but not so much my aspergers, but it's really hard to go in a video call with someone you don't know that much then be kicked out of the call because your face twitches, and then proceed to feel bad about your self, I've lived with these dieases all my life, can you relate? I also don't really give a damn if this get locks I just want you guys to know.<br></span>&nbsp;(With permission from yoavkipper this post will remain unlocked as the players are having a discussion also about their issues in life, not just about WordlessGeek's)
