I've been called autistic a lot on the internet, because unlike some people, I'm actually different than most people on the internet, I act as I do in real life, which makes me a much better person. Most people on the internet are extremely mean, racist and arrogant. Now a lot of people call me autistic because they like to provoke me, but that never works. But after some time I've realized that I have been provoked, in the side of me that feels bad and wants to protect the people that have mental issues. Its because of this that I have brought the attention of this. I really need people to think about this more, and for the staff to really be a lot more serious about this. This is a lot more serious than hacking or anything like that. This is downright cyber bullying, and you all know what that does to a person that isn't very self confident, it makes them want to end their lives, to die, to get consumed by the darkness of death, and that's really just...<br><br>I really think this should be the biggest rule, to not bully someone or call them anything in the group of "mental illness"<br><br>Here are 2 short videos that I would like you guys to see to understand.<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKWuzklXUk0" title="Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKWuzklXUk0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKWuzklXUk0</a>&nbsp;This is someone with autism explaining what autism is.<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mh75_u0uR8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mh75_u0uR8</a>&nbsp;This is explaining what autism is.

Gaming has some of the best and worse people you will meet. I have been called a lot of things and after you get thick skin. I commend you for doing this but this will do little to nothing in gaming. Just ignore them and stay close to people that you like.

You think the people calling other people "autistic" should deserve a more severe punishment then people doing and illegal hack onto another persons computer? This thread isnt going to change anyone's opinion, they are already "rotten", you my friend are one of the good ones that try and stand up and protect the mentally disable, and I commend you for that.&nbsp;<br>But<br>the best thing you can do is&nbsp;<b>ignore them</b>.

One of my closest friends is autistic, and he is one of the nicest, most understanding, calm and mature individuals I've gotten the pleasure to meet.<br>I don't get the point of calling someone "autistic" as an attempt to degrade someone morally. It doesn't really accomplish much other than proving how the only one degraded in the situation is the would-be "attacker".<br>Anyhow. As small as the impact induced by this thread may be, I do firmly believe this should be taken more into consideration. <br>I've witnessed many people do this sort of comments to others and it's majorly sad. I just hope that people who do this take into account that (actual) autistic people also have feelings, like everyone else, and everyone's feelings are as important as yours. None should be treated as less or more, we're all equal and we all deserve the respect we show to others back at us.<br>Seriously though. Autistic people are actually very kind and fun to talk to (given they're comfortable engagin in social interaction to begin with, you never know) so I don't exactly get why people tend to use it as some sort of morally downgrading term.

The problem is that there are not major consequences to being a dick online, so people do it more often. Staff should probably start cracking down on autism jokes, ect more often as to send a message that this kind of insensitivity shouldn't and won't be tolerated.&nbsp;</span>

I don't see a difference autistic people and normal&nbsp;people, so I treat them all the same! ^.^ It is like treating someone unequally because they have different skin colour or they are gay, it's just wrong and I do not like people like this. The internet is a cruel and horrible place, keep the nice people by your side and then don't even lay eyes your eyes on them who are just idiotic and abusive on the internet ^.^ People thinking that hiding behind a computer screen just throwing out&nbsp;<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>random&nbsp;insults to please themselves from their own pain by agonising people is pitiful.

Actually, there really is a difference. Albert Einstein had Asperger's Syndrome, which isn't quite as severe as some of the other syndromes. It all depends on how severe it is.

I <b>used</b>&nbsp;to bully a lot of my school friends which some of them has a mental problems, but after I realised that doing that thing isn't fun at all, well I made their life screw up.

Well, different people react differently to different things. If your friends don't care about you calling them autistic that doesn't mean people that you don't know or people that don't know you will react the same. It's also part of our rules to be respectful to everybody.

MOST people I've met on the internet (large quantity have had a fair share of problems such as autism) barely get offended, if they even do. That's completely different here, which is what I have a problem with, like a new player joins and makes an insult and he's instantly kicked or banned. The internet is toxic, if you can't handle you shouldn't be here, weather your autistic or not.&nbsp;<br><br>I've been online gaming since I was 6 and I've been in some of the most toxic areas of the internet and I haven't felt offended by anything people say to me on the internet because I already prepared myself for it before I came on the internet into online communities.

Trust me, I don't cry useless tears, and I can brush off pretty much any online insult easily. It's just when they're said every single day. I don't know why, but I can get easily offended by insulting comments when they're said repeatedly. Probably just a personality flaw of mine.

Trust me, I don't cry useless tears, and I can brush off pretty much any online insult easily. It's just when they're said every single day. I don't know why, but I can get easily offended by insulting comments when they're said repeatedly. Probably just a personality flaw of mine.

Nope. It's a flaw of avicus. Literally refusing to add /mute or /ignore. I choose not to spam it for obvious reasons but if someone is being completely stupid that's another story.

I dont get offended by anyone calling me this, but some people do, and they kill themselves over it. Its called cyber bullying. They might be too sensitive or something, but these people still kill themselves over it. I didnt get offended by you calling me autistic, but I hope you can understand me when I thought for hours afterwards about how big a problem it actually is, and I did some research about all of it, cyber bullying, and it made me sick to my stomach. The only reason I made this topic is for people like you to stop bullying, and I have nothing against you, its just that I dont think you realize that your actions have consenquences, maybe not on you, but they have a big affect on other people, and a live lost is something bad. People are still in grief from this kind of thing. You never know, maybe your last insult may be the last straw for them, for having the courage (not in a good way) to pick up a gun, point it at their head, and pull the trigger. It makes me wanna throw up.

I only say it to people I know wouldn't give a fuck, are being EXTREMELY stupid or talk extreme shit to me before hand lol. Why would I literally go down and hunt someone who's autistic to try and kill him over the internet? So unless you want to kill yourself over it, it's fucking stupid that you say I'm "bullying" people. Also how is me calling someone else autistic going to trigger someone to kill themselves? I fail to see the logic in that. From what I've seen in the MC community people are only called autistic for the 3 reasons I said up above. So before you come over here with all of your "It makes me want to throw up" bullshit, actually consider the lengths some people stop/start at, because I know you made this thread mainly targeted at me :).&nbsp;<br><br>Also the people who are on the verge of literally killing themselves shouldn't be on the internet or at least in gaming communities because they know to expect toxicity like that. It would be different if they were on some advise website or w/e, but fucking minecraft?

I have a friend who is autistic, he gets bullied at school a lot and it really puts me down sometimes. Its hard being autistic because I can see it wither away his true self. However, he has go the be the best smash player I have ever played against, and you wouldn't want to face his Luigi cause you will lose. :]

Hey there bucko.<br><br>We also live in a world where people are too easily offended, I've brung it up before, I have a good friend who has autism and I used to talk to BlackHawk a lot (who also had autism). They don't give a fuck about "insults" like this, why should they? It's the internet. If you go down into tears if someone makes fun of you (you can ignore people anyways lol), then you shouldn't be on the internet or you know, ignore them? I have a medical condition too being the genetic type of diabetes (for my entire life). I'm not going to jump off of a bridge or cry myself to sleep if someone makes fun of me about it on the internet, in fact I too don't give a fuck if someone does it.

Sadly, more and more people are becoming easily offended in these coming years, Im not sure if it's because of social media or whatnot, but all I know is it's quite the annoying thing in my eyes.

Now, see, I have nothing against you, but you have to realize that you might do these things without even knowing. I really need you to understand, Im not trying to hate on you or start a flame war, I just want you to see where Im coming from.<br><br>Im going to tell you a story. One day, my cousin went to school, and she was feeling really bad. She went to art class, her next lesson, and laid her head down on the table. Then, one of the most messed up teachers came, this tall, fat and disgusting teacher. He was basically the meanest, most cruel person, and he said horrible things. He came, and started screaming at my cousin for laying her HEAD down on the TABLE. And then, the art teacher came, and she is a little bipolar, so she can be mean one minute and be happy the next. She started screaming at my cousin too, and then she felt a tear going down her cheek, and she told me it wasn't because she felt hurt, its because she knew that if someone else that was sensitive was victim to this, they would have gotten suicidal thoughts. Now when I think of the first teacher, the fat guy, I also think of you, and how you dont think before saying something that can make people have these thoughts. All I want is for people like you to stop, because I dont really care what happens to me, I honestly can swat these insults like a fly, but what hurts me is thinking of other people and how they can seriously get hurt, possibly to the point of suicide.<br><br>Again, I dont have anything against you, I just want to see where your coming from, and you to see where Im coming from.<br><br>On the part of that people with suicidal thoughts shouldn't be on the internet, I agree, but there are people that are so addicted they refuse to stop, even when this is happening to them.

That is COMPLETELY different from the internet. Get off of the internet if you're going to cry about shit like this. If they're addicted, how is that anyone's fault other than their own? If they have the willpower to "pull the trigger" they should have the willpower to not be addicted.

I find that as much as the jokes are offensive not a lot of people who are affected by it, find it as offensive as people would think. Like a lot of people have said, you do gain an understanding of how to cope with such remarks after using the internet for a while. I personally do not take cancer jokes heavily, when in-fact I myself have had it.

I agree with the underlying message but there are s few things that I don't agree with. &nbsp;You say that most people on the Internet are extremely mean, racist and arrogant. That's not true... Also not all cyber bully victims want to kill themselves.&nbsp;<br><br>On on the other hand I can agree that many cowards can throw abuse behind the safety of their computer screens and there is no reason to take any of it to heart

MOST people I've met on the internet (large quantity have had a fair share of problems such as autism) barely get offended, if they even do. That's completely different here, which is what I have a problem with, like a new player joins and makes an insult and he's instantly kicked or banned. The internet is toxic, if you can't handle you shouldn't be here, weather your autistic or not.&nbsp;<br><br>I've been online gaming since I was 6 and I've been in some of the most toxic areas of the internet and I haven't felt offended by anything people say to me on the internet because I already prepared myself for it before I came on the internet into online communities.
