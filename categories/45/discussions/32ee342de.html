1. Cocky people. Agreed.<br>2. People who get butthurt over swearing. Seriously, if you want me to stop swearing then go camp out in the cursing forbidden channel.<br>3. People who bash staff when they have NO IDEA what's going on 99% of the time.

1. Posers. Guys who talk the talk but can't walk the walk. People who get overconfident fail to realize that anything can happen no matter how set an outcome seems.<br><br>2. Ignorant People. Seriously guys read the damn forums once in a blue moon. If you don't know what people are talking about, don't try to correct them or try to make yourself look better by trying to be the authority on something you know <b>aboslutely nothing about.<br></b><br>3. Racists/Sexists/Homophobes/Any person with a preconceived notion of "normal".<br>Everyone is special and bashing people because of how they are different in whatever form is idiotic, base, nonsensical, and a blatant attempt to make someone with a low self esteem look better at themselves.<br><br>And most importantly...<br>4. Dem boys who be hatin' on my boy Ralphie!<br>#RalphieRage2014

I hate when people want to fight me at school or something, and they slap me (I want to be hit first). Then I'm all like "Okay, you hit me, lez do dis." Then when I go hit, they all chicken out. -_- Like make up your mind, hit and be hit, or talk and be talked to.<br><br>People chewing with their mouths open, or licking their fingers IN PUBLIC. Like nobody wants to see you do that, do it at home. Why? Because if you licked your fingers, you are going to touch stuff. No one wants your tongue germs on stuff.<br><br>People breaking the rules, then being all devensive when I say something. Earlier today in Nebula, someone was spamming profanity, and I said "swearing is prohibited, do not swear or you'll get punished, and that jerk said "Whatever, HoboMommy, you little sl*t" and a lot of words they shouldn't know.
