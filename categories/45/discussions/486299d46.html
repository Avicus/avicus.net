Ouch<br>Those stone foot massage thingies that are found at the playgrounds. I hung upside down on the bar, accidentally fell, the stones dug into my head. There was no pain though, but when I realised there was blood, I freaked out. Thank god for my dense and thick skull

I remembered another one, around 2-3 years ago i was messing about with my cousin (not the one i mentioned above) and play fighting and it got serious, and he threw at me this (<a href="http://thumbs.ebaystatic.com/images/g/i-8AAOSwEeFVOpJn/s-l225.jpg" title="Link: http://thumbs.ebaystatic.com/images/g/i-8AAOSwEeFVOpJn/s-l225.jpg">http://thumbs.ebaystatic.com/images/g/i-8AAOSwEeFVOpJn/s-l225.jpg</a>) and it hit me in the back of the head, it didn't hurt at all but it made a cut and a LOT of blood starting coming out of my head my whole tshirt was filled with blood like i could've fill 2 bowls with it and i started freaking out and crying but thats about it really<br>(i was winning the fight so he decided to throw the thing at me and cheat xD)

My worst experience is when my dad had a bee on his finger, than ge flicked it off. I didn't know where he buried so I managed to step on it...<br>Another would be getting stung by a bee at lunch for the first time in my life, during 7th grade. It even stung my middle finger! Lol.

I was at school camp and i took a massive shit in my cabins and it blocked the toilet up and you could smell the shit from where we slept at. Since then I've been known as the boy who blocked the toilet<br><br><br>I felt bad for the other school coming though since the toilet wasn't fixed yet

Once my dad slammed a car door on one of my fingernails, and it completely fell off and took a bit to grow back, it didn't even hurt that much though.<br><br>Another time one of my friends was playing fetch with my dog with a 4x4 block of wood (weird I know), and he accidentally threw it when&nbsp;<i></i>I was running in front of him, and it hit my head. Had to get quite a few stitches.

I was playing football, so I turned around, but at the same time I tripped and someone was already in midair tackling me (this is with friends, no pads nothing) so I put my hand out to stop myself and jammed my finger when I slammed it into him.&nbsp;<br><br>Another one is when someone threw nachos at me (with chili, cheese, and more so it stained) so I decided to swing but ended up pushing him into a girl who got up and slapped me.<br><br>That hurt like a bitch<br><br>(this is not me) my friend asked me how much I would pay him if he stripped to his underwear in the middle of class (we were in technology) and I said 50 dollars. Well... He ended up doing it and the other students were um... Surprised<br><br>worst way to lose 50 bucks

Last year, I was playing basketball for school, they were about to make the winning shot with 5 minutes to go. I charged down the court and took him clean out, he ended up landing on my ankle and twisted it. They got a penalty from the side. I had to play for 5 minutes running with a bruised foot. It hurt, took me 2 months to recover from it.<br><br>Second was when I was on year 6 camp in Canberra. We went skiing, during one of out lessons, I was close to the tree line, which was a 1 metre drop from the snow to a pine forrest. Well I lost my balance and slipped down onto the tree line. I wasn't hurt but it was embarrassing, it even made it onto the clip we got at the end of they year, which wrapped up the whole camp, which saw me, in a tree.

My life is one big physical injury.<br><br>I was hit by a car about a week ago, broke some of my ribs and now I'm in hospital with pneumonia, too.<br><br>I've been attacked by dogs, escaping with bites on my lip, leg and arm.<br><br>I've fallen from a story high and survived with a broken leg.<br><br>I've even been half-crushed under construction pipes, leaving me with a broken arm, broken ribs, fractured pelvis and a punctured lung. Lucky I wasn't paralysed or something.<br><br>I have had ALOT of these experiences, so I just put some on here.

I'm a little too opinionated which leads to fights, and I always choose "dare" whilst playing Truth or Dare.<br><br>I ask myself "how do I even" a lot, too.
