Sup everyone!<br>There's something that's been bugging me for the past 3 days, not any life issues or related, I'm just wondering if someone could make me a Twitch overlay (When offline and while streaming).<br>I really need one as I'll be livestreaming the upcoming tourney and I want to provide the community the best quality possible so, I'm gonna ask for that and 2 more things (Optional):<br><br>- Teach me how to stream (With a camera, yeah, I'll be showing my face). (OBS).<br>- Song "Identifier?" (I've seen some little boxes placed in the corners of the streams that show the songs that are currently being played (In the stream), well, I don't know how to do it so I need some lessons on that too).<br><br>Huh, yeah, that's basically everything. There's a lot of stuff going behind the scences and the event coordinators are working really hard on this, I don't want to bother them so, can anyone help me? &lt;3<br>Regards, Juan.
