Pros: Has greatly increased peoples peripheral vision and eye co-ordination, great time filler.<br><br>Cons: Can cause people to become violent / rage, can cause seizures, will start to make people anti social&nbsp;<u>depending</u> on what they play.<br><br>May have missed some but this is all I can think of on the top of my head, if you would like to suggest anything by all means, do so.

Lots of people become addicted to them (mostly due to having high addiction rates) and spend too much time on them. This may decrease your grades/friends. Although it would be better if none of us played video games, they are a great source of easy entertainment and time-filling, as Cupcake said. If you're keeping social and having good grades, with your video games constantly as second-priority, then good job and keep at it!
