Who here owns a product of the Razer company like a keyboard or a mouse or something even more ridiculously overpriced. Recently I have been browsing their website to see what else I can stumble across and found a few interesting things. My question is who has a razer product? Do you guys recommend anything because I know not just me but others may be looking for something a bit better than what they already have. I myself own a Razer Blackwidow keyboard and a Razer Deathadder Chroma mouse. (Didn't realize what keyboard I bought and purchased the basic version not the Chroma version of the keyboard :( ).<br><br><a href="http://imgur.com/VCoth8G" rel="nofollow" title="Link: http://imgur.com/VCoth8G">Razer Black Widow</a><br><a href="http://imgur.com/ZEdcFLK" rel="nofollow">Razer Deathadder Chroma</a>

I have a Razer Naga 2014 mouse, at the time when I purchased the product it was way too overpriced.. definitely not better than what you have but anything new and updated from Razer is good.

I'll beg to differ.<br><br>Razer Mamba TE and Mamba Chroma: Both have a lazer sensor with acceleration and some weird stuff, PASS.<br><br>Razer Naga lineup: Overpriced, nuff said. Also has a lazer sensor.<br><br>BlackWidow lineup: Kaihl switches. The new BlackWidow X line makes it better, but it's still bad.<br><br>Razer Kraken lineup: It's fine, unless you don't want your ears to die.

I'm a fan. I own a blackwidow chroma and a deathadder chroma. Considering I got them for $175 ($134 USD) and $59 ($45 USD) I can say that they were well worth it for the purchased price. They're beautifully designed and I like the matte finish.&nbsp;<br><br><a href="http://www.razerzone.com/au-en/gaming-systems/razer-blade-stealth" title="Link: http://www.razerzone.com/au-en/gaming-systems/razer-blade-stealth">http://www.razerzone.com/au-en/gaming-systems/razer-blade-stealth</a>&nbsp;as soon as this guy drops in Australia and as long as it isn't anything more then the US sale price - I think it'll definitely be my next laptop (AND I WAS AN AVID MAC USER D:)

I have the:<br><br>Razer Deathadder &nbsp;2014 or 2013 to lazy to find out.<br><br>Razer Black Widow Chroma<br><br>I definitely would recommend the Razer deathadder but not the black widow chroma due to its plastic keys it has the cheap feeling and is very high priced for a keyboard.

Deathadder 2013 is good from my experience, so are Razer mousepads.&nbsp;<br><br>Keyboards aren't really good imo.
