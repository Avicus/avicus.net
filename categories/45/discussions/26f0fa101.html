you're probably the only spanish person that can speak english quite good apart from javipepe. you're also a great player very underrated, I honestly used to think you were from UK idk why because you were so good at english lol and then I realised you were spanish so gg. <br><br>OCN but because it's closing Avicus is my no1 source + Avicus is my home server i love this server too much yes i am sad<br><br>It's difficult because Focus would have been a great team if we were all fucking active but then everyone decided to go off to the big world and get chicks so idk man. Grim have really good players rn so I would say Grim

ok tazz - I think you're really chill when you're not the cunt you are and you start saying stuff like "your mum hahhahha" or just basically trying to act like you're funny. However, I also think you're actually a nice guy and sometimes you do make me laugh and you're definitely a brilliant official keep it up babe get those tournaments soon ;)<br><br>Ronloyd definitely one of the best players if not the best of his time, DaGoldBrick was a tank at pvp and used to challenge like 1v5s and win them lol, JKawesome? he was a good rusher for public I guess, <br><br>hmm probably BmB<br><br>when i rob a bank like in Now You See Me

</div>
i don't know you too much I just remember fighting you a lot on the 1 hour fissura game and you targeted me quite a lot but I still won the fights ayy<br><br>Focus on aiming and strafing - forget those people that say "jitterclick get like 10cps for the best" nah I get like&nbsp; 7-8 cps I can combo fine probably why people are surprised at the way I play and I get accused a lot for it. It's also because if I try to jitterclick or click super fast my aim gets messed up and it just hurts my fingers and I don't want to end up with spazzed fingers and bones. Play some games like osu or aim games where it requires you to aim really well and you'll end up good. If you learn to perfect w-tapping it's good as well trust me so effective and make sure you use "ctrl" as your left sprint. I wouldn't have been good at pvp if it wasn't for BmB or kiwi telling me to fix my controls before I used to use "R" as my sprint button i don't know why lol - I just remember bajan canadian saying it was good for pvp but obviously you know he's a true noob and using "R" just allowed me to strafe one way whereas if you use "ctrl" you can strafe both ways so it's definitely better.

THANKS NEMO<br><br>Hawaii probably <br><br>GCSEs were good I hope I just got all straight A's - shit results coming out in like a month<br><br>you are one of the most underrated players I have ever seen. I would say you're like top 5 in camel tbh even though nobody would think but your pvp is great and your comms are great like you know what you're doing and you feel comfortable with the game. You never get mad at anything and you're a fucking nice guy to speak to in ts. You definitely have grown as a public player to the competitive playstyle good job man

thanks alex hope you're getting more brain from that girl at the party ;)<br><br>ahhhh I actually don't fucking know - I keep telling myself I'm going to study astrophysics ngl I like it - it's interesting as shit but it's so hard like the amount of maths and physics that go into it is just aids<br><br>you're a chill guy you're so nice in ts but then sometimes it gets annoying when you ask stupid questions. you're also a good player and you have somewhat good comms but then when you defended that game on GD3 oh my fucking god. I will literally quote what you were like when somebody was at your defence.<br><br>alex - shit<br>zeg/zew - alex what the fuck is going on<br>alex - i was 1v1ing this guy at my defence don't worry I killed him<br>zeg/zew - why did you not call it out before?<br>alex - idk<br><br>when you do stuff like this you actually make us think you've died. Instead of saying shit tell us you're dead or alive or tell us one person is pushing your wool or pushing out. You don't need to make everything so long just get to the point and say what's happening fuck sake alex.

you were a cool australian guy hardly spoke to you but when I did it was nice. pretty sure you stopped playing and stuff but you should come back<br><br>omfg a1 is a piece of shit - their staff server is so corrupt. did you know I was a fucking mod on that LOL on kitpvp and I was probably the best mod. I banned so many hackers and took care of so many people lol I can't believe it. The thing is there's this youtuber called DJTasty now who has like 13.5k subs i don't even know how and he used to be called Girrs I used to play with him back in the day like a year and some months ago. Pretty sure he used sub bots to like 2k subs and then just got popular from there but it's crazy I did a lot of stuff on a1. my friend still plays that shit tho (somali_captain) shit that reminds me lol he had 100k on that server and someone offered him 300 fucking euros for it wtf? but the staff server is so shitty that head admin called kayleigh who is like 16 and has been an admin for like 3 years wtf and the owner is like some 45 year old man with kids older than the staff team LOL

you're a cool admin you listen to the community and I praise you for that unlike those shitty OCN admins who don't listen to anything the community wants, it sucks for you because your ping on this server and other EU/US servers. You're my favourite admin as well I hope you produce more things don't retire please we don't want admins that retire xD

well i'm a skype group chat with my irl friends but idk where he is nowadays like pretty sure he rarely talks and stuff - i think he plays like csgo now or some game called rust but he still goes on minecraft from time to time. He jumps on Avicus as well but that's like every month and he just goes on to see what's going on.<br><br>you were a really chill guy when we first met and I had a shit ton of fun with you in Apollo back before tourney 1 and during - we always used to speak in ts and idk if you've gone inactive now i don't really see you on much in ts or it might just be me but yeah you were honestly a nice guy. Your pvp is good as well and it's nice to see you've stuck by with Apollo for a long time now (a year and a half now?) shows you're dedicated to your team :)

you're like a memey senior mod like you're in ts a lot but I don't really see you much on avicus itself or again it might just be me. I remember you playing those nice arab tunes in ts damn they were fire. I don't really think you contribute that much to the staff team (maybe you do but I just don't see it). You're a good pvper as well and you're a nice person :).

well i'm a skype group chat with my irl friends but idk where he is nowadays like pretty sure he rarely talks and stuff - i think he plays like csgo now or some game called rust but he still goes on minecraft from time to time. He jumps on Avicus as well but that's like every month and he just goes on to see what's going on.<br><br>you were a really chill guy when we first met and I had a shit ton of fun with you in Apollo back before tourney 1 and during - we always used to speak in ts and idk if you've gone inactive now i don't really see you on much in ts or it might just be me but yeah you were honestly a nice guy. Your pvp is good as well and it's nice to see you've stuck by with Apollo for a long time now (a year and a half now?) shows you're dedicated to your team :)
