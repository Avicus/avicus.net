I get around 500 FPS with max settings and an HD resource pack on the same GPU. I wouldn't go for an AMD processor tho, Intel gives you better performance for gaming, unless your on a budget.

No about 300-400fps if not less AMD's CPU's look better on paper and in real life they suck quite a lot so if your aiming for them types of fps ranges you need a intel i5+ or a much better AMD. Me on an old I5 2500k is on 300-1500fps not overclocked yet this old i5 ive beats the AMD FX 4300 by 2.5 on cpu boss '<a href="http://cpuboss.com/cpus/Intel-Core-i5-2500K-vs-AMD-FX-4300" title="Link: http://cpuboss.com/cpus/Intel-Core-i5-2500K-vs-AMD-FX-4300">http://cpuboss.com/cpus/Intel-Core-i5-2500K-vs-AMD-FX-4300</a>' and basically kicks its butt. So overall if you want them fps for decent price using AMD use a AMD FX 6300 six core but even this cant beat any I7's. Also take into consideration it depends on the settings you play the game on.

that is not true, don't just make a cpu down by their brand. An FX4300 is pretty much eual to a i3 or slower i5 which is more then enough for minecraft and so on. CPUboss isn't a very realiable and good source aswell. You can compare indiviudl specs on it but don't compare it all togheter. and why are you trying to put a FX6300 vs an i7 ?<br>the most used i7 rn is the 4790k (skylake still needs to come around and get as mainstream as haswell referesh rn) and it costs almost the triple of that of the FX6300

the eye doesn't work like that. the eye got a constant stream of information, most information is sent where you are focusing right now. what is actually detereming the "fps" you can see is the brain which has to filter out information. We basically don't know and have never reached a high enough fps to not see a difference. Most of the time the monitor is the bottelneck cause most monitors can only show 60fps. For recording and editing a 120 fps recording is really nice. If you 25% slowmotion a 60 fps vid the result is 15 fps. If you slow down a 120fps recording the result is 30 fps which is much smootjer

Well despite CPU boss does bring in bias to certain company's or products i still therefore stand my point that a i5+ should be used and will work well with the 750ti limiting bottle necks as much as possible.

in that budget an i5 may not even fit, or only an older generation one. He is going for the best performance/buck so an FX 4300 is fine. I want to see a CPU bottelnecking such a mid end card like the 750 ti. Even a Q6600 wouldn't bottelneck it
