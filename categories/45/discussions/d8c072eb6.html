So, if you haven't already found out I've been banned permanently. At first I didn't agree with it but now after the evidence was provided I saw that I deserved it.<br><br>Don't really want to say thank yous but I will seeing I'm not having any contact with Avicus until 6 months.<br><br>Thanks Yous:<br><br>Qrysis: <br><br>You guys are like my family, I couldn't ask for anything more then what you've done. You all have done me proud and we grew a lot together and we became closer along the way.<br><br>Elsa:<br><br>You've been a great friend from the start, you always seemed to be the only one who actually gave a fuck about me. Even though we just had a huge argument I couldn't ask for a better friend! <br><br><br>Bustah:<br><br>You're one of the greatest people I've ever met and got to talk to. Recently you've helped me out a lot with my problems and I can't thank you enough for that.<br>&nbsp;<br>Iron: Even though you banned me I still show a lot of respect for you. You're a pretty chill guy even though we hated each other in the past &lt;3<br><br>Rilo:<br><br>First ever Aussie friend! But seriously you were like a brother to me. We may have always fought but we made up and stuck together through all the shit that was thrown at us.<br><br>Jackson:<br><br>You're a pretty chill guy and helped me with my problems as well. You taught me how to become a good leader, and how to get through life.<br><br>Apollo:<br><br>You've been like a "second" family to me I guess because I've made friends with all of you pretty much and I wish I could stay but I can't.<br><br>Staff Team:<br><br>Sorry for my recent behavior. I know I shouldn't have done what I did and it's my fault. Hope you can forgive me when/if I come back.<br><br><br>There are to many to thank so I just thanked the people who are really close to me, but even though you weren't on my list I will still miss all of you. I may be on ts here and there and maybe the forums but not a lot.<br><br><br>Cya, Dawson.
