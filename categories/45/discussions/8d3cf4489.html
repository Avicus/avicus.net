Yesterday my friend danyman2202 got banned for "hacks" even though he is just good. We were in a Skype call when all of a sudden it says he got banned. We had a laugh then got mad how the mods ban non hackers and not actual hackers. And the se. Mods didn't even read the unban because they responded with an unrelated respond.

If you think that's a lot, you should see mine... how long ago did I pass two hundred? I've only been keeping track since late July.<br><br>Seriously, at least one person accuses me of hacking — never really sure which hack — almost every play session. They usually do so when I wipe out multiple packs of enemies at once or force my way through a well-fortified defense and kill all the armored defenders (both of which happen so often it's difficult to pick out one most memorable recollection).<br><br>Noobs will be noobs, I suppose.

I was playing a match of Op skywars on an unnamed server (I don't advertise).<br><br>So I pick the kit with full dia prot 3,speed pot,health pot,and sharp 2 dia sword.<br><br>So I browse through my chests,get regen 2 pots and gapps and all that stuff.<br><br>So I went to spawn to get some loot,and I started getting gang banged on by a team of two (they both had the same stuff as me,if not, better)<br><br>So I started fighting,almost died,and escaped to another island.They followed me there.Long story short,I rekt em' cuz I got lucky and hit 1 guy off the world,the other was just really bad (or I was just try hard mode :P).At around the end of the fight, he stopped to type,and I quote,the words " eZ ban".<br><br>PS:I never got banned :P

I'm amused by how your life is all about minecraft and to do combos, same goes to DaGoldBrick, it really amuses me. Just a tip though, there's a life outside of Minecraft. I know you care about me, you wouldn't be talking about me everywhere otherwise, yes I know you do it, your own friends go behind your back just to tell me. <br><br>Good luck with your forum-ban. &lt;3

You do realize DGB lives in the UK and gets 200 ping right?&nbsp;<br>He doesn't even go all out in Nexus anyways...I'm not fanboying, just stating the truth.&nbsp;<br>I can kill him when he's playing Nexus, and If you're so sure of yourself, 1v1 him on Kohi, That'll clear it up.&nbsp;<br><br>Now let's stop having flame wars over the internet. We're better than this

I enjoy how you count how many times you kill goldbrick. from experience, the number of times you kill a player isn't equivalent to skill whatsoever. oh, and your passive aggressive comments dont do anything but provoke others (e.g. dynamo). i suggest you stop

Guys. Stay on-topic. It doesn't matter if a player killed DGB. It's there opinion on what looks like hacks that the player [posting the reply] did.

All my friend's don't like you.&nbsp;<br><br>I have a life outside of Minecraft. Your the one who gives something about DaGoldBrick. You mocked dagoldbrick, then it's my time to mock you, but &nbsp;i would get forum ban but you mock yourself every time you post. <br><br>Why would I care about some randy that plays avicus and who thinks he is an ocn player? Your complete shit. You say, you can take out good players, but you can't even take out the shit. You say you have god kd, the only thing you do is bowspam tell someone gets knocked of.<br><br>I'm not getting forum banned :)
