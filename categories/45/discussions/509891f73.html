I don't know which was worse.<br>First I had a firework explode in my face, which burned a lot of my hair and some of my skin. Also, at one point I was playing with my friend and we were messing around and he threw this piece of 4x4 wood at me, and since I was looking away, it landed on my head. Not a fun experience, I had to get 10 stitches.

I also had an injury when my sister was playing with her friend in the rain. I thought I should come and I did (I ran) and slipped on the tiles and put a whole in my head

IKR. Elevators freak me out sometimes.<br><br>The cactus one happened when I was in the Northen Territory. I was exploring in Kakadu, then I fell off the edge of the cliff and landed on the cactus. I disturbed some rocks when I fell, hence why they came down also.

Not sure if it was my worst injury but I feel like telling the story anyway.<br>I was playing rugby league with a few mates a few years back.<br><br>I got tackled and as I went down, I landed on someone's knee. <br>The guy was in the process of running so he basically kneed my head at full force as I went down.<br><br>I had a pretty big head on my bump after it..

Deven threw me off a slide in 5th grade and it broke my arm. The thing was turned 180 degrees so the 2 of us forcefully turned it back around. I went home, went to the hospital and it turns out that it was a few millimeters from breaking the growth plate.<br><br>fun<br><br>Also appendicitis. That was fun too

They have to wait until my jaw has fully grown and won't change because they put a metal post in my gum to hold the tooth

A friend on my rugby team had a that happen to him but the other guy's knee hit his temple. He was basically on the ground and not moving for the next 5 minutes and they had to take him off in an ambulance. He got a concussion.&nbsp;<br><br><br>And this was 10 seconds before I got my concussion :/

This is not a big one but I broke my foot while playing basketball. I thought it was a small role but I couldn't even walk. My brothers had to carry me off the court and there was like 10 inches of snow that day so it was really hard to get back home. When I got to the doctors, they told me it was broken. But over the years, I have been responsible with my safety.

I was once on my neighbor's trampoline and we playing a rough version of basketball (since you can basically only jump) and I was going for a dunk and he pushes me and I land and hit my front tooth on my knee.<br><br>It was knocked way out of place but after about a couple of weeks it got back in place. I still a little bump where I hit my tooth on my knee.<br><br>Funny thing is, my tooth was sort of crooked (I was going to get braces about 2 months after) and when I hit it and it went back in place, it was straight.<br><br>It's practically a dead tooth right now since I had to have oral surgery and have all the nerves taken out of it so it wouldn't get infected. But it looks fine, even with braces.
