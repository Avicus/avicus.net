I just wanted to take a little moment to thank all the staff on Avicus. They do such a great deal of work on this server, and I appreciate that. It really makes the server great when the community is great, which is what the staff do. They always are right onto it and helpful, and seem to always know what to do in any situation. They are kind and helpful. I see tones of staff helping and dealing with problems around the server and decided I should thank them for all their hard work. They do it for the server, not for personal benefit. I really enjoy this server, and thats probably because of them. Thought I'd take a moment to thank all of the staff out there, from Jr Mods to Admins. You all do great work and really deserve a thanks. Keep up the good work :) -Mx

True that. The staff are working very hard for the server and I really appreciate people that understand they try their best to make the server a better place, and since we are all human they make mistakes too. Thank you for making this post.

According to the community, some of the staff members are "horrible." &nbsp;But you guys need to remember that each and everyone of these staff try and make Avicus the best server it can be. :)
