So basically, I fucked up big time, and didn't learn from my past mistakes. (What I'm referring too;&nbsp;

I'm pushing to get unbanned on ts, but that will mainly be the only Avicus platform I'll be active in.<br><br>Thank Yous...<br><br><b><b>Qrysis/Proxy;<br><br>These guys are not my team, they're my family.. I don't know what I would've done without them. We all cheer each other up, and we always work through things as a family, not individually and I couldn't ask for a better team.<br><br>Elsa; <br><br>A great person and my best friend :) I don't know what I would do without you, I'd be lost and most likely no where good.<br><br>Jess;<br><br>You've helped me so much in the past month with my irl problems, and you've got my hopes up and helped me so much I could never repay you.<br><br>Jackson;<br><br>You're like the only one I really talk to A LOT. To me you're like that brother I never had. You were there a lot for me as well when shit happened and I never can thank you enough. <br><br>Tiger;<br><br>We've had so many ups and downs but we've pushed that aside and worked together to get our friendship back. I hope we can fix things now and hang out sometimes on ts, cya &lt;3<br><br>TheOriginalMad; <br><br>Your stupid posts brightened my day every single time I red them. Keep up the good work xD but don't get too spammy :P<br><br>My reasons for this, <br><br>Well, I'm never being unbanned from Avicus, I've got some bad things going on irl right now and I need to think about them for awhile. Loss of lots of family members recently, and school which Is my #1 priority atm. I've also been offered a job, and it's my 2nd dream job so I can't pass that offer down.<br><br>I will still be active on skype and play other things but want to cut away for awhile..<br><br>P.s, if I didn't thank you it's because we didn't talk much, but I'm thanking everyone for the best 3 years of my life. I wish every single person here the best of luck in life, and there future &lt;3 even greg :P<br>-Dawson<br><br>P.P.s, if you care or want to know about the irl stuff, just hmu on skype. I'm willing to talk about anything now. Skype; danfromyoutube <br><br><br>P.P.S, I will be giving Qrysis to Cammy, Crazy, Apollo, Random, Mustafa, and Steven_ &lt;3!<br><br></b></b>

This is real sad and disappointing to hear man..<div>I'm sorry about the personal shit going on, my sympathy goes to you and your family, but on the game side of things, I am a little pitiful, I have to admit, because you got banned twice now. Being banned once must have obviously been for plausible reasons, but 2 times banned is just unacceptable man, i wish you didn't evade and tried to figure things out less sophisticatedly.</div><div><br></div><div>Anyway, I dont think I really knew you, but good luck man :) :/</div>

Why is it when YOU make a leaving thread, it stays on the forums forever no matter how many times YOU do it, but when I make a LEAVING THREAD, it's like a staff hits me with a lock from a little kids birthday party and some brollic admin dude decides to forumban me?
