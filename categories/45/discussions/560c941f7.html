Okay so &nbsp;a tiny bit of you know what has been going down, and I decided because it really shut me down and burnt me out i decided to remove my account for good on dec 4th. There's a very good reason to why this is happening but I am not going to be talking about it, when the light is too bright it gets shut off, so that's what I'm doing, shutting off, anyway, I want to say thank you to the great mods and great friends I have made you guys made me so happy and writing this really hurts, my body is numb but I have to do what I have to do,<br><br>Max<br>Toe<br>Sara<br>Jake<br>Ninja<br>Jahaj<br>Dawn<br>&nbsp;izik<br>Aralas<br>plochem<br>Drakeyy<br>Zappir<br>Endar<br>Yoshi<br>snoop<br>Mystical<br>twut<br>Rocky<br>frosted&nbsp;<br>Jamo<br>and other people who did not make it to the list Thank you for being a great person!! &lt;3 you all bye bye!

I hate it when this happens. Someone gets cyber bullied, and they get hurt. It's just plain...wrong.<br><br>But for once I'm seeing someone leave before it gets out of hand. For that, my respect for you has increased greatly.<br><br>Bye Kizzy, I wish you the best of luck back there in the real world. Whenever you feel depressed, please, just do me a favor and TRY to think about all the good things in life. And get help also, that helps a lot.<br><br>I just wanted to say that you are, really, the nicest person I've ever met on the Internet. Just the fact that people tend to be complete douches on the Internet makes me wonder how you are in real life. If you get out of the situation you are in, and grow up, I honestly think you can be an amazing public motivating speech giver (or something).<br><br>Gooebye Kizzy, and you don't look like a horse at all. If anyone sees the real you, you are beautiful.

so you're leaving just for the harrasment? I'm not a huge member of this community but I feel like it's not that important. I don't really know your situation, but you should take things more lightly (not only on a game, it will help you on real life), anyways if you think leaving the game will fix your problems, gl in life, nice seeing you around even if I don't know you ^.^

Gl in life and kindest regards. Remember that you can always find a way through tough times, there is always an option, even if if seems everything is lost, even if life seems like a dead end, there are ways through. Keep your head and spirits high, don't let other people get to you and don't let us, or yourself down. You're positive gestures and attitude, guise or not, will be missed. It's really hard to dislike someone with such a seemingly great attitude. <br><br>And finally, one thing I've learned, the thing that has really helped me is knowing <i><u>the hardest times times make the best, strongest people in this world.</u> When going through troubles, stress, anything, know at least you will be stronger and more prepared for next time.&nbsp;</i>If you ever want to talk, just ask around for my Skype, should be pretty easy to get.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Make us all proud, do well for all of us. You got this, you got your whole life ahead of you, don't waste it.</b><br><i><br><br><br></i><i><br></i>

&nbsp;I got ts harassment, online harassment from a different site, harassment by text on my phone, and in game harassment for all different things plus when that comes and hits you it drags you back to the past where I was 100% bullied for the stupidest reasons and threatened and abused by teachers when you combine all that, you self destruct, so for my own good, I'm minimizing the problem and deactivating my account. I already removed my facebook account in the past from a stalker, my meetme account, now my minecraft account.

I know it's hard, some people is just mean and have a lot of free time, when I took my break of mc 9 months ago, I used to be bullied like that (forums, skype, mumble, I've never gave my fb to anyone that I don't know in person), I got DDosed, focused, overall hated. I decided, same as you to delete minecraft and skype and some other stuff. I took things way to personal with some people and I had a huge consecuence. Over this 9 months I've realized that I should be paying that much attention in some people that are just made for annoying others.<br>Sorry if I struggle to much to get my point accross, since english is not my native language and I'm not the best at expresing myself, but if you really like gaming you shouldn't care about anything, maybe even mute chat.<br>I know from my own experience that you're not quiting, I'll recomend that you take a break, not a 9 month break like me, but maybe 2 weeks or so, then come back, but do not leave a hobby just because some random asshole

I hope you never get harassed again (why would anyone do such a thing to someone like you?)<br>Cya Kizzy :'(<br><br>-FrankenRavi
