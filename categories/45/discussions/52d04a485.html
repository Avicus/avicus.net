We don't have staff applications anymore, we kinda choose you if we feel you deserve it. So just be a good guy and try to get noticed, that's all the advice I can give you.&nbsp;<br><br>Have a great day :)

Staff applications are not open at the moment, the staff are using a hand picked system so just be nice and helpful in game and who knows, you might be picked!<br><br><b>EDIT:&nbsp;</b>Ninja'ed by Javi xD

Yeah exactly i dont think i hand picked system should be in place because that means some mods have a chance to pick favorites which is unfair to people who work for it (this is just my opinon its not to be rude or mean)

Why are you talking about lag on a topic about staff applications...?<br><br>Anyways, just refer to Pel.&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Lyon Text', Georgia, Times, serif;  ">¯\_(ツ)_/¯</span>

It is fair, multiple staff and senior staff members have to approve a person in order for them to join.

Agreed, I'd rather have a server with a bunch of moderators instead of having one with a certain amount of people being hand-picked within a pre-defined period of time.
