A percentage of people are doing on Avicus. I was with a player on avicus who has been getting shit talk behind his back. I don't fucken care how it happened. Stop before you kill some one. I will be happy watching you rot in jail. &nbsp;The player nearly commited suicide. I hope moderators take it into their hands to control this.

Is another one of these posts necessary. Consider the people who are on the forums and compare them to the in-game population. Pretty much all of the people that do this aren't on the forums. Also is the language necessary. You can convey the same message without the language. /report is your best bet and online reporting is your best. I'm also afraid to say that this is the internet and you have to be able to ignore such messages or not take it personally. But this behaviour is still un-tolerable and should be reported.

It wont generate more hate, the only people aware of it will be the staff team. If they are banned they can't return.

Basically people are going to stir up shite with them b/c they reported them, because it was weak or they were (to use lighter language) being a "wimp" or whatever. People will only laugh, "can you believe they reported me?!?? Lmao, they need to chill". That generates hate from the people who see this so-called " sign of weakness" and they will take advantage of that and they will show no mercy. The thing that really gets me is I know some staff trash talk on TS, but I'd only get hated on for reporting them. And I know that there's been s**t talked behind my back, I care less than the average person I'd say, but most people are really affected by this. How would you feel if I was to spread an awful rumour about any of you reading this? You'd probably feel pretty bad, so please consider others first.&nbsp;<br><br>Add-on: and I have no clue how anyone could go on living their life after causing someone to almost kill themselves/legitimately consider it. Imagine the weight on your shoulders knowing you made someone so lost, sad and depressed that they felt the only way to escape was through killing themselves.

Even if you block them, this still doesn't make it go away, it doesn't make it stop, it's just hiding from the issue and not confronting it. Only making it worse. People will find out, and I will get hate, don't pretend like it won't happen, because it will, and a lot of the time this goes around and isn't dealt with anyways.
