I'm fine I guess. I'm in Junior College now and I'm turning 17 in around 3 months.<br><br>hey, just like emily you've been someone I've always known since back when I joined Avicus. You were one of the few people I comfortably joked and messed with. Also amazing at bow, won't forget that ever.

I know it's you :)<br><br>You are a really nice person, and a really good player too. I felt quite sorry for you when members of Apollo weren't treating you the best because of some avoidable things. But at least after all that we were (are) still friends. Of course we haven't spoken in a long time, so I don't know what has really changed.
