I'm very interested in what college you guys want to go to. I would love to go to Colby Sawyer to study Child physiology to become a Social Worker when I get out. Tell me what college you want to go to and why!

Just some firsthand advice — receiving provisional admission to UCLA is much more difficult than doing so at other nearby universities; this school year, only one person from my academy (whom I don't personally know) was accepted to UCLA, whereas last year there were several, a couple of which I was even friends with. In the decision letters, they reported, "For Fall Quarter 2016, we received more than 97,000 applications for a freshman class of just over 6,400. And the quality of our applications gets stronger every year." On the other hand, I'm pretty sure UCSB is a fair bit less selective than UCLA with undergraduate admission.<br><br>For me, USC would probably suit my purposes best. I was actually accepted this year, but not for my preferred major, so I declined the invitation.
