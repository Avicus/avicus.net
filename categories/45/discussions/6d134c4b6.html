Is there any specific time or duration for an Avicus mod to do the task required?<br>If yes, how long?<br>:)

You need to be more specific.<br>There is no time limit for moderating or for issuing a punishment although quicker is better.<br><br>Can you be more specific though? What do you mean exactly?

Should a mod be at least on the server once a day?<br>At least how long should a mod be on the Avicus?

I think staff should be on every day.<br>They should be on for at lest an hour.

I think they should be fairly active. Of course if theres an exam coming up they won't be on as much but I'd say on average 1-2 hours per day wouldn't be bad. And if you have dual-monitors you can do other stuff while moderating so it doesn't take that much of a hit on you if you want to watch a movie or something.

Regarding your question, there is no minimal amout of time that a moderator needs to be on the servers.<br><br>Although being more active is more benefical, moderators don't&nbsp;<i>need</i> to be on at any given time.

Staff are expected to be reasonably active, but it's not as if you have to moderate every single day of the year.

We were talking about this actually in the Interview chat and Jozz says once you are not on like one day a week or something like that its fine.
