"No mods online, so there is no point in using /report"<br>I have heard this alot, and I just want to clean this up abit:<br>So you may think using /report when no mods are on will not help, as there are no staff on to deal with the reports... This is true obviously, but mods have been able to check reports when not online in game for a while now, so if a staff member does check reports and notices there is a recent report, then they will more than likely come online and sort it, if they have checked. Also even if there is a hacker online, and a mod logs in, if you have not yet reported them, then a mod will either take more time to find out for them self's about it, or the person may log off. As mods do login often, check recent reports, and log out if there are none.<br>Thanks for reading and report if someone is breaking the rules, even if no mods are online :)

Just curious, if this is all true, why do frustrated players come into discord pinging mods saying there is a hacker if you already get notifications?

This is true lol. When I was Jr. Mod 1 year ago, I always used /reports when I logged in and no other Mod was there. It was very helpful, once, there were like 3 hackers in one game where no Mods were on and I spied on them.

We don't get a notification, we have to manually type in the command.

We type out a fancy little command, and then a list of recent reports shows up and if a mod sees that there is a recent report with no one on then they will more than likely come on. Also even though /report when mods arent on seems kinda pointless, pinging a moderator on discord is still a good way to have staff online to take reports. (If I said something silly its because I havent slept in well over 24 hours but I think I said what I needed)
