Breaking a monument on Frostbite with five enemy diamond defenders watching me and not noticing that I was on the opposite team.

I love it when users used to block up the monument on Proelium... I once made an iron axe and mined out all of the wood while leather Steves started attacking diamond Steves and I just sat there mining

This happened just yesterday...One of the best rushes ever!<br><br>I was on Senex 1. I was hiding under one iron pile and i killed a total of 5 people down there. I decided to get read to rush the monuments, so i went inside the iron. But then i thought, "they'll attack me!" Then, I crouch and began to mine iron blocks out of the supply to make it look like i was a teammate. Around 9 people walked past me or looked at me and did nothing. Suddenly, someone else started mining the iron, i yelled "NOO" at my PC. Then he suddenly smacked me in the face with his pickaxe. He was so confused he just started walking backwards and i hit him with my sword and he fell out of the world. Then, I had some time so i looked at the monument and saw a ked defending. I ran through the team's spawn and ran along the bridge the defender had made. The guy didn't see me enter and he was making walls, so I shot him out of the world in 1 shot. Then, I broke 1 monument. He came back 2 times and i killed him both times. After that, he just gave up. I bridged over to the second monument and mined it.<br><br>I'll give a cookie to whoever read all that and understood it.

Got some I'll share with you:&nbsp;<br>1: Broke the Left monument on Justice 3 with my fist Splade Style (That is hiding behind the front wall and going into F3 mode while breaking it). Other players from the other team where checking the monuments and I thought they were coming over. They didn't and after over 4 minutes I broke it.<br><br>2: Breaching an OP Senex 1 Defense with about 8 enemy players watching it. I had help from my team as we all tried to get it.&nbsp;<br><br>3: Breaching an OP Fissura Defense. This was just luck. XD

Sitting on top of a Frostbite monument and breaking it without any blocks covering me, trying to make sure the 6 diamond defenders didn't see me.
