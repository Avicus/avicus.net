Everyone needs a little morbid in their lives. Lets get weird y'all.<br><br>I'm interested in what makes you uneasy. Something which I've noticed about me is I always catch myself imagining my teeth breaking and crunching if I bite down suddenly and fast. I imagine the sound and feeling and everything, and I think about this I would say daily. This might come from when I actually did this and took a chunk off one of my incisors. I also have trypophobia. I wanna go into the fetal position just thinking about it.<br><br>So tell me ladies and gents and others, what gets your heart pumping? Lets get some strange things happening, not just spiders and heights :)<br><br>-Puysegur, keepin' it classy since 1996

What worries me is how I and others will be able to live lives in the future when the only thing that the media brings us is violence, shootings, and terrorism. Couple that with pollution and environmental harm increasing by the day, as well as global warming and fossil fuel shortages. I've seen articles that predicted that World War III will happen due to the lack of fossil fuels.

For some reason in certain places I get a terrible feeling, like something bad will happen. Possibly that I may have died before around there, or that something WILL happen. Don't know why but it makes me very uncomfortable.

Something which has always creeped me out isn't death, cause I believe if you die you'll just go into the next life and how good that life is depends on how good you were in this life. What creeps me out is people saying in a few billion years time the Sun will die or the Universe will be swallowed by a black hole or end one way or another. I believe this is inevitable and nothing can be done to stop it, so what happens to all life after that? Will we just... end? Will we have worked something out by then? And how different is that going to be from the life we live now? It creeps me out, I dont want to live on any other planet.

I have a constant feeling of "Unfinished / Uncompleted" work that I need to do. I can't seem to find whats missing or what I need to do. This feeling duplicates my ability to work and when I go to bed, I have trouble going to sleep. Everyday feels the same and I get super depressed when Im tired.&nbsp;<br><br>My life feels as if im searching for something that cannot be found... :(

Not where I thought this thread would go tbh, but I do love the enthusiasm<br><br>Oceans freak me out. Whenever I'm close up to the surface, I can't help myself thinking about how deep it actually is and what creatures could be underneath me at that point. On the other hand, I absolutely love planes and flying, and I love looking down on the ocean 10,000 feet in the air.
