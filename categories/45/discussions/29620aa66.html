Hey guys,<br><br>So I am forced to do art because of my awful education system... Last week in art we were told to draw someone who would pose in the middle of the room so we could draw them.<br><br>My teacher moved ALL the desks to face the center. She wanted us to do poses that were hard to draw. So I decided to do a handstand...&nbsp;<br><br>What a mistake xDDD<br><br>I did the handstand perfectly but the cuffs of my pants were going down revealing my snow white legs.. I told my friend to pull them so they don't show anything more xD<br><br>It made things &nbsp;a LOT worse however when my pants were pulled so much that I was in my boxers. So now I'm in the middle of the class in my boxers and the ENTIRE class is laughing xD&nbsp;<br><br>Of course no one decides to pull them back to normal, and I can't move since my friend is holding my legs to keep me up steady.<br>So I just sat there in the middle of the class in my boxers until I kicked my friend and he let go of my feet.<br><br>RIP girls in my class xD<br><br>You's got something embarrassing? Post it down below :)))

@iznot4fun Pansing is one of the worst crimes a person can commit. ESPECIALLY in front of your crush. Unless of course they like it xD In which case *Success Kid*.

One day I was riding my bike to school with a friend, right? There was a hill right next to the wall, and my friend rides down the hill, but turns away on the sidewalk right before he hit the wall. Being the dumb kid I was, I tried to mimic him by going down, too.<br><br>Except I crashed into the wall. GG, Maddy, you're a failure.

I've been in so many school fights, I'm 3 belts away from my black belt in Kung Fu but I quit a year ago, but on topic I was in first grade and went down the slide and some girl pantsed me but not just my pants, everything went with it including my underwear and the girl I had a crush on was staring right at me.....

My class had a class pet which was a bird and we go to this room to let them roam free. Ofc we don't run around or whatever we have to sit and be quiet so if anything happens everyone will know who did it. I for some reason never wanted to go to the bathroom because I was to interested in watching or something idk -_- I ended up having to pee so badly I pissed myself and all the liquid spilled out of my pants and there was just yellow on the floor everywhere. &lt;\Insert Buzzlightyear Meme here/&gt; The whole class stared at me in disbelief. I do remember the girl right next to me freaking out because the pee had stained her skirt so she had to get changed. I don't remember what happened afterwards because I had probably repressed the memory so much I don't think it even happened. &nbsp;Well I don't think anyone can top that. ;-;

Gather round kids I have a story!, so one day at the end of school year our school takes the class to a water park thingy (little one). So there was this gal that had a crush on me and slowly slid down the slide and u was going next. She stopped herself at a corner and waited for me to come down. When I slid by she grabbed me by the pants and ripped them off :/ then caught me by the feet but my leg kicked back and caught onto her bra ripping it off and breaking it (then some other guy just slid past like wuuuut) and I caught my pants just before they got out of the tunnel (phew) but the gal that ambushed me lost her bra and had to come out with her hands on her chest and go get a towel&nbsp;<br>(haha) but the most awkward thing was that she grabbed my dick when she was sliding down<br>&nbsp;(after she ripped off my pants :/) and mi face fell into her boobs :CCCC
