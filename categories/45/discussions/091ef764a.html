I got banned from the "BLEEP" network, falsely, for hacking (anti kb, aimbot). I have appealed and been denied because the staff don't believe me when I tell them I don't hack (fuk me). What should I do. I'm not good at this stuff :c

If this was Avicus then if no proof is provided, you will be unbanned.<br><br>But on Overcast, they don't need their Moderators to have proof. They just base it off memory. <br>It's a terrible system for appeals...but that's their way of doing things.<br><br>Unfortunately, if you can't comprehensively prove that you didn't hack, your chances are low.

Overcast staff cannot just ban you off of a whim or weak (in-game) evidence. The staff don't have all day to sit there staring at you debating whether or not you are using hacks - if you were banned for specific hacks such as aimbot and anti-kb it must have been very obvious you were using them.<br><br>Also anti-kb is very obvious. I doubt you were not hacking<br><br>But if you truly weren't hacking you have to show them somehow you weren't hacking, which I don't know how would ever be possible. .. but some people have been unbanned by 'showing' moderators sufficient evidence so there has to be some way

They do have time to press a key bind &nbsp;and record for 30 seconds. Anyways, my Internet was derping at the time and my ping was bad af, maybe that's why they thought I was using anti kb? I wasn't using aimbot either, idek where they got that...

It's easy to look like you take no kb... It happens to several people and including me all the time. I can agree that if you have terrible ping and bad internet it makes it quite suspicious.

I'm pretty sure even if you have terrible ping your kb will just be delayed. Overcast mods know this, pretty sure they have been playing long enough to tell the difference between delayed kb because of bad connection and anti-kb.<br><br>Correct me if I'm wrong though

To lazy to edit my latest post but.&nbsp;<br><br>Get banned on overcast isn't that hard to get un-banned from. Just prove yourself. As Jongh said. The moderator that punished you wouldn't just punish for hacking without a reason, if he/she did it would be very strange &gt;_&gt;
