Well, Windows 10 is underway and it's Technical Preview is already released. I am with the Windows Insider Program and I am typing this with the new and beautiful Windows 10. All pictures have been taken by me. It has it's bugs and it's stripped from features currently, but I am going to show you wonderful features.<span><span><b></b><b></b></span><b><br><br>THE TASKBAR<br></b></span><span>Currently, it's not fully customisable, but here is a picture to get you to know&nbsp;what you will be expecting: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://i.gyazo.com/e9de25c5a66717a3c0e5b69b3b6fc53b.png">http://i.gyazo.com/e9de25c5a66717a3c0e5b69b3b6fc53b.png</a></span><br><b><br>THE START BUTTON</b><br>I'm sure most of you&nbsp;loved the Start Button from Windows 7 and below; and finally, it is back. NEW AND IMPROVED: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://gyazo.com/589db61589dd90142c16b2b476eca101.png">http://gyazo.com/589db61589dd90142c16b2b476eca101.png</a><br><b><br>THE WINDOW</b><br>The window borders are VERY SMALL and have changed by a lot: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://gyazo.com/7ed3b0aaa8eae97d72824d8e0817e792.png">http://gyazo.com/7ed3b0aaa8eae97d72824d8e0817e792.png</a><br><b><br>GRID SNAPPING<br></b>One of my favourite features, so say you got 5 windows open and you really want to organise it.

Looks pretty good, especially the Start menu. I'm saving up for a PC in the near future, so this is a great preview :)

Acharige, currently windows 10 has not been released yet, it's about a year away. From what I know, it might be free for Windows 8.1 Users.

I don't really like the placement of the search bar being on the taskbar, I like to pin a bunch of programs on there without having the up and down arrows for pages of them. Also, not really liking the new color for open browsers/windows (The minus, box and X symbol), I prefer the Windows 7/8 type. It's look decent overall though.

I know that you can customise soon, and unfortunately, the old preview of Windows 10 had the search bar, INSIDE the Windows Start Menu.<br><br>Also, as this is a Tech Preview, I can send suggestions and issues and feedback to Microsoft, so if you see something different, I'll send it to em.

I downloaded the technical preview a few weeks ago, and to my surprise, it was actually not that bad of an OS compared to Windows 8. Although I still can't stand Windows :P

I hope the new Direct X will improve a bit in Performance. Also they announced a built in screen recorder ! I hope they don't screw up that one :)
