<b>Hey guys it's penguin today I wanted to say well um wait this is on Wednesday but I will discuss this today anyway so to bad so sad and you really mad um yeah! (this guy makes no sense) Well anyway on Wednesday I am going on vacation. But where to friken licken chicken ricken biken sicken hicken "deep breath" Virginia.&nbsp; You guys are probably (not) sad that I'm going but if your like he won't play if you said that or your brother, sister, mom , dad or even your fat aunt! sorry didn't mean that ,but your wrong. I will play because&nbsp;my aunt has Wi-Fi so I will be able to play so YAY! Are you with me eye eye captain oooooooooooh! who lives in a pineapple under the sea my mom does. Sorry hopefully no offence is taken. So if your like that'll be fun your wrong all I have is girl cousins. I only have a grown up cousin who has a girl friend, a cousin who is in a mental hospital don't ask friken why, and a baby just a little baby cousin so for me life sucks. Except for my sister (aka the annoying girl who likes Justin beaver and 1 direction) Really what kind of name is 1 direction that will get you in the middle of no where! But I would really appreciate it if you left me a comment don't have to but just a suggestion.(I lied do it now!) See you later everyone! Ps: join the penguin army!</b>
