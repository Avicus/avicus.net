Plenty of other people make "kys" jokes but don't get banned, they cuss at people, don't get muted, but I say," Kys xD gf" and get banned. Obvious joke

There shouldn't be jokes about telling others to kill themselves. Some people can't differentiate between joke and real threat. And there should be an punishment, even if it was a joke, so people learn it's not a joke..

People should be able to differentiate between a joke and an actual threat. In this case, it was obviously a joke, and although I don't agree with people saying this, at the end of the day it is only three letters, and I think it is a bit harsh to ban someone just for saying it. Especially when it is in a joking context. Anyways, just my opinion.

You are right, but sadly some can't... Maybe keep the 14 day tempban from people that mean it as threat (and don't make it clear that it was a joke) and maybe warn people for saying it as joke?

+1<br><br>Saying "kys" even in a threatening context should be a temp ban of some description. It isn't really suicide encouragement, like I said earlier, it is only 3 letters. Suicide encouragement is writing a paragraph on how useless a persons life is and pointing out all their flaws, and just all out harassing them, + saying "kys"

<b>*sigh*</b><br>In the past as a moderator on different servers, when people would say "Everyone else does it, why do I only get banned"<br>Well the answer is...<br>Don't get caught.<br>You should know it's against the rules, and if you're going to pull, "well he did it too and didn't get punished" probably means that he didn't get caught.<br>What you learnt from this experience?<br>Either don't get caught or&nbsp;<b>just don't do it</b> (Better choice).

I think in this case he deserved to get perm banned because of the amount of infractions he has but now that I think about it...<br><br>First offence- 2 week temp ban.<br><br>Second offence- either 1 month or perm ban, depending on the situation.<br><br>Third offence- Perm ban.

I see why you would want us to ask the person who got told to see if they took it as a joke or not, but it wouldn't be fair for the ones who got punished already for saying it as a joke.

Some players need to learn a lesson and their lesson is to have a 2 week break off the server (if first offense), so they can at least have time to learn from their mistake. &nbsp;We don't need players going around encouraging suicide to people, jokingly or not since it does effect some people.

Mute commands are stupid.<br><br>Muting cuts off communication between players and staff. Communication should be encouraged, not suppressed. And if there is a player saying things worthy of a mute, they probably don't belong on the server anyways and can be dealt with using tempbans and kicks.

Insults like these are highly frowned upon, especially directly calling people out. The entire purpose behind this rule is to maintain and have full control over the in-game chat, I'm not sure if you've noticed, but on the servers which do allow such insults, their chat usually gets heavily spammed, filled with rudeness and profanity, and is very aggressive to all the nice users. The point of this game is to have fun and enjoy yourself, if you can't control yourself or your actions, then don't be suprised when you get banned.

Well your infrations lead up to a perm ban. You obviously don't realize that, and you should learn not to say that. I don't like to encourage suicide at all. I think it is irrelevant and that nobody has the right to say things such as "kys". It's just a learning experience, i guess? Just be better about it.

You can appeal now I believe, but a response will take long.

You can try to appeal again after the amount of time you were given to wait, I recommend that you wait till then and not now like Sev said.

Imo there's no reason for this not to be a warn, then a two week ban, then a permanent ban. If you've done it once then you should know not to do it again. I personally know people who have thought about this and it's honestly really scary to know that at any point you could get a call or text that they are no longer with you. As much as I get it if it's a joke, it still shouldn't be acceptable. If you didn't know it was against the rules then a warn should get the message across that it's not allowed, and if you still don't get it then a two week ban seems perfectly acceptable. If you still don't get it after that then there's no reason to keep you around. All you're doing at that point is being toxic.<br><br><b>Edit:</b> Just to add and maybe answer some questions I might get. I know it sounds insane to kill yourself because someone told you to on the internet, but if you're legitimately on the edge, then that could be what sends you over it. I have a friend who was talking to me one night talking about how he/she was just so done with everything, and suicide came up and he/she stopped responding because she fell asleep. It was one of the most terrifying things ever, considering &nbsp;this person is one of my best friends. I don't know what I would do without them.<br><br>(Also this should be a mature topic, saying the words "killing themselves" or "suicide" shouldn't be hidden, it's part of the topic. It's like when you talk about sex in Science and everyone feels weird say it, it doesn't make sense but either way. There's no reason to use "kts" instead of just saying killed/killing themselves just to avoid it being talked about it.

So guys, I'm sorry about this kys business. Recently, my "gf" has wanted to kill herself, and I've really started to rethink this.... so when I'm unbanned it's not gonna happen

<p>My opinion is that&nbsp;a ban on 1-2 weeks is the best way. People who say it as a joke need to learn that it's not something you joke about (as Rese said) and lots of people have problems with be nice on internet that&nbsp;need to learn how to be respectfull and nice. If they get tempbanned for have been rude/mean on any way they can just blame themselves.</p><p>There's also&nbsp;better ways to tell people that you got mad on them on the funny way, use that instead. =)</p>

No the main problem here is that people on the internet do not know how to differentiate&nbsp;a joke and a none joke and those people should not be on the internet. It may&nbsp;be something not to joke about to you, but others find it as a&nbsp;joke. Seriously, if someone you&nbsp;do NOT know and have NEVER met before is telling YOU to kill yourself on an online game, you should&nbsp;be proud. You don't know this person and they are telling you to end your&nbsp;life? what kind of joke is that. It's something I laugh about.&nbsp;Let me kill myself over a video game.

Like, I can see how some people get "feelings" about kys, because there are people out there that want to leave this earth. But honestly, I see it as a joke if it's over the internet
