<b>The Title Says It All, However This Story Is Much Longer<br><br>Claustrophobia</b>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

When I
was five years old, we had a big house and a good life. My father was the
reason of it all. He had a great job at a rich business company. The school
that I went to was a good and decent one; I never got bullied, and always had
good grades. This went on for about a year.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;On my sixth birthday, my father wasn’t at home
a lot. He was working all the time. However, when he did come home, he was
usually quiet. My brothers and I including my mother were worried about my
father. He was usually loud talking on the phone, or talking about the people
at work with my mother. 

&nbsp;

The day
came when my mother questioned my father on the sudden silence and emotion.
That broke out into a huge fight. Then the silence and sadness went to my mom.
Days later, I made up the courage to ask my mom what daddy was mad about. She
told me in a lone voice that it was just money and job problems. As months went
by, we couldn’t get any more furniture and couldn’t go to restaurants. We
basically lost our belongings. This caused the fights between my parents to
progress rapidly. 

We finally
chose to move to a very small apartment… 

&nbsp;

This is
where the story gets eccentric. This didn’t really cause an effect to my mother
and brothers, but it did to my father. My father started banging his head on
the walls. 

&nbsp;

My mom
would tell us to go into the bedroom, and then she would clean up the dripping
blood coming from my dad’s head. 

&nbsp;

It got
so bad he started talking and whispering at the corner of the wall. Then he
started blaming it on my family. I sometimes woke up in the morning and saw my
younger brother crying. I went over to him and asked him what was wrong. He
then pulled up his shirt, and honestly what I saw was traumatizing. Dark purple
bruises covering his entire back. The same thing happened to my other brother,
then soon, it happened to me. My father had become worse than crazy, he was
insane.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;He beat us to pulp with his belt. My sweet
mother though, she had it worse. It wasn’t only the belt; it was glass cups
getting destroyed on her head. We tried to take care of our mom the best we
could, but it was so hard. We tried to escape but found all the doors and
windows locked. We were completely trapped in this small and tiny apartment. 

One
night came when my mom started yelling at my insane father. She sought after a
divorce. Right after that statement, my father was set on killing my mother. I
heard the three specific noises. The first noise was the metal clanking coming
from the cupboard. The second noise was the deep footsteps urgently walking.
The last noise was a scream, a high pitched scream, the scream of a full grown
woman. The one who was my flesh and blood. 

&nbsp;

My
brothers quickly ran out of the room, as usual I walked with them only to find
in my living room, my mother’s dead body slit in the throat. My father standing
with a kitchen knife covered in red blood. In a usual horror story, the maniac
smiles, my dad wasn’t smiling. Instead he had a big grimace, breathing heavily
like a famished wolf. 

&nbsp;

He
quickly jumped on my brother and stabbed him in his eye. Dropping to the
ground, my younger brother and I ran into our room. I locked the door, and then
realized my brother wasn’t there. I heard another body fall to the ground. 

&nbsp;

I stood
there trying to hold back my tears. I flinched when I heard the slamming
against the door, the only way I could get away was through the window. Even
though we were three stories up, it was either get tortured by a knife, or
escape with broken limbs. I took anything I could find and tried to break the
window, until it finally cracked. I kicked the window which completely broke
the window. That’s also when the slamming against the door stopped.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;My father said on the other side of the door a
message. “Your mother, your two brothers, they are all dead. This small
dwelling, it controls me, it told me to do it. Those pigs deserved to die; now
it’s just you”. The door splintered leaving a small opening. He finally said
“You won’t be able to escape”. 

&nbsp;

He was
right. The courage I built up to jump, it got destroyed just by the change of
his voice. I came to a conclusion that this wasn’t my father anymore. It was a
fanatic that lived with me ever since I was born, who planned to kill us all.
He was someone you will never be able to escape. That was the last moment I saw
the fanatic. That was the last moment I could feel. That was the last moment of
my life.
