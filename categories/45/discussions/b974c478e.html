What are your thoughts on sweating a rank that allows you to control other peoples decisions in online lego?<br><br>Personally I don't think that people like a sweaty mod and if the admins/current seniors do, it doesn't stop the people actually keeping this server alive from hating you.<br><br>So don't be a sweaty moderator. Take a long, hard think; are you being a little over the top with the punishments? Are you locking forum posts which shouldn't be locked? If yes, you should just calm down a bit and relax, it's just a game after all. If no, either you rate yourself too highly or you are actually pretty chill, congratulations, you are one of the only staff here who do their "job" and put a little, even the very minimum amount, but still a little bit of humour into doing it.<br><br>N.B. 95% chance this will get locked without reason and if so then you are exactly the reason I am making this topic.

You know, I'd rather have Mods that you call,"Tryharding" than to have mods who dont care at all. &nbsp;If they want senior mod, good for them, go for it. &nbsp;I'd rather that than a lack of devoted mods

Most mods will say that they help the server and while shutting down spam or related forum posts and banning the occasional hacker is helping, it's not entire dedication. What he did was not sweaty at all and if all of Avicus' mods could be that way it would be very enjoyable.

I wouldn't say that I am salty from my ban at all seeing as I just laughed it off.

Sure, we all have lives. My life at the moment is as busy as it can get. You don't need to be on actively to be non sweaty or sweaty at all. Just when people do get time to play some Minecraft and more directly the Avicus Network remember these words.<br><br>Everyones lives could use a little more fun in any way!

May I ask what is wrong with tryharding?<br>Yes, I tryhard everything I do, when I want something, I want to do it right.<br><br>Mods that follow the punishment lists are doing good.<br>What you are saying:&nbsp;<i>''</i><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><i>Take a long, hard think; are you being a little over the top with the punishments? Are you locking forum posts which shouldn't be locked? If yes, you should just calm down a bit and relax, it's just a game after all.''&nbsp;</i>Does not make sense... Yes, it may be a game, but what is the goal of a game? Right, to have fun, to be able to play and enjoy it.<br><b></b>Maybe you enjoy breaking rules, but it ruins the fun for others. Think about others too when doing that?<br><br><i></i>Of course, you can overdo stuff. Which may not be the best thing to do. But they show they are trying their best to keep it fair and nice for everyone, instead only for 1 group of players.<br></span>

It looks like you were the sweaty one when you were caught. &nbsp;Why would they be sweaty they weren't doing anything bad like you at that moment of capture and they are in minecraft they don't have pores? &nbsp;Best roast of 2017; 10/10. &nbsp;But really I have no comment on this that was just a roast that I wanted to add.

Okay, being one of the most called out people for this act, here's my opinion.<br><br>It's hard to tell the difference between tryharding and just trying to be helpful and friendly to players. I will admit, I used to be a tryhard during my early days, but later in my staff history it just felt nice to help others out.&nbsp;<br><br>As a former mod, it definitely helps to keep you motivated when you know there's a higher rank you can achieve. It makes you work to your fullest extent and pushes you to do the best you can.<br><br>But this isn't the only perspective of my thoughts on this.<br><br>A senior staff member and I were talking after retirement and they were telling me how I shouldn't focus on whether I was close to senior or not, I should of focused on,"Did I make the server a better place?" "Did I make a change in the community?". Not everything you do has to be about a promotion, others passion comes from their peers, some comes from the community. It's not wrong to work for senior, and I think the community gives those guys to much shit for just trying to work the best they can.

It makes you work to your fullest extent and pushes you to do the best you can.<br><br>But this isn't the only perspective of my thoughts on this.<br><br>A senior staff member and I were talking after retirement and they were telling me how I shouldn't focus on whether I was close to senior or not, I should of focused on,"Did I make the server a better place?" "Did I make a change in the community?". Not everything you do has to be about a promotion, others passion comes from their peers, some comes from the community. It's not wrong to work for senior, and I think the community gives those guys to much shit for just trying to work the best they can.

I see you haven't read my replies or original thread already because I'm this was brought up somewhere.<br><br>From what I have read here you seem to agree that you were one of the "sweaty" bunch, which is perfectly fine. Yes, I agree, not everything is about a promotion which is one of things that I said in the original post. You're talking about "making the server happy", and while yes, it makes the server happy to have active (not a "sweaty" trait) mods that do their job it doesn't need ones that are strict to the point that people dislike them; they are the ones keeping this server alive by playing it after all.<br><br>You can and are welcome to have your own opinion, but this is mine and a lot of people seem to agree with it.

I agree with most of this. I especially hate whenever people are average, toxic community members and then all of a sudden when apps open they become good noodles. I believe if someone simply wants to achieve a higher rank though, good for them, just be careful how you do so.

I'm confused. Why is this a bad thing? If you are want to achieve something in life, you have to try. If that means putting all your work into getting Senior Moderator on a server, then go for it! There's nothing wrong with trying to do your best. If anything I would rather have a staff member that is try-harding for Senior that one that is practically trying to be demoted.&nbsp;<br><br>When I get older I plan to go to collage and become a Preschool Teacher. If I didn't try to get to this goal then I would never get there, and overall I would end up complaining about all the things I did wrong, or should have done to get to the end goal. If I decide that I will do anything to get there, then I will go over the top to get there, and eventually when I go to get a job I will be more then qualified and I will most likely get the job, and enjoy my life more, because the better you are at what you do the more you get paid, Which in turn gives you a better life overall, not because money creates your life, but because you have the ability to take a vacation, live in a nice home, and pay for whatever you need to and still have some left over for enjoying your free time.&nbsp;<br><br>I see nothing wrong with a Moderator trying to get Senior Moderator and punishing for things against the rules consistently. If someone is breaking the rules, well that's why we are here... That's the whole point of this rank, to punish rule breakers.

i don't think mods really want to help the server, i mean &nbsp;a lot of time there are no mods.<br>and its fine if the mods don't have enough time to play, but in my opinion mods should care more about the server and not the rank, in the moment you apply for mods you know you need to me super active on the server and forums, but a lot of them they just get the rank and don't even join for a day , and if they do they are afk, mods need to change for good to make a good community

Eh. I wasn't saying that the moderators completely lack the maturity to handle being a&nbsp;<b>moderator</b>.&nbsp;<br><br>Each rank has more responsibilities, and for each there are higher expectations in the people in those ranks (for a few reasons; seniors represent the server more - an immature sr looks worst than an immature mod, have access to more info that needs to be kept private among the staff team, etc.) This is why not every single mod gets senior.<br><br>Same sort of deal for admin. We don't demote everyone who can't fit into the admin role, and we don't promote everyone either.

I respect that, but just to clear anything, I'm not even thinking about Senior right now. I've only been a Moderator for a few months, it's much too early for that. I mean if they asked me then sure, but it's not even on my radar right now. Even if I wanted to try-hard to get Senior it would do next to nothing at this point.&nbsp;<br><br>When I applied for Mod, the reason had nothing to do with the rank. I applied because I enjoy Avicus and I was starting to lose interest, I needed something to keep me here. And at the time, I felt like if I had a cool chance to help change the server in a good way, then it would give me incentive to stay online, as well as help the server as much as I can.&nbsp;<br><br>Any feedback as to how to help me as a staff member or the staff team as a whole is always appreciated. We all have things we should work on, but if you can think of some of those things, then that would be really helpful. It would also help to avoid these types of topics that are basically made to create hate against the staff team.

Can I correct this? The Omega update had a lot of glitches and problems with it at first. Overall it was an amazing update for Avicus and has come to prove that it is much better then Avicore. If you want to blame an update for losing players, the Omega update isn't it. <br><br>The Omega update brought us better map options, easier coding for the Developers, which means updates can be released faster and more efficiently. It also added a new feel to Avicus, which as much as I liked the old Avicus feel, this one is much more professional and seems much more open to new players.<br><br>Avicore on the other hand got rid of Prestiges (A bit after, but it was part of the update), which made over half our player base leave, brought a lot of lag with it, and created a very weird environment between new and old players, causing new players to not stay. Not even going to mention the update to full 1.8.x a bit later on.&nbsp;<br><br>Also I would like to point out that the staff team right now is looking more promising then it has been in the past year to year and a half. We are working on fixing communication between the The Admins and Seniors, as well as between the Senior staff and Moderators. A lot of the new Moderators may not be the best, but they are learning as they go, I being one of them. There is still a lot that we need to learn and get better at, but this next year is looking very good for the staff team. As long as we keep with our goals and don't quit on them the next few months will be much better.&nbsp;<br><br>Also like Snow pointed out. the Moderators don't develop anything, you seem to be putting a lot of blame on the moderation staff because things aren't being fixed, such as the lag or some update that you wanted. We have no control over that at all. If you want something to be updated or fixed then post it on Github. That's where you will find the most progress, not making a forum post talking about how bad the staff team is, especially when half of your points aren't even logical.

Although it was in my opinion a fantastic update dispite the block lag at the start, your only conpensation would be that it gained the players that it lost, and I'll give you that. Except it certainly didn't increase :(

True, but Omega along with Atlas had lost players at first, but it's not done gaining players. There are still updates to come, and with the new Dev (Kashike) and ALM doing a very good job Avicus is coming back, if anything, not dying. Sure, it's slow, but it's not dying.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/BMotkzO.jpg" title="Image: http://i.imgur.com/BMotkzO.jpg"><br>essentially i think that the staff are way too "cliquey" , isolating them from the community. a possible solution would be to break up the staff into two groups that hate each other's guts. the groups can be assigned with a pseudo-random number generator when the staff are hired, and then the new staff member must be constantly hit with propaganda denouncing the other side. this way, the staff will get angry at each other and that'll humanize them in the community's eyes since they are having emotions like normal people. eventually, maybe even community members will take part in the staff feud, and then it can turn into a great community event with big matches between the two groups every so often.

The staff team is already split up. Seniors and Moderators. That's half the reason this post was made, because there is no communication between the community and the staff team. The problem is that there is no communication between the staff team. We are working to fix that problem, but without the communication factor, as bad as it is right now, you guys would have a lot more to complain about.

I'm sorry that I have to say this, but the seniors and admins have been going on about improving communication within the staff team and between the staff team and the community for over a year now, and little has changed. If I'm honest, that was one of the reasons why I left the server, albeit a rather minor one in comparison to the others. =(

Yes, because he's completely honest with his actions too. Regardless, he's only one senior. You have seven of those for a reason that only the Gods know, even though at least one of them is incredibly in-active.
