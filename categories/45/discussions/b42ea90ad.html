Maybe because it's illegal, and Avicus could run in to legal issues?

Ok, then why isn't this stated in the forum rules, and not telling me that this is bad by just randomly archiving the thread with no explanation

Well, Tazz... I don't believe Avicus would really run into legal issues because Avicus was merely used as the platform to transport that information.<br><br>It's merely a forum that is invested in basically transmitting information. The only person who is likely to run into legal trouble is the one who provided the material.<br><br>Also, there are tons of youtube videos who have these guides and Photoshop CS6 is a more outdated version of it. They've never run into legal issues with Adobe and I've heard from many youtube videos that Adobe doesn't really care for it's older versions.&nbsp;<br><br>I would've gotten photoshop sooner from those videos but my anti-virus had detected a lot of attempted phishing so...
