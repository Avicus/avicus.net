I just noticed this. I was looking at the staff page and I didn't see Storm, so I went to his profile and it says he isn't a Mod anymore :C. Did he retire, or was he demoted? cri

It's a real shame to see Storm demoted. He's been a really good friend of mine for a long time now. It was a real honor to work with him again on the staff team. We met way back on MCZone. I remember immediately talking to him and hitting it off. We worked along side each other for quite some time on the staff team. As I made my stupid mistakes that ultimately lead to my demotion, Storm continued his career. Throughout the entire incident and conflict he remained a very good friend of mine. As time went on, we spread apart. He gained new friends as I ultimately left gaming for a large time. Once I finally returned, he was the first person I talked to. There was nothing better than reuniting with my long lost buddy. As my Avicus journey lifted off and I received the junior moderator rank, it felt great. One of the things I looked forward to the most was to be back with my pal.&nbsp;<br><br>I'm going to be honest here, I really don't cry too much when it comes to gaming. I've had my moments where I feel down because something "tragic" has happened. When I heard of his demotion, it was like nothing before. I genuinely felt blue. I was extremely upset and I was at a loss for words.&nbsp;<br><br>Servers grow and change. Although some players may not like change, in the end it's for the best. Although he's no longer a staff member, that's not going to change him and/or his legacy. He's still one of the nicest, friendliest guys I know.<br><br>I'm going to miss you buddy.

Ah, Storm. I remember seeing him quite a bit back in MCZone. The memories, probably a lot more for the people that got to know him better than me. But please, keep in touch with us on the forums, and don't leave us entirely.&nbsp; It won't be the same without you, but we all have to move on someday. It's been a wonderful time getting to know you. <br><br>It's tough saying goodbye to you.

That's sad considering Storm is like the only Mod I have seen on the server so far. Storm seemed to have a good connection with the players so it's always sad when someone like that gets the axe.<br>Anyway Storm didn't die so I'm sure Storm will keep in touch somehow.
