I'm mk7. My main reason for coming here is thus:<br>I can come off as an asshole on these servers, and i honestly feel ashamed of myself. Whenever I say something that is, well not "mean', but unnecessary, I regret it within an hour. I just can't stop myself sometimes, mostly when its about how this server copies off others.&nbsp;<br>Honestly, I am a person who is easily pissed off at things on this server, like lag, which I get a good dose of daily, and things that don't work out. I do not want to be a jerk, i really don't. And it may appear that way to some people.&nbsp;<br><br>But anyway, I am a huge Mario Kart fan, I'm so excited about getting Mario Kart 8 this week.

They are only bringing back the boring GameBoy Advance tracks in the past 2 games, which isn't saying much since its only 2 in total. Mario Circuit, why not the 4th Bowser Castle or Ribbon Road?

Yes, yes indeed. But, correction. Mario Kart 7 as in all 7 games. I'll have to make a new account once i become a pro at the 8th, mk8master.<br><br>I dont hate any of the mk7 tracks, I'm good at them all. But Toad Circuit is SO BORING!

Ok, this sí the third time you've flamed a topic. I don't care if this post gets deleted, but it's about time you've been told this:<br><br>Stop bullying people. Just stop. Dont bother continuing to say things that are rude and utterly useless on other peoples threads. Show some respect for once kid. Why is that so hard? This isn't fucking 4chan. People have feelings. Think for a minute. This guy has been on other servers and has been pushed to his limit. He can't help it. Don't go pissing off people that can't handle enough. When will you get the message?<br><br>...welcome to Avicus btw... you seem cool...

Yes, he is not a moderator, but you should listen to him as he is correct. Even if people are not moderators and they know what they are talking about, you should probably listen to him. Remember Chris, the guy that advertised in the Hub when I told him not to advertise? Well, he should've listened. Since he didn't listen, punishment was taken, which could happen to you if you don't listen.&nbsp;That bump was highly unnecessary.

I'm not mad. And instead you should make sure they don't try and start another argument in-game again. I'm fine, I don't try and start conflicts. I asked a simple question and here they come running their mouths when its NOT THEIR JOB. It is yours.

Oki, if they ever decide to start a conflict, you may report Ingame and on the forums with evidence to prevent this from happening. It's okay for them to help you out, they were just letting you know what not to do ^,^ &nbsp;Thanks for understanding! ;D &nbsp;Glad we resolved this.
