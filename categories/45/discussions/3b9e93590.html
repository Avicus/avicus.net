Toby here (thats my IRL nickname) and im here to make a complaint about my donor rank not<br>coming<br><br>Yesterday, my friend bought me or he said he bought me donor and based from what the other<br>donors i play with said, after you pay for a donor rank, it automatically goes on your Minecraft Account,<br>i dont really have any solid proof right now but im really concerned, my friend is trying to get proof<br>and ill also try to get some proof,<br>but if you want to talk to him incase, here's his twitter&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/Lukethebossman1" title="Link: https://twitter.com/Lukethebossman1">https://twitter.com/Lukethebossman1</a>

I thought you said in-game your brother<b> didn't</b> buy it and <b>scammed you</b>...<br>If he did, he would have gotten an email for the purchase right?

i didnt say it was my brother, i do have a brother but its my friend who bought it, and hes from the UK<br>and i just assumed he didnt buy it cuz the other donors like InfiniteLunacy and Sesspee said that it only took them 1 sec or 0 sec after they bought it and then got it

Okay, my mistake. However, sometimes it's slow and takes longer to register.

It doesn't make sense to me, you are complaining about a rank you are not even sure was bought. Why? It sounds like you are trying to scam imo.
