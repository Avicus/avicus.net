Hey everyone,<br><br>Im bored, so I just want to challenge the forums to a math problem thats almost impossible. I saw it on a video, so please don't look it up (unless you're a cheater).<br><br>What is the value of 1+2+3+4+5+... (to infinity). The Value of the Sum of Positive Integers.<br><br>Ill post the answer with an explanation tomorrow.&nbsp;<br><br>P.S.: The answer is not infinity.

"Almost impossible" it's completely impossible to solve because it's infinite. The best you can get are partial sums

Hang on, there's a symbol for this... I can't quite remember, but there's literally a symbol that stands for the answer to the question he asking. Not the inifinite symbol, but a different one...

I guess I'll make this a math marathon :)<br><br>@Max You think that's impossible? You haven't seen some of the problems people can make.<br><br>Also, I'm not nice in terms of math problems; I tend to use very difficult ones.<br><br><b>An n by n matrix has entries from the set {1,2,3,...,2n-1}. This is called a flawless matrix if for every k=1,2,3,....,2n-1 the union of the entries in the k-th row and the k-th column of the matrix is {1,2,....,2n-1}.</b><br><br><b>Prove there are an infinite number of flawless matrices.</b><br><br>Edit 2: Changed the problem, with changed words to make it less searchable. Credits for this problem will come as soon as there is a solution.

Also, one thing about the original post that's really annoying me: It's all&nbsp;<b>positive integers</b>, not all real numbers.<br><br>Also, for the problem I posted above,&nbsp;<b>YOU MUST PROVE YOUR SOLUTION FULLY</b>.

LOL that's the riemann zeta sum, not the euler one. This is just a useful approximation, it actually diverges

Lol I'm still confused. How does it add up to -1/12. I thought a positive+a positive=Positive numbers.

No it's not just cos it's infinite series but cos it's a Cesaro (i think that's the spelling) sum what equals 1/2, in conventional sense it technically diverges c:

Sure, but in number theory, 1+2+3+4+5+.... is clearly not -1/12 due to group theory c:
