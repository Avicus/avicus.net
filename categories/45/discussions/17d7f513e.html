Minecraft Account Purchasing Problem
by
<a href='/users/Emmaye.html' style='color: Gray'>Emmaye</a>
<small>November 18, 2014 at  2:11 AM UTC</small>
</h1>
So I recently got a $30 Visa Debit Gift Card, and I tried buying a new minecraft account with&nbsp;it, but it comes up with this error on the website, it's not only me, it seems to&nbsp;be happening to some of my friends also. Any help please? Also, all the information for the Debit Card and Location are right, so that isn't the problem.<img alt="" src="http://i.gyazo.com/121aec1dd262354b84cb8dc15a090699.png">

Personally, I've never had troubles with purchasing an account. But here's a few things I would've tried...<br><br><ul><li>Reload the page.</li><li>Re-enter your information</li><li>Contact credit card company.</li><li>Contact Mojang.</li></ul>I don't know if this will help...<br>And you don't have to do any of the things I said in a listed order.

What do you know so far from google/forums/etc? I dun wanna repeat what you already got...<br>Also possible that you have to register the card online to use it online. Read the instruction that it came with to check?

Did you purchase it on the Minecraft website?<br>You should try it on the Mojang website.<br><br>It also might be a problem with where you live...<br>For some reason, Mojang has trouble with people purchasing accounts from places other than US and UK and such..

The paper the card came with says "Your card will be active when you receive it. You may begin using the card as soon as you receive it." Anyways the card was a birthday gift that came in the mail 3 months late.

Most probably a card problem then. It could be due to international, need to register it online to an account, something like that. Is there any instruction with it?

For most cards, you'll have to call in to register the card so you can complete the transaction. (: Try searching up the website for the card to call and register the card.<br><br>Make sure to check to see if the card hasn't expired ;)

Has the purchasing problem been recent as in the past 3 months or so? Also I live in Canada now since Late August, and the card is from the US and says "Valid only in the United States", but I set the postal code and info for location in the US, so it should work, since I moved recently, right?

At this point, I'd contact the person that gave you the card to see if they activated it or anything along those lines.&nbsp;<br>Second, make sure that you typed in the correct information into the website.<br>Third, if any of these options don't work out, you're always welcome to Skype me about this, and I can fix this for you. :)<br><br>If you have to use this in the USA, I'll be more than happy for you to contact me so we can get this resolved :) and I'll get back to you as soon as I can :)

Not to intend to bump this purposely for trolling, but how the hell are people managing to buy Minecraft Premium Accounts still? I'm watching the number counter on the home page of Minecraft, and it's going up, and still I can't purchase an account.

Yeah. From the looks of it, I'd just wait a couple days before trying to purchase your new account. (: Maybe it'll help.
