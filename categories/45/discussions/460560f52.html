I know dat some people like the bonzi buddy here Dev_Revs wont approve of this, Idc cuz Kawaii is c00l. NO ONE CARES WUT U THINK DEVON jk kappa . Jeez.&nbsp;<br><br>Anyways, Me and people like JumbKCM need dis chat to feed our anime needs. Plus I'm banned from most anime discords cuz I kept spamming that Minato is obv better then Shippuden Kakashi,(HE IS1)<br><br>Also that Jason needed more character development in Tokyo Ghoul, He died 2 quick.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Anyways, WE NEED ANIME CHAT ON DISCORD I MEAN, OCN HAD IT, Thats the driving force that kept OCN alive.

I'm not against it, or at least having a movies &amp; tv channel that can also be used to discuss anime. I'll bring it up to the Sr staff team.<br><br>It's the sort of thing you can mute if you're not interested, much like with #politics

Minato is better smh,<br><br><br>Flying Rajjin is broken af and &nbsp;Minato &nbsp;was faster den the Ay so how would Kakashi reach his speed, waat<br><br>btw Minato has Reaper Death Seal sooooo Minato is obv the winner, Unless Kakashi got dem double sharingan and Minato was alive, minato would be faked,<br><br>But Edo Minato v Double Sharingan Kakashi, Edo Minato would win with unlimited chakra and KCM. Plus Minato beat Kakashi who was a jonin when Kakashi was 13. I'm pretty sure he can beat him again.&nbsp;<br>Soo Kakashi is probably going to lose obviously, Im a kakashi fan and a minato fan but when it comes down to a 1v1, Minato stomps.

Then their is someone like you.&nbsp;<br><br>The average stereotypical person who thinks that Anime is made of &nbsp;socially awkward people &nbsp;that have Body Pillows and have posters and call people -chan and -kun. Ridding the world of anime wouldn't do any good. It's the exact same thing as other cartoons. Heck theirs some people that are h00ked on Spongebob. People think that Anime lovers sit in their couch everyday and watch Crunchyroll or something like that. &nbsp;You are saying like every Anime lover is the same, that every anime lover watches anime alot, only watches anime, Has anime pictures and wallpapers, and have alot of hentai, You even say that Anime lovers dont have a real girlfriend as your implying to get a&nbsp;<b>REAL</b> Girlfriend, do you think that anime lovers have fake anime girls as a girlfriend? Very stereotypical. ANd you are also saying to get a girlfriend, implying that anime lovers dont have a girlfriend or a fake girlfriend.<br><br><br><br><br>I know your a internet troll but do you have to be stereotypical about anime, Sure you can say I'm wasting my time talking to this internet troll, but its the truth. Pretty much what your saying right now is implying &nbsp;to others, &nbsp;"to free yourself from Anime". &nbsp;Thats saying me and others.&nbsp;<br><br><br>Anyways, just stop judging others on your own preconceptions. Even if your not saying things to other, you are saying it to me. Which offends me. Jeez.&nbsp;<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Kappa &nbsp;I dont really care what you say but if you say that to a Anime Subreddit, ur gunna get attacked lol XD
