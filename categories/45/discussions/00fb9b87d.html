Basically, you can post your weirdest nightmare on here. No matter how weird.<br><br>I'll start off;<br><br>In my nightmare, there was a giant desktop computer <b></b><i>jumping</i> on people, and crushing them. It also strangled people with the power cord. Anyway, me and my friends had to go on this quest and stop it. I think I unplugged it from the power cord, and it stopped jumping on people. I woke up hyperventilating, and turned my computer off from the main power.<br><br>So, post away!

My worst nightmare was just that girl from the Exorcist - if you haven't seen the Exorcist, the girl is basically a fricken scary demon - and it kept teleporting around me and jump scaring the shit out of me, and i was in the streets alone at night for some strange reason, and it kept popping up right in my face haha&nbsp;<br>Weird...

I have two<br><br>One) So I'm at home chilling with my friends the Backyardigans. Then we find a gun. I give it to my mom and she hides it in an air vent, concealing it with pancakes. Suddenly a gunshot comes flying out and hits my brother, who immediately comes back to life. I crawl in the air vent to find and kill George Bush.<br><br>Two) So my house is kind of on a slanted hill. I decide, like I apparantly did last year, to make a river flowing down it out of rainbow sherbet, the ice-cream river. Some kid comes up and tried to tell me I can't do it and another comes and says I did it last year. Then the pokemon Mawile eats them and all the ice-cream.

Was playing Avicus except I had&nbsp;<b>Let it go</b> and was going full on rage mode, and therefore I was a total arse to everyone. While playing i was shaking alot like head swaying and I couldn't focus. I was in a dark room and then eventually while playing I raged so much that I melted into a pile of human flesh while screaming horrendously.&nbsp;<br><br>I'd say more but most of my weird dreams are totally suppressed from memory.

I didn't know that I was sleeping...<br>I was hungry. When I went to the door of my "Bodew" ( I called Bodew the kitchen) and when I was opening the door, I heard some strange sounds. It was my mum in the kitchen floor, with blood, and saying "Bad, Bad, Bagghhhness....", and she disappeared. After it, I went to the NYC police office, but it was empty, only a note in the door saying in blood:&nbsp;<br>" UR HANDSSS ARE DARKS...... YOU KILLED HER!"<br>I looked my hands and nothing was happening...... I didn't understand it. All New York was empty. Was in this moment, that I understand that I was crazy.<br>I went back to my house, but when I saw the ghost. I didn't know it.

M.... Ok. Time to count it:<br><i>I was in Pto. Madero, Chubut Province, Argentina. There was so cold (1 month ago :P) And Dubby said "I love you, mary me". I was scared, and I said to she "I love you too, but, we are from different worlds". After it, I was on a strange place, with Dubby matched w/ me with a rope, and she crying with a cutter on his left hand. Finally, she kiss me and I stop sleeping (6:00 AM D:)<br></i>.

Sweet lawdy Jesus. xD I can't stop laughing xD<br><br><br>I have so many that I could share, but one would be a "Lucid Dream" Hands down, scariest experience of my life ever. Ever.&nbsp;<br><br>If you don't know what Lucid Dreaming is, it's basically when you wake up in your dream, and you are aware that you are dreaming. You control your dream, by yourself.<br><br>Scariest experience of my life ever.&nbsp;<br><br>It just started when it was around 12am, and I was in this giant "haunted" house. I walked up the staircase, and I head to a room. From that point, I see a doll on the bed. *Remeber that I<b> knew&nbsp;</b>that I was dreaming this* I hear noises across the hallway. I check it out, since I'm not that fearful of hearing things. I see that nothing was there, I head back to the room that I was in, and the doll wasn't there... I tried to end this awful dream by sleeping in my dream. Didnt work out so well, I couldn't wake up irl. I was stuck in a horrifying dream, with scary apparations. And I was living it. <br><br><br>It was beyond way worse than I made it sound. I fear that I will lucid dream again x)&nbsp;<br><br>Lucid dreaming can be dangerous too x) Just imagine being stuck in a horror movie, and you couldn't leave.x)
