First of all I didn't know where to put this so I am just putting it here.<br><br>Ok so I am pretty sure that everyone that uses Teamspeak on the server loves the Music Room. It provides good songs and is a great place to listen to music. Although recently I have noticed that the Music Room hasn't got any well music playing. Just wandering why, if it is a glitch or just me.<br><br>Thanks TinyBear

Wait, are you complaining about the songs that are being played?<br>If so, that is a matter of opinion and definitely not a glitch.

Ahh I know what you mean. Sometimes the MusicBot is offline or has a glitch of some sort. Just check back in at a later time and it might be fixed by then. I always hate it when that happens :p

Are you talking about the normal music room or the musicbot room? Because the music room doesn't play music automatically, people have to go in there and play it.<br>As for the musicbot room, atdit has to bring the bot back up

The MusicBot is laggy and I don't feel like anyone wants to hear laggy music. (It's very annoying) I took him offline until I find the solution.<br><br><br>EDIT: Okay I bring him back up but it's your choice if you're taking the risk of a laggy music.. :/

I'd rather listen to laggy music than no music, plus there's always at least 2-3 people in the musicbot room when I'm online.
