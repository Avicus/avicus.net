Hello Avicusers, I wanted to ask a question that you may have been asked before but:<br><br>Can you remember a time when you played a game where you thought "OMG, best game ever!"<br><br>Mine: Got around 30 kills and got all 4 monuments on Frostbite.<br><br>Yours?

:(<br>Lel<br>My best game was probably getting around 40 kills in Frostbite, knocking out 4 diamond guys and strafing the crap out of another one. Then proceeding to break an extremely heavily defended monument with 5 full diamond guys on a glass platform around an open monument. I broke it without shifting or surrounding myself, and standing on the glass platform, and somehow they didn't see me :3

Any game in the good ol' monument rush morning.<br><br>I especially like the games where I just ninja it. Feels so good to know that some people have such short attention spans. :)<br><br>Edit: Oh yeah, one game on Rendezvous 1 I was getting 3v1'd every 10 seconds. I managed to knock some into the still standing cobwebs so I could 1v1. Then in Senex 3 I killed approx. 6 out of 7 people on a middle island with no armor. I also shot back a guy's arrogant comment back at himself ;)

I hardy can enjoy a game when pepole rush and break the monuments in the first 2 minutes.&nbsp;<br><br>So I guess any good game is a game that lasts more than 10 minutes, pretty rare nowadays.

I was on Sector Six on top of the tower that's outside spawn.<br>I was just sitting there sniping people off their 1-block wide bridges.<br><br>People were calling me out for hacking and aimbot, someone even said that they were recording and had video evidence of me using aimbot xD<br><br>It's funny because it was the same people over and over again.<br>I kill one person 13 times and another 11.<br><br>It was the best xD

Ah.... In Rendezvous II, I quickly rushed to the first obby... killed an iron guy and a normal guy, while wearing no armor myself. Got the obby, and proceeded to the next one. Killed another full iron and got the second monument.... Finally put on some iron armor, and went for the 3rd. Killed another 2 guys and got the last obby.

Wow.. So many memorable games :P. My favorite game was back in the days of the beginning of avicus. So here's how it went: I had like 30 x.p from a long time of kill farming and I decided to buy some stuff from the shop. *Note: I was not a Donor at this time. What I did next was just an absolute troll towards the other team. I made a little hiding place a long a large sky bridge, and sat in there and waited for someone to come by. When someone did, I pulled out my Spanky spade and knocked them off! In the end, I killed like 3 diamond guys, 5-6 iron guys, and a bunch of leather armor guys! It was a fun game! Oh and I miss the fact that the spade costs so much more x.p now a days...&nbsp;<br>Thanks 4 reading :)

Hahaha!<br><br>If you check my stats, you will see I killed hv7104 25 times, in the same game too xD (I witnessed rage and hackaccusing from him when it ended xD)<br><br>I haven't really had a "best game ever" on Avicus, I remember the last game I played though, it was 10 days ago. It was Frostbite, as McNerdy bridged in full diamond I threw a single snowball and he fell into void. It happened again to two other players wearing full diamond xD
