Hey!<br><br><b>Small message</b><br><span>Lately it has come to my attention that we are being disrespected. Whether it is in game or on the forums, we won't be tolerating it. We are here for you guys, to make your experience a better and more enjoyable one. However we're sick of joining games where we get nothing but hate. And it is not just me, it is other staff as well, and what is even worse is that staff are getting harassed because of their gender. We could walk out, and step down at any time, but we don't because we enjoy what we do. It could be me, it could be the server, but one thing I know for sure is that it is because of what is happening in game.<span><i><br></i>Punishing doesn't always&nbsp;help, because they'll come back and do it again. People make differences between the Forum community and the Game community, but in the end we are one big server, with one big community. We as a staff team have things that we can improve on, but if we never get credit for what we do, what is the point? What is the point when we only get pointed out for things we're not so good at?<br><br></span></span><span><b>Issues regarding /report</b><i><br></i>As you may have noticed, a number of the in-game commands are broken. This has been going on for a while now and it’s causing a few issues with reports too. Multiple players have been timing out or crashing after using the /report command. There are also other commands that are causing issues such as /hub and /where.<i><br></i>IvyCode has been informed and is working on the problem. If you find any rule breakers, please file an online report with sufficient evidence. The staff team will do their best to deal with them as soon as possible. Thank you for your patience!<br><br><b>Map development<br></b>The map development team has been working harder than ever before! Their work goes unnoticed, and we should all owe them respect for keeping the rotations updated and as fun as possible! Thanks :D<br><i><br></i><b>Junior Moderator Mentoring</b><i><br></i>For this round of staff applications, the senior staff team has made the decision to make all the moderators mentors. This essentially means that every single moderator will be offering their time to guide and assist the junior moderators. If you pass the interview and are given a Junior Mod trial, one of the current staff members will introduce you to the team and show you everything you need to know.<i><br></i>It is important to note that as a Junior Mod you’re not expected to know everything straight away, so it will be in your best interest to ask as many questions as you need. Feel free to approach any of the moderators, as we’re all here to&nbsp;help!<br></span><span><i><br></i><b>Staff training<br></b>I know many of you have been ranting on how you've been punished "unfairly". However, I plan to host a staff training program, which will essentially go for ~1 week. The senior staff will get together and one by one, we'll train the moderator in depth in what team griefing, spawnkilling and hacking truly is.&nbsp;<br><i><br></i><b>Results from the meeting held couple days ago<br></b>As you may know, a survey created by Sulorak and myself was posted on the Forums not too long ago. We gathered the results into one spreadsheet, and I essentially spoke to the senior staff with the issues the community has with them. Same went for Moderators. Hopefully you will notice a difference...<br><i>If you still believe a staff member is slacking off or not doing their job correctly, please contact me.<br><br></i>This has been a little update notifying the community what has been done to improve the staff team as a whole. Keep updated with my twitter (@Fluenza_) for further sneak peeks on what I have planned!<i><br></i><br></span>

No offence, but ... I do think you will need to change the guidelines regarding your staff and the punishments you are giving out. You can't expect people to stay when they are constantly being harassed, if you want to maintain a good atmosphere you clearly need to do something about it quite soon. It shouldn't take five pages of infractions until a player gets banned, do you realize how stupid that sounds? You as staff are able to prevent people from attacking and harassing each other, instead of what you are doing right now and giving out a second chance after another, until they are at five+ pages of infractions.

If it's true, I'm happy that you will bring it up for once, as this has been told so many times but nothing is done about it. (I've been talking with Jozz about it many times too). <br><br>As I said in my post, you as staff are able to prevent the harassment and maintain a good atmosphere if you really want to, but it seems like this isn't anything that really matters. I played on Avicus a while, like two - three months? and I would say I did <u>NOT</u> get a good first impression of this server at all. I was constantly attacked by players, even your well-known players, but nothing was done about it, even though I reported it. "You only care about your KD, KD means nothing", "You are worthless", "M*therfucker", "Bowspamming f*cker", bla bla bla.<br><br>You can keep coding and developing maps and gamemodes but who will be playing these when you're not even able to keep your players? I'm happy I got to know some people who I still talk to on a regular basis but what about the great majority who actually attacked me in-game? At the end of the day, it's the bad people who give your server the bad reputation, not the good people who actually care for you.

Well, yes, you're completely right. However, typically, emphasis on typically, the Sr. Staff are more experienced and knowledgable than the Moderator/Junior Moderator team, so they tend to make less mistakes.

This may seem like a weird suggestion, but maybe some of the staff could spectate top PvPers fight and record them and get staff to watch them. I find a lot of false bans are PvP related.

No offence, but ... I do think you will need to change the guidelines regarding your staff and the punishments you are giving out. You can't expect people to stay when they are constantly being harassed, if you want to maintain a good atmosphere you clearly need to do something about it quite soon. It shouldn't take five pages of infractions until a player gets banned, do you realize how stupid that sounds? You as staff are able to prevent people from attacking and harassing each other, instead of what you are doing right now and giving out a second chance after another, until they are at five+ pages of infractions.

From my knowledge, I mentioned three pages in the recent meeting. Things do change behind the scenes. Maybe you should catch up on what's been happening, and yes it has been stated numerous times on multiple different threads! :)

Well, when a moderator is spectating someone, it's not like they can tell if the player is aiming at the center of the opponent's head.

You should discuss about the player with another mod, hopefully a Sr or +before banning him so you can have some feedback about him hacking or not, then you decide if he deserves a ban or not.<br>Hacks don't work if you're using PvP mods like he was.. and how do I know? Simple, I saw the appeal he made in the forums before it was locked and archived.

No need to discuss it with other staff when it's quite blatant. Just because someone appeals on the forums, doesn't mean they're legit.&nbsp;<br>You have no evidence to support your claim, and those screenshots in the OP showed nothing but his GUI interface.&nbsp;<br><br>Case closed, back on topic.
