Guys, I'd really appreciate if you could please like an EDM set a friend made for a contest. All you gotta do is go on Soundcloud and like the last track he uploaded. Here's the link:&nbsp;<a href="https://soundcloud.com/dj3aus/vives-forero-dj-contest">https://soundcloud.com/dj3aus/vives-forero-dj-contest</a><br><br>I'd also appreciate if you could not archive this since I'm not gaining anything out of doing this.

Spam thread. Even if it's not helping you, it's still a spam thread.

It's either a spam thread or a thread "about one person". He made the thread so we can go and thumbs up something, it's basically nothing we can discuss about. If at least his friend would've made this thread and said something like "What do you think of my creation? Feedback?" then it would be something else but this is clearly a spam thread.

They are supposed to be used to show more support to the track and create more awareness about it in the contest.

This post doesn't break any rules, and can't be really considered as spam.<br><br>I personally am not a fan of stuff like "help my friend by liking this plsss" posts but there's no reason for it to get locked, unless the replies get bad / go off topic.
