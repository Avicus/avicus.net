It's dumb, If I sneak in the wool, I hope to get out quickly without them knowing, its practically impossible :(

Maybe it's broadcasted after 1 minute to give you time to get out before the other team can focus on you? Hiding it completely seems a bit unfair in the fact you wouldn't know you'd lost both wools until the game ends. See what I mean? c:

Yea a slight delay sounds good, but maybe something lower like 30 secs.<br><br>Edit: It only tells you on the 1st touch though so I'm neutral now.

If you can't notice someone breaking into your wool/broke into your wool. You have a problem. Also Tourements are supposed to be challenging. This would be asking someone in hockey to light a firework if they were cherry picking.

Agreed. Instead, make it so it sends the team a message that one of their wools has been placed. (Does it do that already? I don't play CTW, sorry)

Maybe a ten second headstart would be good because you should be far enough ahead that if they go back to wool room they won't be able to catch up.

Maps need to be better organized and regioned before we do this. Considering our region system, it's not really plausible unless we do 70 regions for each side (and shape) of air and mix it with cylinders and cuboids: having one coordinate wrong would screw us up.<br><br>If I can, I'll make a regions folder in the maps repo and have an import (import regions/region1.yml) and it'll hopefully play better instead of wicked skybridges and U bridges.

I don't think that would be possible as far as I know. That function doesn't work in nebula last time I tried and it's from what I understand supposed to triumph all other regions as the highest priority.<br><br>Kylo was working on a fill region for void, so there's always a possibility of using that, too. Smart idea though!

Honestly, it's stupid how it is. It needs to be changed. You can not be secret at all. It's more of a challenge for a defender if they don't know the attacker is there. All of you Avicus randies saying it's good like this have no idea of what competitive play is and how it should be.

Well if you're so perfect at defending and you see a 4 man push on its way to your wool room and you actually see someone going into the wool room and come out with the wool... Telling your team on TS or waiting for the broadcast, does the same thing, bro.

What if I, the offender don't want to instantly leave the wool, and I want to wait till the time is right to leave, there is simply no way that you can give the other team that kind of information if they don't know already, its their fault, and they shouldn't be gifted that kind of information, its their fault for not being aware, dont tell them
