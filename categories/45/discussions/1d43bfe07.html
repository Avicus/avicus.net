so basically this post is a bunch of people who don't know what there on about but think they do, so comment what they think but it ends up not being true and then rilo becomes known as a hacker/cheater because people don't actually know what they're on about. Classic.

What SpookeZZ is saying is that we do not have any solid evidence that he was&nbsp;using any mods or hacks at the time. In addition, he logged off before any concrete proof could be collected. Therefore, he is only temporarily banned.

You get banned on any big server for disconnecting mid screen share and it's REALLY obvious he had something to hide lmao

The point of saying; Don't disconnect while SS'ing is that you will be banned if you disconnect... this is the standard everywhere. If avi wants to implement SS'ing it needs to implement the expectations upon the community that &nbsp;SS'ing brings. With that said, I dont like SS'ing and don't believe it should be used.

Be that as it may, we lack conclusive evidence of hacks or mods on his system. Thus, a temp ban most likely seemed like the most apt punishment. It is foolish to go around banning whomever we suspect of possessing mods or hacks without evidence.

staff chose to implement SSing that means they need to ban if the person doesnt comply or disconnects. Arguing "oh we didnt have proof doesn't make jack for sense. His punishment is for disconnecting not hacking. The argument is that there is no way this system works with temps for not complying, it only works if it is a perm. Its really not difficult to get, SSing wouldn't catch anyone if it was ban for a week for refusing or perm for SSing. The system is stupid and staff will update it soon. Also ffs look up the meaning of biased. Yall just use it to describe staff you dont like. kthxbye.

They don't need concrete evidence, he was told he was going to be permbanned if he disconnected mid screenshare, which he did. The situation right now is incredibly bias since it's so obvious he was using something but isn't banned. If this is how it works everyone should install a triggerbot.

I agree with DGB. I could use a ghost client which I would be perm banned for, then get seed and just disconnect to get a temp instead of a perm. It's so easy to abuse

You shouldn't take me as supporting either side.

1. Saying rilo doesn't mean anything you never know you or me could be hacking right now<br>2. Why would he hack? Idk maybe he was bored maybe he didn't want to lose/die<br>3. Why not he disobeyed staff instructions he could of potentially gotten a perm ban imo he should of gotten at least a month<br>4. Oh boy...

He was told that he would be banned if he left the screen-share, and he did. He's lucky he didn't get a perm-ban, although I don't agree that he should have gotten a perm-ban, like some people said above, he was warned, and is lucky that he was not perm-banned. He could be hacking, and that's why he was temp-banned, but there's no proof 100% that he had a client on or not.
