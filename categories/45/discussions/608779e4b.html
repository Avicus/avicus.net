Can anyone tell me or someone from the staff tell me the meaning of what is<br><b>Fastplace</b>, what it means or does&nbsp;and how and why is it considered bannable?<br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/N62SDQF.png" title="Image: http://i.imgur.com/N62SDQF.png">

Fastplace is a hack used to place blocks far faster than the average amount. In general, hacks are bannable however some are less severe than others.<br><br>As well as this, censored your image.

ok but is there a way of actually telling the difference between placing blocks fast in general like when your in a panic during combat (like blocking a tunnel via spamming blocks, bridging/ jump bridging, etc.) and the hack itself/ fastplace?

Not really<br>There are a lot of people that get over 18cps like Splade and Epsilpha which makes it hard to detect but generally, they place more than 5 blocks in just one spot so you just need to watch out carefully to catch them.

It's generally quite easy to differentiate someone who has fastplace and someone who's just spamming their mouse.
