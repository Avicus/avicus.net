I was working on a pvp guide for about 3 hours, with diagrams and stuff and I closed the tab. &gt;.&gt; I guess I'll just make a new one, is there any way to get it bacK? ;_;

Unless your browser has it cached, it's probably gone forever ;s<br>This is why you always copy your entire guide to notepad/word/etc. every so often.<br>

There is, but only if you still have the browser open. Just do shift, then CTL then T<br><br><br>EDIT: you have to keep tapping T, while holding down both Shift, and CTL, until the tab appears again

I did that once with my "The most amazing thing happened in-real-life" post. When I typed it again, it was 10:30 at night on a school-night, so I had to summarize it. I wrote so much, too, I understand your pain ):

Some browsers cache, some do not. Try what ducks suggested.&nbsp;

OMG. Go back through Recently closed tabs. Then try to go back into your history where you were first typing it. Try no or else your history will be filled with garbage and you can't find it anymore.

Actually it is still there :P Nothing on the internet is taken off from the internet, it is always there hiding in the background so if you ever get like a government job they will look at all your social networks even if its broken, they will check your posts :P they have a way to recover anything

In this case he didn't actually submit anything to the web server, so no, it's not there. It was never put 'on the Internet' in the first place.<br>
