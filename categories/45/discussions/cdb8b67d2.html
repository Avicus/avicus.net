I'm really starting to read a lot more lately... Does anyone have any good suggestions of books to read? So far I've mostly read the Percy Jackson series and some of the WoW books, I'll read pretty much anything though (I prefer science fiction books mostly). Any ideas?

Try the Unwind series. Its sci-fi. Kinda hard to explain but basically in the distant future parents can choose to unwind their kids which is basically killing them and the organs/body parts can go to other people who need it. It follows the story of 3 kids running away from home after their parents signed a form to get them unwound.

If you haven't already, try out the hunger game series. Also, a good series is the Vampire academy series. I know it sounds a bit silly, but it &nbsp;actually has a really good story line.

The Gone series is great; it's about a town where everyone over 15 vanishes, things start getting more and more crazy as things go on and it's pretty great. <br><br>Maze runner is awesome, it's about a load of kids (again no adults) who wake up in this maze one day. It's a really good series and definitely worth reading.<br><br>The Knife of Never Letting Go series is also great. It starts of in a town where everyone can hear each others thoughts. Can't really say much about this without spooling it but trust me, it is really good

I've read the Percy Jackson series many times over, try <b>Heroes of Olympus</b>; another set of books with the same characters and theme!<br><br>If you want some heart-warming books then read <b>Wonder</b> or <b>I'</b><b>ll give you the sun</b>.&nbsp;<br>Action packed ones are the Maze Runner trilogy and the prequel!<br><br>My absolute favourite book series of all time is&nbsp;<b>The Last Dragon&nbsp;Chronicles</b>, absolute killer read, no complicated language to follow and you'll get stuck in it straight away, I found two sequel books for the series...<img src="http://www.trojansnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/ChrishdLacey8bks-820x483.jpg" title="Image: http://www.trojansnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/ChrishdLacey8bks-820x483.jpg"><br>I'm currently reading&nbsp;<b>We were liars</b>, really good book as well.

Divergent series. Don't read it at night tho, it will only make you more awake xD. It's an incredible series. &nbsp;<br><br>Harry Potter series. This series may be for kids around my age, but my parents have read it too and they really liked it. It's a must read cad.<br><br>The Maze Runner series is incredible. I can't say anything else.<br><br>The Heroes of Olympus is alright. It does NOT beat thePercy Jackson series, but its still a must read.<br><br>The Hunger Games series is an incredible series. Just be ready to be mad at Susan Collins when you finish it xD.

Maze Runner series is a must.<br><br>Try the series starting with Gone, that's also incredible.<br><br>If you're into zombies/horror also try The Fear by Charlie Higson. It's basically a post-apocalyptic world where all adults turn into zombies. It's set in London which is why it appealed to me so much.<br><br>Good luck reading all these books xD

Blood Ninja, read it last year and found it to be a pretty good read. Has that Perspective shiz goin on and is based around the Edo times. As the name suggests it's about Vampires who are also ninjas. <br><br>Hunger Games is pretty good.
