I strafe when I'm at 7.5-10 hearts and I'm fighting one enemy, block-hit and strafe when I'm at 7.5-4 hearts, and I tend to block-hit until I get a good chance to run away when I'm anywhere under 4 hearts and/or there are 2 people with the same gear chasing after me. When I'm on a flat plane, I often swerve right and combo them without jumping. I always try to stay on the high-ground, too, because in Minecraft PVP, you want to get behind the person and jumping from above gives you the perfect opportunity to do that :3

From my profile, I have a lot more but these seem to be most useful:<br>-Strafe (make it hard for them to see you and they can't hit you)&nbsp;<br>-Combo (click as fast as you can, faster than your opponet so they can't hit you, somtimes they say you have reach hacks so I don't recommend it , jk xD I don't care)&nbsp;<br>-Critical hits (when you fall from something like a jump you do more damage)&nbsp;<br>-Sprint (spam space under a 2 block high ceiling so you can go faster and do more critical damage, also sprint to knock players back more)&nbsp;<br>-Lower advantage (go under your opponet so they can't reach you but you can reach them)&nbsp;<br>-Ladder (When 7 or more blocks away from your opponet, climb a ladder to regenerate health, eat, drink potions and other stuff if low on health, once you reach the top and someone followed you, kill him xD)&nbsp;<br>-Bow first (if you have a bow or a different projectile, shoot him/her first to hurt them more and easier to combo since it stops their sprint)&nbsp;<br>-Water (reccommended if no ladder, low on health, regenerate or eat in the water, make sure you have a bow)

Yup, thanks for sharing all the information with everyone! The only thing I think might not be a good idea, though, is climbing a ladder while someone's chasing you. Due to having no knockback on ladders, they can just keep hitting and hitting you over and over while under you and you usually don't have any time to react before they kill you. Otherwise, good ideas!

Thx! But in the ladder trick, I forgot to add make sure you are around 7 or more blocks away from opponet :P. This was an old list. Editing! Thanks for telling me about this!

Nobodies mentioned hitting legs.<br><br>This tactic essentially is the reason I've been able to pvp when I've had 250ms. If you aim for the legs the server will favour your hit to your opponents. I don't know why but it's as very useful tactic.

@StanMPL it's not noticeable if you have a good connection already but if you have a high ms to a server you'll see hitting legs makes a difference.

If you (anyone reading this) see someone making a bridge on Nebula, shoot him [or her] at an angle instead of straight on. That way, you can shoot him off the bridge and to his death, instead of letting him retreat to safer ground.<br><br>Also, pay attention to your surroundings (i.e.: So you don't miss an enemy player running to your team's monuments).

Run at the person like a maniac hoping he gets scared and runs away, jumps off but I hit him while still in range or he comes after me and I either die, or we tie, and in rare cases I win lol
