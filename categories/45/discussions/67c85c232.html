Hey Avicus players!<br><br>I've made 2 maps so far, and am working on a third one right now.<br>But, even though it almost never happens to me, I'm out of ideas to build!<br><br>The maps I've made are YinYang and Smite, which are both not accepted <u>yet</u> :P<br><br>I'd love to hear your ideas and I'll try my best to make them look how you expected them to look.<br>Even though I'm not sure what to build, I got a few things the ideas need to have:<br>- Needs to be kinda original, not something that has already been done on avicus.<br>- Good for gameplay AND looks. I really hate maps that are made within an hour &nbsp;and look horrible. But yeah, that's just my opinion I guess :P<br><br>Thanks a lot for helping me!<br>-Clijmart

I think that you can make a map which includes CTW and DTM both. I mean you'll need to capture a wool, then you will need to destroy a monument. I don't know what people will think on that but I believe that this might be interesting.

Sounds interesting, but I'm not sure if I'm able to do that, since the plugins have to be changed I guess... Could ask some info to the devs about it :)<br>Thanks for your suggestion!

This is going to be hard, a lot of people are going to be asking you for different ideas and suggestions. Good luck getting both of your maps accepted btw :)<br><br>If you could, make a map that has 3 monuments, vertical to where you spawn, and 1 behind it. Some challenge would be nice :P
