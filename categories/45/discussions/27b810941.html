Like, communicating with snakes. I don't know how, but I can somehow make my snakes go calmer when I want them too. I just really like being with them and, it's as if they are real, living human beings. Call me crazy or retarded and I don't care, But sometimes I have "conversations" with them. Somehow it feels like they are listening inside sometimes. They always like to slither up to me and just cuddle...<br><br><br>I also have a sorta license, so in here, where I live. I can go to a zoo, show em' dat card, And I'll be allowed to look behind the cages, and sometimes handle the snake...<br><br><br>Shhhhh, I'm a "Parsel Tongue" (hehehe, harrypotter fans only...)
