Yeah....<br>To explain why I'm leaving...<br>I kinda lost hope in this server,I'm offended by a lot of people on this server,I'm am sick and tired of getting this cold-shoulder treatment and I have reached the limit of how much I can take,everytime I win a match or something,I get cursed on.<br><br>Player 1:F--- you b----!!!<br>Player 2:Yeah get lost you noob.<br><br>I also find it really really boring nowadays,the max players I see everytime is like lesser than 200.<br>I might still come back on provided I get treated better,or if I see some improvement in the player count.<br><br>I will still be on the forums but very rarely.<br><br>See you guys around....

I'm sorry this happened to you :(<br>but when playing an online game these are the risks you're taking. As for the player count, I think it's your time zone ;(

Bye Tek. I think my days here are also almost at an end . Way too much criticism from players. I won't name names though, but the Avicus community just isn't like the MCZone I started playing in.

Bye. That's all I can really say, Please don't go! As other people have said, you are a really skilled and funny guy. I would love to be in just one game with you before you go, just one. I don't know weather I have EVER played with you before, maybe a couple of times xD. It's soo sad seeing people go, from this amazing server :(. Please come back sometimes because Avicus keeps changing! It will be a great surprise! Anyway, I would love to keep talking but I've got to go. I will miss you! Bye!

Anyone know why we are crashing so much today? as for these " I'm leaving" posts - why bother just go if your going. The status of the server and community is what it is and it is not going to change because <u>people don't change</u>. You should just build a small network of friends and play with them - that's what I do.. works great and then there is no need to project your "needs" and "wants" onto a community that really has no business "taking care" of your feelings. Nothing wrong with the community on Avicus at all... as for the server stability.. that's another story.

Sorry to hear that. When you win and people swear at you, don't be offended. Just type &lt;3. And if someone calls you a hacker, suggest to them to use /report. Don't go...avicus is losing too many players. If all of these people who left after avicore have stayed, avicus would still have 400-500 players

Tek, I don't play with or against you much, but you are someone who everyone loves. You are a great PVPer, or maybe I just suck, but either way, who will destroy me comepletely when you leave... wait... everyone else. I suck at PVP... that's right.<br><br>Anyway, don't leave....<br>&lt;3

I've been ignoring it for the past 5 months,there's a limit of what a person can mentally take before he actually takes effect from insults and emotional hurting.

I've found Avicus with 700-800 people &gt;_&lt; I actually hate it at that range because Neb's full and boring like that.&nbsp;<br><br>I seriously like the 400-550 cause Neb's nice and Avicade's on too. :D&nbsp;<br><br>Bye Tek!!! I can't really convince you to come back because you've made your mind, but I just want to say that's it has been really an awesome experience with you. :D Good bye, but remember to come visit us time to time!
