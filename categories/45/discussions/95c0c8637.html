It was really terrible and stalematey in my opinion. It lagged quite a bit too.

Laggy due to snow, usually takes a long time, kill farms are frequent

A year ago, it was a good map but now with so many good players, it's hard to win...

its basically whos team can bridge faster to mid and kill the other team from getting the diamonds. Meanwhile the other team builds up and cross over to the monument...

I liked it. But it was always a stalemate so I see where the people who removed it are coming from.

I could possibly make a remix? I mean all that needed to be done about the lag with the snow was simply put snowballs in the remove-drops tag.<br><br>Also, make the diamonds be on both sides equally with there only being 12 diamond blocks on each side.<br>The map could also do with a few extras as well.<br><br>I don't care about the map being "Stalematey" and whatnot. It was a good map. Quintus, Luar and many other maps are stalematey. Why aren't they gone?<br><br>A map can only be stalematey if the people defending know what they're doing. So essentially if being "stalematey" is one of the reasons to get rid of it in the first place then don't you think you'd have to ban every good player off the server? It's good players that know how to defend that make the map stalematey.&nbsp;<b>And it's fun *Maniacal smile*.<br><br></b>Bring it back or I could dish out a remix with improved features and added content.<b><br></b>
