I think it would be a good idea to make a cyber Monday discount or like double xp for next year. If you don't make a discount I can understand because black Friday is just a couple days before. So yeah I hope that someone takes this into consideration.

I understand you, if you weren't late you could've also used the discount. I see no reason for a server to have a discount right after their first discount, as this server needs money in order to stay alive.
