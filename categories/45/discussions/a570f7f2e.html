After reading about it a bit, I wouldn't assume there is no democracy, president or freedom. At least not right now. We have to wait and see how the situation develops.

Omg, you don't even know what army does here. They kill people for no reason. Erdogan is a terrible president. But people choose him, that's not his fault. It's people's fault. I wish he wouldn't be the president but better than &nbsp;military coup. CUZ ARMY WAS ABOUT TO MAKE A CIVIL WAR.

Well actually he does. He does the worst things on this world. And I HATE HIM PLS NEVER FORGET THIS. But what I mean is, coup is a worse thing. I wish Erdogan didn't be the president but people are voting him cuz Turkish people are so idiot. He steals money and people say' He stole for us'. He is a cunt, fag, retarted. whatever you say is true. But. When military coup happens, more people die, army starts administrating the country, THEY FUCK EDUCATION SYSTEM EVERYTIME. And last night, if a soldier would have attacked to another soldier (it was about to happen last night btw) there would be a civil war... You can choose a better president by voting, but you can't change army by voting... I wish erdogan wouldn't be the president, but it's fault of fucking Turkish people unfortunately...

Hope he gets arrested asap and a better president comes... When the military coup was happening he was at his summer house and having vacation. So sure he was ready to run away. Then he messaged to all mobile phone users 'Get on streets, show your power to them and don't let them get the country'. And meanwhile, he was on vacation at Marmaris. LMAO

It's nice to see a Turk actually opening his eyes. If you want to learn more about how much people your country has killed (my people), search the Armenian Genocide up. It's a mass killing which your people commuted 101 years ago that president Erdogan refuses to accept. 1.5 million people were killed in total.<br><br>I wouldnt be be saying this if you didn't say what you said. If you don't believe that your people did this 100 years ago, it's fine, I don't want to start a flame war. If you have any more questions about this topic PM me on Skype and I'll answer when I get back from vacation.&nbsp;<br><br>Also, you know the world is fucked up when you leave home for 8 days and come back knowing there was a terrorist attack in Nice and a military coop in Turkey within those 8 days.

So true. But I'm not Turkish and I'm proud of NOT BEING A TURKISH. I live in Istanbul but I'm from the USA. Your people wanted to make an Armenia country and Turkish people didn't let you and sent you out of the country. In Turkish schools, they teach it as something nice. But I've always though that we should let people create their own countries. And they teach us like France, Italy and England are bad countries. I just wanna move out of this fucking country. People suck, education suck, president suck EVERYTHING SUX HERE OMG

You know they didn't just send us out of Turkey right? They literally made my ancestors walk across a lot of miles (idk if it's more than 100 or a thousand, I don't want to give false information, but I do know they made us cross the Der Zor desert). Fortunately, Turkey tried to advance on the second part of Armenia in 1918 we fought back and won. It was they first time we were independent in &nbsp;more than 100 years.
