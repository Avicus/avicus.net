If you know me, I never get bothered by other peoples grammar, or bother to have good grammar myself, just enough so everyone understands what I'm writing. But it really bothers me when someone says "would of" instead of "would have". Anyone else have this problem?

Actually, "would have" is grammatically correct. People write "would of" due to the similar pronunciation when someone says "would've"
