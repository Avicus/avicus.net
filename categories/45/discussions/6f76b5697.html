Hey! The forums is a wonderful place where you can discuss with other players over the server about any minecraft related stuff, ask for help, report players, apply for staff and even about the server! :) I feel like I speak for many people saying we hope to see you around more often!&nbsp;<br><br>As we are getting a new update there will be a few more gamemodes, but here are just a few:<br><br><b>Nebula:</b> Two teams fight against each other trying to destroy their opponents monument, first team to break their opponents monuments (an obsidian block) wins!<br><b>Nexus:</b> Its a team deathmatch where 2-4 teams fight off with special kits that you can unlock with each level you gain by obtaining experience.<br><b>Elimination:</b> Ever heard of the Hunger Games? If not its a gamemode where you have a limited time when there is a grace period where you are allowed to craft items. After that grace period you fight all the other players in hope to be the last one standing and win!<br><b>The Walls:</b> Four teams have 10 minutes to gather as many resources as possible, after 10 minutes they fight it off, the last team standing wins! Also with kits that you may unlock with levels!<br><b>Avicade:</b> A bunch of minigames put together, for example: Red alert, One in the chamber, minotaur.<br><b>Coming soon</b>: Survival Games, Capture the Wool, and more! (still don't know .-.)<br><br>And with what is so great about all the games that we have right now, is that you can prestige! You know Call of Duty prestige? Same concept, get to level 50, do /prestige, lose all your levels and kits but you get an awesome star next to your name and get all the bragging rights :P but don't do it a lot, it would create lots of spam, therefore breaking one of our rules.<br><br>Hope you enjoy your stay at The Avicus Network :) Remember, if you have any concerns/ideas you may contact us over email at support@avicus.net.<br>Make sure to read the&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://avicus.net/rules">rules</a>&nbsp;so you don't get in trouble and get banned off the server :c that would be sad :/<br><br>Have a great day!

Hey Flor! Welcome to the forums and the server! Feel free to ask me any questions, that's up for your desire :)<br>This server consists on 6 gamemodes: Nebula, Walls, Control The Hill, Nexus, Avicade and Elimination, hopefully I'm not forgetting any other.<br>Regarding the other question, you &nbsp;can create and discuss different topics in the different sections this organized forums have, however, if you're wondering, "How do I add friends", there isn't any way for now as the old.avicus.net (Where you could add friends) is now gone.<br>Hope you enjoy the server and have a good day :D

Welcome to the forums, Flor! :D <br><br>To find a good skin, you can probably check on what interests you have and use that as your skin. Be it food or pop culture, anything should be there! :P If you want, you can also make your own. :D
