So its a bit concerning that no one has responded to my Mod App.<br><br>Reasons;<br>1. Its been 11 days and people have been telling me that they got theirs answered in 10 minutes.<br>2. (Not to hate) But Numberz is a junior mod and I think I applied before him?<br>3. Either I'm being ignored or.... they denied it and didn't reply.<br><br>I'm just wondering why no one has responded to me in 11 days. Go ahead and say this is forum spamming but I'm really concerned and asking why?.<br>-Aidan or Cardioo.

Firstly, I'd like to apologise for the long wait time but don't worry, you haven't been forgotten!&nbsp;<br><br>The amount of time you have to wait is all dependent on the availability of the Senior Staff, unfortunately, you're just going to have to be patient while the Seniors get through the apps.<br><br>We have quite a few to get through and it's not an easy process. <br>It's going to take time to get through all of them thoroughly.&nbsp;<br><br>In Numberz' case. His demotion was reassessed and he was given the Junior Moderator rank.

Everyone will get to know whether they are accepted at the end of the month, no one knows yet.

Isn't this your second thread about waiting for a reply?<br><br>The least you can do is post your concerns regarding the staff apps in the Q&amp;A they made for the sole purpose of keeping the board clean from these sorts of threads. :P
