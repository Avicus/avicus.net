Who would be in your top 3 list of archers ? Remember, it doesn't have to be the best PvP'ers or the most popular players.<br>My top 3 from when I was active would be:<br>1.) Celestrian572<br>2.) MLGTino<br>3.) xcrunner67

Ugh, I'm pretty good at archery-ing (is that a word? It is now), but I'd say:<br><br>1. Pizza334<br><br>2. MLGtino<br><br>3. Slicorn&nbsp;<br><br>While I'll agree Sfkwww is good at Neb, IMO along with a couple other few he is overated at PvP, Archery, and Rushing.
