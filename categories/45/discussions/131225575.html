As a fellow DDR fan, pretty good! :D<br><br>...But if you REALLY want to impress me, do "1, 2 Step" on NOVICE. If you can do that, then you would have truly earned my respect. c:

Kicks hurt, so I guess hug ;3<br><br>I first started playing during 2008 and I continued for about two years. I then stopped due to middle school, ya feel? I was so close to dominating boss songs on expert too... shame. But last year, I got Stepmania and I bought a controller adapter for my computer and I basically started from scratch. I knew the basics, but my stamina wasn't the same as before. Now, it's more of an on-off thing. One moment I'm like "Yes! Let's get pumped! I'm really feeling it!", but other moments i'm like "...Nah". I definitely want to start again so I can join FaZe.<br><br>TL;DR: Was pro, now semi-scrub.

Same here pretty much, but not when the school started, only when pads broke, the one I just used, just doesn't work so I had to slide and pray, but I practice on my "imaginary" pad. Pretty much I just mimic videos on my chair .-.<br><br>Going to get an Omega gx one day, best on the market, and I really want one. I keep trying max 300 but I fail midway because so stamina.
