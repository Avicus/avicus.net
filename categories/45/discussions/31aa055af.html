BitDefender is pretty good, but you'll need to make an account.<br><br>It scans for viruses at all times and even warns you if the page you're about to enter has any traps in it.<br><br>I used to get background frequencies that would warn me about me having a virus on my computer *(Even though this was a virus in itself)*<br><br>But I downloaded BitDefender and watched as it completely quarantined and executed the PUP.optional and many other Malware and spyware programs.

Nope, you gotta pay for it. But if you're looking for a free one, I recommend "Avast!".

I used to have it, I really hate it, random pop ups that advertises the company are annoying... Even in game mode.

Requesting locks never was a thing. Mods just never listened/forgot about it after being told xd

I use&nbsp;malwarebytes and AVG, works great with out any problems. Malwarebytes is a good clearer and AVG is there to save your ass if you download the wrong thing :p.

Bitfender has a free version that works great for preventing viruses and Malwarebytes is good if you want to remove something that's already installed.
