Hi<br>I joined this server like April 2014<br>I live in Singapore and I'm turning 15 this year.<br>I like forum spamming, and I can see people like Blueish like it too.<br>Recently, I have been lagging a lot. Idk what's wrong with my internet. Sorry to all people who I lag to death.<br>I'm bored, and AMAs for me never thrive. So why not just keep making them.<br>Ask

Like Blueish said, I really have nothing better to do on the internet, I have no life. I only watch some type of youtube videos and I get bored really easily. And also if I'm at home the entire day, my browser pretty much never closes. Even when I'm out I'm on the forums. so Idk, you could call it an addiction xD.

Ingi, and it's probably going to stay like that for a long time.<br><br>There are many good people good at the bow, most frequently I see you and Spookz.<br><br>Wearing a bikini in the North Pole is suicidal, a wooly coat in the Sahara desert can work if worn correctly.

Don't really know you well, but I remember listing a bunch of people asking you if you can kill them in a 1v1 in a pub game. Extremely good at PvP from what I've seen. Used to be toxic, especially after your Jr mod demotion. But you're a lot nicer now.<br><br>Singapore, it's in the thread xD

Didn't really like you at first, around the time you got unbanned, I thought you were some annoying guy who did something to get unbanned after evading so many times. But I realised you're a really nice guy, nice to talk to and hang out with. You're improving a lot as a player in terms of the competitive aspect.

Pizza and Spaghetti and many others I can't think of.<br><br>Lots of homework, maybe it seems a lot to me due to my poor time management. It's the rainy season right now, so rain everyday. Safe 24/7(questionable due to recent events). "Good" Education system, I'll leave you to decide whether it's good or not. Warm weather throughout the year. Train breakdowns/train delays (6min +- waiting time). Probably lots more to say but I don't know.<br><br>I know I always I say when I feel like it, but what I really mean is when I gain more confidence in myself.
