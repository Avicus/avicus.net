On Nexus or Nebula, you have to kill at least 5 people with your pointstreak shop.<br>But you can't knock him off the world or from a high place.<br>You can't use your sword AT ALL during the game. You can use your bow as much as you want though.<br>So pretty much when u MLG Shrek someone with the nebula shop the chat must say (person was slain by (person) using pointstreak shop.<br>Now go do it.<br>Edit: Oh yeah, i forgot to put that you must do this in one game, if the game ends the challenge resets.<br>Also, you can't glitch it like shooting with your bow then quickly changing it to the shop so the chat would say that you shot the person with your pointshop.

Bows make this eZ&nbsp;<br>1st kill- at monument on quintus, bowed down the person running at me, hit 3 times with shop.&nbsp;<br>2nd kill- also at the monument but this guy had full iron (and extreme nubbiness) and ran along my bridge got shot to about 3 hearts then I strafed round the centre box<br>3rd kill- same as the first - the same nub was back<br>4th kill- the iron guy came back - in leather though<br>5th kill- another player did the same thing and died the same way.<br><br>i recommend changing this and saying no to bows. It's also easy if you get dia/iron armour

I've done this before with the kit selector:D&nbsp;<br><br>It's some hard thing.<br><br>Easiest way is to challenge a friend to a special item duel.

Just shoot with a bow and change your current item to the shop before the fatal arrow hits them. Extremely easy in OiTN

That doesn't count because it's a glitch.
