Everyone does Wool Stalling, even me, but sometimes it's very annoying; -; , so, I think we should do some sort of thing to stop Wool Stalling. Oh wait, first we need to know what Wool Stalling is, It's when someone is in your wool room, then they come out, but when they see like 3 people rushing them, they come back to the wool room, &nbsp;An even more annoying&nbsp;example is when a Person comes out of the wool room and you fight them, and you got them to like 2 hp and then they go Usain bolt to the wool room and gapple. then they do it over and over till u run out of gapples&nbsp;;-;<br><br>Maybe make it so you can only go out of the wool room once or twice?&nbsp;<br>I mean, its a minor issue but is very annoying in Capture !

Gotta -1 my friend, this is a strategic thing. Would ruin the gamemode if we only allowed people in the woolroom once or twice.

As annoying as it may be for the defender and the person in the wool, I don't thunk it's a good idea.

No. By implementing this, instead of 'stalling the wool', the game would be stalled due to unnecessary pushes out of the wool.

No. I think there are two big reasons for why Wool Stalling should not be banned.<br><br><b>1.</b><b> Defenders outnumber Rushers.</b> This is straightforward; the wool is closer to the defending team's spawn than the rusher's team's spawn, so not only are there more people available to defend, they respawn somewhat close, so dying isn't too big of an issue. So already, rushers are disadvantaged. They need everything they can get, including stalling.<br><br><b>2. It's not as big of a problem as you think it is.</b> Fire your arrows; you can probably hit someone in the wool room by shooting. Because of this, you can't stall in a decent amount of maps, including:<br><ul><li><u>Revolution</u>. Probably the biggest one where it's not a problem, since you can hit the rusher pretty much no matter where they are inside the wool room.</li><li><u>Sunset Town</u>. 4 teams means that rushers will kill each other, almost eliminating the problem. Also, defending isn't good on this map anyways.<br></li><li><u>Green's Farms</u>. Large and long wings leading up to the wool rooms make stalling pointless, as no defender is going to come up there anyways.<br></li><li><u>Apache</u>. For the same reason as above.</li></ul>I'm sure there are more, but I can't think of anything else right now.<br><br>tl;dr: wool stalling is fine, it's not broken
