I've got an idea of how to derp bridge, but it requires to put my mouse in a box so my mouse can't move up or down, only left to right. Is this allowed?

YES! I just need to make the box and set my sensitivity. I'm going to have to learn how to do it really quick.

It was taken off the rules page as it was still possible to do, I think once it's fixed so it is impossible to do they'll add the rule back, not sure.

Well, we can't punish for it since it's a weird and unique way of bridging, it's a different form of way to bridge. It would be like how players use different types of mouses and pvp tricks, like jitter, butterfly, and tap clicking to pvp and we don't punish people that do jitter, butterfly, and tap.

Peter said it was taken off because it got fixed. Never got added back.<br>But from your thinking, if it's not on the rules it's not punishable, yet people still get punished for it.

Oh, I get it now.<br><br>In my opinion if you're using something like a box or whatever to help your mouse movements then you shouldn't be punished for it.<br><br>It literally makes no sense punishing someone for this... like come on.

One way to find out, is to try it out. I would actually be quite impressed if it got done successfully.

If the one press one click idea is the general rule is the roll clicking allowed?&nbsp;<br><br>It's where you press your finger at the top of the left click part and by increasing pressure gradually and moving down thr mouse you'll be clicking pretty fast, but tends to only work on certain mouses. Can't seem to find the video.

That's mentioned in the rule to be prohibited<br><br>EDIT: apparently it isn't, Posighdun apparently changed the rules me and the seniors agreed on for autoclicking. But no, drag clicking is prohibited.
