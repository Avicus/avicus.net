Post some times where you were so amazing it looked like you were cheating-/hacking<br><br><br>My Story: In quintus I was the final one with diamond gear. The other team had 5. I rushed in and killed all 5 on 7 hearts. I was so amazed it looked like regen. All I had was 2 gapples too.

one time, I fell into a hole in quintus, along with an iron guy, I was wearing full diamond, there were two other full diamonds, and one iron, I think they were lagging... o-o I strafed through their lines, and killed a diamond and an iron, and 1 other iron and two leathers who came in later, my teammate was killed, and I killed the other diamond, but at the same time, he killed me :( and... i lost my stuff :P

One time I was falling with an enemy side by side into the void but not so close I could hit him with my fist. I sniped him before he died from the void and he still had nearly full health when we started falling. He raged at me for having an aim bot but he would've died anyway xD

Well, you know the block glitch right? So i was on Senex, and bridging over to the monuments, but i was kinda lagging, and i could see the blocks disappearing, so i started bridging really fast and made it to the other side, but there were 2 guys from the other team shooting at me (they weren't very good), but to them it looked like i was flying :P<br><br>They called me a fly hacker soooo many times xP

It's happened to me once, too xP<br>It just has to do with ping and technically destroying the monument before you die but ti doesn't count because the information hasn't been sent to the server yet due to your high ms. You destroy the monument and between the time it takes to send that information, you die :3<br>I was rendezvous and I rushed right and covered myself in blocks. I was about 5 seconds to getting the monument when someone broke one of the blocks and decided to swing at me with their sword, so I just decided I should keep on mining and try to get lucky and not die. I then died then broke the monument :o

On quintus I rushed to the other side knocked 2 diamonds off. Went to top of spawn and individually went to each monument and destroyed it without dying in under 4 min. I then went onto Ternio and destroyed 3 monuments there

So I was playing overcast once avicus was down. There were these 2 guys making an underground tunnel full diamonds. I found lava and I also had a water bucket. I poured the water out and got the lava then went under. I got them both down 2 hearts using the lava (damage indicators) &nbsp;and 3 shot them. They called me hacks for spawning stuff in ;/
