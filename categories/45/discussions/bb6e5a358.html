My razer deathadder served me well and I used it for 3 years.... The scroll wheel broke so now I need a new mouse ;-;. Any suggestions? (anything below 50 dollars is my budget)<br><br>Thanks!

Before I got my Deathadder, I used SteelSeries 100. Its a decent mouse imo, its worth its price (Â£29.99 in the UK) so just do the conversion and you can get good cps with it.

Razer mamba te is a good choise. I bought it from bestbuy, Chicago and it was $80. Or I'd suggest deathadder which is $70

Do you want a mouse similarly designed to a deathadder?<br>How good do you want the mouse software to be? (e.g: razer synapse)<br>What games do you play?

Nagas are bad as fuck and have acceleration problems tho ;l<br><br>For anyone wondering, basically don't get anything with a laser sensor, or any Razer mouse except for the DeathAdder.

The only reasons I didn't get a Zowie over the Castor is because it didn't have RGB (bad reason ik but color coordination is a must for me because ocd) and because I heard it had weird buttons.

Castor would be second on my list but I prefer the EC shape to the castor.&nbsp;<br>The finalmouse ergo would be mine instantly if it had decent software.
