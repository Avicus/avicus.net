<b>Remember:</b> You can't write IPs in the forums nor the server, otherwise, you'll get banned. Just saying so when the IP comes out you don't put it here, try giving it out throught Skype. Still if It's Avicus related, Moderators won't tolerate the giveaway of other IPs.<br>Thanks ^-^

Sounds great, I'll contact you if I need a build server :P<br><br>But, as Juano said, you can't post an IP on here, unless you directly get permission from a senior staff member.
