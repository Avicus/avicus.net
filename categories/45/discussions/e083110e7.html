Uhh, like a week before in Istanbul an airport was attacked by some terrorist. I was there with my dad and we were about to fly to New York. Then we saw many people trying to get out of there. I was really scared honestly...<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGTaWmvKL6k" title="Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGTaWmvKL6k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGTaWmvKL6k</a>

When will terror stop? Never.<br><br>It's been here ever since people started civilisations and it never stopped. If Muslims are the "terrorists" now, the Christians were the terrorists during the Crusades. People get killed simply because they were in the wrong place, wrong time at this point.

Pessimism is the best way to go face this problem. The world should face this saying to themselves "the worst is still coming". That way we can hope for the best but prepare for the worst.<br><br>But I'm not that worried. Vladimir Putin saying stuff like...<br><br>"It's God's job to judge to terrorists, it's my job to send them to him". That statement was so badass O_o

On a serious note, terror will stop when:<br><br>We stop de-stablising the middle east<br>Stop supplying possible terrorist groups with weapons<br>When we support regimes like the Saudi's, yet condemn the Russians for similar laws such as Homosexuality<br><br>Let me just inform y'all on the formation of ISIS:<br><br>In the Syrian conflict there was three sides. The West supported the Rebels in fighting against the Syrian regime, which by the way was&nbsp;<b>very fucking good in comparison to Isreal, Palestine and Saudi Arabia</b>. We supplied the Rebels with weapons and training.&nbsp;<br><br>Long story short, the rebels fought the Kurds as well as the Syrian regime and later went on to form ISIS.&nbsp;<br><br>Oh and this isn't just a one time thing, we formed Al Queda to fight the Russian invasion of Afghanistan (which we later invaded, too (how hypocritical)) and we all know what happened to Al Queda.&nbsp;<br><br>And I will just leave this here:&nbsp;<br><br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif;  ">"Then, in 1988, George Bush Sr. was elected president.

Junr... You have to think. People who do this type of thing, ARE NOT rationally thinking. No matter how morbid and bad it may sound, it won't stop til all the white-hating blacks, and black-hating whites, and all the ISIS members, and all the bad people in the world, and (very unfortunately [unfortunate for some]) their children, are dead.<br><br>In other words, it'll never be better. All we can do is hope it just doesn't get any worse.

There is no end. Both war and terrorism are parts of the human lifestyle. We must not allow ourselves to be frightened by the thought of terrorism, if we are, the terrorists win. True peace does not exist, there is no such thing as a perfect world or Utopian society. This is our world we were given. We must make it liveable by modeling it to our own way, even if that way isn't the right way. Wars and conflicts have happened for thousands of years in all countries. No reason to run away from what cannot be avoided. It's better to face the problems face on as one whole nation of nations. We gotta work together, set aside our differences and beliefs to do what right for the future. It's very simple to believe that we can have a less violent more peaceful world but it takes more than one person to accomplish. You need everyone. Right now our major problem (as I see it) is terrorists organizations like IsIs. We don't need to be worry as much about stuff like Globel warming which is not a problem the human species is causing. IsIs won't stop until the world turns into the same terror loving sect of Islam that they worship. Taking weapons away from American (and other countries) citizens is not the problem. We don't need less guns, we need more guns in order to protect our western values from terrorism. I believe that people like Trump is what we need right now. Stoping unmoderated immigration is a big priority. Governments need to know who is in the country in order to protect their native citizens. Thats why I also think ending the E.U. is an important step. Change won't come quickly it'll take years or even decade's to make the world a better place. But right now, instead of being scared and pretending that everything is okay, we need to get to work. &nbsp;Every little thing helps...&nbsp;<br><br>Sorry for my rant. typed it on my phone s fornatng and spelling might be bad.<br><br></i>

Human nature. They'll always be murderers, extremists and the likes. It's just how humans are built. I'm sure certain terrorist groups will die down or be eliminated, but it doesn't change the fact that there are still humans out there wanting to harm others.

Certain sects of Islam take the violent parts of the Koran too seriously. IsIs needs to be stopped, I agree 100%, but it needs to be handled carefully. The E.U. needs to stop allowing questionable immigrants into countries. Then they can actually work together to end IsIs. Don't expect help from Canada and America though, both the leaders are basically Islamic sympathisers.

I was so scared. It's like, I was about to get on the plane. Kinda walking. Then I hear a sound that my ears couldn't hear exactly cuz it was a really loudly. Then everything got orange. After it, people are trying to escape... Then the second one. One of the terrorist was killing people randomly with his gun. Guess what children would feel... Guess what a woman lost his child feel.

Not all terrorists are cowards... some are just people pushed to the brink, brainwashed into believing nonsense, driven to do outrageous things.&nbsp;<br>People tend to do crazy things when they've been ostracised by society, pushed into alleyways and street corners, spit on and beaten everyday for being in a minority. Or they're seeing their way of life intruded upon and rapidly being eroded by outsiders who know nothing of their culture and beliefs. Or you see the very things you trust and believe in, your government and your community, suddenly turning their backs upon and leaving you to rot or systematically oppressing you. <br>These things drive someone to the edge, and on that edge they can be manipulated into fighting for a "cause", for "change". Some terrorists become terrorists because terror groups are the only ones who will take them in and have them belong. Some do it because they think they're somehow going to make the world a better place. Regardless, a good deal of them have been brainwashed or otherwise broken down.<br>The Boston Tea Party was terrorism, though not murderous. Some Kurdish factions are terrorists ( yet quite a few in the US support them). The Native Americans were terrorists.&nbsp;<br>The fact is many of these people are not cowards. They're a lot like us, except we pushed them towards the devil's claws instead of welcoming them into our arms.<br>They are just lost... God have mercy on their souls...

It's been said many times - not only here - that terrorism is something that will never "stop". Somewhere in the world there will always be some form of evil act, whether that's terrorism or not. Good thing is, the ground that ISIS have claimed is steadily decreased (they are losing battles over there) which is why they have retailiated with the bombings in the Istanbul Airport and Bangdad suicide acts.&nbsp;<br><br>That being said, in the 20th century no one really knew what terrorism was, because there was rarely any act of it. I asked my Grandma a few questions regarding this topic and she stated that she heard no terrorist act. Of course, that really only pertained to the "advanced" nations like the U.S and European Union. It was simply unheard of. That just goes to show how fucked up this generation can be - on so many levels.&nbsp;<br><br>I know you're scared, everyone is, because no where is safe anymore. You aren't sure what could happen in the coming minutes where you're standing. The Martin Place event was very close to my Dad's apartment, and it was literally the direction where I was to be heading after I got off the cruise that day. I think of terrorism as one more reason to spend time with your family, friends and loved ones as you never know what can happen - because after all - extremeism is unpredictable and cruel.

Certain sects of Islam take the violent parts of the Koran too seriously. IsIs needs to be stopped, I agree 100%, but it needs to be handled carefully. The E.U. needs to stop allowing questionable immigrants into countries. Then they can actually work together to end IsIs. Don't expect help from Canada and America though, both the leaders are basically Islamic sympathisers.

This is completely true. IS is far from anything islamic. They are not even slightly symbols of any part of the Qu'ran. They attack people during Ramadan, the month of peace and charity. They try to attack some of Islam's most holy sites and then continue to attack innocent people. Nowhere in the Qu'ran is it stated that we should murder innocent people or bomb places of worship. Just like in the bible it doesn't say that people should be hung for their colour.

Terrorism will most likely carry on but the truth is guys there is a bigger threat then ISIS now. We don't know their new name but they are worse than ISIS. The people that are doing this currently are the new version of ISIS and my dad was telling me that the cycle always happens. From Al Qaeda, Al Shabab, Boko Haram to ISIS and now from ISIS to something much more worse. All the terrorist organisations just keep evolving into new ones and become more of a threat to the world and that really concerns me...<br><br>Also it's really sad what happening in Iraq there was a big explosion 2 days prior to Eid in a big shopping centre in Baghdad and 250 people were killed. One of them was a man who had just graduated in dentistry by doing his Masters' degree and he opened up a dentist practice. Sadly, when he was killed his wife gave birth to their baby boy 2 days after on Eid :/. It was at like 1am because it's during the time when you can eat and go shop + these guys didn't even know they just wanted to have fun and then they get killed by a massive explosion so sad.

If we are talking about IS, their main targets are muslims. So I am not sure about what you are arguing. Moreover, the arguments you are making are the same ones people who are islamophobic&nbsp;make. I mean no offense in saying this; however, a lot&nbsp;of the points you are making are the same ones that all people make without understanding the problem. IS may base their teachings off of ancient ideals, but they are ancient. They were relevant during their time and as a result were norms. However, in modern time it is not acceptable. Henceforth, when a terrorist group with no affiliation to Islam decides to pick up this ancient ideal it is not Islam's fault.

Not all terrorists are cowards... some are just people pushed to the brink, brainwashed into believing nonsense, driven to do outrageous things.&nbsp;<br>People tend to do crazy things when they've been ostracised by society, pushed into alleyways and street corners, spit on and beaten everyday for being in a minority. Or they're seeing their way of life intruded upon and rapidly being eroded by outsiders who know nothing of their culture and beliefs. Or you see the very things you trust and believe in, your government and your community, suddenly turning their backs upon and leaving you to rot or systematically oppressing you. <br>These things drive someone to the edge, and on that edge they can be manipulated into fighting for a "cause", for "change". Some terrorists become terrorists because terror groups are the only ones who will take them in and have them belong. Some do it because they think they're somehow going to make the world a better place. Regardless, a good deal of them have been brainwashed or otherwise broken down.<br>The Boston Tea Party was terrorism, though not murderous.

Brainwashed or not, only a coward attacks children, simply because that child is of a different faith or is homosexual. There is no excuse for killing an innocent child, and the Daesh members who torture these children should pay for that dearly. Their cowardice is even more obvious when you consider that Daesh run from trained soldiers and attack civilians.&nbsp;<br><br>The difference between the Boston Tea Party and the current attacks is that these ones are intended to kill. If these terrorists wanted change, they should join pressure groups that campaign for change.<br><br>The sad thing is that these people aren't being ostracised by society. Rather, they isolate themselves. They refuse to seek help or confront people with their views, and that to me is no excuse for the horrific acts that they commit daily.<br><br>I don't believe that these terrorists are lost. Light exists in the darkest recesses, you just have to search for it. If you don't, &nbsp;well, you're at fault.

Do Christians and Jews not base their teachings off of Moses? Compare the amount of Judeo-Christian terror attacks to the Islamic ones. It's not the teachings that are to blame, otherwise there would be just as many Christian terror attacks as Islamic ones, considering that the Torah/Bible contains teachings that are easily as violent. People who try to claim that Islam is a violent religion by citing small verses from the Qur'an are (no offence intended) either narrow-minded or use Google to search up incriminating sections from the Qur'an, without considering the possibility that many of these quotes are inspired by the Torah and Bible.

Brainwashed or not, only a coward attacks children, simply because that child is of a different faith or is homosexual. There is no excuse for killing an innocent child, and the Daesh members who torture these children should pay for that dearly. Their cowardice is even more obvious when you consider that Daesh run from trained soldiers and attack civilians.&nbsp;<br><br>The difference between the Boston Tea Party and the current attacks is that these ones are intended to kill. If these terrorists wanted change, they should join pressure groups that campaign for change.<br><br>The sad thing is that these people aren't being ostracised by society. Rather, they isolate themselves. They refuse to seek help or confront people with their views, and that to me is no excuse for the horrific acts that they commit daily.<br><br>I don't believe that these terrorists are lost.

There are monsters amongst them, that is true. However, child soldiers attack other children because they are scared, and many do end up struggling with what they have done and coming to terms with what they did, be it in Africa or Asia or Latin America. Others, they have no remorse, but those are not who I am talking about.&nbsp;<br><br>Daesh does not run from trained soldiers to attack civilians. I do not know how you came about with that line of thinking. They are a very well armed military force, and are currently fighting the Iraqi Army, the Syrian Army, Russian Troops, and Libyan government militias, just to name a few. It's quite scary.&nbsp;<br><br>While the Boston Tea Party was not intended to kill, the Sons of Liberty rioted and tarred and feathered tax collectors, just to name a few things. While killing was not part of their agenda, they were very violent and radical. They were mere steps from becoming killers, similar to Shay's rebellion.&nbsp;<br><br>Also, how can you join pressure groups for change when you aren't even taken seriously? When you feel that things aren't going to change within your lifetime, and that the system is actively pushing you down no matter what. Similar thoughts led to a lot of the violence caused by black separatists during the civil rights movement as well as the domestic terrorism done by groups such as the KKK during reconstruction.&nbsp;<br><br>They don't refuse to seek help, but rather the only ones who would "Help" are these radical groups. Many groups are actively being ostracised by society, they are not isolating themselves. The Tamil Tigers, despite doing atrocities of the worst kind in their terror campaign, were being put down by the majority Sinhalese government. Hell, hate towards muslims is still very much a problem, though perhaps not one seen daily by you and I, but one very present nonetheless.&nbsp;<br><br>I am not saying all terrorists are lost. I am not denying the existence of evil men and evil organisations. But not everyone in these organisations is as evil as you make them out to be. If their only light came from a tiny LED bulb and from a bonfire, many are going to head straight toward the bonfire, even if it burns them. They are being led astray and harming themselves and many other people in their pursuit of a "righteous cause".<br><br>It's happened so many times in history to good people, and this time is no exception. Not everything can be so black and white, split into good and evil, unfortunately. Humans are flawed, and everything falls within a spectrum.

Do Christians and Jews not base their teachings off of Moses? Compare the amount of Judeo-Christian terror attacks to the Islamic ones. It's not the teachings that are to blame, otherwise there would be just as many Christian terror attacks as Islamic ones, considering that the Torah/Bible contains teachings that are easily as violent. People who try to claim that Islam is a violent religion by citing small verses from the Qur'an are (no offence intended) either narrow-minded or use Google to search up incriminating sections from the Qur'an, without considering the possibility that many of these quotes are inspired by the Torah and Bible.

It's all based on how the teachers in the religions (priests, imams, rabbis, etc.) explain it.&nbsp;<b></b>I could read the Bible, Quran or Torah and come out with a completely different view then what the priest taught me. All about each person's interpretation of the texts in my opinion.&nbsp;<br><br>And yeah, Christianity came from Judaism so it uses some of the teachings found in the Torah (Old Testament).

Nah thats not true, look up how many Imam's have condemned their actions. Also Pakistan's army has been engaged with the Taliban for the past few years. Recently they have upped the ante as well. I am not going to admit that its Islam's problem as groups like this are not created by Islam. For example the Taliban is the US' mistakes backfiring. Same with Al-Qaeda all of these problems have been created by western powers and in return have created huge problems for the people who live in these regions.

I have read parts of the Quran before. But I haven't heard the use of the word hadith. I understand a bit but not all which is why I'm trying to learn more... the Quran is complicated read like the Bible and the Torah different people find different things from the same text.<br><br>your other post. I'm allowed to have a different opinion on the topic since I'm living on the other side of the world. If you have a link to where I can find streams I'll gladly watch it.

You probably read parts of the Quran (translated in the&nbsp;worst manner)&nbsp;placed out of context by Islam skeptics.<br><br>So these Hadiths (saying of Muhammed) are made 250 years after the Death of Muhammed, the Quran can be translated in various ways in Arabic. The (verses of) translations you read are translated in a manner so they go in line with the Hadith but muslims don't know that the names of Allah are written in the Quran so we can translate/interpret the Quran in Allah's way.<br><br><a href="http://www.quran411.com/99-names-of-allah.asp" title="Link: http://www.quran411.com/99-names-of-allah.asp">http://www.quran411.com/99-names-of-allah.asp</a><br>If you translate the Quran as Allah wanted us to translate it, you have found the real meaning of the Quran. And that meaning only supports self defence.<br><br>You've to know everything about a subject before discussing it. If you don't know what Hadiths are you don't know what Islam today is. Al Jazeera has youtube now I think.

If knowing what we are talking about calls for a title then I guess you could say we are "politically smart". You know that gut feeling of hate and disgust you get when I talk about the USA? Thats how we feel when people talk about our religion wrongly. When I say the US, of course I do not mean the people. I have a lot of American friends. Some of them are the best people I have ever met. The point is, the US is the main cause of most of the destabilization of the east.

I do pity the children who are forced to fight, but that's just further proof of their cowardice. They're using children to fight their wars, because they're afraid to meet their enemies on the battlefield.<br><br>Not to be rude to the Kurdish forces, but just like Daesh, they're primarily comprised of volunteers who have little to no military training. Considering that these are the only forces that were until recently being pushed back by Daesh, their military prowess isn't that notable.<br><br>The key thing about the BTP is that they didn't become killers. They also attacked people who at the time were known to threaten people if they couldn't afford to pay. Now, compare that victims with civilans like Alan Henning, who went out there intending to provide humanitarian aid to the people of Syria, yet was seized and beheaded by animals.<br><br>Let's put into the perspective of everyday people, such as you and I. I often feel like the govenment doesn't take my complaints or the wishes of the people seriously. So what do I do? I keep pushing for change. I keep writing letters, sending emails and following the news. Do I join a terrorist group that intends to wipe out "heretics" and "infidels"? No! There are so many other courses of action that these terrorists could take, yet they refuse to do so. Perhaps some have attempted this before turning to terrorist groups, but can you really claim that this is the case with most of them?&nbsp;<br><br>Frankly, if terrorists try to justify murdering innocent men, women and children, then they're truly lost. I doubt that they can be helped by this point, because they've refused to look for the light and the realisation of what they've done, whether it is because of guilt or brainwashing.<br><br>I don't view Daesh as black and white. Child soldiers? Innocent. Children being forced to marry and have children? Completely despicable. People killing children, however? Brainwashing or not, that is vile and inexcusable.
