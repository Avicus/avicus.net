Thank you to DoctaPop for giving me the motivation to make this post.&nbsp;<br><br>Hello, I've decided to make a post explaining a little bit about my life and my condition. You will get the answers for: "How is he online all the time" , "Hes homeschooled I think". I'll take it from the beginning so it won't be that hard to follow. When I was in 4th grade &nbsp;I started to develop some sort of fear for going to school. Not because of bullying cause that actually never has happened to me and never will. But actually just afraid of what people might think of you. &nbsp;I mean I got up in the morning and though, "but they will think I'm stupid or ugly or something". Even though that would would not happen. The fear was still there and it prevented me from going to school occasionally. In 5th grade it just got worse I'd miss up to 2 - 3 days per week. And at this time I was taking gymnastics 21 hours a week. So that stress building up with anxiety eventually led to depression. After that year I was diagnosed with Autism. Most people know what that is some maybe not but I'm not going to go into detail. Most people use jokes about it and at the same tme know nothing abiht this sydrome. I was diagnosed with a typical aitism meaning that my aitism was very high. Basically the lower the harder and.higher you have more knowledge and are able to do more. According to them... But anyways. After 5th grade I started taking therapy twice a week. I went to multiple different places and camp type things. I had changed school by now and was going in 6th grade. At first it was going fine then 3 months later, boom. Down I go. I started constantly saying I hate my life and I wanted to die. This went on for the rest of 6th grade and eventually I did not go to school for a whole semester. And the same time I had issues at home and gymnastics to worry about. This unfortunetly led up to multiple talks of committing &nbsp;suicide, and 2 suicide attempts. By then I had been taking an antin depression pill for 1 year. Yet it was still there. I had so much crap going on in my life I did not know what to do with my self. I easily got angry at my family and constantly swearing at them I was violent and sad. When I gt angry I used to climb up onto ourb house and sit there. I had the police come to get me down once not due to the fact that I didn't know how to get down but that I broken two windows at my house. My dad did not know what to do at this point. So the only choice was to call. Back to school, I never knew how to make friends hown to fit in and how to addapt. I never hung out with anyone after school and I never was in contact. I was alone and had nothing but my friends at gymnastics. And at this time I was close to quitting the sport. After becoming second in the second highest class/level in my country.. The sport just got to hard. It helped me cause it diverted lots of my anger into concentration and determenation. It helped me with my depression so after I quit I was so depressed that I just didn't know anymore. I'd randomly wake up at nigbt and start crying for no reason. One thing that helped me with my depression the most were my cats. They made feel good aboht my self and above all calm and relaxed. So by now I have missed a whole year of school. And half of that year I started playing Avicus again. At that time I was either 12 or 13. After summer break 2014 I had changed to another achool by now a private school with 7 students and 4 teachers. All of these students having equal issues of there own. So we arranged something with one of the teachers that he would come home to me and teach me. He said you don't even have to think aboht going to school. Eventually we made progress and started to go 1 day a week 2 days a week and so on. So currently I go to school 4 days a week from 8:30 - around 2:30 - 3:30.. Never felt so &nbsp;good about my self in a long time. so for once I''m doing Preety good.<br><br><br><br>Avicus: I was once perm banned on MC zone and did not get unbanned untill that start of Avicus. I became a regular and like the server a lot Allthough I had only made a couple of friends. It was the best feeling I have ever had IronSoldier2000 and buster_U were one of my first friends to ever have on Avicus. And believe it or not I don't know if I convinced them to join TS or if they convinced me or we just all convinced each otber. During this time I was going through my depression stage and Avicus really helped me . Since it was the only place I actually have any friends. 3 months or so later. I'm 10th on the all time leaderboards, and known player by quite a lot of people. Then I decided to apply for staff. And here I am now. Avicus has made a big impact on my life and I want to thanks everyone in the community for there friendship. At some times it's all I had to hold on to. And now I'm going 4 days a week playing MC with mates and buying shit from IKEA.&nbsp;<br><br>So so yeah that's that you don't have to read this all if you don't want to. Just wanted to explain. I'm not the best with words either and I hope that all of your questions have been answered. If you do have any important ones you can ask me and I'll happily try and answer them the best way I can.<br><br><br>I really love you guys and thank you for everything.

Depression can hit anyone, but people with depression are typically more creative, spontaneous (which apparently you are), and more likely to grow up to be famous!<br><br>You are a perfect example of showing autism can be a blessing.<br><br>Keep it up man!

<u></u>gl m8. Been through some of the same experiences, but I've never been really depressed, but have seen others that have been. It's never easy. Autism is also very misunderstood and the insane ignorance surrounding it stuns me. People use "Autistic" as an insult for retardation? Actually, I did a bit of research on it, and some of the smartest people to live are actually Autistic, including Albert Einstein and Isaac Newton. Beethoven as well I believe. Actually studies show that Autistic people generally have above-average IQs. So quite the opposite of what it's used as an insult to represent. OK so now that that that mini-rant is over...<br><br>Keep your head up and always think of your friends. I've had some difficulties as well, nothing as bad, but I've got through them, and what I've truly learned, as cliché as it sounds, what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. And if you fall, all your friends here got your back. Know I will too, as long as there's no disrespect between us or anything I got you, regardless of how well I know you.&nbsp;<br><br>There's always a reason to live, remember that.

I never knew, I'm so sorry. People were saying you were diagnosed with autism and I thought they were joking so even I got mad. I feel bad for saying things like "Are you autistic?" and stuff like that. I've stopped making jokes related to down syndrome and autism. I'm so sorry I never knew, I feel like such a bully :(&nbsp;<br><br>Also I'm really sorry for calling you things like "no-lifer" in the past. Sorry Sunny and I hope you forgive me :(

Being social on the Internet is much easier for me the being social in real life. For instance I really hate party's and stuff like that.

I'm sorry for you Sunny. However, we should all learn to be more social. You can't live a life without social skills forever.

I know. And that's what I have been working on for the past 2 years with my therapist.

It was probably extremely hard to talk about this...<br><br>but thanks for making this thread and explaning your condition to us so precisely.<br><br>I really do wish you the best with your problem and I hope that, in the future, once you get a job, you will be able to go for anything and will be allowed to. You've proven yourself to be an excellent mod even if you have this ''condition''. <br><br>In no way am I going to look at you differently after reading this thread. You're an amazing person and always will be.

Sunny.<br><br>To be honest, I'm really glad that you didn't die from trying to commit suicide - you are actually one of the bubbliest, friendliest people I have ever met, to be honest. You are always caring, and you are funny on Avicus, even if you do ignore us (:D) but I'm really glad that you found this great server to brighten up your life with and you have been a great leader for us - you have been one of the yardsticks on McZone and Avicus, one of the best.<br><br>Don't think that having autism will effect you - think positive about life, we all have our bad moments, even if it doesn't stretch to the extents you have done. Autism does not mean that you cannot still do great in life - work hard, and you will earn a good education and will be successful in life, with money, a partner and maybe even children - make friends, ignore the haters, Sunny.<br><br>Thanks for writing this, because it has shown us that we must understand how your life has been and we must respect that. Carry on with what your doing Sunny, you're doing great, I promise, and everyone on Avicus is backing you up.<br><br>Thanks sunrise, it's been great with you so far, I hope you stay for a long time.<br><br>&lt;3

I'm here for you dude. At least you never got bullied... IRL friends... Yeah, stick to your online friends IMO, most of them have never caused anything except for trouble for me. But, if you do, try and befriend girls first. That's what I did... Never regretted that. They will normally be sympathetic, and help you. They are also very nice... That's just my input though. Glad you're getting better. ^-^
