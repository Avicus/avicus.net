<b></b>Never done one of these before, so why not?&nbsp;I've been playing Minecraft since 2011. I'm currently a High School Senior, and I'm 17.

You guys never responded to my messages over skype when I wanted to trial, even after you had requested me to add you. You guys just kept on ignoring me. That pissed me off to the brim and I still carry a deep hatred for you guys. Happy I joined BC over Apollo

Well, you insulted me when I left your team, calling me bad, etc.. even though you desperately wanted me to join before that, also you seem pretty immature. One word to describe you would be Toxic.

Before the update I used the A4 and straight after the update i switched to A1 lmfao. The reason I didn't use it before is because bullets went to fast, now it's so much more controlled.

At first I thought the a1 was horrible after the update, but I was wrong about it. And yeah, like you said it's better to control it and my ammo clip isn't 3/4 empty after killing 1 or 2 people.

I don't recall saying you were bad? I insulted you while you were in the team one time, which I then told you, that I tend to poke fun in a rude way and that if you werent ok with it I would try to not specifcally target you, not when you were out of the team? Also desperate? How so?
