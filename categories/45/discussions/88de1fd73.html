Hey guys!&nbsp;<br>So I used to be a frequent player on Avicus back about half a year ago. Now that I have just joined I am bringing back "Battle of the Crafters" This was a fan fiction I wrote about 1 year ago, and it was very popular along with Voltdrive's fan fiction series. Unfortunately, this inspired a TON of other fan fictions, some good, some… meh. But, I think since this has died down, I can start up again. I don't think many of you will remember my fan fiction because it was so long ago and so many veterans have left, but I know a few will remember :) <br>This is just a notification post, and I will be writing the next episode and creating the official thread tomorrow if I can. For now, if you want to read the first few episodes, check out the fan fiction's website right here:&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://battleofthecrafters.weebly.com">http://battleofthecrafters.weebly.com</a><br><br>Let me know what you think of it!<br>&lt;3
