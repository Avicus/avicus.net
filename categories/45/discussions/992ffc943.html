<a href="http://www.rachel-beckwith.org/">http://www.rachel-beckwith.org/</a><br>This happened 3 - 4 years ago but really touched me inside.<br><br>Rachel Beckwith was a girl with a truly inspiring dream. She wanted to raise enough money for those in need. She managed to raise $220 but wanted to raise $300. Tragically, one month later, she was killed in a vehicle pile up. After hearing about this, people all over this world began to donate and over $1 million was raised. But what made me really emotional and somewhat angry was that&nbsp;I realised that it took the death of one girl to help donate for a good cause. People shouldn't have to let it go to the point of death to donate. It just shows selfishness in a way. People should donate regardless and I'm not saying everyone is like that but some people are and that needs to change. Rachel, we want you to know that you were an amazing girl who everyone appreciates and looks up to. It is people like you that truly help the world and we will be eternally grateful. Rest in peace Rachel, your actions shall never be forgotten. :(<br><br><br><div><a href="http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nC_vXAF-pBM">http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nC_vXAF-pBM</a>&nbsp;<br></div><div><br></div>
