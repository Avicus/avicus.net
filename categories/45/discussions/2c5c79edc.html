Its just going to make finding a name harder... Majority of the names won't be used again. People will be changing their names over and over again. Especially creative servers where people do RolePlay. Its a waste of names used for other Minecraft players. Soon unique names like Vapour_ or Keiji_ are gone. Its should be one name change only and if you want more you pay or win them in competitions hosted by other servers. Hopefully you can understand.

There has been a forum topic like this before, but I can't find it. Anyways I don't think creating a second topic about that isn't necessary, just a bump on the old one, since you can bump topics as long as you are contributing to the forum topic.

Snow you might want to add the glitch with optifine capes. You need to transfer them to another account or they will be lost forever.

Never mind the glitch I said above. You just have to log into your donation email rather than your minecraft email, and you should be able to switch capes after logging in.
