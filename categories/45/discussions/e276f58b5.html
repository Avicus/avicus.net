I need some recording software. My Action trial ran out, and Fraps screws up my dpi. Any suggestions for recording software?&nbsp;<br><br>If someone can get me a working Action crack or another software besides fraps that is good for recording, I can either teach you a bit on how to PvP, or another thing we can discuss over Skype, which I'll give out if needed.&nbsp;<br><br>Also, Idk what to upload on my channel due to recent lag. I was thinking of making a "Laggy PvP" vid or recording some Osu! or OCN for my channel. Any suggestions? As long as it's 60fps I'm fine.

Does OBS record at 60 fps? I'm looking for a program which records at 60 fps and into mp4 format. AVI takes up far too much space.

I don't want to use fraps cuz it screws up my dpi and aim with it. That's the issue. I get no lag recording with it, but the aim screwing up is kinda bad for a PvP channel, as the most important part of PvP is aim.&nbsp;<br><br>Ty for the suggestion though :)

I changes it a little and it makes it so that the movement of my mouse is choppy, so instead of getting a smooth turn, ill get one chopped into several short bursts of movement, which is pretty stupid =_=.

@Pavlo OBS is pretty powerful. I prefer <b>QuickTimePlayer&nbsp;</b>1 problem... It is for OS X i don't know if you play on windows, Linux or Apple

bumping up. Camtasia wont record in full screen and f11 modes. OBS recordings are coming out quite low quality and grainy.

I use the full version of action. I see you took it up as a possibility, it is really worth the price. All the options formats and even the streaming is awesome. Only if I had internet powerful enough to use it :c
