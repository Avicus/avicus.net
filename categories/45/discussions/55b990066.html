<b>Hello there,</b><b><br></b>I have decided to see what the Avicus community thinks about this:<br>I've thought about making a new Avicus clan instead of the old one. This clan can have anyone that is in the Avicus community.&nbsp;<br>The clan name would be chosen from which ever team wins the current Avicus Tournament that is lead by Pelpelajax.<br>The clan will have a temporary username for now until a new one is made for the new clan name. It will be called Avicus and will be made in a few hours.<br><br><b><u>Rules:<br></u></b>1) Be respectful to all members and give a warm welcome to them or just say hello.<br>2) Don't be mean to them and say "Your base is terrible", however you can give tips on how to make it better.<br>3) Don't argue with each other.<br>4) Have fun and help each other :)<br>5) This one is for staff members: Don't talk about important staff things, however all players can still talk about general Avicus stuff.<br><br><b><u>Clan Leader:<br></u></b>It will be myself if everyone else agrees (it is a community clan so we have to have everyones' opinions) or we will do a poll vote.... put your username down below if you'd like to be in the poll.... but remember that it could be me running it if we don't do the poll.<br><br>I will be looking forward to seeing your responses, it doesn't matter if you don't agree with this.... just say.<br><br>Kind Regards,<br>Aqoi.

As I said, we would like everyones' opinions on if they agree with having the person as leader. Also if you have a higher town hall, you would have more experience as you would have played longer.

So that no one else argues with leadership, I will edit the post to say that I will run the clan or there will a poll.

I agree with Stormer_, you can have a really rushed town hall with a garbage base (no offence) which concludes that you have no experience. I'm not saying this is true for everyone as majority of the people I've seen have well maxed out bases.

When you download it, there's a tutorial explaining everything on how to play and it is difficult to get in a clan at the start since you don't have much money at the beginning, but you'll eventually have to buy this thing called a "Clan Castle" and you can join a clan after you buy it :).

So... you'll rather listen to other people and not listen to me, though we've voiced out the same opinions.<br><br>anyways, Tynvale has already created a Clash of Clans clan, called "Avicus". It isn't full, so instead of creating another, why not join his?
