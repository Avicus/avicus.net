Tell me :) I have it and I just saw I have $3.00 on my paypal account and was wondering if its worth paying $0.99 for 3 months of premium?<br>Thanks for giving your opinion! :)

Yes, you can get thousands of songs for a low price. To get that on Itunes you would have to pay thousands/hundreds of dollars. The one downside is that spotify might not have the song you're looking for.

I'm going to partially disagree with this, as I just&nbsp;I just canceled premium for a couple of reasons.<br>1) Spotify doesn't show small artists, but if you only listen to mainstream stuff it shouldn't be a problem.<br>2) Syncing local files with mobile devices can be annoying (ie: tracks that don't show up on spotify and are download as local mp3s)<br>However it is quite convienient and you don't have to listen to cheesy music followed by ads praising the benefits of premium after each track, so yes, get it if you want. However most people download their music for free nowadays.

<span style="color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; ">I think it is! Most artists are on there. Premium lets you listen offline, which is my favorite, and without ads. On a mobile device, you can skip unlimited songs and choose what song plays. Compared to their usual price for premium, 99 cents is a good deal for 3 months. Just make sure to cancel your subscription before the 3rd month is up because they'll continue to charge you the regular price.</span>

If you don't want to spend a penny, find the youtube link to the song, convert it to an mp3 file, and save it to your device of choice.

I really like Spotify, I've gotten to listen to artists I couldn't before because I simply couldn't afford to spend that much money. It's definitely worth it :)

No because I just use iTunes and I download my songs from YouTube using the mp3 converter and drag my files into my iTunes and BAM! It's free music :P
