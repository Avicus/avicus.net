Hola, long time no see. o/<br><br>So, question. How did Fluenza reach Administrator so quickly? I mean, props to him for getting the rank, he definitely deserved it. But I was told when I retired, that if I wanted to return as an Administrator; I would have to start off as a Junior Moderator and work my way all the way back up. Not sure if this was the case, but I'm just curious if that same concept applied to Fluenza as well in making it all the way back up in such a short amount of time. And by all means, he did deserve the rank. He always has, I'm not trashing on Fluenza in any way, shape or form. He was actually a very good friend of mine before I left the Avicus community, and I still consider him a long time pal. Again, re-stating myself, I was just wondering if, let's say... The rule changed? Or did he legitimately went through every individual rank to get there?<br><br>Thanks and have a wonderful evening, (If you live in EST)<br><br>Regards, -Jake

There was a rule regarding former admins, I'm not sure you knew about it though.

Ah, alright. Thanks Snowy &lt;3 And everyone else that responded to this thread. If only this rule had changed a few months earlier! xD It's alright though. I made the decision to terminate all of my accounts so I wasn't tempted to come back online. Anyways, congratulations to you Joel. I miss you buddy! Hope to get in touch once again.
