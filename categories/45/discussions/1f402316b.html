The order you should try if a step fails:<br>1. Try getting the school first and if that fails file a police report.<br>2. If that fails get your brother to scare them enough to stop.<br>3. You don't have much choice left, try fighting back (no weapons though, if you lose it your probably foked), if you lose the fight rip

I bet it will fizzle down after a month's time, but if not, I'd go with the 3rd option. First is sort of hard, and second sounds unreliable. I doubt your brother will be with you ALL THE TIME to protect you.

Third option all the way.<br><br>My best friend used to get bullied in a year ago, and I broke the Bully's nose, trust me, it's not a good path to follow.<br>He's getting bullied by this other kid, and this time I broke his nose &amp; told the Police. He's now arrested.

What you did first was the right thing. But the only way you can end this for good is to confront her. Im not saying beat her up, but do something about it. I recommend trying to talk to her, and if she gets physical, you can too and if a teacher catches you, tell them the truth.

As long as you don't die it's oke ;).<br>thebigballsoption: If he comes just stand calm and tell him to hit you if he wants to do that. Tell him that you don't want to hit him and that if he wants to hit you for a small thing like saying the word bitch he can hit you. If everyone is watching he won't hit someone who just keeps his arms on his back cause that is the most brutal thing to do (im assuming he is popular and doesnt want to look like a total dick to everyone). If he does hit you just fall down, accept the pain and know that he is gonna get in trouble for that and looses his friends. After a few days in the worst case senario you wont feel it anymore and he is probably kicked from school or has detention. If this is too much of a risk I would suggest option 3.

That's not good. Letting anger control you like that is dangerous.<br><br>Even though I take Karate classes, and I'm confident with my fighting capabilities, I always try avoid situations that involve fighting. More often than not, people who are inexperienced with fighting cause serious injuries to themselves or others, even if all they are trying to do is knock someone out.

Do not let your anger control you. Option Three, definitely, do not try to harm the person, or anyway abusing them, even passive aggression could be used on yourself if you find yourself in a problem. Just call the Childlines or something similar or go to the teachers and report to them. Remember, anger is not the path, anger will lead you into the path of danger. If you do get in a fight, just tell him you won't hit him and then walk away. Simple as.

PLEASE, get adults involved. If you fight or take wrong action things can backfire, I heard MANY Horror stories of kids who got bullied and became paralyzed(from being pushed down stairs) or died because they were chased and got hit by a car, PLEASE for your girl and yourself/the sake of everyone get adults involved because I don't want to see ANYONE in serious danger and then ending up in the paper/internet. That girl who is bullying your girl has &nbsp;problems and she's only going to make more and drag people down with her but if you become the bigger person she will not dare bother anyone, report her to an adult.

This may seem really weird, but it will really mess up the bully's mind. Accept the fight, but fight naked. Nobody wants to get in a fight with a naked person. Jump around and walk up to the bully and he'll start to back away. He'll be too grossed out to fight you and there would be a sense of awkwardness for him to fight you. If you are doing this with your brother, then it'll be even more awkward for the bullies.
