So, I've just hit my 2 year mark. I first joined Avicus just like 2 days before Mc Zone. The first gamemode I played was Walls (I have a walls fetish). I was banned for a year and finnaly got unbanned by Para (which I cant thank him enough) and have changed my act a bit and re-joined the community. So since it's been 2 years of Avicus why not have an AMA!<br><br>(I will answer all questions and any questions at all)

@Tazz, you're a pretty chill guy to hang out with. We don't talk a lot because of timezones but other then that you're pretty cool!<br><br>@DaFrozenSavage,<br><br>-Honestly, I don't know. It took me like 3 days of talking and debating to get unbanned so I guess. It was the mods vote anyways so if they think I should have I guess I deserved it.<br>-Nebula, walls has just gotten to plain for me<br>-Good, Competitive Nebula has made the game more interesting for me and makes me want to play more.<br>-Why not?<br>-Pretty chill guy, lags a lot, doesn't talk, and possibly the coolest lagger I've ever met :P<br><br><br>@Symbolism&nbsp;<br><br>Uhh, during a skype call with Para and Eric.
