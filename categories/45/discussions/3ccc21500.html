I have this constant humming noise in the background of my computer and I don't think it is natural. Could somebody please explain to me how I could fix this? Thanks

I have the same problem to. Usually if you lower the volume, the sound will go away. I believe it may be due to a cheap sound card but don't quote me on that.

Probably something to do with the soundcard.

Alright, a bit of tech time with Tails.<br><br><br>Inside your computer, there is a lot of electrical business happening in there, and that produces a lot of noise... Now, your sound card, is usually placed away from the CPU, GPU and all that other stuff to prevent this sound from being picked up, and sent to your ears, which produce that buzzing sound.<br><br>If you're computer is custom built, move that sound card. It can also be damage to the ports, or anything. But these are a few suggestions of what is wrong with your computer.

Send it to dell. Is it a laptop or Desktop.<br><br>If it's a laptop it's probably soldered to the motherboard.

Its normal for most laptops and even desktops. Any type of noise is fine if its not affecting performance or your temperatures, which you can check by installing:&nbsp;<a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/24075/Intel-Extreme-Tuning-Utility-Intel-XTU-">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/24075/Intel-Extreme-Tuning-Utility-Intel-XTU-</a><br>&nbsp;<br>EDIT: Nvm, you're saying you hear it in your headphones? If so, then it is the electrical current. I wouldn't worry about it too much if it's not that buggy.
