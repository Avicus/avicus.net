<span>Thanks to Midnight for the idea and the format!<br><br>Welcome back to another Plug.DJ session. This week's theme will be "<b>Pop.</b>"<br><br><b>When is it?<br></b><b>EST: </b>7:00 PM<br><b>PST: </b>4:00 PM<br><b><br></b><i>There is no specific end time.</i><b><br><br>I have a profile. Now what?<br></b>You can start a pre-party, maybe tell a few friends to come along and have a good time!<br>Remember that the link is:<br></span><a href="https://plug.dj/avicus" rel="nofollow">https://plug.dj/avicus</a><br><span><b><br><br>I don't&nbsp;have an account :c<br></b>If this is your first time ever using plug.dj, you will need to sign up. Go to their page here:<b><br></b><br><a href="https://plug.dj/dashboard" rel="nofollow">https://plug.dj/dashboard</a><br><br>Follow the instructions to create a profile.<br>Keep in mind that once you create a username, you cannot change it in the future, so do not impersonate others.<br><br></span><span><a href="https://plug.dj/avicus" rel="nofollow">https://plug.dj/avicus</a><br></span><br>Once
 you "plug" into the hangout (haha), create a playlist of songs by 
searching up your favourites on YouTube, and then join the wait list! 
Once it's your turn to DJ, everyone in the hangout can dance, listen, 
and have a good time to your song!<br><br><span><b>Cool. Any rules?<br></b>Basic&nbsp;behaviour
 rules apply. Don't be rude to others in chat, try to limit the amount 
of inappropriate language you use in the chat. Any person found doing 
this will receive a warning.<br><br>Basic video rules apply. Please do 
not play any videos that may contain 
gory/sexual/racist/homophobic/violent content. Any person found 
playing&nbsp;such content will receive a warning, followed by a ban.<br><br>Have fun!</span>

Are these events limited to these styles, or are they solely base off of pop, and allow other music?

Pop music is the theme, you are allowed to play any type of music as long as you don't break the PlugDJ rules.
