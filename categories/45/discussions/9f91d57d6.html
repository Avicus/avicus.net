Yeah... no. "After all, life is no more than a perpetual alternation between the wretchedness of reality and evanescent illusions of joy, never getting better. People, simple and spontaneous, will not even turn around or glance at you when you are lonely and gloomy —&nbsp;don't delude yourself into foolishly believing that life is bearable and worth living." That's just the indefatigable harshness of being "realistic"...

I just came back from school, and I was like 'oh my, what could make this day worse'.<br><br>Then &nbsp;suddenly I saw your post about for those who having bad day, and it was funny because I don't have lots of bad days, I saw the video and I can confirm it's helping, In my personal opinion, this video is really good for those who having bad day, and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it.<br><br>Thanks for making this post, JJ. &lt;3

:/ Wasn't actually too uplifted by that. I feel like their are so many 'inspiring' words and sentences out there basically saying the obvious. Seems like half of the things said in that video were just common knowledge put into metaphor form. Still though, I could see how this would lighten the spirit a bit for someone feeling down. But I wouldn't know, I'm not really having a bad day.

Then let's hope it stays that way. It hit deeply for me because basically all my days are bad. This is really for all those people like me.
