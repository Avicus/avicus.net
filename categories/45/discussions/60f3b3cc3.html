I'm not sure how many of you on here are 3D artists, or wish to learn how to do that kind of thing but here's the thread to share your works and talk about 3D in general!<br><br>I personally use Blender and have been doing it for around 2 1/2 &nbsp;years on and off now. Here are a couple of my renders<br><br><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/MyHx7mE.png"><br><br><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/RctEsoS.png"><br><br>If enough people are interested I'll write a post explaining how to get started as well.

That looks amazing man!&nbsp;<br>How long does it take you to create one image?

The ball took me like 30 minutes it's fairly straight forward to do, the building one took a couple of hours because it takes time to set up the building for one, then the explosion and character placement take a little while the render time was about 30 minutes on that one and then you get into compositing&nbsp;which can take a long time, in that case I had a fairly simple setup though so it only took around 30 minutes to make it all look how it does.<br><br>Of course then you can start doing more hyper realistic stuff where a single scene can take months of work from modeling to lighting to material creation (that's the real kicker) to very long render times.

Nice work LavaLeaker, these look great! I'm interested in web design however I never really looked into this sort of work. Seems really cool though!

They are excellent! My personal favourite animating program is Cinema4D.

duuuude, thanks for making this thread, i thought it was totally awesome and downloaded blender recently. i got one render down. it's not great, of course, and it could use some more detail but here it is:<br><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/lIASSpF.jpg"><br>i'm pretty proud of it seeing as i started yesterday night and have only worked with blender for around 4 or 5 hours. it is pretty hard right now but hopefully i'll get better.<br>if i had worked on this longer, i could have done more detailing on the bottles and added some foam to the stream of soda, maybe added a bit of extra soda in the bottoms, and possibly some other extra stuff, but after working on it for a while i got bored with the image. also the render time was very long already at 1920x1080&nbsp;<br>thanks again for the help!

Those look awesome! I have had Blender for a while now but I don't really know how to use it. I'll try what you said in that response though. I'm sort of just interested in making renders with minecraft characters and stuff like that. Do you have any tips or links I could use for those sort of renders? &nbsp;Thanks in advance!
