You can still get it back by emailing them and explaining it there.<br><br>But in the current state I don't think they worked on that yet.

Yeah, all you have to do is sign into the donator email, and switch the cape from your old user to your new one.

Oh boy..Before posting look for other posts on this topic. There is one. But for your sake I'll help you.<br><br>First click login: ask for a new password and enter the donation email.<br>Second: once ou get the email copy and paste the new password the give you.<br>Step 3: click login.&nbsp;<br>Step 4: you should now be logged in and ou will see your old name with an option next to it that says (transfer) or change) something like that.<br>Once you click one of those just input your new name and your done.

All you need to do is:<br>1. Log in with your&nbsp;<b>donation</b> e-mail, not your account!<br>2. Many options will appear but you need to select the one that says, move cape or change cape.<br>3. Put the name of your new account.<br>4. Log into your<b> account</b> in the OF website to receive the cape.<br>5. Enjoy it and you're done!<br>Requesting a&nbsp;<b>lock</b> as this is the proper answer and this works for everyone too!

as Juano said + more detail in some parts:&nbsp;<br><br>Find the email with your OF password or change it with the email you donated with and log in on the OF website <u><b>after</b></u><b></b> logging in with your MC account. &nbsp;Select Edit Cape, and put your new name in instead of your old name.

Sorry for the bump but I now have my cape on this account (Thanks! :)) However.. when I try to login it gives me this error:&nbsp;<br><b>Login failed</b><br><span><b>Invalid credentials. Invalid username or password.</b><br></span>I'm pretty sure I have the right login because it usually works..
