Alrighty so it is my 18th birthday in a month and I am looking to buy a new phone. My current phone is an iPhone 4 that I bought 3 years ago (It's only my second ever phone o.o) and it's running REALLY slow to the point where it's painful so I am in need of an upgrade.<br><br>I am also kind of bored with IOS and it's lack of any form of customisation, so I was thinking of switching to android. Has anyone ever gone from Apple to Android before? I was also looking at the red Google Nexus 5 (red is my favourite colour) so anyone who knows this phone I would be grateful for opinions. I won't miss apple that much as the only thing I really used that is apple exclusive is the iCloud.. I mean I use Gmail, google hangouts etc. So it makes sense for me to move.<br><br>pls halp c: I hope this doesn't get locked as a personal update as I'm simply asking for help :p

I have a Samsung Galaxy Pocket, cheap but I didn't recommend it, be cause it crashes some apps and is limited with graphics and rendering, but the Samsung Galaxy S5 is a good opinion, +1 to Samsung Galaxy S5 !!!

<i></i>Go for an Android phone. Apple is cheap and wants to make you spend more money on your phone.

It depends on what purpose of the phone. &nbsp;Personally, I have an iPhone for my personal phone, and two Androids for business and other purposes. &nbsp;If you're going to use it for calling, texting, playing games, etc, &nbsp;Go with an iPhone because it has more social compatibility with most others. &nbsp;If not, go with an Android.
