</h1>
So, after posting content of my videos to my video hub which was in the <b>OFF TOPIC </b>category for 4 MONTHS, with several mods and staff members commenting on my thread about my videos, it gets locked. I do not understand, was there a rule change? and if so why did nobody alert me of this? Anyways... &nbsp;Can I please have a detailed explanation on why my video hub was locked after 4 months. I did not say "JOIN THIS MINECRAFT SERVER!", I was just posting what people wanted and what people thought I was good at.

I believe your topic was locked because of their policy of "No promoting other Minecraft servers". Honestly, I don't understand why posting videos on servers that have 10,000 times our population is a rule but there you go.

why is it not ok the share your content that you made with the community? so what if its on other servers, a server like hypixel about 75% of avicus go on that server already and 99.99% know the server. i would understand if it was old avicus that had 500 players, but the server now has like 50. why do we have to be so harsh with rules for a server with 50 players on it, its not like he is obviously advertising telling people to go on hypixel.&nbsp;<br>please tell me how people sharing their content with the community effects avicus?

To be honest you don't play avicus too much anymore (<a href="https://gyazo.com/fb09d83745672d920e905777fa03ec5f" title="Link: https://gyazo.com/fb09d83745672d920e905777fa03ec5f">https://gyazo.com/fb09d83745672d920e905777fa03ec5f</a>&nbsp;this gyazo shows you haven't played 'properly' in over 20 days)&nbsp;and like 85% of your videos are non avicus related so it was pretty justified your video hub was locked. Basically just using the avicus forums for advertising and views whilst playing other serves :(

Seems like people don't understand that "promoting" isn't always like "hey come join this server!". Simply playing on another server is promoting it. and like Lokigh said When you haven't even&nbsp;<i>played</i> avicus in over 20 days you're just using the forums to selfpromote etc etc.

Jesus the logic you use is quite&nbsp;ridiculous tbh. Just because avicus has 50 players doesn't mean the rules don't apply anymore. Rules are rules and even if avicus had 2-4 players you would not allowed to be promoting other servers. It's not quite the fact that it's effecting the avicus community its more and IS on the lines of&nbsp;<i><u><b>Rules are rules and will be followed no matter what.</b></u></i><u><b></b></u>

Honestly if youre gonna make a video with hypixel content go make the hub on the hypixel forums instead. Then you can have a video hub on this server with avicus content.<br>I do have content from other servers but thats &nbsp;not too many and i still play avicus actively and upload avicus videos aswell more than you do<br><br>have a good day

It's stated clearly in the rules that it's not allowed, but is not enforced due to the Staff who have channels want to Advertise their other content thus they break the rules and then other mods just bandwagon along by not punishing to not create any drama/to not seem the odd one out.<br>Props to Wolfy, he's the man for enforcing the rules.<br>To you Samuel, you've apparently already been told, I see no reason why you continue to do it.
