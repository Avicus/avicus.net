It has a couple things that are the same but that doesn't mean they are a ripoff of it. Just because theres a couple similar things it doesn't mean its a ripoff.<br><br>Example:<br>Samsung phone looks similar to a Nokia<br>Samsung must be ripping off Nokia here! They have the same screen size and both have a volume button on the right!<br><br>Even if its not the most original thing its a good thing that will make people enjoy the game. Its a video game, people should have fun, play and enjoy the game.

Ocn doesn't own everything, deal with it seriously. I can name many servers that have the exact same DTM or TDM gamemode but just renamed it to be something like Search and Destroy. Its up to the player to decide which one he wants to play on. If you really don't like the way Avicus looks ( I honestly like it )or if you think anything is copying just deal with it because most servers have the exact same gamemodes that can be found on many others. Ocn is Ocn, Avicus is Avicus. Just saying....

Honestly this is one aspect of the community that I really don't like, you guys say how much you want a certain gamemode back (SG, CTW) and then when the devs actually get to adding it everyone has a bitch fit and acts like we're copying OCN, Jesus Christ, they care about y'all enough to actually listen to you and add this, the reason CTW&nbsp;<b>wasn't</b> added was for originality, but y'all kept begging, and you got it. So be happy and shut up.

Stop saying how avicus is dieing! Because it is not! A new update would make avicus better IMO! Guys overall, just deal with it. Avicus is a truly unique Minecraft experience. Appreciate all the cool things that the update has created for you guys. So what if there is still lag! People can't solve all of your problems! Be happy that you guys are fortunate to have staff that work so hard, to make your experience amazing!

It is stupid really. To be honest, I do not really care if Avicus has the same things as OCN. I mean, there are tons of servers with similar things like factions and skywars but it doesn't mean they are ripoffs. I mean, its is kinda hard to think of an "original idea" because all these ideas were based off of some game or something. The only original gamemode in OCN would maybe be Destroy [Leak] the Core but the rest were from other games

Seriously?<br><br>At least every update someone whines about Avicus copying OCN. Here's the thing - OCN doesn't own everything. OCN isn't the most original server. OCN doesn't have the most original website. Avicus and OCN are similar in ways, but who cares?

Everyone's saying pretty much the same thing.<br>Also, the amount of arguing on this thread is a bit much.<br><br><i>We don't need any more of these threads on our forums.</i><br><b><br></b><b>Locking...</b>
