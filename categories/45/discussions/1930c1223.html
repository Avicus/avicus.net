Time Managment, as in not playing videogames as much as you used to.

So, being a college student, there are three things that are necessary to being successful.<br><br>1. Time Management: you have to manage your time between your friends, school, co-curricullar activities and such. This is one of the most important things.<br><br>2. Join co-curricullars: this is also a good way to make friends. I was a big band geek in school and that helped me meet a lot of new friends.<br><br>3. Do your homework: this one is pretty obvious, however in college you only have two tests in a class and that's your grade. You need to do your homework to understand the curriculum.<br><br>Good luck!

Task management and prioritizing has never personally been an issue for me, but you should worry first and foremost about your grades, then extracurricular activities and relevant hobbies (things that would look good on, for example, an application), then less meaningful pastimes such as&nbsp;video games (Avicus falls under this category). This is, of course, assuming you're part of the minority that wants to go to a good college and such. Unless you're able to waste all day on your computer while still maintaining perfect grades in multiple advanced classes — my situation — I wouldn't linger around online too much.

Ok.<br><br>I think the biggest thing is to stay busy.<br><br>Join clubs, get into a sport, start a hobby<br><br>When you are lingering in your house/dorm/whatever, having nothing to do but play on the computer, you'll put off homework<br><br>Surprisingly, it's easier to get work done when you have a busy lifestyle than if you have all the time in the world to do it, because procrastination, regardless if your a lazy person or not, gets to you if you have the time to stall
