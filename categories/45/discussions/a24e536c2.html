A graphics card isn't really the most need for Minecraft. The least you would need is something like the&nbsp;Intel GMA 950. That being said, a graphics card is mainly for games that have a lot of detailed textures/graphics.&nbsp;<br><br>When looking for the best FPS you can get on Minecraft, that is mainly based off of the raw power from your CPU or APU.

@Bader: It wouldn't be too cheap from what I know, something like an Intel i7-4820K would be able to do that no problem.<br><br>A&nbsp;Intel Core i7-4790 would also be able record MC at around 120 FPS. And it is a little bit cheaper.&nbsp;<br><br>Intel would be the best if you want to record MC and high FPS, but they aren't the cheapest company.

@3picRises: Nah, I haven't overclocked my graphics card. I haven't really needed to yet, but if I was to overclock a part of mine I would go with my CPU only because it would allow me to record with less lag on MC, but my graphics card is good enough to handle most games at good FPS and settings.

Pretty much agree with these points. Looks very similar to my current razer mouse but with more macros. After reading reviews, I'm pretty much convinced that the G502 is better. Unless I find a good and cheap razer mouse that's better, I'll probably take that over the logitech mouse, but currently, hooked on logitech.

Pretty much agree with these points. Looks very similar to my current razer mouse but with more macros. After reading reviews, I'm pretty much convinced that the G502 is better. Unless I find a good and cheap razer mouse that's better, I'll probably take that over the logitech mouse, but currently, hooked on logitech.

`As well, if you happen to actually use a dpi over 3000, let alone 8000, the G502 will allow you to max out at 12,000.

Oh, it just isn't popping up in your browser, just check your download files and it'll still pop up. like when you downloaded Toon Town 18678 times, you got it, but you have to check it through files. So, you would have to go and look for the files on your PC. I'm not sure how to change that, but I am assuming it is something in your browser settings.

Yes, but that graphics card target audience is mainly people who do a lot of work with 3D animations. That is a graphics card you'd see Disney have.

So I opened my computer to see what ram card I had. I discharged on the metal before touching anything. I pulled out the graphics card like I should. The one in the first slot. &nbsp;I put it back in and when I start my computer it goes for like a second stops and repeats. Could it be because I didn't push the card the entire way in? &nbsp;<br>(EDIT) I opened it again and noticed the ram card was indeed not pushed in the full way. Now my computer starts and runs fine.

What CPU do you have?<br><br>Nvidia's minimum system power requirement of the GT 630 is 300W, so you'd really, really, really, be cutting it close, personally I wouldn't risk it.
