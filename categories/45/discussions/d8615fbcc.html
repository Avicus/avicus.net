It seems since the 1.8 update out population has been down.<br><br>We have like 100 people on , and normally we have around 200-250 this time of day. It was really low all day yesterday too...<br><br>I did also notice that a few other servers are already 1.8 compatible, why are we not?

It takes time to get all the plugins up to 1.8 compatible. People are probably trying out single player to mess around with 1.8. Give it a week and everyone will be back to normal. Also school is back for many people.

@ Arachadonic : Like 5 other servers just on my servers list are updated already, and they are bigger, so it doesn't take that long to update the plugins.. School is back for ever other server too &nbsp;but I still see them with really high player counts... A larger portion of Avicus players could be testing out the update, but this does not seem to be the case across the board on other servers.

Just be <b>patient</b>.<b>&nbsp;</b>Avicus will update when it is ready and not a minute before. It is nice of you to show concern but I do not think it is reason to panic or anything.

Well, there are many reasons; for some, school has begun and they're getting stuck into it, therefore have less time, but the major one i noticed, was that 1.8 is here and you can only go online if you go down to the 1.7.10 or less version, which many people don't know how to do or for some reason can't.
