You've gone from some kiddo I dislike and I was like how tf did this boi get a 3kd to one of my best friends on the minecraft Avicus server. Also, you and I are best builders in build battle we should be map dev. That's about it for opinion...except you bad at minecraft pvp :3<br><br>pretty sure I'm gonna get demoted before you LOL

Hi R O C K Y (Tay Tay) you were one of the first people I talked to when I came back to the craft after a 6 month break and you allowed me into your team which lead to my starting in the competitive scene, so thanks for that lol. I remember when you were trash at pvp and I could just hold w and click 2 cps and best you, but now you've gotten pretty good (i think because of gaming shirt) and I actually have to blockhit and sweat to beat you. As a person, I always enjoy talking with you because you are really open and we have some good memes together.<br><br>HI<br><br>I SWEAR IF YOU ASK 50000 questions I'm gonna IGNORE your minecraft messages&nbsp;<br><br><br>HOME, Celestial is bad<br><br>rockyyyyy...who is that ocds casual randy<br><br>fatlesbian, because it is meme name and I stole it from okiba<br><br>megan is still legend<br><br>ily2 &nbsp; N E R D

We share similar humour and sometimes similar ping. I used to think that you were black but then I was told you were white so rip...you're very good at the craft and you have a really easy to work with personality. That's about it seuthboi, I hope we stay in CONTACT after this mineman server dies
