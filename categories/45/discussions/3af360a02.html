This will probably be locked but I really don't care. This needs to have a post specifically for this topic.&nbsp;Okay, clearly no one else cares enough about this topic to do anything about it aside from complain and fight over it, so I'll actually try to help the community and give some advice to you all.&nbsp;<b><i>Fighting doesn't solve anything</i></b><b><i>.</i></b><i></i> There's been so much fighting in topics about mods be bad at their job, etc., but honestly it's to the point where no one is actually trying to fix anything. All I've seen is complaining and people are telling Para that it's supposed to be helpful, and some of it is, and Para may need to listen to some more of some things, but the people complaining are doing in the wrong post anyway. If you're going to give constructive criticism do it on the posts that are meant for it.&nbsp;<a href="https://avicus.net/forums/b9e124262" title="Link: https://avicus.net/forums/b9e124262">https://avicus.net/forums/b9e124262</a>&nbsp;(Sr,Mods)&nbsp;<a href="https://avicus.net/forums/23235c07a" title="Link: https://avicus.net/forums/23235c07a">https://avicus.net/forums/23235c07a</a>&nbsp;(Mods)&nbsp;<br><b><i><br></i></b>Just to make this more clear, stop complaining, and if you're going to give constructive criticism then do it in the right place, not on random posts.<b><i><br></i></b><b><i><br></i></b>

Exactly my point, they just need to either stop, and realize that not every staff member isn't&nbsp;going to be perfect, or report the problem in a nice way and try to help get problems fixed....

No one would complain about the staff if they weren't prefect but still good. We complain because they are no where near good, except for some (I have seen improvements in the Staff Team recently though). The major thing everyone complains about (I'm probably the best example) Is lag (block lag, lag backs,etc.), biased kb and 1.8 hit detection. The 1.8 hit detection isn't Avicus's fault though, as well as the lag isn't in the Staff's control (jr mod, mod, sr mod, admin).<br><br>I have seen an improvement in all of these aspects though.

Everything you have listed is out of the moderators' control. They're developer problems.&nbsp;<br>Also if the staff team were perfect I bet you people would still find things to complain about.

Again, which is why I said I can't blame staff about lag. I agree if even if they were perfect people would still complain, but there would be less than a fraction of the drama we have now.
