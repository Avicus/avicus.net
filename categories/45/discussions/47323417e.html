Hey everyone!<br>As a lot of you already probably know, I'm a huge soccer guy. Since it's nearly summer vacation, I was thinking of starting to watch some soccer games online, but I don't know exactly which website(s) have all the recent games.<br>I'm not able to watch any soccer games on television, since I don't have cable.<br><br>Anyways, what I'm asking is if anyone knows a website that allows you to watch all the new Champions League or any other Leagues' games for free.<br><br>Cheers!<br><br>-Porky.

Righty, first off, the season is over, no more games except pre season friendlies. The season starts in August and then there you could watch some nice&nbsp;<b><i><u>FOOTBALL. &nbsp;:)</u></i></b>

Not necessarily. They could be replays, but not a month old.<br>Live wouldn't be bad, but I'd prefer the replays.

You won't be able to watch any decent club football matches since pretty much all of the good leagues and tournaments have finished. The Copa America is going on though so you could watch that instead. I believe some matches for that will be streamed &nbsp;here:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.totalsportek.com/football/copa-america-live-stream/" title="Link: http://www.totalsportek.com/football/copa-america-live-stream/">http://www.totalsportek.com/football/copa-america-live-stream/</a>
