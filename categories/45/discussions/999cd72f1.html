It's connected to your java version, at least it doesn't look like a normal minecraft crash report.<br><br>Things you could do:<br>- Turn the computer off and on again.<br>- Updating your graphics drivers<br>- Updating your JRE (Java Runtime Environment)<br><br>After some research most likely your graphics drivers are not updated.

Check that you're using the correct Java version for your MC launcher. Also, check that you don't have two versions that conflict.

Minecraft doesn't use the full version of Java anymore, instead it is built in to Minecraft itself. If Minecraft is the only thing you use Java for, uninstall it, as it has been known to cause problems in the past.

I don't have much experience with Java errors, even though I do develop Java programs and spigot plugins. To me, this issue seems as it's been caused due to lack of memory needed for a thread or the Java virtual machine. I might be wrong, but that's what it looks like to me. How many gigabytes of ram does your computer have?

A GeForce 210. But here's the thing. I just tried to run minecraft on my mom's work laptop and it ran pretty well but the same exact error came up. Minecraft crashed on that computer too as frequently as it did on this one. This problem started happening all of a sudden and the only thing I can think of is a software that I downloaded. I installed "Hide My Ip" to my desktop and my mom's laptop the day before minecraft started to show these errors. After i installed this software the crashing started, and considering that the same problem is happening on my mom's computer I think that is what is causing it. Unfortunately, even though I removed the software from both computers, the problem persists. Aslo, neither one of the two computers has a restore point set to before I downloaded hide my IP. I know it sounds ridiculous that a ip changer might be causing this mess but I hope that this info helps out :c Thanks for your help &lt;3

Okay so I found a semi solution to this problem. For some reason the crashes were not happening on 1.7 or 1.8 vanilla. So I decided to try out some other mods. As a replacement for toggle sneak and optifine I used Tazz's MTRL mod. Thankfully no crashes have happened and everything is working fine :) Just wanted to post this solution in case anyone else had this problem.
