It's been a different and hard year for some people, 2016 has. But we have all got through it together and as a force in this world.<br><br>We have had many celebrity losses, Trump, Brexit and loads more funny, sad and unusual things this year.&nbsp;<br><br>Use this forum post to comment your resolutions for 2017, or to thank and mention those who have made your 2016, whether it be from Avicus or your real livelihood.&nbsp;<br><br>(P.S I'll do mine later I am on phone and can't be asked xD)<br><br>Happy New Year! (when it comes around)

Happy New Year everyone! &lt;3<br><br>My New Year's resolutions are to connect with this community more, keep my grades up in school, and just overall enjoy life and take the good out of everything, and everyone instead of the bad. :)<br><br>Since we're here, and it's been a rough year for Avicus, with many retirements, demotions, and bans. Everything I see on any social media site I go on it talking about how terrible 2016 was, and although 2016 was a pretty rough year there's a lot of good to take from it as well. Throughout the year we've updated to Atlas, which was really bad at first, and there are still some things that need to be fixed, overall the Atlas update was a huge step up for Avicus.<br><br>I've played on a lot of servers, and I've never seen one with such an amazing community. We have our problems, the people that don't like each other for whatever reason, but that's what holds us together. Without the community being as strong and amazing as it is on Avicus I would have left a long time ago. You guys don't realize it, but whether you are active, or inactive, or only talk to a few people, you are part of this community.&nbsp;<br><br>My favorite thing about Avicus is the fact that even when we have 40-50 players on a good day, we all stick together and we do complain about a lot, but we still help in any way we can to keep Avicus alive, and improve it. I've seen many suggestions that are very good get better because of the communities ideas and constructive criticism, Let's keep that up. Help improve Avicus instead of complaining about everything we see wrong. Find a way to fix it, give ideas, be open to new ideas, and even if your suggestion seems stupid, suggest it, the community can help you improve it.<br><br>Thanks to a few people. :)<br><br><img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/d78324b1575744218df3c1eeaffe7489?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/Nebbsy.html" style="color: none">Nebbsy</a> : You've been one of my good friends for a long time now, and it's always fun talking to you about random crap that neither one of us are actually interested in. xD<br><br><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cddcbae20d91113c7013149149c87241?s=20&amp;default=mm" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/Junr.html" style="color: #FF5C5C">Junr</a> : When I became Junior Mod, and slightly before, you were the first one to really try to talk to me and spend time with me.

Thanks for a great year, and I hope there's another great year to come. &lt;3<br><br>Staff team: It's only been a short time so far, but it;s been really fun, and I've made a lot of new friends since I've joined. Thank you guys for helping keep the server alive, with whatever you do. &lt;3 &lt;3<br><br>Avicus community: Don't change. Keep being the amazing people that you are, and keep welcoming new players, and get to know them! One of the best things that Avicus has right now, is you guys. Keep it up! :D &lt;333<br><br>Thank you everyone for a great year, and I hope 2017 can be even better! Good luck to everyone on your New Year's resolutions and Happy New years!<br><br>-LiloOe/Micah.

Happy New Year everyone! &lt;3<br><br>My New Year's resolutions are to connect with this community more, keep my grades up in school, and just overall enjoy life and take the good out of everything, and everyone instead of the bad. :)<br><br>Since we're here, and it's been a rough year for Avicus, with many retirements, demotions, and bans.

Thank you to the community on suggesting ideas and to the developers for implementing them. Thank you to the Officials for creating fun tournaments and to the Refs for reffing it and the Medias for streaming. Thank you Map Developers for developing maps and working with Builders to build maps. Thank you builders for building amazing maps. Thank you Junior Moderators, Moderators, Senior Moderators, and Admins for things you do towards the server and staff team. Thank you to the retired/demoted for the service they provided. Finally, and not least, thank you to the Social Media for advertising this wonderful server :3.
