Because TS is players to come together when playing Avicus. If you banned of Avicus, your banned of TeamSpeak as well.

But I still don't get it. I never connected to ts.avicus.net to play with my friends on Avicus, even if I was playing Aviucs with them. I was there to interact with the awesome community, teamspeak is a place where players shouldn't just play together, they can talk about news, updates etc..

I think you shouldn't be banned from TS. Most mods always say that if your appeal email got no answer after resending it we should contact a sr mod or higher directly over skype. What if we don't have skype ? The person should still be able to get on the TS and atleast be able to text a sr mod.

Well, I agree and not agree with this rule.<br>In my opinion, this rule is good because players that break the rules in-game get banned there, and get banned from TeamSpeak so they won't break the rules they did break in-game, in TeamSpeak.<br>From the other point, we have the thing that Strafes_ has listed above, that Minecraft and TeamSpeak are completely &nbsp;different services Avicus provides, and I usually come to TeamSpeak to talk with the nice community we have about life, Minecraft, and stuff, not&nbsp;<b>only</b> to play with them in-game.

If the players don't get a reply to their appeal emails, then they could use the Support rooms to get help from a moderator+. I never ever saw someone in these support rooms so finally a good reason to keep them. It's also good to discuss their ban with a staff to learn what they did wrong and how they have to change to get unbanned. It also shows the players that the staffs aren't robots, cuz you can talk with them about things like that.

I don't really understand why players should be banned from teamspeak, support rooms can be used to talk to the player, but not for appealing, just to figure out what's going on, or quicker communication to get a hold of a a senior moderator about it, if they want to appeal on teamspeak that is. I only bother banning players off ts when they are banned ingame if I am pestered by that player constantly (asking to appeal their punishment or unban him) or getting DDoS'ed/threatened.

I agree with this. It kind of relates to how if your not banned on something such as plug.DJ you aren't banned ingame, and you aren't banned on the forums or TS as well. But as emmaye said, if people are trash talking the staff and/or other players, that should not be allowed. However rules are rules and we have to follow them. Even if it sometimes means doing the thing you don't want to do.

Avicus and Ts are two different things, I disagree with the fact that if you get banned ingame you get banned on ts. Even tho its an avicus teamspeak players don't just use it to talk and play avicus all day, players go on other servers as well while on the avicus teamspeak and the staff team doesnt have a problem with it.

There's a issue with appeals being answered, so even if the person appeals and it's a valid appeal, they probably wont receive a response quickly, and maybe not at all.&nbsp;<br><br>So it's adding further inefficiency to the system.

@Greg: Its not really my job to look at other Minecraft servers and what they do. Haha.<br>@Zinteka: I don't make friends with people who get banned. Most I actually dislike for obvious reasons.

The email should be answered (thats kinda why its there). One of the Admins needs to step up and force the Sr Mods to do appeals, or else there should be no bans without evidence by the moderators.&nbsp;<br><br>So, in theory, if the email is working, then there is no reason for the player to have access to the forums or TeamSpeak.

Once again I said what if the person doesn't know how to email the support email, Then what? they are banned from the server and teamspeak and have mostly no chance of attempting to appeal it, also i'm sure the staff team wouldn't just give out their skype to random people

You know it saddens me to see how in the strawpoll "Yes" is winning. <br>Lets look at it this way, if you get banned in game why don't you get banned on the forums? Because they're two&nbsp;<b><i><u>completely</u></i></b><i><u></u></i><u></u> different things. Also players in TeamSpeak don't just go there to play Avicus, me and my friends go on Avicus TeamSpeak but not ONLY for Avicus, we go on other servers like Kohi or Badlion as well.&nbsp;<br><br>Avicus provides other services too like TinyChat and Github so does that mean players who are banned in game &nbsp;get banned of GitHub and TinyChat?&nbsp;<b><i><u>NO</u></i>&nbsp;</b>it doesn't, so if you're intending to ban someone off TeamSpeak just because they're banned in game you might as well ban them of GitHub and TinyChat.<br><br>P.S.

Excuse me? i'm 100% against the staff with many things including this topic. Why do you think I have been going against Gill with everything he has said, because getting banned from everything over something that happened ingame which is 50% of the time false and to me its stupid. Now call me ignorant all you want, I'm Greg and like others I have my own opinion like you and everyone else that play this server.

Exactly that's what I've been trying to say it's BIAS that everyone is getting banned just because they have been banned in game.

I'll make this clear for everyone. People should only be banned from TS if they do something unjust on there. If they are banned from avic.us but, comply with TS rules, there is no need to ban them. These rules are basically "reading a book by its cover." Some of you staff judge people by whether or not they're banned in game. So you are saying that people who hack will be rude on TS? I think not. I think it's time to open up to these new ideas and accept that changes need to happen. It's time to broaden your options and look for outside help.

If you are going to ban players from TS that are banned IG, you have to be consistent and ban on the forums, Plug, and anything else associated with Avicus.&nbsp; The main point for these extra stuff is to grow the community.&nbsp; Isn't that the same reason for TS?&nbsp; All I am saying, be consistent!

Funny how everytime I join your TS room, Tel is there with you playing a cars game and later in this post you say the TS is mainly for the MC server but you don't play that much.<br>I've seen you more times playing that game than moderating.<br><br>This rule is pretty bullshit as the forums are made for Avicus players as well so I don't see your point on banning people just from TS.

Why can't people just play the damn game?&nbsp;<br><br>When Avicus bans someone, they practically have nothing to do with that player anymore. It isn't their responsibility. If they go hack or swear on another server, why should we care? So if this person isn't doing anything bad on the Teamspeak, it's not our responsibility to ban them. That's like banning someone in game then banning them on the forums. It doesn't make the slightest bit of sense. If they want to still be part of our community, why the hell not?&nbsp;<br><br>Now if you have a player who has banned for ddosing/ddos threats, why the hell would you NOT ban them off TS? You run the risk of them hitting innocent players offline. If they're spamming the chat with key loggers or porn, (and we're talking regulars by the way) why keep them on the TS? There are people who want to communicate with each other and there are those individuals that like to troll the living shit out of everyone they can. You can determine the difference.<br><br>In all honesty I don't really care about this at all. People should just be able to play the game. ITS A BLOCK GAME.

To stay in touch with friends..<br>This is a community and friends are made here, one example is Eric which I think is banned off TS for being banned from the server. He had tons of friends that spent time with him and he lost them, I doubt he has all their Skype accounts so he lost contact with some of them which is sad. Also, if he keeps a casual atmosphere now, I don't see the reason on banning him as attitude an MC clients are not related at all. Maybe he can't play Avicus anymore but let him talk with his friends at least, there is no trouble with that right? Emmy even said he just bans people that keep asking for an appeal, those kind of people should be banned but not the kind of people like Eric as they don't make any type of trouble. Last thing to remind you, not everyone gets on TS to play Avicus so people who were banned from there for being banned off the MC server should be unbanned now for reasons stated above.<br><br>+This isn't going anywhere unless a Sr comes in so, ye.

It doesn't hurt to allow them to use Teamspeak. Plus, banned players are just going to use it once in a while. And, how are you supposed to find out a friend's skype if, it's not on forums?

Don't get me wrong, Eric's a great guy, and he's a good friend of mine. &nbsp;Not every banned player is that way though, as a matter of fact many are the opposite. I'd love to see some of the banned players on TS, but I uphold the rule and support it strongly. If we were to let Eric stay, then that would be a problem commonly known as bias, which you guys love to get onto us about anyways.

I don't think you understand my point.<br><br>I like a lot of players, even the banned ones.<br><br>That being said, I agree with the rule and I support it strongly, no "roboticness" intended.

If you're banned in-game, you should be banned on the forums and TS. &nbsp;I'm also supportive to modifications and rearrangements on the rule.<br><br>I'm confused on why everyone's getting so salty over it, you just gotta follow the rules.

I do, but I believe that it should still center around; If you're banned off the Avicus Network, you shouldn't be able to use our services.<br>Exceptions? Regulations? The staff's open to suggestions, not insults.

I'm pretty sure I heard you saying: "I'll ban Eric the next time I see him around" without being sarcastic, but I don't want to get off topic so, IMO, the best way to solve this is making a testing process (Unban TS people)&nbsp;just so they have a 2nd chance and prove the staff wrong about themselves, maybe, there are more good people around there.<br><br>Note!: People that have been banned for DDoS threats or DDoS should't be unbanned, well, you know why and it's pretty obvious.

You really should know, everyone hates me since I got my first ddos infraction, and I really hated it. I was very very sad, because it wasn't my intention to ddos people. I'm still sad beacuse so many people think I'm a bad person because I was ddos'ing doozie for 20 seconds? How can 20 seconds change a life? They can, if people exist, which don't give a fuck to one of 450k players, and just look for the rules.<br><br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://i.gyazo.com/22c8e682352927197611137e9b336565.jpg">The second ddos infraction should be removed</a>, but like I said above, nobody really cares since I'm banned. Sr Mods are blocking me from Skype, e-mail support doesn't write back and my image is probably one of the worst here.<br><br>Why did I get banned for ban evading?<br>Very simple. I hate being banned for rules, like "Using alts to start games faster etc." and I don't see much sense since I did not want to abuse it.
