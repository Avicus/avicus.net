Now, before you tell me, I couldn't care less, or this isn't the forum community, I have seen enough of you do this as well.<br><br>Do you know how many people use Minecraft as en escape from all the horrible shit they have to put up with day after day? It's impossible to know, but I guarantee there are millions of players that use this as an escape. They get bullied, just because of their clothes, their religion and their sexuality, all things they can do very little about. What gives you the right to treat these <b>people </b>like trash? Every mean comment, directed at them could be just another blow to their already crippled, beaten minds. Suicide is all they can think off, and they use minecraft as an escape from the hell they live. And they're playing in game when you just have be negative towards them, because they killed you, or because they let the other team win, all things that don't matter. These words hurt, more then anything else, so please, next time you play in game, treat people with respect, and support them, even if they did something wrong.<b><br></b><br>I rushed this, so sorry for small mistakes.<br><b></b>

What I'm saying is it isn't really the forum community who are the ones who insult people freely. I for example enjoy having a joke and blatantly mocking people who I talk to alot - people I know that would say so if they didn't really take it as a joke and want me to stop. This is what most forum members do.

I commend you for doing this bud, I just don't know how many of us adapt to change. I see tons of the regulars being super nice. I won't name names, just for privacy reasons, but there are some people who just don't change. The way that I see it is that some people escape all the torment IRL by bullying other people in game. I will try to change, but it will be really hard to do that will the whole community. Especially because, less than 25% are active on the forums. Its possible for it to happen, because this is honestly one of the best Minecraft communities I have ever seen. The way I see it is that the only way that you can change the whole community, is by either kicking every single person who says "rekt" ,"eZ" &nbsp;"You suck", " You as*hole", and stuff like that. I'm not trying to be negative just trying to state the facts. Once again I love your recommendation, I just don't know how far it can go.

The fact that a post is necessary to make this clear to some people actually makes me feel sick. The thought of people lacking even the slightest idea of common sense. I want to be clear here; if you think that you can trash someone, make them feel bad, bully them or any other disrespectful behaviour towards anyone. Should not, and most certainly will not be tolerated. Not in the past. Not now, and not in the future. If you think you have the right to say what you want, you are wrong. If you feel like you am not talking to someone with feelings you are wrong again. We don't want you to say everything you think of. Use common sense, think. Use your mind before you do and say something.&nbsp;<br><br>If you don't. Just go away. I don't care what you are, who you are, what you think. Just how you behave, that is what matters. Here, and in real life.

Ive seen too many people being left off with 4 pages of chat-related infractions. Perhaps, a solution could be for harsher punishments for repeat actions, racism, nativist and sexist comments. With the other three being treated almost akin to one hacking.<br><br>This is the 21st century... the fact that people still go about being racist heavily is frightening... but common...&nbsp;<br><br>Harsher punishments should be appointed IMO.

A community is something you help to create and shape, negativity like yours is what hurts it. If you don't care about a community you wouldn't go out of your way to post on the forums and become part of it. Also please explain how it is sad people treat this like real life. In real life people have morales and are held accountable for their actions and words.

I don't disagree with you and when I read this I figured as much but decided it was a nice post regardless of it's results. You don't need to be negative towards it. If you don't want to help him reform the servers morales then at least recognize that it is well intended and the actions although you feel are a waste are also good. Instead I see negativity. Why stand in the way of something just because you believe it will fail anyways?

No offense to anyone&nbsp;now&nbsp;but the majority of the disrespect is mainly from well-known players and donors who think they can act as they like because they have a donor tag, and often nothing is done about it.

Um no. While I have seen some disrespectful donators, I have also seen many disrespectful non-donators. Both are equally annoying with one exception: There are more disrespectful non-donators.&nbsp;<br><br>I don't think the majority of rudeness comes from well known players because a) they are a minority and b) most (not all) regulars know how to act on the server.&nbsp;<br><br>As for staff members, I haven't recently seen much of this but if you do see rude staff, I would suggest you to bringing it up with an Admin or Sr. Mod so they can deal with the problem.
