I think a Factions server on Avicus would be such a good idea. At the moment we have no server that's like survival type game mode. In survival type i mean have your own house ,have stuff and all sorts! I believe the Avicus Network guys are easily capable of this and it would make this server so cool! Also some where you can hang around with no real game objective and chat while gathering resources say? Is this a good idea? Also a place to show off your buildings and your skills or what ever you would like. All in all is this a good idea comment if you think this is a good idea&gt;<br>-If you do read this please dont yell at but hope you understand this type of concept!<br><i>--Thanks 7788james</i>

It's more like saying "thanks for donating" and the kits should be placed on what normal players can get, such as emerald rank players having a kit that had diamond armor, protection 1 which isn't as op.<br>And honestly it's not that hard to get either.<br><br>I don't appreciate "pay to win" things, but its better than donating and getting nothing. Plus it can be set really weak, like better tools not always armor.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Plus there's also something called sharing, friends or generous players can share their stuff :^)

I don't think we should have factions because like subzero said "A minecraft network providing you with the minigames you love and a community you'll love even more!"<br>I do think it would be intersting to add a survival type game into Avicus. Let's just wait to see what the winter update brings.

Faction servers give donators a big benefit, yes, but in the end it is usually easy to get P4, god apples, ect in Faction if you know what you are doing. Yes the community is trash, but what did you expect from the gamemode. To be honest, factions is one of the best gamemodes in minecraft, but it's how servers attempt to incorperate it is where it fails. No offense but I don't see Avicus factions being very good. There are a lot of different plugins, rules&nbsp;and commands that can make or break factions.

There used to be factions on here, as it was called "Volmaria". I think the reason it was taken out is because barely no one played it. Meaning most times, there were about 3-5 players online. The same type of situation might occur, and no one would play it (most likely). If i'm wrong, correct me please.

Donors wouldn't get protect 10 it would only be like p1 -p3 and in factions it is very easy to get diamond. Gold p1 emerald p2 diamond p3

That time and this time is different, since it wasn't literally factions then I see why it wasn't popular. &nbsp;<br><br>-I help servers sometimes there was a faction server that I set like this= since not everyone can afford ranks, I set it so that people can use in-game money to upgrade into a donor rank, for that one server.

some sort of tournament with sg that lasts a couple weeks might be awesome, actually. here's what i mean:<br>a survival games tournament starts out just like any other sg game would. building is turned on (maybe) but pvp isn't. the map is huge, not quite a full minecraft map though, restricted by a smaller world border from 1.8. the map would be large enough that players could build their own fortresses and create large teams, etc. this would last a very long time because the map should be large enough so that people can go far out of spawn to build their bases. during the time it goes on, you could log on to the map whenever you want and spectate or, if you're in it, play. it'd be cool if people could join only within 2 days of it starting, otherwise player amounts would build up and people would just have to keep going around killing all the new players. (plus it wouldn't be fair). there could be a new seed every time and community members and map devs could volunteer to go out into the seed and build little structures/chests/etc and then it could all get checked by the map devs to make sure the gameplay/aesthetics are ok.<br>a whole world that is static and never changes and is factions would maybe break up the community, but this would be so amazing...

I think it'd be good because it would greatly expand the player base on Avicus. It would bring in a completely different group of users, which could be a good thing for Avicus. Its what we need to grow and expand. The only downside would be the community, and I believe that the staff are capable of having a tight leash on the subject manner. Also, I doubt donors would be given anything over-powered (kinda against EULA).

I've seen this idea been brought up several times.<br><br>Honestly, I don't want to see factions on Avicus. I came to Avicus because of the mini games that revolved around a single concept, (breaking monuments, getting kills, etc.) and that idea kept me here. I don't think factions would really fit into a server like Avicus.<br><br>Also because of the fact that I flat out don't like factions... ;3

If Factions and Avicus were right in front of each other, Avicus will walk away. See if factions is added on Avicus, the community is over. Right now Avicus is a wonderful community but when there's factions everyone would be rude, not polite and there will be lots of hackusations. I know factions is pretty fun but we don't want Avicus to have it.

It's more like saying "thanks for donating" and the kits should be placed on what normal players can get, such as emerald rank players having a kit that had diamond armor, protection 1 which isn't as op.<br>And honestly it's not that hard to get either.<br><br>I don't appreciate "pay to win" things, but its better than donating and getting nothing.

You aren't supposed to donate because of the perks you donate because you love the server and want to keep it running. If you donate for the perks you are doing for the wrong intentions entirely.

How is candy and donating related that made no sense.<br><br>Also I that is what donating should be about and why you should donate not why some people donate.<br><br>Also if the community goes into ruins the <b>fun&nbsp;</b>for a lot of people will be gone as the community is part of the fun or in my case most of the fun. Minecraft Factions is stale,over done and does not suit avicus.

You can't count numerically in this kind of way as some things should have more weight than others. All the cons are very serious and would be a huge detriment to the community.

-1. adding factions is uncesary and a bit clishe imo. Also, unless you want nebula to be not fun and lonely, factions should not be implemented. It will only do more harm than good because it will only disperse the players more, thus having less people on each gamemode. If avicus had a bigger player base, maybe but even so, i wouldnt consider factions

Factions, is a gamemode where you can talk to each other freely, instead of running for a monument, or taking control of the hill. It could be a really non-op factions, and all the Premium ranks, don't get a lot better gear. It would be a great idea to expand Avicus, and bring in more players, to the the classic, favourite gamemode with a signature line up of all the Avicus gamemodes. I would definately play it if it was to come.

I have to say :/ I used to enjoy factions a lot, and it's quite fun really.. But I don't think it's a great idea for Avicus to have it, it could cause a lot of bad relationships and some hate in the community.. As well as drama.. But yeah.

Umm yea, no thanks, I don't want all the regs from factions, as then we get, for the most part, douchey regs. Then our regulars and in-game players are annoying. Plus I don't think Factions would really work with Avicus' style anyways
