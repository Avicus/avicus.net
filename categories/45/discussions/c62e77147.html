This is completely off topic, but here is the place to ask all the stupid questions stored in the back of your head and have them answered by others. Just a few guidelines:<br><ul><li>Any question(s) discouraging this network/encouraging others will immediately be deleted and will not be answered.</li><li>Any profane or otherwise inappropriate questions will be deleted and ignored as well.</li><li>This thread is solely for humor and is hardly serious, so expect some pretty ridiculous answers :)</li></ul>Here are some examples of questions I'm looking for:<br><ul><li>If a synchronized swimmer drowns, would they all have to drown?</li><li>Is the square root of rope string?</li><li>Why is it a sin to kill a mockingbird but killing something else is just fine?</li></ul>

Not sure if that was a serious question, but in case it was:<br>No, it's not possible to walk on the sun - no matter what. The only reason why Winter is cold is because of how Earth is facing. Obviously, your country is facing away from the Sun, hence the cold weather.
