As a lot of people already know I play on a laptop, a really sucky one that is. And well today my brother was taking a bath and took my laptop with him, to do work. And then we'll you can guess... &nbsp;<br>The ironic part is, is that today is birthday.<br>Happy Birthday to me<br><i>And now imma get a better laptop any suggestions on wich laptop I should get next, just remember maximum price is about $500 maybe a little higher. Any ideas, guys/girls?</i><br><br>Due to this, I don't have access to games nor any programs associated to computers.

I agree with Vlad on this one, this post isn't all about Shah leaving for a week, he's mainly informing us on what happened with his previous laptop and asking for some help on what laptop he should get. I honestly have no idea on any good laptops out there. :P

On some of the links I provided, there is an option which will take you to "pre built" - if you will - computers.

Well... I'm going to go ahead and recommend an iMac.<br>Despite the contrary, the iMac I use is <i><b>very</b></i><b></b> good for gaming, editing, writing, and overall looks. It's smooth, user friendly and runs smoothly. If you want me to explain any more, go ahead and reply to this comment :3

In my honest opinion, Macs aren't even that good for gaming. Windows is more beneficial for gaming... Well, most games aren't supported for Mac anyways.

Saying they aren't good for a gaming is a common mis-conception.&nbsp;<br><span>The real truth is the following:-&nbsp;<br><br>1. They are ridiculously expensive. This guy's budget it $500. The only way you're going to get any Mac OS X product for $500 would be one for 3-4+ years ago which'll likely have horrible specs all round.<br><br>2. On top of being ridiculously expensive, for that expense, you are not paying for any extra power spec wise. The cheapest base-line iMac being 1.4GHz Dual-Core i5.<br><br>Emphasis on&nbsp;<b>1.4Ghz </b>and<b> DUAL-core<br></b><br>Base-line iMac also having the integrated graphics of last years' macbook airs as well.<br><br>So yeah, they're beautiful computers and I'm in love with apple. But no, they aren't worth the investment if you can't afford it.&nbsp;<br><br>NOW BACK TO MY GOD-FORSAKEN ASSIGNMENT, WHICH I WAS WRITING AND AM NOW PROCRASTINATING BY WRITING ESSAYS ON THIS DAMN FORUM.&nbsp;</span>
