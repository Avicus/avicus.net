The relationship between Avicus and OCN

</h1>
I am really not sure wether it is appropriate to make this thread, so I am sorry if people view this as spam, or advertising. I feel if anyone is going to make this thread, it has to be me, as I am a regular on both Avicus and OCN.<br><br>Very recently, a small group of OCN mumble users got together and used hacked clients on Avicus, although in the past OCN hasn't dealt with it's players in Avicus related incidents, I can assure you all that they have all been punished. Although what these individuals did was stupid, reckless and thoughtless, I don't think anyone can deny that as a whole OCN has improved it's attitude towards Avicus. I know that many of you are very open minded about the OCN-Avicus situation, but those who aren't, be aware that things between servers are getting better.<br><br>I hope one day both servers can get along as they should be. Obviously I will not give out the names of the individuals who took part, it would be completely unnecessary.&nbsp;<br><br>Thanks for reading this- Gibbo<br><i>Also please try to be mature in the replies.</i>

It is very thoughtful of you to make this thread. Yes, it is true that some Overcast Network players dislike Avicus and the Avicus Community, but that should not ruin the gameplay for anyone.<br>I too believe that these server can get along, and just because they do not see eye to eye on everything, does not mean that one server is better than the other.<br>Thank you for writing about this.

Alright, let's clear this up.&nbsp;<br>A group of OCN regulars used an Overcast service (Mumble) to organize hacking on Avicus. This is a poor representation of the Overcast Network and as an Overcast service was used, action was taken against the players involved.<br>As for poor relations, it's ridiculous. Sure, players of the networks have had strains in the past, and some continue to have them. However, an uneducated and unbacked dislike for either network simply doesn't make sense.

I'm perm banned from OCN so I don't even care. I was banned 7 times from that server, mainly for attitude problems because the community was horrible.<br><br>Tbh, I'm upset I didn't find Avicus a long time ago because the community is just amazing. Not everybody here is cocky and arrogant. It's just great!

Same applies for OCN. It is just the community is bigger and the player base is bigger so you see more people bringing it down.

I recently came back to playing OCN a bit. I don't really talk in chat since I don't know many players there. But it's good to know the servers are beginning to get along a bit better.

Alright, let's clear this up.&nbsp;<br>A group of OCN regulars used an Overcast service (Mumble) to organize hacking on Avicus. This is a poor representation of the Overcast Network and as an Overcast service was used, action was taken against the players involved.<br>As for poor relations, it's ridiculous. Sure, players of the networks have had strains in the past, and some continue to have them. However, an uneducated and unbacked dislike for either network simply doesn't make sense. The stereotypes and the rudeness need to stop. Incidents like this should not happen.

I enjoy playing both Avicus and OCN. Both are great server's. OCN people who troll around here are just fools. They just ruin OCN's name. I hope that OCN people can get along with Avicus people just as Avicus people getting along with OCN people because this fighting is, Pointless. What's the use in that?<br><br><br>Anyways, Avicus and OCN could be still rivals. Rivalry is actually good if you think about it. Heres a quote i got.<br><br><span><b>Proverbs 27:17<br><br><i>"</i></b><i>As iron sharpens iron,</i></span><span><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i><i>so one person sharpens another."<br></i></span><br>This quote means that OCN and Avicus would strive to be the best of the best which is benificial because they will keep doing better and better :)

I am an OCN regular and have nothing against Avicus. A lot of times if I see a topic on avicus that I feel it cool I reply. I mostly look at map topics and im a map creator but yeah :) Heck I even have an avicus YT series :)<br><br>Even tho Nebula is very similar to Project Ares (OCN) I still enjoy it.<br>The skill level of Avicus is lower than OCN's (my opinion!) but still fun to play here.
