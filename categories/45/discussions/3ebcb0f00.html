So...... to get straight to the point this is an AMA because I don't post anything on forums and do not totally remember what was the last thing I posted. Also everyone seems to be doing it and I'm sure you guys got some questions so I'll let you all ask before all this goes away.

You're a pretty good guy, despite my main interactions with you was my short time on Celestial. I like you as a leader and you're an overall chill dude.

You are a great minemen yes. As a mod, you were alright once you started "cleaning up" for lack of a better phrase. I can see why the community ripped on you but at the same time, I didn't see the need to. As a person you are nice to hang out with in TS (rip) and in the discord VC's the few times I would pop in.

10/10 great guy. It is nice when you PM me on Discord even though sometimes I don't respond because it would be 1am sometimes. As a staff member you were great even with your breaks and eventual retirement. As a mentor you were just a chill dude which I liked. As a person you're a real solid dude to talk to. I do suck at remember lyrics to the songs you like messaging me with though but I assure you I listen to a fair bit of the songs you do even if my lyric game is a little weak.

1) You are a really chill dude and are great to talk to occasionally. As a player you're pretty good at the game of Minecraft. As a map dev, your Oasis (i think thats the name) map is one of my favs. As a mod, you do a great job, too bad you couldn't be senior.&nbsp;<br>2) my favorite moment would probably be becoming Jr Mod. I have had other moments here and there like me getting my first punishment from building penises using the excuse of 'defense'. In all fairness, it worked.

1) not much of an onion guy, I find them ew. yuck yuck yuck<br>2) As a mod, you did a great job and still continue to do a good job despite the server's future. As a builder, you seem pretty good at it but I cant say much since I do not exactly get into maps and stuff. Your memes are great ngl. You sound like a younger _Distraction_ though, yet I assume you know that already lmao. You were probably one of my favorite mods to work with because of your chill attitude and also because you took reports when I was sometimes too lazy to take (i mean what?)<br>3) (i clicked reply by accident before finishing my answer) Out of the current ones, you. I woulda said Paige butttttttt she left and came back too late so rip. But yeah you. If the server wasn't closing I could read all the docs I want but there was no way I was not going to be lost when apps would have came around. You did a good job with Wolfi even though he retired, he's bad (jk ily wolfi).

You were probably one of the better mods out there before you were demoted. You were chill when we talked a few times also. Haven't seen you around recently because I have been inactive sorta but yeeee.

You were probably the best player on Celestial when I was on it. You also are good at pvp since you railed me on Valux (not sure about now since i am a lot better but eh im sure youll rail me). You also make really good vids, they are enjoyable to watch

1) best croatian fella ik. Your accent is still funny to me for some reason idek. Bedwars GODDDDDDDDDDD, like so good egirls should be coming to you not the other way around yafeelme.<br><br>2) For packs from you, im between Apollo 32x or Spectrum 32x, but I play better with Apollo 32x so that one. Maybe if you send me that sexy RoseGold 64x ill think other wise ;))))). As for like, any pack I would say Avarice 128x by iSparkton &amp; Ollie, or maybe Dynamic Duo.
