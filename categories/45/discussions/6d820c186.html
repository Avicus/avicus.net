SOOO, does anybody know how to do this, I have a hunger games plugin for my server that I got yesterday, and it was able to have wall signs (when you right click the sign it tp's you to the area) but just today while I was testing the survival games with other people I found out the signs only work with opped players, anybody know how to change it that everyone can use the signs?<br><br><br>(will be telling people on skype the ip when I believe the server has enough maps to play with on hg, will also be adding more classical minigames and custom made minigames)

Im pretty sure it has to do with properties and how you assign the players, Like I forget what the name of the properties thing is It might be just properties but you have to make so&nbsp; any player gets it and Im pretty sure its "*" &lt;-- That represents everthing

vlad, search up the name of the plugin you are using, so they can tp with signs, then type in google "plug-in name" permission nodes.<br>Then, find the permission node that permits players to use signs to tp.<br>Using your permissions manager, add this permission for all groups(or the groups you want able to do this)unless your perms manager has inheritance, then you can just give the perms to the lowest group that u want to have this perm.<br>Hope this helps :)
