Most of you might know me from being one of the _Ezbla's or maybe being the best at pvp out of the ezbla's other's may not know me, other's may know me as rude selfish cocky uptight and other's look at me like a friend.<br><br>How ever you look at me bad or good I have been extremely rude, mostly to staff member's and if you don't believe me you may want to check my sexy infractions for which are about 20 million...&nbsp;<br><br>So I really want to say&nbsp;<i><b><u>Sorry</u></b><u></u></i> to my friends that I was rude to like para or polar or zeus So I wanted to say sorry not trying to get a staff rank I am trying to be a decent person and doing the right thing.&nbsp;<i></i>

Sorry but I don't forgive you. You've apologized before, saying you've turned over a new leaf or whatever, that you have changed, yet it's the same scenario every time.

Hear threads are just attention seeking and it's like the third one you have made. Most people don't care and apologising on the forums doesn't help.

Is this really gonna happen every time you get an infraction? I half accept your apology, saying sorry doesn't change the fact that you have been rude but its a start.

I think all will forgive you, if you are nice ingame and in the forums.<br>Ingame: Don't get any infraction for the next time.<br>Forum: Don't make attantion seeking threads or spam threads. Helping others by forums things is kind also. And don't be rude...<br>I don't have so much to do with you, but were really rude, from that what I saw.<br>If I had somethind to do with you, I would not accept your&nbsp;Apology.
