Kepler-438B is the most earth like planet we have ever found, it has a score of 0.88 on the earth similarty index. (1 is identical to earth in every way and 0 being nothing like earth.&nbsp;<br>It was discovered in Januari 2015.<br><br>It is 470 light years away thought. :3<br><br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KZ1kvIUFrU" title="Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KZ1kvIUFrU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KZ1kvIUFrU</a>&nbsp;(Number 10 is Kepler-438B)

Yes it is a scary thing to think about, but I love learning about it.<br>From what I've read, this planet if it has&nbsp;<b>any</b> lifeforms on it.<br>They will be small, tiny little cells, but... It's a start!<br>It's how the earth started! ( if you look at it from a scientific view)<br><br>@killerbye thanks for the info!<br>I will add it!

How far away is it?<br>And if we do get there, I have no doubt that there is going to be some sort of alien life form. I just hope if there are, their intelligence is going to be below our's.

Light travels at "670,616,629" MPH, Our technologies can push us about 40,000 MPH. Meaning that it would take around 18-19 Thousand years to travel one light year. Multiply that by 500, you get somewhere in the 8-9 million year range.

Light travels at "670,616,629" MPH, Our technologies can push us about 40,000 MPH. Meaning that it would take around 18-19 Thousand years to travel one light year. Multiply that by 500, you get somewhere in the 8-9 million year range. You can find this information here:&nbsp;<a href="http://gyazo.com/7b23915dded3bb5552157c6b1c352adf" title="Link: http://gyazo.com/7b23915dded3bb5552157c6b1c352adf">http://gyazo.com/7b23915dded3bb5552157c6b1c352adf</a><br>&nbsp;<br>Now my honest opinion. I don't think we would destroy this planet. I assume our technologies are going to be advanced and efficient enough to not pollute the air (If there is an atmosphere), because there is no way we could EVER travel that far in a humans life span (80ish years). But later on, we mostly likely could.<br>(Sorry If I did make any errors, I'm not bothering to look over this, am going to sleep, bi bi)

We're getting closer to FTL technology. Some guy made a propulsion system out of microwaves that could jettison us to Proxima Centauri (Nearest star system) in approx. 30 years. Proxima is approximately 1 or so light years away/

That's still not enough to actually get to a planet. But with this information, I would say 50 years to perfect this design, and I think this will be well on its way! :D

I know that. But holding back a bit surely would delay the inevitable.

A bit, wont do anything. Oil companies and Nuclear facilities won't stop, everyone is so hung up on money that if they stop / slow down the process, they will become broke and eventually have to give the land area up. Not to mention we rely on that every day? Us normal humans can't do anything about it. If we protest, it will be ignored and we can simply ruin our life that way...

We're still good for around 100 or so years. Technology is growing fast. I mean we went from "Charles Babbage" (Which Should be one of the first computers) that took up a whole room, and can do only a couple thousand processes per second. To Micro processors that fit in out pockets that do 10000X as much, meaning millions of calculations per second. And it all fits in out phone. Actually, It would take around 10,000 Charles Babbage Machines to be even compete with our phones. Not to mention that will take up a land area of a whole CITY! And all of that was done within 30-50 years...

Skimming through an article about him, he is the Prime-Minister of Australia, who held that position since 2013, He is a mix between British and Australia. And has 3 children xD. What's so bad about him?

You obviously missed every bad thing about him.<br><br>He's cutting pensions to the elderly and disabled.<br><br>He's taken away funding for education.<br><br>He takes money from hospitals.<br><br>He makes it difficult for people to retire because he's taxing the pension, therefore people must work longer to get the money.<br><br>He spends 75,000 on military things instead of Australia's needs.<br><br>If a soldier dies, his reaction is "shit happens."<br><br>He is sexist.<br><br>He is- I'm going to stop because my blood pressure is going through the roof.<br><br>You get the jist though.

We're not good for the next 100 years. We'll be lucky if our supply of oil lasts for more than 60-70 years. Plus things like global warming, overpopulation, lack of food and clean water for some countries, deforestation, and killing off species will only have their effects amplified by time. As resources and land run out, countries may also turn to war to solve their problems. Unless we can fix something fast, it's not looking good.

How far away is it?<br>And if we do get there, I have no doubt that there is going to be some sort of alien life form. I just hope if there are, their intelligence is going to be below our's. If its not, and they're way more developed, they can possibly track down the disturbance (If we cause any) and wipe us out in an instant. But. Lets say that didn't happen.<br><br>How would we get there? (Since we have no information as how far away it is ; Lets say it is), It would take years! Light years!...

That's the wrong one. 'Earth 2.0' is Kepler483b, 1400 light years away.
