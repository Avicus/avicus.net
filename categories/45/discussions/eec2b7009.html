I also noticed a few days ago that the first few players on the leaderboards are / were staff members. This isn't biased in any way though.

That's because they're generally more active on the forums and in-game. Also, they have lots of dedication to the server, so it puts them in a nice position to become moderator.<br><br>Edit: 10/10 would edit again.

Staff do not receive an exp boost, however, most of them have donated to the server which is why you see that they are receving an exp boost.

Often staff have more experience than others to gain their role of leadership, and spend more time on as their duty, therefore it isn't that unorthodox that they have more Exp, and also, many of the staff have donated, too :)

Staff spend more time on the server since they deal with reports and other stuff too. Often staff buy donor ranks and that's what the xp boost is from. Staff need to be more active in order to keep their position so I guess they play as they're active and don't go calliex11 mode just waiting in the lobby for reports...
