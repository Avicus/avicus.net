Yes finally a post. 3x3 is 1 min and &nbsp;59 seconds (record) and I have the dayan zhanchi speed cube :D ! Sticker less... My brother can solve it in 29 seconds and my friend in 17 seconds! Currently learning Fredrick's method. Haven't got to any other cubes even though my brother has speed cubes of all the kinds!

I can solve one side, but not the entire cube. There is this one kid who lives on my street who can solve a 3x3 cube under 5 minutes. Even if someone else mixes it for him.
