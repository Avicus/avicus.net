Looking for a new computer

I'm looking for some suggestions for a new computer. I have absolutely no idea when it comes to this sort of thing so building my own isn't an option. Just wondering what I should look for to have a decent running laptop that can play MC with more than 15 fps. My old one was an Acer that's roughly 6 years old all the ports burned out and lost the ability to have more than one program opened, plus is just slow as f*ck. Any help would be appreciated! :D

Budget is 500-600 dollars Canadian. Just needs to be fast enough to run Minecraft, Teamspeak, Skype/Slack and music application/browser all at once. Not looking for anything to record with or have tons of hard drive space simply for casual gaming.

MacBook Air. Its not as good as Pro but you can get very high FPS, easily edit and record videos. And it's pretty fast.

If you're not going for a laptop, find your closest PC parts store and let them know your budget and what you want to use it for. The canadian dollar is as shite as the australian dollar at the moment though, so the prices aren't incredible. But if you're just going to use it for minecraft, you DO NOT need to spend a significant amount of money on it.&nbsp;<br><br>Let me know if you have any questions :)

I'd just say have a go at building it your self :) Its cheaper, doesn't come with the rubbish the pre-built companies install in it beforehand and you get the satisfaction of using a computer which you put together

Don't look for a specific brand, look for the one with the best specs that you can afford. Building one would be so much better and I can help you through Skype but it's up to you. Either way, message me on skype for specific help, I should be home in about 9 hours.

Actually it does depend on the brand lmao.<br>The software may be the same but different brands use different kinds of materials.<br>I have the same laptop 99 had and is trying to replace which is an ACER, and I can tell you that ACER uses less qualitative materials on the keyboards, USB ports, the frame.<br>It just breaks apart after a few years.<br>On the other hand ASUS is much more qualitative with their materials.<br><br>So when it goes for pre-built laptops you want to look for specs, but also for the company to make sure you get the best performance but also have good material because no matter how good your specs are, if the laptops frame, keyboard, USB porths, e.t.c. aren't of good quality then those specs go down the drain along with the broken material.

Yes a desktop is better unless you absolutely need the portability. I actually upgraded an old windows xp computer too with around $150 USD but it also depends on what you can salvage from it. Let me know if you know the specs of the computers.

Does it work? If it does, download <a href="https://www.piriform.com/speccy" rel="nofollow">this</a> program and it will tell you the specs.
