You did have invisibility, which gives you an advantage.

Invisibility is really OP actually. I have had half diamond and half iron and gotten killed in a 1v1v1 by a stupid invisible dude with speed.

I wouldn't say that that was "One of the Best Kills in the Walls"&nbsp;<br>It might have been one of your best kills, but tbh you were kind of being pretty damn rude after you killed him.
