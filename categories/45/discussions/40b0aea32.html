So I was changing my Optifine Cape design, nothing wrong with that. I'd only done it about 15 minutes earlier. Then it locks me out of my account, saying that my password is incorrect. Now I'd never changed my password, it was the exact same as it had always been. I check my emails, and Mojang come back to me saying that my account was "compromised" and all that. How? I'd only changed my cape, and I'd changed it before normally. On my xBen_ account, this was the reason I could not play MC anymore. I don't know if this is Mojang, Optifine or just some fucktard stealing my account, but it's happened twice. I contacted Mojang, but they say I need my "Transaction ID" to fix the problem.<br><br>Does anyone know what has happened or if it has happened to other people?

I heard there was a site that was so similar to optifine, that when you logged in, it took your account. I think they made a small letter change in the website address. I changed my cape a couple days ago, and it was fine.

It happens to me when I change the cape 2 times or when I changed the skin.<br>Your account is not compromised, just change the password with the link that they gave you in the email.
