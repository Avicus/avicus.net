I personally think that this server will not blossom unless the staff improve. I saw someone get banned for calling someone fart in spanish. Really? Staff ban for no reason and don't ban their friends on this server.<br>I &nbsp;think that if this continues, I will get my prestige and leave for good. I love this sever, but after seeing innocents get banned, favoritism, people leaving and my friends stop playing Minecraft, I come to this.<br>"If you want to be a moderator on this server, you should be able to punish fairly and put the server before your friends if they hack."<br>Who agrees.

<b>"If you want to be a moderator on this server, you should be able to punish fairly and put the server before your friends if they hack."<br></b><br>Are you making the accusation that the staff team don't ban their friends if they hack? Well buddy boy I'm gonna have to tell you that you are dead wrong. If a player hacks,regardless of them being a friend, the staff will ban. If you would like to take a stroll over to glitchy's profile you will see that 1/2 his infractions are from DoctaPop, who happens to be one of his friends.

ok.... I'm sorry, that was too harsh. smitdalt we couldn't have a server without the staff. I just have some opinions and I am thinking about leaving. I'm not saying I am leaving but I might decide to.

Seriously, all of your can be countered pretty easily.&nbsp;<br>Have you seen some other servers that are the same or bigger size than Avicus?&nbsp;<br>Their staff don't do crap.<br>(Cough cough) Mineplex.&nbsp;<br>Furthermore, ban for no reason?&nbsp;<br>I'm guessing it was a simplified version of what you said?&nbsp;<br>The person that said () spammed it in caps and then proceeded to not stop after being warned.&nbsp;<br>Most of the other stuff have already been covered with favoritism, but seriously, they don't...&nbsp;<br>Mostly, they just know that their friends who are usually experienced players on Avicus, only do that if they're crazy. Once in like a hundred times, especially if someone prestiges, you sort of have the privelege to use caps during that situation. Typed on an Ipad.

I not saying that is the staffs fault. I just thinking that i might leave and I have an opinion i felt like sharing on the forums. If you see me play, it will be my brother, who also plays on my account. If I am active on the forums it will be one of us. I just might take a long or short break form Minecraft or leave forever. I am just expressing my opinion about the server which makes me feel this way.

I agree with many people here. &nbsp;There are many individuals in the staff (not naming anyone) &nbsp;that really need to get their act together on the grounds of favoritism, unfair punishment/treatment, etc. &nbsp;Luckily, we are getting a new influx of Mods/Jr.Mods, so that's a good sign on a newer, brighter horizon.
