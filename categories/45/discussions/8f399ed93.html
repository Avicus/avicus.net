<span>Thank you! Thank you very much!<br>Well it is official. Cacalmarin is 1 year old today and has been running the whole time. We have gone through some ups and downs. Had different people come and go. </span><br><span><br>Some epic wins and some spectacular fails and losses.We are still waiting on the official Avicus tourney... Fluey...*cough* *Make it happen Bruh* *Cough* and we have scrimmed different teams at different times. </span><span><br><span><br>We even branched out to form a DOTA2 team that is somewhat ready to go for some amateur tournament at some point in time... When we get organised...</span></span><span><br><span><br>I would like to thank Avumbaca for keeping the clan running when both nath and I would disappear for different reasons. For always just being there to chat and being probably the most mature in the clan (and the only girl). A big thanks to Stormz for always being around to goof off with us and teach us how to properly play dota! To stud also for his crazy weird jokes and his DOTA and Minecraft Sweg. A thanks to Jake for always making something sexual out of something that didn't need to be.&nbsp;</span></span><br><span><br>A&nbsp;big shout out to nathbrown. I suppose I owe you one for forming the clan with me on that hot summers day a year ago when we were pissed about not getting into another clan. You are a sweet cousin and know the ropes to dota real well.Thanks to CaptainDCRaven for all his coding and technological goodness he brings like what is a hack and what isn't really a hack but a mod and his internet help. Big thanks to lunax for being an awesome SMP buddy and the new Up and Coming&nbsp;DOTA player with his axe and Ogre Magi.</span><br><span><br>A thanks to Luxe for being salty and always being there to rib me and me rib you. You really aren't that Salty luxe, I just seem to make it like you are and then do make you salty! XD. A special thanks to Ingi for just being you our British ol' chap (I think that is it isn't it? :D). We know you wouldn't hack and so we are there for you if you need us pal.<br>Ech, Broo. it's good to have you in the clan man, glad to see that you have dota and great to have you play with us.</span><br><span><br>Izzy, Trans, Flo, I haven't got to know you well yet but I hope I do and I hope you can stay in the big happy family of Cacalmarin for a long time to come!</span><span><br><br>You guys are always so good you know how to cheer anyone up at any point in time. you have kept me in good company over the last year and hopefully for years to come.</span><span><br><br>Congrats guys! We did it. We are the longest running clan!<br><span><br>Banway Out!</span></span>

Hate to burst your bubble, but since it's related to your clan please post it on your team thread instead of making another one.
