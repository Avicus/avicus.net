I recently heard that it is not allowed to kill players behind the walls before the game starts, this is unfair because I have a clear shot at my enemy so why not kill him, and the target of the game is to kill other players, so if you want to stop people from doing it make a code or something to stop arrows from reaching the other place or make the walls higher or something but dont ban people for it

The point is that your attacking a person before the pvp starts.&nbsp;<br><br>The principle of walls is to prepare yourself before the walls drop. By doing what you did you ruined it.

If a map allows you to shoot at the enemy when you aren't supposed to it's the map makers fault and should be removed. I see no reason for this to be against any rules.

In the walls you start off in a zone, you have to get prepared (the build time) and then fight (pvp time). It is a glitch to be shooting people before the walls drop. Therefore you would be abusing a glitch and therefore it is tempbannable
