Depends on the circumstances but mostly I think it's fine. However, I don't believe there is a point if you are not likely to meet up in the near future.

Online relationships are interesting but do take a lot of dedication, as with physical relationships. You have to be devoted to the person, but online you just show devotion in some different ways. You absolutely have to know what the person looks like and talk to the person over voice to get a true feeling of who they are and how they feel. My advice is to be extremely careful and try to take logical judgements over pure emotions (as hard as that might be).<br><br>As for Avicus, you meet people in game and on out social platforms (slack, forums, teamspeak), and interact with them sometimes daily. It is natural to become attracted to a person and for people to become attracted to you. It is fine really as long as both parties agree on what not to share. You have to build up a lot of trust (more than IRL) in an online relationship. People have dated on this server, and many others, and just like any relationship, some have worked and some haven't. Just always use your best judgement.<br><br>Oh, and it always helps to meet the person IRL at some point soon in the future, that really shows devotion.<br><br>- ALM
