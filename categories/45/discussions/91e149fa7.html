I would reccomend u start coding HTML then css then start coding java.<br><br>A program I use to code java is Eclipse.<br>To code C++ I use notepad++ hu3hu3hu3hu3hu3<br><br>Coding is an ancient illuminate art started by nerds. "The guys who code" was the first coding clan where they sacrificed any m8 dat made a bug, that's why those who are part of the clan are in the very top high companys and even in world leadership controlling our minds. So you must not give up on coding or "The guys who code" will kill u before u tell the world our secrets.<br><br>Have a good day!

Yeah Samir is right, Start at HTML/CSS its a good base if you ever want to make a website and you can interwine it with JavaScript and a lot of diffrent code launges. Also, if you want to make a plugin you want to learn java :P

I remember when I told my dad once that I wanted to code, so he signed me up immediately for an advanced C++ class. I had a really rough time xD<br><br>But yes, HTML is great for designing websites and such, and Java is awesome for creating programs and such. With these two under your belt, you can be sure to learn any coding language you want!

I've heard python is a good place to start but don't quote me on that, I am not that knowledgeable about these things.

If your main goal for learning coding is to develop for Minecraft, don't even bother with HTML, CSS, or any of the web languages. Dive straight into Java. HTML will&nbsp;<b>not&nbsp;</b>help you with Java at all, since they are completely different. HTML is a markup language, while Java is a C-based programming language. Java is one of the easiest languages to learn, so it shouldn't be hard to start off with it.

Not a bad idea to wait until high-school to start Intermediate Java, if of course it's included in the program. To be 100% honest with you, somebody who is just beginning or is not yet in high school shouldn't be running a server.

Not following other's tips I started with Java. Is pretty simple when you get used to it but I think I'm on the basics still ;p
