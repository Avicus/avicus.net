Random Ping Issues?

Ok, so recently I had around 30ms on the server, now randomly I've started getting over 100ms on the server. I live in Canada and in a Province near where the servers are hosted (Quebec I believe) so I shouldn't have any issues...I have no clue what it is.

Is it a consistent 100ms or is it fluctuating a lot?

I'd think they'd just switched hosts. Doesn't seem that way though, does it?

Try playing on BL or Kohi with 110ms when you're used to 22-30 on those servers. It's horrid, but at least you take zero kb.

Yeah, but that's around the point where ms is abusable T_T&nbsp;<br>It's more 350+ range doe.

On peak hours, I can't even connect to Avicus anymore. It just gets stuck at "Downloading terrain" for me. However, if I do get on, my ping ranges from 400ms-500ms.

I usually get around 20ms to Avicus, but when I checked yesterday, it went up to 100ms. Is it the server or is it us? It looks like a lot of people have been getting these issues, but Shadow said that it's happening to him on Kohi as well.

Oh, this is why your appeals got rejected, if you'd stop doing that type of things you maybe would get unbanned. Stop doing this, if you want to be unbanned. Do it for me :c<br><br>Okay, On-Topic:&nbsp;<br>I live in Buenos Aires, Argentina (around 13.000 miles from Quebec) and I get 170 ms with 1 MB p/s of connection speed. The connection speed and location is very bad, but any way I get less than 170 ms.
