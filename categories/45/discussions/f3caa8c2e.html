I have noticed that in Nebula when you are on defense and you die and the other team wins people start pointing fingers like arrows in a tornado, why does this happen and how do you handle the situation? do you go along with the crowd or do you think about it? it has happened to me and let me tell you, it feels horrible to get the finger of shame, has it happened to you and how do you handle it? to me, I stand up for myself and tell what gone wrong. Explain down below, thanks.

I enjoy defending because that gives people a chance to be a leader and communicate with the other teammates/ bond with the teammates, I had a few people I didn't get a long with and when I got on the team with them and defended with them it made me learn better about the person and get along with them. Rushers also become leaders to the team directing them what to do but when the team looses I just say okay and I think about what went wrong and what can be changed on the defense.

"the finger of shame" lol good one<br>Just ignore them, you know that you defended and it doesn't matter if you lost if you tried (unless it was a tournament then it'd be a different story, in that case you deserve the finger of shame)<br>And telling them what went wrong is ok i guess but how many will listen anyway lol every time i rek some scrand and they call me a pinger on badlion (which i am btw) and try to tell them it's not all about ping and they should also consider if that person that beat them were just a lot better. So far only 1 person believed me and i had a dumbass conversation with him for like 10 mins xd.<br>Waste of time pretty much.<br>And if it's too much and you can't take it, i'm sorry but you just gotta give it up until you can take it, that's just how it is.

When I'm low on energy I prefer to defend, but after doing sport or something I enjoyed I'm bursting to rush and pvp with loud music. O.o<br><br>Pointing fingers is natural for anyone, some may do it more than others and in harsher ways, but we all have done it at least once. When people blame me I just laugh, shake it off, because I know they're just mad and don't want to blame themselves. When I do muck up in scrims and do get blamed I will accept it and move on, arguing about something that's already happened is a complete and utter waste of time.

I don't tell them what went wrong I tell myself what went wrong and try to build a different defense. Bridges, not good, water okay to slow down the player, glass it's okay but it will really mind crash you. but yeah I still tell my team it's okay we will get it next time!

I would have to strongly disagree as well. There's plenty of players not in tourney teams who want to tryahrd in normal games. Also it's a good way to teach newer players tactics and how to defend properly (not just cover it in wood.) You should see it as a challenge to get past a defense , not a chore. Besides you get more credits the longer the game goes on anyway.

^^^^^^^^^^^<br><br><br><br><br>@OP The reason most people don't defend on pubs is that it's tedious, boring and that they don't credit for it. If a team wins the match, the defender doesn't get rewarded or complimented. If a team loses the match, the defender gets blamed. It's hard being a defender, most prefer being a rusher

Well there's another perspective to that too.<br><br>Every time I win on defense, I feel so good, because I know of contributed to the win. &nbsp;Where if my team wins and I'm rushing, I feel okay, unless I'm the one who got a mon. &nbsp;I just feel so much more victorious when my team wins and I'm on D. &nbsp;Because I know I affected the game.<br>Where when I rush lol, most of the time the game would have been the same with or without me there

Who are they to point fingers? You don't see them trying their ass off to defend. If other defenders blame you because you "died" you just simply say, "You could not do better". If someone got pissy at me, I'd just accept it. Who cares what they say? They're just a bad team mate

Yes, but thing is there are a lot more rushers than defenders in avicus games so it becomes much more important to have decent defenders.
