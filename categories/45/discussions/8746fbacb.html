<div>When I was admin one of the things I was working on was trying to get the Team based gamemodes, from a competitive aspect, out there. Whilst I am no longer admin and I no longer play Minecraft actively, some of the other people are still continuing what we started. The people i was working with wanted the Minecraft Competitive scene to grow as a whole and not just on one server. Not going into too much detail, the first part of the plan was to provide players who are serious about competitive minecraft with opportunities, on all servers including Avicus. The best way of doing this was to create some kind of hub and provide events/opportunities for players.</div><div><br></div><div>Some of the guys have made a discord which will act as a hub for competitive players who want regular events on Avicus. They’ll be hosting multiple competitive events, including on Avicus. So if you’re a competitive player and you want to participate in more competitive events on Avicus, and even if you want on other servers, then this discord is your best bet right now. We’re working on other things for competitive Minecraft but for now the first part is just about providing players, on all servers, with lots of opportunities.</div><div><br></div><div>For those interested;</div><div><div><a href="https://discord.gg/DAEjfgv">https://discord.gg/DAEjfgv</a></div></div><div><br></div><div>FYI Staff I got permission from an Admin to post this.</div>

Zicuri is the only &nbsp;competent &nbsp;one "hosting" these tournaments as over ten teams witnessed in last weekends tournament&nbsp;<br><br>though I do like this, something like this needed to be made.
