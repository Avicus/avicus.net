Hi all,<br><br>Recently I've been very inactive on &nbsp;Avicus due to many reasons. Mainly I just don't enjoy Avicus as much anymore and don't feel the urge to come on so often. I found this server almost 2 years ago now through a friend and since then I've made countless friends and had a great time!&nbsp;<br><br>I will still come onto the forums occasionally and maybe teamspeak sometimes. If you want to talk to me about anything, feel free to add me on skype, <i>PavThePavlova</i>.&nbsp;<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><b>Special Thank You's&nbsp;</b><br><i>There would be far to many of these, so I'm just going to do people who've been <u>very </u>close to me.</i><br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><b>Para&nbsp;</b><br>You and Evo are like map making gods. Both of you inspired me to get into map making. You were always there when I need a question answered or help in something. You may not realize it, but you've done so much for me. &lt;3<br><br><b>Evo</b><br>You're just amazing. I love your maps, and you always gave me great feedback and encouragement on my maps. That really meant a lot to me, and I don't know where I'd be&nbsp;without&nbsp; that. You and Para almost guided me into the MapDev team and made me feel welcome. You showed me the ways of map making, and it's been great working with you!<br><br><b>Ashley</b><br>I only became friends with you a few months ago, but it's been awesome! I don't know how you found me on here (stalking? :P), but it's been lovely playing and chatting with you. I've had some epic times with you!&nbsp;I might come on teamspeak sometimes to chat :D<br>&nbsp;Love ya &lt;3333<br><br><b>SnowSX3</b><br>The Avicus New Zealander! Man, you've guided me so much through my short period of moderating. You pointed out where I could improve and what I was doing well. Barely anyone was as much help in moderating as you. And before that you were such a great friend to me. Thank you for everything!<br><br><b>MapDev team</b><br>You guys are all great. You're always all supportive and helpful. I could count on you for just about anything and I love you all &lt;3<br><br><b>The rest of the Staff Team</b><br>Even before I became a mod you guys were all so nice to me. You are all helpful and supportive and I don't know what else to say xD It's been sweet working with you all!<br><br><b>Everyone else</b><br>To all of you who were great friends to me, helped me in anyway, or I just forgot to mention, Thank You all! I've loved every minute of my time here with you guys.&nbsp;<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>If i every hurt someones feelings, I am genuinely sorry. I'd never want to intentionally offend anyone and I hope you forgive me if I have.<br><br>You guys all rock!<br><br><b>Thanks </b>:)

Pav!<br>Honestly, you're one of the more dedicated staff members I've met. I've always been envious of your map making skills.<br><br>You were an awesome Moderator, you were friendly towards the community and always showed improvement in every aspect. You took all the constructive criticism and overcame it to better yourself, and it wasn't going un-noticed.<br><br>Thanks for helping me represent New Zealand in the staff team :D<br><br>Good luck in life and in NCEA :P<br><br>o/
