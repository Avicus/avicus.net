Well, I don't really know how to explain it, but I asked for people to join CTH and we had from what I can recall one of the best games in Avicus history.<br><br>It lasted for about 45 minutes, and it had a peak of 23 players.<br><br>It was so hard to get into the hill as everyone was using Demo!<br><br>It was too much fun, I earned 500 credits from it.<br><br>Green team emerged victorious by 60 points, after a very hard fought and long battle of egg grenades.<br><br>Thanks to everyone who was part of it, it was hilarious, I hope it happens again sometime!<br><br>I also think that this match helped build the CTH community as a whole - hopefully it has now encouraged players to join more often, me being a big fan of CTH for a long time.<br><br>Here's to more CTH!<br>Myv

Can you change it to 2 eggs? I'm pretty sure we had a discussion somewhere that 1 was too underpowered and 3 too overpowered.

How is 1 underpowered? It's a guaranteed kill with no work.
