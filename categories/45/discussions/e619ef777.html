I think the staying power is amazing.<br>This server has had a lot of highs but more importantly it's had a lot of lows and I think it really shows how dedicated the people who play on this server really are. <br>Because after all the ups and downs this server is still running and it's running comfortably. Which I personally think is amazing.

Avicus is that one guy in gym who never does amazing (but not bad) at anything, but then in one sport he dominates. The sport is the community.

The community is very good, staff is steadily improving as weeks go by but the server itself is becoming stale - that is - only one gamemode being online. Once atlas comes out hopefully there will be expansions of gamemodes.

Staff is shit (with few exceptions), there's really only 1 game that everyone plays on Avicus, The attempts to improve Avicus aren't that great or helpful, and the community on all platforms of the server (forums, teamspeak, and Avicus in-game) have become total shit and now I'm triggered .

The community here is incredible. Pretty much everyone is friendly and helpful. While there are a bunch of different things to do, it seems like dtm is the only thing anyone plays, so a bit more variety there would be nice. Overall a great server!

The main reason why Avicus has never really "died" is because of the community. There will always be that group of people who will never give up. It has got a lot of potential, but it's a lot harder then it looks.

savage. <br><br>OP: I like Avicus, I played this server for a long time I don't want it to die and I'll try everything even though I can't do any developer stuff or anything else I'll always try to give suggestions. One thing that really shines out that I like about this server is that the officials and admins know what the hell they are doing. I can safely say that in comparison to OCN that this server the staff actually LISTEN to the community. The officials are really smart as well in this server like we have people who are experienced in tournaments and know how pvp works such as: Tazz, Cyclops, Pie, Sli etc. The admins as well know what they are doing and the devs are doing a great job of developing Atlas (it should be almost finished just a few bug fixes) and the fact they are hosting events to test it on "beta.avic.us" shows that they want the community to engage and give them feedback. The UHCs hosted in this are hillarious as fuck I love them xD. Also, teamspeak is just hillarious and great I feel like teamspeak a lot of avicus players chill in there and talk to people. Mega scrims as well are great it allows people to have fun and show their abilities in game (although it can be a cluster fuck). My only disappointment in this server is that for them to create better maps because the maps are so stale. Atlas looks sexy though so I'm really happy for this server :)

Imo the maps are really bad, staff aren't that good, and there are too many gamemodes. To the people saying the gamemodes are stale some are but dtm isn't, its the maps which make DTM stale. Almost every map I have played is just a few lanes with monuments on islands which leads to gameplay being the same.

Avicus is like the really old car in your shop that you've renovated and re-upholstered multiple times, but still seems really weak and outdated no matter how much you try to cover it up. It also runs the same way, where sometimes it starts up beautifully and runs with perfection as opposed to other times when it breaks down and is unusable, making you feel sad and disappointed that you can't spend your day the way you wanted to and have to resort to other means. But regardless of all of this, you've been with this junker for so long and have grown a connection that makes you never wanna get rid of it.

The community is exceptional, I love that we haven't updated to 1.9, I feel like the Devs have improved greatly since they were criticized a ton earlier, the Mod team is pretty good right now, and the Seniors are way better than they were a few months ago, but they still have a ways to go. Overall Avicus is trending upwards since the all time low we hit in I would say the 2nd half of 2015, and hopefully that will continue.

<b>Cons:</b><br>Lack of players resulting in less interesting games not only by the player amount but also by playing games with people you've already seen a million times. This also means that there is less competition as you already know a lot about the opponent's skills and there's no almost no new people that would become regulars, and in turn a tougher opponent which would make the game more interesting. This obviously lowers the drive to play at least for me.<br>I know nothing about the staff here so I'm not going into that.<br><br><b>Pros:<br></b>Nebula is very hard to get bored of, seeing as I've been here for a long time, so Avicus is good at keeping things interesting enough for a long time.<br>This server at least used to contain less salty whiners than what I see on other servers.<br>This is a personal reason but this server isn't extremely competitive which means that it's easy to rack up kills on the occasional new batch of noobs, which in turn makes my kd higher which makes me feel awesome.<br>Avicus is original in the sense that there aren't many servers out there like this, which makes this server of more value in my eyes, especially since I enjoy the types of game modes that this server provides.<br>Even though this server isn't very competitive in the main gameplay it gives those more competitive a platform to play more competitively, which are the tournaments and scrims. Not only does it make avicus more enjoyable for more people in the gameplay sense but it also improves communications skills through Teamspeak and whatnot which can be very important in real life as well.

I have mixed feelings about bowspamming. I mean I understand if it's in a situation where you're either low on hearts or getting teamed on or something but sometimes literally all people do is bowspam and it legit ruins gameplay. They stay in one place and never try to engage someone with a sword. I'm sorry but tactic or not it's fucking annoying and ruins gameplay.&nbsp;<br><br>But that's not my point. My point is even though Avicus has a lot of flaws the community is so awesome I can forget those flaws.

I have mixed feelings about bowspamming. I mean I understand if it's in a situation where you're either low on hearts or getting teamed on or something but sometimes literally all people do is bowspam and it legit ruins gameplay. They stay in one place and never try to engage someone with a sword. I'm sorry but tactic or not it's fucking annoying and ruins gameplay.&nbsp;<br><br>But that's not my point. My point is even though Avicus has a lot of flaws the community is so awesome I can forget those flaws.

I disagree, I don't think it ruins gameplay, I think it enhances it.<br><br>In my experience, generally, people will run behind cover when I start bowspamming them , which starts a nice short-range bow battle <br><br>because bowspamming is only useful&nbsp;when you can actually aim with a bow right after the person gets behind cover.<br><br>It is a legit tactic and it's quite easy to beat tbh if someone thinks it's bad it's because they can't avoid fast arrows that deal half a heart xD<br><br>Very rarely do people just stand still, eat my arrows then call me a noob...well..people do that last thing anyway but you get what I mean.

^<br><br>Also, if you want people to stop bow spamming, stop sword spamming... :P<br><br>Just... runnin' along and wildly swinging a sword all day in a block game isn't really much of an achievement, is it? ;)<br><br>Where as learning to shoot and lead your targets can be applied to all shooting games and fighting games, overall "bow-spamming" is a legit tactic and is a lot more advanced than sword-spamming.

Imo the maps are really bad, staff aren't that good, and there are too many gamemodes. To the people saying the gamemodes are stale some are but dtm isn't, its the maps which make DTM stale. Almost every map I have played is just a few lanes with monuments on islands which leads to gameplay being the same.

Maps arent bad, staff are, mehhhhhhhh, and there is too many game modes people dont play, thats true, but DTM being the same is the whole point man, breaking a monument is so satisfying that u want to break more. ;p

I mean the type of bowspamming where people never get our of their team's spawn and never even scroll to their sword. The other kinds are pretty annoying as well but I've learned to cope with them, but that kind is literally impossible to counter unless you have god aim with a bow. And usually you can't even shoot back because most of the other team is trying to kill you.<br><br>Anyways, can we get back on topic?
