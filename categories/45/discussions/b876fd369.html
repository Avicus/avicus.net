Also just on the Quake Pro thing, it really depends on the individual. I used to use QP and then I turned it down a bit, and it MASSIVELY helped. But I still know people like Plaza and theo who can play well on QP. The target becomes smaller and some people can keep up with it. Personally I find it SUPER annoying with speed II, but it's personal preference I guess. :/

I mainly gave you my advice because you were using the default faithful, I felt like I'd hook you up with a nice and plain edit. You are almost denying that turning FOV down improves accuracy. All I am trying to do is give you advice and all you're doing is acting hostile.
