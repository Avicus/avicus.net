I am not sure if you guys know who this man is; however, in Pakistan he is one of the greatest men ever to live. I myself was not fully aware of what he did until he died. However, after learning about his work I felt really horrible to see someone like him pass on. <a href="http://tribune.com.pk/story/1138127/abdul-sattar-edhi-life-pictures/" rel="nofollow" title="Link: http://tribune.com.pk/story/1138127/abdul-sattar-edhi-life-pictures/">Edhi</a> set up a network of Ambulances inside of Pakistan that have more reach then the actual government ambulances. In fact, when conflicts were happening and Edhi ambulances showed up, the fighting factions would stop and let the ambulances pick up the wounded before fighting again. His organization the Edhi Foundation, has rescued 20,000 abandoned infants, helped 50,000 orphans, trained 40,000 nurses. Moreover, he has many soup kitchens, rehab homes and shelters. As I said before his ambulances are also the largest ambulance service in the world. He has supplied aid from the Middle East all the way to the United States (Hurricane Katrina). He is largely known as Pakistan's Mother Teresa.<br><br>I find some of his quotes equally as thought-provoking:<br><br>- "<span style="color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; ">People have become educated, but have yet to become human."&nbsp;<br>-&nbsp;</span>“So, many years later there were many who still complained and questioned, ‘Why must you pick up Christians and Hindus in your ambulance?’ And I was saying, ‘Because the ambulance is more Muslim than you’.”<div><span><b><br><br><i></i></b><i></i>R.I.P<br></span></div>

What a great man, the world needs more men such as him and the "Doctors without Borders" people... These monumental people are gods among all of humanity.<br><br>His legacy has surely left a great mark on all of Pakistan, and I hope that many others take after this man's example.
