<span>Hello, everyone. I just want to start this off with a solid apology. Recently I've been fairly inactive, and I'd like to inform you why.<br><br>As many of you reading know, school in the United States recently began again, starting more High School work for me. All of the work has been fairly overwhelming, and I haven't really had any time to get online. And when I do, it's not for as long as I'd wish I could be on for.<br><br>Secondly, football. I recently started football for my first year this year, and it takes up my entire day if you include school. Here's my schedule:<br><br>6:10 AM, wake up call.<br>7:40 AM, school begins.<br>2:10 PM, school gets out.&nbsp;<br>2:45-5:00 PM, football practice.&nbsp;<br>5-15 approximate home arrival time.<br><br>From there I do homework until dinner (usually around 6:30-7:00), then after dinner I continue homework. After that, I go online. But I go to bed at 10:30 to give myself a good amount of sleep, so I don't have much time online. Plus my dad's computer I used to use recently blew up, (died) so I can't play 4 out of the 7 days because I have no computer to use anymore.&nbsp;<br><br>So this thread was just to inform you on why I've been inactive lately. I'll try to become more active soon.<br><br>-JakeFromStateFarm</span>

I can only go on at around 7 oclock after school, but at weekends I can go on all the time at the moment - I ain't got no homework! Well, I have French and German revision xD

Well, you should try to enjoy all the time you spend with us on Avicus &lt;3<br><br>I know what your school schedule feels like; I get out at 2:45 three days of the week to go to sports (if anyone is wondering, I am a fencer), and I get back from that at about 6:30. It's hard, but manageable.

It's fine, Jake. School takes up almost all my time as well, but I imagine your schedule is much more packed.<br>Don't forget to make some time to get in-game! ;)
