So as the title says on top,<br>this topic that I am going to share is about<br>Scary Stories.<br>So I would like to share a Ghost Story,<br>and you community is going to write your scariest stories<br>that you have heard.<br>So here we go, here is my story first.<br><br>One day, there was phone call in the police station in Japan.<br>One of the police officer received the phone call, and he stood <br>there for about 3 minutes and hung up. One of the friends asked him<br>what the call was for, and the guy who got the call told them that <br>there is a ghost out way in ***block **way. The person who made<br>this call said that he saw some weird sounds coming from one of<br>the apartment, and he saw something like screaming and something<br>like ghostly-shade of creature inside the apartment. So the police officers<br>gathered their things and went out to inverstigate. They were complaining <br>that they had gotten a prank call and that ghost was all fake. When<br>they arrived at the apartment, the guy who should be waiting for them was<br>no where to be seen. They cursed the man for the prank message when<br>they suddenly heard a voice. ''!%#DDNGDD%$^@^$26NO6OO2642^@^''<br>The sound was coming from the apartment. They was frozen for about 10 <br>seconds, but then one of the police officer grabbed the other officer and <br>told them to see what was happening in the apartment and something was<br>going wrong. When they went inside the apartment, they hear the same voice<br>again. '!^!@^@^#@^fGRRrrR%@^^@^yuuUUMM$^&amp;@''<br>The police officers banged the door to get in, but the door was locked.<br>So they break in the door and were frozen to their feets when they<br>saw it.<br>There was something.<br>Something which made them not to go in.<br>Something that made them lost their souls.<br>They saw a woman.<br>a woman who looked really ugly, and blood everywhere.<br>The woman was sitting at the ground, eating a horriblly disgusting meat.<br>And the meat was everywhere, and it was hard to identify it.<br>The woman looked at the officers, and screamed.<br>She screamed and poured something whitish-liquid over there faces.<br>The police officers tried to move, but they couldn't.<br>The woman was smiling, and she suddenly burst opened the <br>refrigertor door. Inside it, there was all blood over it and she took out<br>something red. It was a heart. She chopped it in half and ate it happily.<br>She said, ''!%!%$!%yumm!%!^!^41yumgrr165''<br>she said also, '' Heeeeeey THEEEERE!!!!!!!!"'<br>''DO you Knooow WHAT I ma eatATTINGG?''<br>''It is my HUUSsbnnndd!!!<br>'' HE is really TASSSTYTYY!!! YU,! YOU WANNA HYhhave SSOOOmmmee?''<br>The officers fainted, and only one stand alone.<br>The one officer was really terrifed and tried to calm himself but it didn't worked.<br>The woman took out something slimy.<br>She brought out a straw, and poked the slimy thing.<br>she drank something like whiteish liquid.<br>And the officer realized that she was drinking the same thing that<br>she threw to the officers.<br>She Said:'' YUM!!!! MMY HUUSABNANDD 'S BRAAINNN IS THE MOOOST<br>JUCCIIISEDST THING IIII HAVAVEE DRAAANKK!!''<br>''MMy HUuuSSBAnd,, HOW DOEOOESS THHHAT LOOKK SSSLIIIKE? YOOOUUU LIIIKEEE IT??? YOU SHHOOOULLDNN;;T HHAVVE TOUCHHHED ME.. NOW LOOK ATTT YUUUU HAHAHAHHA'!!!!!!''<br>The officer fainted at that moment.<br><br>The story is unclear after this sentence, because this was the only thing<br>i heard until. This was a true story.<br>So there you go, and you guys write!

My scariest story was when EricV4 changed his skin to the derp-face, I still get nightmares and dream about him. The end. xD (No offence, I'm just joking, I'll write a story when I'm home from work in a couple of hours).

Real dream, mind you. NSFW.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>I just woke up and all the clocks in my dream were set to 5:50 - I didn't even look at the time until now and I woke up. There was a person with a dead toddler as a face, rotted, trying to break down my doors and kill me. Parts of my family already died and it's almost entirely too real. I ALWAYS forget my dreams, but this one; every single hair, every single piece of skin, every move was real. Every step was so realistic. Everything was the exact same and eventually once he started chasing me I grabbed a pistol and shot it in the head 3 times; one in the eye, two in the brain.<br>It grabbed a box cutter and started shredding it's skin like cheese. It said "Help me." three times and everything turned misty as well as dead toddlers piling up around me. Suddenly, my entire family disappeared and I had a heart attack. All kinds of chest pains, my heart is racing, and for some reason my muscles are really dead. When I woke up, he was standing over me until I opened my eye again and he disappeared. I know it seems like a nosleep story, but every single thing I just felt I do not want to ever feel again, and I don't know the cause.

<h2>I love u mommy &lt;3 (ghost story) 1</h2><br>A few days ago, the Friday, at 1.01 AM I was hungry. When I went to the door of my "Bodew" ( I called Bodew the kitchen) and when I was opening the door, I heard some strange sounds. It was my mum in the kitchen floor, with blood, and saying "Bad, Bad, Bagghhhness....", and she disappeared. After it, I went to the NYC police office, but it was empty, only a note in the door saying in blood:&nbsp;<br>" UR HANDSSS ARE DARKS...... YOU KILLED HER!"<br>I looked my hands and nothing was happening...... I didn't understand it. All New York was empty. Was in this moment, that I understand that I was crazy.<br>I went back to my house, but when I saw the ghost. I didn't know it.<br><i>Sorry for grammatical errors...<br></i><h2>PART 2 COMING SOON....</h2><h2>&nbsp;THIS IS TRUE!</h2>

A few nights ago, I had a dream about the zombie apocalypse. It was with my sister. We were the only people for miles, maybe the only ones left.<br>I saw my sister get bitten. "Maddy! Burn me to death. PLEASE. I don't want to be one! Please!" I had a flame thrower, and I cried as I set it off. Despite being an introvert, I felt sad being the only one left. It was an eeriness that was undescribable.<br>I pointed my gun at the horde and opened fire. Crying as gunshots pierced the silence. I missed my sister. The undead kept on coming and coming. It was me against them. But they came from all over. I couldn't win.<br>I felt something tackle me from behind and claws dig in me. I was down. I felt their rotton teeth sink into me. I was the last person, dead. Humans are extinct. Having multiple undead beings eat me was the worst experience of my (dream) life, but I could feel it.<br><br>I woke up and had scratch and bite marks on me. We live within a mile of a graveyard. (This is 100% true.)

I saw a ghost in my castle. I was very scared. I ran away, but it kept following me. Then I decided to send out charizard to battle it. The ghost got 1-hit KO'd and then I realized I was in hogwarts, and the ghost was of Marowak! erh, I mean, A hogwarts ghost! And then a skeleton popped out.
