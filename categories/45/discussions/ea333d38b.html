My mom bought me a laptop while I was at school and I was just setting it up and I did some research on it and it supposed to get 300-400 fps, but it doesn't. I don't know what to do, this computer seems like a scam and I thought it would be good, these are the specs:<br><br><div>&nbsp;</div><div>MSI - 15.6" Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 - 1TB Hard Drive + 256GB Solid State Drive - Aluminum black<br><br><br>Btw: i7 is 6th generation.&nbsp;</div>

i would make sure none of the parts are chinese fakes<br><br>on a more serious note, i used to have a rather high end laptop and i found that for some reason whenever i launched minecraft i'd have to right click the icon and select the graphics card from the contextual menu. if you go in game, make sure it says your graphics card is a 1060 and not intel integrated graphics. also idk if you laptop has a 4k screen, but if it does you probably should turn down the resolution if you want more frames as well.

yeah make sure the graphics card is actually being used and your computer isn't by default going straight to integrated graphics<br><br>on a more serious note, i used to have a rather high end laptop and i found out that for some reason whenever i opened up the laptop i would experience quick flashes of depression and anxiety attacks. if you really think about it, the laptop is often causing these mental problems and fills you with regret and self hatred. if i were you i would probably get a refund on the laptop and try to reevaluate on the mistakes you have made.

How much did it cost? I expect something over 1800$ (ok maybe less than 1800$ because where I live PCs are more expenisve), if it was like 800$, then it's obviously a fake.<br>Press F3 while you're in game (doesn't matter when/where) and look at the top right where it somewhere says "Display: ......" just one line below, does it say "GeForce GTX 1060..." or "Intel"? If it says something with Intel: Right click on your Desktop, go to NVIDIA Settings, click on the "Manage 3D settings" tab at the left side and then switch from "Auto-select" or "Intel...something" to your NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060, or whatever it says and save the setting. The next time you start Minecraft, it should automatically use your GPU and get you&nbsp;<b>a lot more</b>&nbsp;fps. On mid-settings much more than just 300-400 fps.<br><br>This is a common problem for laptops with integrated Intel graphics.
