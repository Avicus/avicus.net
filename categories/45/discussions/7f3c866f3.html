Instead of asking others maybe look up how to do it on Youtube? I just think you'd be able to work so much more efficiently if others weren't doing it for you :P

Ok:<br><br>1. Find the pack you want to use as a canvas. Usually you should use something like Faithful as a resource pack to add everything to. This pack is just serving as a spot to hold all of your swords and needs. You can change the name, description, and items, don't worry.<br><br>2. Open this pack with Winrar. Go to "assets", then hop on to "minecraft", then into "textures". Once you've done that, you'll see an ass load of files. Each has its own properties. GUI has chest inventories, your inventory, your crosshair, hearts, etc. Items has items such as swords, food, etc. Particles are self explanatory. Just look around in the other files and double click them to display the image. It's fun looking through them to see what each thing is :)<br><br>3. Do the exact same thing as step 2, only open the resource pack in which you would like to add a feature from. Now you should have two tabs open: one for Faithful, and one for the resource pack you'd like to take your item from (whether you want the sword, inv, etc).&nbsp;<br><br>4. Now for the simple part. Let's say&nbsp;<b>for example</b>, you like the diamond sword in Sphax and you want it in your pack. Go to "items", press "d" on your keyboard (if everything is not in alphabetical order, click the small arrow above all your files to put it in order), then you should look and find "diamond_sword". Do this for both tabs. This part is really simple: Drag the diamond sword from Sphax and put it into the Faithful pack. Simple as that. This is the exact same thing for any picture of any pack of any kind.&nbsp;<br><br>Any problems?

<span>Ok I just wanna say sorry :P<br><br>You got it all wrong.I know all the things you just said, what im talking about is multiple assets of a widget or icon image in the GUI folder. Im talking about for instance having Huahwis circular crosshair with Toxicwastell pack hearts and Defscape food bar, or &nbsp;a Sphax hotbar and selector, but default menu icons.<br><br>Thats why I need a professional resource pack maker, like _Phyre (Vsplesk101)</span>

The icons are good, but you need to edit the widgets (Hotbar, noy including the selector thingy, and the menu GUI, and remember the selected menu GUI isnt the same as the one I want.
