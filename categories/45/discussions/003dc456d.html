Basically if you build your own you can get a good gaming PC for a total of 2 to 4 K. But it takes one and research for inexperienced computer users (meaning you don't know the insides if a computer)

Honestly, a 3k+ pc for only gaming is a complete overkill

I don't think you're going to need a very good computer to be able to max out minecraft and make quality recordings. I bought a $650 gaming computer called <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16883258020">Avatar Gaming Desktop FX6164</a> and I can max out the settings and still get a solid 70 FPS, which is really all you need. It's really the best computer you can get for that amount of money or anything closely above it. Personally, I think buying a computer for over 1k would be a waste, so maybe get a good, cheap one like I suggested, then donate the rest of the money to charity or something :D
