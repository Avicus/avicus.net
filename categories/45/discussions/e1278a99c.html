Hey,<br><br>I was recording a video and decided i wanted to do a video including some facecam in the corner. But the editing program I use now doesn't allow it. So I am asking if you have one I could use which will let me use facecam?

I think OBS or VSDC does it. In VSDC, you can add video layers so lets say "Video 1" is your main video and "Video 2" is your facecam. You can put video 1 as 1 layer and on top of that, video 2 can be your other layer where you can readjust and place ur facecam video.<br><br>idk :p but both are free however

Thats werid :/ I am not sure if I can help you there. VSDC isn't all the fancy type thing. Try adjusting the settings when you first create a new project I think there are some other free video editor softwares out there. I use Wondershare but the full version costs 40-50 bucks :/

Camtasia is really nice. You can put videos on other videos, which looks like a facecam section. xD
