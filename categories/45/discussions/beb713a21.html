Hello everyone! I'm not sure why I got demoted, and I haven't been told - I don't expect to either!<br><br>Anyway, I realized that this thing - gaming, as a whole, and minecraft too, has gotten to big for me... I know, I just got a new computer, etc, etc.. And I'll still play, occasionally, or whenever my friends want to go on, but for me, gaming is too big of a problem - I play too much, and, really, I'm not even that amazing. So, I really feel that I need to take a break from gaming<br><br>As I said earlier, I'll be on occasionally, but not really much... I'm going to try to earn some more pocket money, and start moving on with my life.<br><br>As SWEET_Johny said, "None of this will matter in 2 years!", and I realized that. I'm going to try to be more active, with my family, friends, and really, try to do something with the remaining years of my childhood / teenagehood (is that a word?).<br><br>I think the reason I got into gaming, like, on this level was because I had seen all of these youtubers gaming, earning lots of money. I started to get into it, and, bam - I was addicted. I've tried to stay away, to stop, but I just keep getting sucked back in.. :/<br><br>I guess what I'm trying to say here is, well, goodbye, on a much smaller scale, and I'm trying to warn you of the dangers of becoming addicted. Don't get caught in the same trap I did.<br><br>See you all later, people of Avicus...<br><br>I'd really like to thank<br><br>Avumbaca, SWEET_Johny, AwarriorVenom, and the people who made my stay at Avic.us worth a million bucks. I am glad that I at least got a chance, to moderate and keep people in check, temporarily. <br><br>&lt;3 -Hero

A good FightToWin exit.<br>I agree with all of this, I'm trying not to get sucked in. But I have nothing to do after school. So when school sports start I probally will forget all of this, and focus on that stuff.<br><br>Have fun in life dude. Just enjoy it while you can &lt;3
