A plane crashed onto an unmapped tropical island, there are three survivors. While exploring the island the three survivors come across a tribe of cannibals. They are captured and brought to the chief of the tribe who tells them "Go out into the jungle and bring back 3 pieces of the same fruit". The first survivor returns with apples and the Chief says "If you can stick them where the sun doesn't shine without flinching, I'll spare you." The first guy comes back with apples,&nbsp;he gets one in and winces, the chief immediately executes him. The second guy returns with cherries. He gets two in and is working on the third when all of a sudden he erupts with laughter. He's executed. In heaven the first guy asks the second guy "What the hell? You had it, what happened?". The second guy says "I couldn't help it, I saw the other guy coming back with watermelons."
