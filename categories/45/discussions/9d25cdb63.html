What do you think about that? Big servers like Badlion, Kohi, ParaPots and So on are now going to have 3 buyable unbans, 1st, 2nd And 3rd and Last. So, Do you think this should be implemented in Avicus?

Thats what appealing is for. If they are banned, they were obviously doing the wrong thing. They might pay to be unbanned, come back and start hacking straight away. This would just become repetitive.

Harry's right. If we implemented this, I guarantee a lot of hackers would pay themselves back and cause more havoc. Plus, we do give players chances to come back via appeals, but they can only come back with our approval (rather than monetary gain). In my eyes, paying to be unbanned from a server is more like a bribe than a relief.

It makes Avicus look bad. First of all, it would seem unfair to people who are banned to who have to wait a year, where some other guy, who has money to waste on a server (no offense) just comes right back. Also, the community has been pretty uptight about people appealing, and being banned before, and I'm sure some controversy will come from this. In addition, to new players who see people being unbanned because they have money, makes it seem like Avicus is desperate for money, because they are letting rulebreakers go free, and the only reason would be for profit. Lastly, for people who are banned, if they are good enough to come back, they can appeal.<br><br>If this were to happen, there should at least be conditions. Like, you have to wait 2 months before unbanning, or certain bans are different from others.

At first thought of this idea you would just say no , as if i see a server with a unban pass i automatically think negativity about it. Only logic i see behind it is why would someone pay to hack again? And if they did well , free money i guess.

I love looking at the ignorance of the mods on this thread.

Admins have shown me the profit made on avicus for a while, you actually fucking need this.

If people choose to hack after they buy a $5 unban, cool, free $5 on the cost of someone losing a calorie to type /unban. 

Make the 2nd unban $15, someone chooses to hack? Cool, more profit.

Up to whether you make the 3rd or 4th ban the last chance or w/e.

But hey, instead the mods are choosing to be idiots and going "no" without even thinking it through. Inb4 someone archives it (I'll be sure to see who archives it if it is :^)

I dislike the idea of buying unbans and the servers that do that.<br><br>Its an easy way for the server owner to get money out of (usually) kids that just took their parents credit card.<br>You sell them the unban and ban them again if they do it again but why? Again, easy money but you would ruin some matches and if a person really wants to get unbanned they will appeal.

This is so funny.<br>Okey to start of here, I'm all for buying unbans.<br>People lets be real here, you don't waste dollars to come back and hack in a block game, and if you do you really need to re-think how they are living life. Mods &amp; players are complaining on how the server would look "bad" and "how they would just come back and hack again". I find that&nbsp;hilarius.<br>To start of, it doesn't make the server look anywhere near bad. You're basically giving a player who has no chance what so ever to be able to enjoy a server they like again. And to be honest, I don't think McPvP was that bad untill they fucked up HG, or McBrawl until they lost playes, or a kitpvp server I played on until relog was a thing.&nbsp;<br>So, you're saying they would just come back and hack again? No, they would not. And what is the big deal of that anyways, if you're having trubble typing in /ban Robin_DD_J Hacking - Killaura or just can't tell if I'm using a triggerbot or not, you should retire now. It's their loss if they hack.<br><br>This server need money right now. To stay alive, to get people to start advertising and to pay new developers. I'm still having issues with gameplay, how some servers crash and stop work and the glitches like "fasthit".&nbsp;<br><br>You, need, this.<br><br>Im on my phone, so something might have messed up.

1) Just ban them again.<br><br>2) Have a limit to the amount of u bans you can buy, or make it more expensive as you buy them. For example, it might start as $10, then you get banned and want to buy another. Now, it's $25 instead of $10.<br><br>3) If people are paying money just to break the rules again, they need to find something better to do. Plus, they'll be gone before they know it.

So many people are against buying unbans because rule-breakers will just return and cause trouble. However, if the rule-breakers are willing to spend money to be unbanned from the server, just to break the rules again and get rebanned, then that's free money for Avicus. While I can surely see why people would not like the idea of adding this due to the before-mentioned point of rule-breakers returning and causing more trouble, we have to think about the server too. Unban passes are actually really nice when it comes to money-making, because the rule-breakers like causing trouble. If they are given an opportunity to cause more trouble, many of them will take that chance if the cost is cheap enough. They may cause trouble and disrupt matches, but we have punish/report commands for a reason.<br><br>Profits will certainly increase, which is very important for Avicus to continue running. There are definitely better ways for those profits to come in, but if there's ever a time when money is needed (meaning if the server is ever near the point of closing), then I 100% support this, from a money-making perspective.

I'm pretty sure someone would appeal a shit load of times instead of paying to get back on the server. &nbsp;I mean if someone gets caught hacking and they want to they really want to hack again, they'll just do it on another server instead of paying for a server that already knows they do. &nbsp;I mean I'm sure there are people on Avicus who have hacked before, appealed a ton, and got back on the server. &nbsp;In order for this to work you would make it permanent that if you ever hack a appeal isn't going to work.

So many people are against buying unbans because rule-breakers will just return and cause trouble. However, if the rule-breakers are willing to spend money to be unbanned from the server, just to break the rules again and get rebanned, then that's free money for Avicus. While I can surely see why people would not like the idea of adding this due to the before-mentioned point of rule-breakers returning and causing more trouble, we have to think about the server too. Unban passes are actually really nice when it comes to money-making, because the rule-breakers like causing trouble. If they are given an opportunity to cause more trouble, many of them will take that chance if the cost is cheap enough. They may cause trouble and disrupt matches, but we have punish/report commands for a reason.<br><br>Profits will certainly increase, which is very important for Avicus to continue running. There are definitely better ways for those profits to come in, but if there's ever a time when money is needed (meaning if the server is ever near the point of closing), then I 100% support this, from a money-making perspective. We can have a limit (ex. maximum of 3 passes), and if the person breaks the rules again, we reban them.&nbsp;<br><br>Excellence also brought up a nice point.

Kudos to this post.&nbsp;<br><br>@OP: The least we can do to make it fair for those who don't support this idea is to put the system to a test trial and see how it goes. If the outcome is bad (Eg. Increase of hacker attraction), we can remove it. It it works out well and the server makes a decent profit from it, we can debate on whether we should keep it or not/keep it.

Personally, I vote yes. The server needs money to keep going, and every opportunity should be taken. Sure, they might hack again, and get banned again. But then they could buy an unban again. That simply means more money for the server. Think about what Kylo could implement with more money, and where the server could progress to. But don't make buying an unban the <i>only </i>way to get unbanned, keep appeals.

I honestly do not think too badly of this. To those thinking this will make the server look desperate for money, you have to understand that getting enough funding to run the server is difficult, and If there is a simple solution that will lessen the tension building up financially, then it's a great idea. Also, if we run out of funds, the server will shut down and there will no longer be a server to look bad. Another thing is that if people really minded such a thing on a server, larger servers would be at a loss.&nbsp;<br><br>Secondly, if people do hack and buy themselves back on, we can be sure to keep am eye on them, if they are found hacking, it'll be a simple ban again. I also think that if people pay 10-50 dollars for an unban, they are less likely to hack because they know they spent money and don't want to waste it. Another thing, If they pay to get back on, it could also show that they seem to like the server enough to spend money for it, which probably means they don't want to risk being permanently banned. (This doesn't apply for people who have no value for money) And even if they do, it'll only benefit the server more with more income.&nbsp;<br><br>If this can help get the server back up on it's feet again by attracting players, we may not have to need it anymore, and can get rid of it by popular demand (that is l, if we get enough players and enough of an income using another method)<br><br>Sorry for any typos, I'm on my phone :P<br>~kammy

To be honest, I think that this is a good idea. As Peachy said, the server will make more profit with buyable unbans. Also, if someone buys an unban, they probably think that they are ready to be unbanned. If they decide to hack again, then it is their loss. Limiting the amount of unbans that you can buy is a definite.

You'd be surprised on how many people would happily spend a small bit of cash to come back onto the servers to cause more trouble. On another server that I used to play on, there was a few people that bought $100-$160 worth of passes (5-8 passes.. they were expensive xd), because they just continuously broke the rules over and over again, and kept getting banned. They didn't care, they enjoyed breaking the rules, and they had money in their pockets, so they used that money. Of course, not everybody did that, but there's always those few people &nbsp;that'll spend quite a bit of money on things like that, to get the opportunity to wreck havoc.<br><br>If the cost for the pass here was even $5, I can guarantee that people would buy them. It's weird, but people like causing trouble, and if the price to pay is low enough, those people will happily pay it to continue causing trouble.<br><br>Which again, is why I support this idea.

Quite a lot of people on avicus are people with gaming devices worth hundreds to thousands of dollars that were paid for by their parents. In comparrison to most people avicus players are rich and spoiled kids. As far as the OP goes I dont mind banning someone who wants to pay for a bunch of unbans. I think this decision would affect the players more than the staff and their opinions are the ones that should be considered for this idea.

Si, pero yo veo el punto de Jozz. Una persona puede se puede permitir el lujo de comprarse un Unban, Y otra no? No es justo. Si una persona se compra un donor y el otro/otra no puede, tampoco es justo.

So, I don't understand how it isn't fair then. Firstly, unbanning a player through purchasing unban tickets in the shop doesn't affect the gameplay ONE bit. Additionally, I know some players who REALLY want Gold, Emerald and sometimes even think about purchasing Diamond - yet they can't due to the affordability being incredibly low for them. <br><br>So this argument does go two ways. I can compare carrots and potatoes in this instance because they are under the same 'food' category - similar to how this argument is unfolding ;]

Personally, I vote yes. The server needs money to keep going, and every opportunity should be taken. Sure, they might hack again, and get banned again. But then they could buy an unban again. That simply means more money for the server. Think about what Kylo could implement with more money, and where the server could progress to. But don't make buying an unban the <i>only </i>way to get unbanned, keep appeals.

So, I don't understand how it isn't fair then. Firstly, unbanning a player through purchasing unban tickets in the shop doesn't affect the gameplay ONE bit. Additionally, I know some players who REALLY want Gold, Emerald and sometimes even think about purchasing Diamond - yet they can't due to the affordability being incredibly low for them. <br><br>So this argument does go two ways. I can compare carrots and potatoes in this instance because they are under the same 'food' category - similar to how this argument is unfolding ;]

Now that I look at it carefully... yes it should be implemented. However, it should be put into heavy moderation like limiting a person to only 2 or 3 unbans, each costing 25 dollars.<br><br>And a wait time for the unban to work through to make them wait: A week would be fair enough, or a few days? If they just buy an unban and immediately come on the server to eff up then they will have learnt nothing.<br><br>Money is good, but a sense of morale must come into play.

</div>
That's not the way I see it.<br><br>It's maybe not the 90%, but for me to actually support this idea I have to be 110% sure the player is not going to break the rules again, ever. Senior Moderators put all their effort into making players wait a certain amount of time so they learn what they did wrong and all that. Making unbans buyable would just scrap that time. Also it would, even if it's not the 90% but the 10%, make mods waste their time in punishing a player again. Rulebreakers are already a pain and punishing them takes its time to get the proof, ban, maybe look at an appeal, I really don't want to increase that not even by a 1%.

If he bought the unban and from what people are saying there are a limited amount of unbans to be purchased you think that there is a 90% chance they will still hack? and if he did hack again it would take about 20 seconds to just type /ban player reason... It wouldn't really affect gameplay at all

Ok you are literally over emphasizing this. 5 days to discuss appeals? Since when? How do you know?&nbsp;<br><br>It's part of being a MODERATOR. Its a volunteer job, so making the job easier on just us while keeping the financial position and community wants at bay is SELFISH. Why are you saying "it'll take too long to ban this player again"?
