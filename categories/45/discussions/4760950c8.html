<u></u>Hey Everyone!<br>Just asking for anyone who is interested what do you think of creating a Avicus Podcast?

I LOVE the idea, but a podcast only works if there's a mix of serious discussion with a little bit of banter.<br><br>I assume Avicus podcasts will just be an hour of stupid jokes, memes and banter the entire time, which doesn't make for the best listening experience.<br><br>But I'd be keen regardless, just my opinion.<br><br>Sign me up!

Yeah, no way I am using NCS... I don't really like their music. I am with another YouTube music channel that I use.

I was thinking of taking the latest Avicus news and ask for opinions and comments. I am thinking of adding memes and stuff like that too.

I intend to do this podcast a) however often it takes to make it b) how much support it gets and feedback as well.<br>I think to begin I will start with once every 2 weeks.<br><br><i>"</i><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><i>&nbsp;guessing/finding out the contexts behind quotes on the quote thread</i></span><i>"<br></i>Love that idea!

The podcast would need to be planned a lot so that discussion can be held throughout the entire stream. Interesting content would be a must, no one wants wishy washy content.

Agreed.<br>I would much rather prefer a 30 minute podcast that's entertaining throughout the entire video as opposed to a 1 hour podcast that feels dead and unorganised.

I completely agree with your point as well. I have done a podcast before on my main channel and I am hoping to use the same system as to just writing up points, stories, and segments to refer to if everyone is going off topic.

Next Question:<br>Naming Suggestions for the Podcast?<br>I was thinking Avicus Podcast or AviCast or Avi Podcast?

The Avicus Podcast would work fine imo, not too gimmicky.
