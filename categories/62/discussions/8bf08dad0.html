I honestly think running a tournament isn't that hard, and it's silly how many struggles the official team has trying to conduct them. I don't understand why something as easy as testing maps for feedback is something that is fallen short on, because the heart of any tournament (and really, the server) are the maps. Without maps, we wouldn't have a server.

We really need to outsource our official work to more experienced, successful servers. We've had a bunch of tournaments to fix our mistakes, but we haven't proven ourselves worthy within competitive Minecraft yet because we consistently have a bad wrap specifically because of the most basic issues. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to know how to run a bracket, maps, and refs. At the very least, basic cooperation between the staff sectors would be beneficial.<br><br>I'm wondering if anyone from Stratus/Badlion/RMCT/OCN/etc. would be willing to help Avicus pull itself out of the competitive rut, because this is one of the major legs of the server keeping it stable.

Planning tournaments is easy, I could have one done in an hour or two. The unofficial one I hosted last year was a huge success It just got stalled at finals because scrim servers were dead [LOL]. Yeah they just don't care enough. Priorities are not set correctly.

I find it very telling if a player who has no prior experience with a tournament being able to make a more successful and smooth running tournament than the officials, that the officials just aren't doing their best. 2 years ago you couldn't've told me that a player would end up eventually running a better tournament than people appointed and running their 6th tournament.

So after seeing that there is a backlash on some of the current maps. I would like to start improving on this map pool to make sure our next tournament is as good as it can be. I have talked to a few individuals and if you are in the tournament please continue the conversation in #general of the Tournament Discord for me to understand the want of the competitive community is. Here is some of the feedback I have received&nbsp;so far,<br><br>Replace:<br>Coral Reef<br><br>Add:<br>Apollo 13<br>Golden Drought 3<br><br>Please reply to me what you want for the tournament and share this with your team members to maximize the responses and to have an easy time pinpointing what maps to use. Thank you

No, it was regarded as a map unfit for a tournament by the teams that didnt understand it because they couldnt skybridge directly into the wool, and couldnt figure out a better, more up-to-date strat for the map. It plays great and challenges the cancerous skybridge meta, which are both positives imo.

How can i reserve a server to play a full game (45 minutes) when the longest I can reserve one is for 30 minutes?

+1. There is not too much days left to the tourney. This issue should be fixed soon so teams could practice in a better way.

it doesnt get hate for being a bad map, not at all. it gets hate for people complaining how avicus cant get their own maps so they get ocn ones instead.

A skybridge battle on rend isn't inherently a bad thing, the maps main problem is that it's too long but it plays much differently than the current island hopping map style trend which I think helps the pretty homogenous pool. It can really easily be fixed with a few edits by just making it shorter and making spawn time longer to compensate. Lowering the height limit would just make it impossible to sky and blur the line between ground and sky which ultimately just makes it impractical to rotate, and it deadlocks a map. Wahiz is really just a much worse version of this map with more stalemate and it's less fixable. GD3 is a good idea though.

We really need to outsource our official work to more experienced, successful servers. We've had a bunch of tournaments to fix our mistakes, but we haven't proven ourselves worthy within competitive Minecraft yet because we consistently have a bad wrap specifically because of the most basic issues. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to know how to run a bracket, maps, and refs. At the very least, basic cooperation between the staff sectors would be beneficial.<br><br>I'm wondering if anyone from Stratus/Badlion/RMCT/OCN/etc. would be willing to help Avicus pull itself out of the competitive rut, because this is one of the major legs of the server keeping it stable.
