Hello,<br><br>As some of you may know, the Officials had a meeting yesterday in which between many other things, we decided we will be using <a href="https://discordapp.com/" rel="nofollow" title="Link: https://discordapp.com/">Discord</a>&nbsp;for tournaments from now on.<br><br>When the tournament is announced, you will get a link to join the server.<br><br>You can use their Discord application (download link on the front page) or online website version.<br><br><b>What is Discord?</b><br><br>Most of you probably know what it is already, but for those who don't, Discord is a communication app specially meant and directed to gaming. We can resume it as TeamSpeak and Slack together. If you want to find out more about it, you can <a href="https://discordapp.com/features" rel="nofollow" title="Link: https://discordapp.com/features">click here</a>.<br><br><br><b>Why are you changing? TS is better!<br></b><br><b></b>Our reasoning as to why we switched to Discord:<br>- Almost no possibilities that the server goes down. If it does goes down though, it would not be an Avicus issue but a Discord one.<br>- The rank system gives us a completely effective way to manage and make sure who is in the team channel.<br>- It makes it easier for us to communicate with team leaders.<br><br><br>If you have any problems with Discord functioning correctly, either look them up on Google (the problem that you have has already happened to someone else) or feel free to ask for help here.<br><br><div class="row-fluid" style="width: 869.984px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; padding-top: 15px;"><div class="span12" style=" min-height: 1px; margin-left: 0px; width: 869.984px; "><div>Regards,</div><div><br></div><div>The Avicus Network's Official Team</div><div><br></div></div></div><br><br><b></b>

No need for Tournament discord, just private some channels, drag some refs in etc.<br>The perms pretty much work the same.

yeah to be honest the advantages of discord seem dubious at best but i guess everyone wants to use it because it's hip

I wan't saying we should keep teamspeak. I said instead of having a tournament discord, we could always drag people into a private channel instead.
