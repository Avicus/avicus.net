Hello.<br><br>All teams must now apply for a team channel when there is no tournament happening at the time. This is to organize team channels and a way so players with upcoming teams can create a channel without going through the old process. For all teams with a team channel currently, they have been removed and you must reapply to obtain it. Once the tournament begins, all teams registered for the tournament will automatically be granted the team channel then removed once again for another application period for team channels. Team channel applications will never be closed (even during tournaments) and will be available for anyone with a 12 or more players in a team to apply.<br><br>Team Requirements (<b>Banned players do not count towards the following requirements</b>):<br><ul><li>12 or more players in the team&nbsp;</li><li>10 or more players with 12 hours (or more) of playtime</li><li>10 or more players with 500 (or more) kills</li></ul><br><br>Here is the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfPqs3JVU4P_RRk9LO04vfTTGvqT_UHTdT0K9HEeFzopGwBEA/viewform" rel="nofollow" title="Link: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfPqs3JVU4P_RRk9LO04vfTTGvqT_UHTdT0K9HEeFzopGwBEA/viewform">application</a><br><br>Good luck with your application. All passwords and channel information will be sent to you via email.

Never liked this. As long as your team played in the tournament, and uses it often they should be fine. Better get responses right away when we send in our apps.

You do realise if there are bullshit rules like last time teams won't bother using the channels and will use like discord or their own Ts

great, another over-complicated attempt to solve a problem which no one cares about while simultaneously creating more work for both team leaders and staff members.&nbsp;<br><br>i also don't see any reason to have any requirement except team size. the other requirements are stifling the competitive scene a bit by making it difficult for newer teams whose players haven't been on avicus that long to get a teamspeak channel. after that, if it turns out no one ever uses the teamspeak channel, then delete it. there's no need to dick around with tons of applications and requirements, because in the end, you are only screwing over less established teams like my own. we use teamspeak quite a bit and we've certainly been active enough as a team in tournaments and such, but yet it feels like it's been an uphill battle to keep our teamspeak channel because we don't quite 100% have a bunch of people with 5000(!) kills. all in all, teamspeak requirements are just screwing over teams that actually use the teamspeak, just because they are less established.
