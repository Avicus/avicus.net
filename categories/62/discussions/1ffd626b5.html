<div>Hello,</div><div><br></div><div>With the recent way the scrimmage servers have been running, we have decided to change the system up a bit in order to fix some of the errors in the other system - such as not enough time for servers uptime per reservation or just problems with reserving them in general.</div><div><br></div><div>This system will incorporate the use of donator perks more and will obviously work for every user still. All you need is at least one donator to reserve the scrimmage servers (if you want the extra perks). Here is a brief run-down:</div><div><br></div><div><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/313331851315904512/329893640317042688/Screen_Shot_2017-06-29_at_2.59.24_AM.png" title="Image: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/313331851315904512/329893640317042688/Screen_Shot_2017-06-29_at_2.59.24_AM.png"><br><br></div><div>Max Instantaneous Servers | Max Servers per week (resets Sunday) | Max Length</div><div><br></div><div>Normal 1 | 5 | 45m</div><div>Gold 1 | 7 | 1h</div><div>Emerald 2 | 10 | 1:30</div><div>Diamond 4 | 15 | &nbsp;2:30</div><div><br></div><div>Each level of donator rank will receive different perks in regards to scrimmage servers. The <b>first number</b> is the max amount of servers that will be able to reserved by a specific single team. Please do not use all 4 reservations at a single time to get access to 4 scrimmage servers as it's considered hogging the servers and will lead to some form of punishment (possibly a blacklist from scrimmage servers for a specific amount of time). If it becomes a big enough problem, the numbers will be adjusted.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The <b>second number</b> is the max amount of servers able to be reserved per week. Users without donation perks will be able to reserve 5 scrimmage slots per week and so on as listed.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The <b>third and final number</b> is the max length of time that the server reservation will run for. If you do not want the full time available in your perks list then you are also able to select a specific time such as a reservation for 30 minutes instead of 2 hours and 30 minutes.</div><div><img src="https://images.discordapp.net/attachments/313331851315904512/330069664778682369/Screen_Shot_2017-06-29_at_2.38.52_PM.png?width=400&amp;height=218" title="Image: https://images.discordapp.net/attachments/313331851315904512/330069664778682369/Screen_Shot_2017-06-29_at_2.38.52_PM.png?width=400&amp;height=218"><br><img src="https://images.discordapp.net/attachments/313331851315904512/330069667039412235/Screen_Shot_2017-06-29_at_2.38.47_PM.png?width=400&amp;height=115" title="Image: https://images.discordapp.net/attachments/313331851315904512/330069667039412235/Screen_Shot_2017-06-29_at_2.38.47_PM.png?width=400&amp;height=115"><br><br></div><div><b>NOTE:</b> I will repeat this again as it's important: <code>Please do not use all 4 reservations (if you're a diamond donator) at a single time to get access to 4 scrimmage servers as it's<br>considered hogging the servers and will lead to some form of punishment (possibly a blacklist from scrimmage servers for a specific<br>amount of time). If it becomes a big enough problem, the numbers will be adjusted.</code></div><div><br></div><div>If there are any other problems or concerns regarding the new scrimmage server system, then please be sure to post it below or message an administrator.</div><div><br></div><div>Regards,</div><div>The Administation &amp; Development Team</div>

Really useless and unnecessary.. What's the point in allowing non donators to only be able to reserve scrims servers that last 45mins when most scrims last for that amount of time.. :/

Do you not use 1 sv for more than one scrim? As i usually find myself booking another server.

How do you use it I made a team specifically to test it out and it didn't work? It came out with an error and then when it finally let me book, it booked a server 10 hours after I wanted it

Two reasons why this has been bad so far...<br><br>Firstly, you are making leaders have to PAY for things they used to get for free, and should get for free. A two-hour scrim server is what a lot of people need, but you are giving them 30-45 minutes? This is quite ridiculous and you should probably change it. Some people go over the two hours, as mentioned above by Rocky.<br><br>Secondly, they don't even work? Now the fact they don't work isn't what I am trying to point out., It's the fact they don't work when A TOURNAMENT IS VERY SOON. You should have fixed the old scrim servers so they don't crash, and then spent more time actually working on an update that works, and not published broken scrim servers right before a tournament.<br><br>Please fix this...

if i were you i'd remove the word 'improvement(s)' completely from this thread, just to make sure nobody gets confused and thinks that this 'fixed' scrim servers/the way that they are being run.
