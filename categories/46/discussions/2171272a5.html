When people are being annoying in chat mods normally give them a kick then if they continue a temp ban then a bigger temp ban and then a full ban.do you think this is good? Or do you think they should get less chances? 2 chances? One chance? More chances? Post your opinion bellow with some good backup facts.have fun in this debate don't get frustrated over it it is just for fun and to see other people's opinions!

I think the way it is now is good. One verbal warning, then a kick.

A verbal warning and a kick works most of the time, unless the person continues to not learn their mistake. Or, a /warn instead of a verbal warning then a kick.

There needs to be a medium between instantly banning everyone and giving people 50 chances. But it also depends on the severity of the harassment.
