Hey guys, JJ here. I've wanted to start a youtube channel for a few years now, but I've had a few dillemas...<br><br>1) Recording program... I have MSI Afterburner, but I don't know how to work it. :/ Anyone know of a good, easy one? Or can someone tell em how to work it?<br><br>2) Editing. I need another program for that, and I need to know how to work that too. :/<br><br>3) The channel! I need a channel too! I'm trying to think of what to call it... Contest time! What should I call my channel? It's gotta have JJTheGuy in it.<br><br>Thanks guys!

1) &nbsp;Camtasia, easily one of the simplest recording program to use<br><br>2) Camtasia comes with its own editing program as well, and it is very easy to learn<br><br>3) &nbsp;I would just keep it simple, for example something like JJTheGuy or JJTheGuyPlaysMC

1 + 2 - I personally use Camtasia and I find it the easiest to use by far! It can record and edit.<br><br>3 - I spent a long time to think of mine, so I advise to make sure you are happy with your decision and don't rush into it. Maybe something like JJTheGuyGamer!<br><br>P.S - Also when you have started. tell me and I might be able to make you a channel art and logo! But I would rather that you enter my Top 5 plays to win in it, just to make it fair for the people win it in my Top 5 Plays!

1 - Either Camtasia or Fraps. From my experience with these softwares, camtasia is generally better when capturing your whole desktop. However, if you want to record just your Minecraft screen, and not the taskbar or other desktop icons, Fraps is probably the better option.<br><br>2 - You can start by editing on Windows Movie Maker (which is what I used when I first started making YouTube videos) because it is the most basic and simple editing software to use. If you don't like it, I would recomment Sony Vegas Pro 12. It is very simple to use once you get the hang of it, and it has hundreds more features than Movie Maker does. Also, the rendering for videos is much better and detailed.<br><br>3 - My YouTube channel is just my Minecraft name, because people will find you on YouTube more easily. If you want a different name, I'll suggest: JJTheGuyYT, JJPlaysMC, JJTheManMC.<br><br>Hope I helped. :)

It has a trial version where you can use all of the features for 30 days, and you can just renew it if it runs out. :)<br><br>I have the full version, but you can do that if you really like the software.

1) Bandicam, the free version allows you to record for 10 minutes straight (with a watermark tho) but the full version is TOTALLY worth it.<br><br>2) I use Pinnacle Studio 17, if you know of Avid Studio its the exact same as that and if you have heard of sony vegas pro it had been bought (from the company of Avid Studio). Its cheaper than both of the programs ($100 CA). Only problem is that I have to convert the videos because recording something not in MP4 format makes it think that it is not compatible<br><br>3) Sorry :c not creative :/

1. I'm just going to follow the majority and say Fraps<br><br>2. I would start small with something like movie maker or you can find another program called WeVideo if you have a google account online and I am pretty sure that is free<br><br>3.So I don't know if you have ever seen the show Bill Nye The Science Guy, but i was thinking something like...<br><b>JJThe MinecraftGuy</b>

1. Personally, I use FRAPS. I like it. It's easy, quick, and does the job. The only issue is that the video files come out a bit large, but can be resolved by compressing it with Movie Maker, or some editing software.<br><br>2. I use Adobe Premiere Elements. This program is also very easy to learn and use. It's good for compressing and can do a lot. The only downsides with this one is that it requires a good computer and GPU to run smoothly. I have an i5 and Intel HD 2000 and I have trouble running it. Premiere Elements is around $100, but I've had it for quite some time and even though I lag, I'd say it's worth it.&nbsp;<br><br><span>3. For the channel name, I'd try to keep it official. Don't use numbers or random spaces or characters. Similar to other people, I'd go with something with "Games" or "MC" following your name.&nbsp;<br>=============================================================<br>More tips:<br><br>Titling your videos formally and briefly. Have good thumbnails too, those grab the viewer's attention as we as the title. Also have a nice description that tells what the video is about and include contact info or links to social media sites. Social media helps you interact with your fanbase. Remember to have a nice channel avatar and banner. Those help people recognize you better.&nbsp;<br><br>Have the video quality be nice 720p/30fps (or better). Keep the video concise and interesting. Have it grab the viewer's attention. Remember to revise and edit and remove anything you don't like or should leave out or add in stuff if necessary.<br>=============================================================<br>So yeah, these tips will get you far as a YouTuber. Use them well.&nbsp;<br><br>Bronson a.k.a. TheBron_cool<br><br><br><br><br><br><br></span>
