Okay, may be the best app of 2k16/17 in my opinion. It pushes people who love the game and are intreiged by it to go out and catch some pokemon while excerising. As a child when I played pokemon, I dreamed of having it come to life and this is almost as close as it gets! It does drain your battery though...Please keep your hatred if you have some to yourself. I think the game is AMAZING and its bringing people together in these rough times. It's just what we needed.<br>Answer these questions!<br><br><a title="Link: http://www.strawpoll.me/10925687" href="http://www.strawpoll.me/10925687">http://www.strawpoll.me/10925687</a><br><a title="Link: http://www.strawpoll.me/10925710/r" href="http://www.strawpoll.me/10925710/r">http://www.strawpoll.me/10925710/r</a><br><a title="Link: http://www.strawpoll.me/10925728" href="http://www.strawpoll.me/10925728">http://www.strawpoll.me/10925728</a><br><br>1.

Ingress (Pokemon Go's predecessor) still hasn't died and it came out 3 years ago, so I really doubt PoGo will fade into obscurity.

I have never played this nor will I ever, but why would you want to when there are murderers and muggers that use this app to catch their victims. &nbsp;It sounds all innocent and fun, but there is a major dark side that is enough to prevent me from downloading this game.

This doesn't make sense. &nbsp;You can't predict the future and you never know if a group of people armed with guns and knifes are hiding around the corner and catch your group off guard. &nbsp;I understand and agree with your second sentence about staying with a group, but the first one is very childish and is an awful argument.
