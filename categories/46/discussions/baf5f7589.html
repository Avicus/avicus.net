I just went on to the scrim page to look at when servers are available, and it says that it's currently the 9-11 PM time slot, and right now it's 8 PM&nbsp;<a href="http://gyazo.com/49a29a978c59040e3cc3008b58c035a0" title="Link: http://gyazo.com/49a29a978c59040e3cc3008b58c035a0">http://gyazo.com/49a29a978c59040e3cc3008b58c035a0</a>. Is something messed up that we don't really know about, or was that intentional? It really threw me off, and might be part of the reason why the servers have been pretty empty for the most part

Since your EST, its an hour ahead like nintendo said.<br>If your wondering why its not available if its still 8, you must get it before it hits open time, so a minute before.

It's mostly just the hour ahead thing that doesn't make sense. I understand that it's an hour ahead, I just don't really understand why it's an hour ahead. I'm pretty sure the forums are an hour ahead too, and I just don't really get why it's an hour ahead. It just seems like it would cause more confusion that anything

It used to run on your specified timezone automatically, but from all of a sudden, it got set at 1 timezone only, which I'm guessing is Central Standard Time.<br>Probs a bug, but that's just my hunch.

It's definitely not Central time. If it was Central it'd be 8:30 right now. I'm pretty sure the only places that use this are some cities in Brazil

It's says you wrote this at 8:31, so I'm pretty sure it's in CST. (For me at least.)

Here in the Uk the only reason it's 1hr ahead is because we put our clock forwards in Spring , then we put them back in Autumn. But yeah would be nice if they had a system to auto update.
