Hey guys, for about 1 year 3 months I have been compiling best times for maps on Avicus into a document on my desktop. I am making this post so people can refer to the list of best times and records if curious, but also for people to post new records they have achieved on maps. To put your time on the list please follow the guideline of; <b>screenshot of map time (displayed on tab), type names of people who got the objectives (if someone gets more than one objective write x2 for example), type the name of the map and previous record</b>. If valid I will then edit the post and add it to the list :) I do not have screenshots for the times I have currently collected as there are so many, although you will have to trust me that all these times are correct- and I would have no reason to lie anyway. Also, some of the IGNs on the list are likely to be outdated as this list has been compiled over a long period of time. Enjoy the list and feel free to ask any questions below :)<br><br><b><u><i>List of map records (no particular order):</i></u></b><br><div><br>Honeycomb-55sec Ryiley Lokigh</div><div>CherryLandMC-1min 4sec Lokigh TwentyoneNemos</div><div>Fissura-32sec Lokigh killerbye22</div><div>Formorgar-50sec Dereban rolinol</div><div>Crusade-1min 14sec Lokigh</div><div>Abandoned Park I-1min 35sec Lokigh x2 dyah Fauin</div><div>Rendezvous II-3min 38sec NotJoules x2 MeMyselfAndGhost&nbsp;</div><div>Castle Adventure-1min 50sec Mr_Mazza NotJoules</div><div>Dust Devils-46sec Speeded(Dereban)</div><div>Bleened Rings-1min 34sec Lokigh x2 Mr_Mazza</div><div>Justice I-1min 26sec Dyah Lokigh</div><div>Rigor Mortis-1min 9sec Merp</div><div>Ternio-2min 17sec Lokigh Third_Eye03 SlimeyFxsh</div><div>Senex I-1min 17sec Lokigh SuperLasuz</div><div>Luar-58sec Merp Nathy</div><div>Teres-1min 34sec Lokigh Ryiley MarcuzFireZ</div><div>Sandstorm-55sec Wazzah MarcuzFireZ</div><div>Venomous-55sec Merp Eteh (Unknown)</div><div>Rendezvous I-47sec Lokigh MarcuzFireZ</div><div>Ravanged-1min 43sec Lokigh Dyah</div><div>Senex II-1min 16sec Lokigh x2</div><div>Clay Wars-51sec Lokigh pierrotwinner</div><div>Halcyon-47sec pierrotwinner seacat1906</div><div>Campi Erbosi-1min 4sec Lokigh Ryiley</div><div>Quintus-1min 29sec Lokigh x2 Aviia x3</div><div>Tasty Fight-1min 2sec KevinToys ziqyx</div><div>Atlantis- 1min 5sec Lokigh x2</div><div>Mute City II-1min 21sec Peniquin salchixa</div><div>Tallon Overworld-56sec Lokigh KevinsToys</div><div>Castle Adventure-1min 47sec Lokigh Jotrexwitz</div><div>Frostbite-2min 5sec Lokigh x3 Bebe1972 x1</div><div>Phrendrana Sanctury-1min 20sec Lokigh Aviia</div><div>Sunbeam Temple-1min 1sec Lokigh AstroPizza</div><div>BerryLandMC DTC-56sec Lokigh</div><div>Campi Erbosi 2- 1min 1sec Lokigh Aviia</div><div>Port Town 2- 1min 1sec U_U_U_U_U_U_U_U mels159</div><div>PonyLands 2- 1min 13sec Aviia</div><div>Deadlock- 1min 46sec Lokigh Aviia</div><div>Terra CTF- 1min 31sec Aviia nnatile</div><div>Sweet Slopes- 3min 11sec Lokigh PeeDubz</div><div>Solvite- 1min 48sec Lokigh x2</div><div>Rendezvous Redux- 1min 5sec Lokigh Cqctus</div><div>E Minor- 1min 17sec Casck</div><div>Apache-1min 28sec Lokigh</div><div>Starshine Beach-1min 20sec Lokigh x2</div><div>Sector Six- 1min 28sec Lokigh x2 minertedtoad</div><div>Proleium 1.5- 1min 8sec Vior_ Mariorusher50<br>Formorgar 2- 1min 26sec Patrikano TiosTy</div>

both rushed one side straight there + back, I was lagging behind a bit but luckily someone on the other team hit me which made up a few extra seconds. Weren't too many players in the game though, else under 2 would be extremely hard xD

Not exactly hard when you have luck on your side, get a couple of teammates to bridge/bowspam for you, and once you get in the wool getting a double is insanely easy and running back is also easy (unless people are actually trying to defend).

it is not 10 seconds for obsidian, pretty sure there is efficiency. Also the other players didn't bother shooting so we were able to bridge straight from the start, so pretty much the fastest you can get on that map hence why its the best time I have recorded in the last year and a bit.
