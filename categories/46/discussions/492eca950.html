Hello everyone, Key here. Today, I've decided to talk about sportsmanship, and how it plays an importance in the games we play, and this even applies in our lives. Yesterday, I was playing on my favorite mini-game, Nebula. After every game, I noticed that after every game, everybody was cussing and arguing. Some even blamed their teammates for not defending their base. This really saddened me because, you don't know someone and yet you are arguing with him or her. I decided to try an experiment. I actually praised both teams for working very hard each game, I realized that many players started being happier, less arguments. More friends were being made by everyone. Does this not show the power of sportsmanship and the importance of it in our lives? You can brighten up someone's day with this :) Please reflect on it.<br><br>-Key
