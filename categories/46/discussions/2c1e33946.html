Recently, I found a new game called Cube World. I looked into it and thought it was a pretty fun game that I could actually play. I haven't bought it yet or else I wouldn't be asking this question: is buying cube world worth it?<br><br>i have already done some research on it from articles to video gameplay on it which makes me really wanna buy it.<br><br>i know that there are cracked/pirated versions out there but I dont want my very own person virus crawling around my computer.<br><br>Thanks

Ah Cube world..<br>I have it, my friend gave it to me :/<br>But, Cube World isn't worth the money you pay for it, it's the kind of game where it is really easy to get bored of, plus it is a bit of a rip off of Minecraft.

You also have to have a pretty powerful PC to play it smoothly.
