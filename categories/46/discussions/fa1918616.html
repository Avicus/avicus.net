so I currently use a shitty laptop that gets me 12 FPS (with OptiFine, fastest graphics and RD of 2 chunks) on avicus, so pretty much a slideshow (I also get a ping of around 480ms but I don't know if better computers help and is playable). The specs on my laptop aren't bad but the fans are full of cat fur and it has loads of bugs/viruses that can't be fixed (already got 2 useless repair guys)<br><br>So really don't want to leave you guys but recently playing is unbearable and I just fly around chatting, as a result of that I'm considering of buying a new laptop/computer. All I require in a computer is to be able to comfortably play Avicus and other games (60 Fps with OptiFine).<br><br>Anyways, I need help with choosing a new laptop/computer (no preference)<br>Budget $600 (preferably lower)<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://pcpartpicker.com/user/poptyler945/saved/cK2WGX">http://pcpartpicker.com/user/poptyler945/saved/cK2WGX</a>&nbsp;is this worth? Slightly over/budget and I'm not sure how it works (they build or just sell/display parts)

Pretty decent actually. For MC, swap the 270X for a 750Ti as a 270X has some problems with Minecraft. Also, a DVD/CD player is usually unnecessary.

Also, the selected hard drive is too high end for a budget build, swap it out for a cheaper Western Digital hard drive.<br><br>Also, PcPartPicker allows you to choose parts that are suitable for your build from a few selected retailers. You then go to the retailers website, order the parts and put together the computer at home. Make sure you have the region set properly when using it (Top right hand corner).

Thanks :D, got a few additional questions, roughly how many Fps will this run minecraft at? How much does a decent monitor cost? And how much should I pay to assemble the parts?<br><br>as I have said before, I am an absolute nub when it comes to computers.

It'll run minecraft at 60 fps. I don't invest time in researching monitors, so don't bother asking me that. And build it yourself, just look it up on youtube.

A decent monitor depends on the size and resolution.

The build you linked is pretty decent but do you really need an optical drive? You could just use a USB stick for windows. Pretty sure you can get it.on a USB stick.<br><br>Swap out the 270X for a GTX 750Ti because of driver issues that AMD cards have with Minecraft for some reason. I think they are seen as a Java program not as an actual game<br><br>You could also get away with a cheaper hard drive and possibly get an SSD in the build.<br><br>I am not a pro at this so I recommend waiting on someone with more experience but thats all changes that I see could be made

As Juano said, try formatting your PC and reinstalling Windows (or whatever OS you have). This will get rid of the malware on your computer, and clear up a lot of space on your drive. Just remember to back up important files.

Do you have an anti-virus? If not download one after you do what JKawesome said.

It will be hard to find a laptop for around $600 that will support 60 FPS in minecraft. I would suggest a custom built Desktop, there has been a lot of suggestions about specs and there's always google at your side.
