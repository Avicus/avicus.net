Have you checked your chat? Anticheat could be preventing you from building.

I sometimes also have the same problem with that anticheat. because I tend to mass-produce forts, I can build more forts quickly. But sometimes I build a skybase and it goes (AntiCheat) Fastplacing detected.

The problem is that Avicus is having a Lag Issue. I don't know the reason but seems like a water problem. A lot of maps got water and that could do some lag to the client and the server. I can't see a way to fix this more than recode (if thats a word) the Avicus plugin code (I mean Avicus and Avicore plugins)

In my opinion, I would like to see prevention of bridging. I don't mind if you want to bridge all up the sky and get the monuments as fast as possible, though I can't see what's so fun about it. When I play&nbsp;Nebula, it's all about the pvp, either you defend or you attack, down on ground, not up above in the sky. Especially when you are wearing full diamond and your team mates only got iron, and you're just up there admiring the sky.

No, I think Ivy made it so you can't use them due to team trolilng problems. It just ruined it for the people that did actually use the flint and steels for combat.. It did stop a bunch of trollers, though, so oh well :P
