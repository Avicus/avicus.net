Recently I have been think why can't there be a yearly avicus vs ocn tourney? 30 on each teams? This could just be a friendly match and I will organise teams this would bring avicus and ocn closer together 1 step more to becoming friends :D

IMO it would be kinda weird to just have an Avicus player organize something so important. : / It would just make a lot more sense if a STAFF did it.

I can beat a lot of ocn players. Check my pvp encounters. Most of the times I died where due to teaming (which is inevitable). Am I allowed to post a link to my stats on ocn? But anyway that doesn't prove much. I think this'd be a great idea :)

They may win in pvp aspects. But it's not all pvp that wins a tourney. I'm probably not good enough to get onto the servers team though.

What if we had 30 players from avicus, 30 players from ocn, threw all the names into the pool and drew out 2 teams ? That way we would get to work with some of the ocn players rather than strictly compete against them :)

First time and effort and second how would you choose regulars as many people like me play both and third what would to the network that won and fourth as MissCaramel said how would you distinguish the "best" players.

this is a really bad idea cause some players are just gonna be cocky to each other and just b**ching around since the hatred toward each server (to some player's point of view). so i would recommend that don't host friendly tournaments between avicus and ocn yet. wait till the hatred stops.
</blockquote>
</div>
you still think the servers hate each other? I would like to say as forcefully as I can, YOU ARE WRONG. I've been on mumble, been on ocn for about a year and I have yet to meet any rude/cocky people. You obviously are pre-judging the entire community when you haven't even been on mumble. Same applies for avicus. Honestly, I've been seeing some famous ocn players come to teamspeak and they're quite chill.

Dont start with any comments like "OCN is better" or "Avicus is better".<br><br>Ill point this out "This has been brought up several times and this will not be happening." ~ParaSpider<br><br>IF the tournament happens there should be staff organising. On overcast theres event coordinators that organise overcast events and they could probably work something out with avicus staff.<br><br>Reasons why I would not want this happening:<br>&nbsp;- Servers - Who would host the event?<br>&nbsp;- Maps - Selection of maps would have to be from OCN and avicus but in the final, it will come down to 1 map<br>&nbsp;- Players - Lets say we have 8 teams (4 OCN, Avicus). Selecting those 80 players from both networks would be hard AND if OCN wins first four matches (example) then Avicus is already out.<br>&nbsp;- Map knowlage - I dont know about Avicus but on OCN a lot of stuff depends on map knowlage. It would be really important.<br><br>Overall I just see too many negative things and issues that could appear.<br><br>&nbsp;- Let's say Avicus loses (example). When some younger kids know there will be spam all over OCN's forum.&nbsp;<br><br>Something like this would be cool to do but looking at the things I pointed out above I highly doubt it would be worth doing.<br><br>My opinion on the whole thing in a shorter version: It would be cool, but the amount of preparing is too big and not worth doing.

I have a better idea. Make it an unofficial tournament, one that players from both servers host.&nbsp;<br>Either 32 teams from both servers can play or 16 teams. Put it into a randomiser for choosing who plays who. I would advice against putting OCN and Avicus at round 1 because it would make people upset.&nbsp;<br>Instead of Avicus vs OCN it should be Avicus and OCN. This shows that it isn't a tournament to see who is the best but a joined one to bring both parties together.<br><br>I am sure staff would help out, it is just those with the final decision saying no. I would quite happily help out and try and get it organised. I have no issue with it, but a joint effort would bring the community closer together.<br>It is really just organising the whole tournament what seems to be more difficult than it actually seems to be.

People misunderstood my point. People can make mixed teams if they like but I am not saying it has to be mixed teams. I meant teams will apply, from ocn or avicus or mixed, it gets randomised who can play and then bracket is put out.

Wether you like it or not, Avicus and OCN are very different servers, this isn't a bad thing. OCN is&nbsp;<b>much&nbsp;</b>more competitive, and a lot more tournament based, players are more experienced, and therefore better than more Avicus players.

Wether you like it or not, Avicus and OCN are very different servers, this isn't a bad thing. OCN is&nbsp;<b>much&nbsp;</b>more competitive, and a lot more tournament based, players are more experienced, and therefore better than more Avicus players.
