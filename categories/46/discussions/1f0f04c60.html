Just making this alrdy stresses me out....<br><br>So lately (especially today) me and a bunch of players have been getting mon blocked by so many players who either have no idea what theyre doing or they are trying to mine/steal the monument when me or my teammate is alrdy mining it, and then you also have the players who decide to mine the monument with you (thinking it will break faster, sadly having 2 or more players mining it doesnt make it break faster) and not guard/distract for you or cover you...<br><br>Why do these kinds of players exist and why do you do as you do by mon blocking/stealing or not guarding or covering distract for the miner???<br><br>(Inb4 ill get hate but this needs to be stressed cuz not many ppl can record or staff cant be on 24/7 to solve the situation)

I've seen this before and yeah it's annoying, but I'm pretty sure that nobody on the forums do it regularly so I guess it's just one of those things that sucks but there's nothing you can really do. Again, this is unfortunate but I'd rather have staff spending their time responding to hacking reports and things like that.

You've answered yourself&nbsp;mate... <i>"not many people can record and staff cant be on 24/7" </i>so use common sense to realise that there will always be people like this in life and sometimes you just have to suck it up and deal with it because not every little problem can be fixed with the swish of a magic wand.

Usually when that happens in a group, I cover myself in while everyone else blocks each other.&nbsp;<br><br>But then sometimes there is a teammate who trys to break the wood I covered myself in and they go in my secret mining area.

Even i get monument blocked on a regular basis. LOL.<br><br>But it is hard for staff to punish for this kind of stuff as by the time the player has reported, the monument blockers usually have already either broken the monument or have stopped.

There's nothing much we can do about it, so live with it and learn not to rage over a monument.&nbsp;Just stop raging in chat and calm down whenever things like this happens.

I wish there'd be way to punish them. But unfortunately it's not possible to fix this problem. But warning people might work =) I also rage all the time but I know that it's not true. But I realized that whenever I want them not to do this again, they say 'Sorry!' and never do it again :p

I understand how you feel. Sometimes I do get angry about it but I try not to express it. The only solution right now is to report the player to the staff member and hope that they come in time, or record it.
