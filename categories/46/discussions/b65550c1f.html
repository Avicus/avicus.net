This is the place for your longest match and its screenshots, when all map becomes super messed up and unrecognizable.<br>My longest was far away in the past, when Checkmate map had broken, and game continued for ~16 hours, and no one stoped it. Unfortunately, I haven't screenshots of that legendary match. But have screens of Quintus on June,19&nbsp;<a href="http://imgur.com/a/qDFet" title="Link: http://imgur.com/a/qDFet">http://imgur.com/a/qDFet</a><br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/JgoGHeH.png" title="Image: http://i.imgur.com/JgoGHeH.png"><br>=======<br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/OoyI9Np.png" title="Image: http://i.imgur.com/OoyI9Np.png"><br>=====<br>Post yours longest matches below :D

I remember, about 2 years ago a senex game went on for more than 2 hours and it ended because it went on for too long.

Long ass matches that are plenty of fun... this one of the reasons why I love Avicus :)<br><br>I had a 2 hour match in Senex when it was a 60 player+ map and the points shop was ingame. Super defense with spanky spade-wielding defenders and attackers.&nbsp;<br><br>TNT dropping skybridgers :D<br><br>T'was the fun days when you could dick around on a map with the points shop stuffs :P<br><br>I also had an incredibly long match on Clay wars and Quintus. 3 hours and 2 respectively.<br><br>Oh and you had a 16 hour plus match on Checkmate? Wow. I wish I was there... :D
