There are many players in the walls (in general) who kill their teammates for many reasons, such as having valuable stuff, and these tend players to steal their teammates' hard work easily since there are &nbsp;many ways to teamkill such as lava buckets (commonly and most used way) and is mostly seen in the village, spleefing, drowning afk teammates, tnt and the most important one the wither and summoner kits, this is a common problem but has to be solved players are being annoyed and bullied by this and it needs to be stopped once and for all, so what I was suggesting is finding a way to remove lava, water, and fall damage until the walls drop and removing the wither kit since it cant actually kill anyone but teammates and stripping the summoner kit from harmful mobs

I don't think that could be possible however the /report command is always there, so if you catch someone doing that report it to the Moderators and they should be there in seconds.
