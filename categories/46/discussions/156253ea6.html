I am seriously considering getting it after seeing stories like this:<br><img alt="" src="http://i.gyazo.com/606b92f009e92dc775851cfcd8648f46.png"><br>If you dont know what the game is then google it. Its 12 at night and not bothered explaining :P<br>Anyway I just hoping to get an insight into if its worth 20 euro. Its only in alpha stages like.

I got it and 12 minutes into the game, 3 naked guys lured me into their hut and trapped me there. Then they decided to torture me by blasting the song Barbie Girl into their mics... I managed to escape though when they opened to door to finally kill me. I ran in the cold, dark woods being chased for like 10 minutes till I lost them. Then I decided I'd go for a swim in the water... and died the second I touched it wat.<br><br>Its a fantastic game everyone should get it!
