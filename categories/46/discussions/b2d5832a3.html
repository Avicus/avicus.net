Anyone got some PC suggestions, my budget is £400 give or take a bit. This does not include monitor, keyboard and mouse they are separate the £400 is purely for the computer. £400 is $670 if that helps. The PC can be custom or ready built and is for gaming. Thank you.

The computer looks good but I would research what cooler they built in cause if they overclock it too 4.3 Ghz it may be unstable if they are using the stock cooler for example.<br>Yep we are using euros. The build I showed you is 500 euro, 400 pound or 670$.

I think the budget isn't good enough to use a ssd. I would use more money on other parts like CPU and GPU because OF can fix chunkloading problems. The Ram doesn't need 1866 mhz as most of the games don't profit from it. But &nbsp;the case and PSU is a good choice.

I went with 1866 in case he wanted to do some overclocking. But you're right, most of the games don't profit from it.&nbsp;<br>As for the ssd, most people that I know, won't upgrade their OS drive often, since it's a pain. Which is why I included an 'or' in the post. :3

£400, well depends what you need it for; gaming on the top level would mean you need more money to spend for better thing.&nbsp;<br>I payed over all £2'670 that included everything. So from i7 to G700S it really depends what your going to use it for man.&nbsp;<br><br>:)

&nbsp;Ignore how it says the graphics card won't fit unless you take out some drive bays in the case, I have the same case and graphics card and it fits in fine.

There are a lot of companies that will custom build your PC for you, but the problem with that is that the majority of them ship to the US. &nbsp;Most of those companies you can call and arrange a shipping to another country, I know <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.digitalstormonline.com/">Digital Storm</a> does that. &nbsp;You can find something with a good Google search or two. &nbsp;<br><br>If you need any more help regarding finding a company, let me know.

For the price you have, you won't get a very good PC that is prebuilt.&nbsp;<br>You'll be lucky if you can even get a decent graphics card in a prebuilt pc for little under $700.
