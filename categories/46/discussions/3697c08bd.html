Basically one person says their favorite/least favorite Pokémon, rates their own and why, and the person below it repeats those steps.<br>For example,<br>Smart Me: (Rates above) Mew 10/10 because it can learn any move+it's cute.<br>Dumb You: (9/10) Metapod 0/10 because I hate when they use harden and a leaf type has a leech seed on you.<br><br><br>I'd rate Mew 10/10. My Pokémon is Grovyle because of Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time/Darkness/Sky.

10/10<br><br>Alakazam. VERY high special attack, can learn Recover, Psychic, Thunder Wave, Shadow Ball, the Elemental Punches (Fire Punch, Thunder Punch and Ice Punch)...<br>Only bad this is that you only get it by trading &gt;:(

9/10 Evocal, are you a pokemon nerd too? :o Alakazam also has Magic Guard as its ability which negates all damage from non-attacking moves and hazards, like weather, Stealth Rocks, etc. Its speed is top-notch as well, not to mention it has a Mega Evolution which, while doesn't add too much, gives Alakazam a whopping base 170 special attack. #NerdAlert<br><br>Anyways, my Pokemon is Clamperl. Clamperl is a Water-type NFE Pokemon that, while might not seem threatening at first, can decimate the opponent with the power of the DeepSeaScale, which doubles its Special Attack with no drawbacks whatsoever. Coupled with the godly setup move in Shell Smash, and you have one deadly son of a gun.

8/10 Blastoise is a decent Rapid Spinner and has mediocre defenses but its Mega Evolution is much better with a great ability and a unique movepool that it can abuse.<br><br>Lucario, the Aura Pokemon. It has the ability to control and see aura, both in itself and in other living things and Pokemon. In competitive play it was usually used as a sweeper, slowly declining in Gen V but rising with its Mega Evolution in Gen VI. It has an awesome, mixed movepool (and suffers from 4MSS a lot) and fantastic mixed attacking stats, giving it a variety of choices to choose from and a great surprise factor. Its Mega Evolution has the Adaptability ability, which further increases STAB moves by a whopping 1.5x damage; coupled with an insane base Attack stat and much-needed increased speed, and this thing can kill.<br>It has also starred in its own movie and has appeared in Super Smash Bros Brawl. It is coming back in the new addition for Super Smash Bros, in Super Smash Bros 3DS and Super Smash Bros Wii U.<br>That was fun to type xD
