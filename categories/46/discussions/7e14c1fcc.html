Minecraft is CPU intensive. To my knowledge, having a good GPU or not makes no difference.<br><br>@OP Where do you live?

I'm not. Minecraft is a game COMPLETELY based off Java, and Java is CPU intensive. If he's going to play other games though, he should get a new GPU.

Have you even tried playing Minecraft without a GPU? You lose 30-50% of performance. Plus, I'm pretty sure he would like to use shaders as well..<br><br>@OP I don't know what games you're playing, and your current system... soo..

Not being mean, just stating facts.<br>Good frames on CS:GO, GTX 950 / 750 Ti is good.
