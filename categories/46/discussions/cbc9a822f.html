hello I was just wondering what ever happened to Corey (insert numbers here) he used to be on the server all the time. For those who might remember him he was a mini-mod. Someone who acts like a mod but doesn't have any authority over anyone. Everyone seemed to like him. Even staff members. So anyway about a year and a half ago I left the server because of the community, and came back a couple months ago and he's not on the server anymore. Which surprises me. Since he was pretty popular. Someone told me several months ago that he was banned. Which is unbelievable to me since he was a mini-mod. If anyone can tell me what happened to him that whould be great. and tell me his full name too if you can.

Damn really?! That's really hard to believe, like I said he was always about following the rules. Especially since 3/4 of my infractions were Because of him.
