I don't want to bump my (very) old topic about this (especially because it's changed a lot!), so I'll give this a refresh!<br><br><img alt="" src="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/54MeUDG_JaI/hqdefault.jpg"><br><br>As you may recall, I'm running an osu! group on Skype; you can add me at&nbsp;<b>milkcreamyum</b> along with your&nbsp;<b>MINECRAFT</b> username so I know who it is. It's also preferred that you post here so I make sure I put you in the osu! group.<br><br>Recently, we need more osu! players; our current group has declined in activity :c<br><br>Full list of members (osu! username):<br>Milki (MilkFreedom)<br>BlackMetalGhost (rfandomization)<br>Xx_Maddy_xX (_Maddy_)<br>TheTNTPotato (TheTNTPotato)<br>Lunax564 (LightBeats)<br>Ambamore2000 (Ambamore2000)<br>FrostedCupcakez (TheEverest)<br>BALLZI (KANEKAI)<br>Cyclops (Robo16)<br>MLGtino (MLGtino)<br>ViolentBoo (ViolentBoo)<br>netox_max (Netox005)<br>Juano_ (JuanoMC)<br>Chiddybangmaster (diviniation)<br>Strafes_<br>Zoom (Boltt)<br>Emmaye (Emmaye)<br>iCarnage (_Vapour_)<br>Stimulating&nbsp;<br>Nolan (Nolan)<br>KatLikesPie (KatLikesPie)<br><br><b>What is osu!?</b><br>osu! is a rhythm game for the PC based on clicking/tapping circles.

How much experience do I need with Osu? I've played a lot on iPhone, and recently started the PC version about two weeks ago.

Like Juano said, no minimum level is needed; a lot of our players are not particularly great, but we have fun anyways!

I enjoy playing Osu, but I haven't had a lot of free time in the past few weeks. I'll probably ask to join this later...

It usually takes 2-3 months to get decent at it (Insane maps) - (HD, HR, etc), I used to play before but as I was a noob, I left it, then came back and I had some kind of thing with the game so I kept playing, now I even think it's better than MC.<br><br>;)
