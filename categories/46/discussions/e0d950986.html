What is this man..&nbsp;<br><br>First off i'm not blaming anyone for hacking :)<br><br>But I have a question. How does one hit give me 30 block KB? I was literally hitting the guy and he hits me once, does CRITS in that one hit and knocks me into the void. It was at least a 7 block KB. How the hell does this happen? I'm sure it isn't jitterclicking because I jitterclick and I don't get KB.<br><br>Also.. people are doing more than just breezily bridging. There are some that are jitterbridging.. is that bannable or not?<br><br>Please?<br>elaborate.

Jitterclicking does nothing to kb. Most likely it's due to sprint reset.<br>No, jitterbridging is allowed.

I don't know why jitterbridging would be bannable, its not a hack.

Jitter bridging is easy if you have a mouse that registers all of the clicks ;-;<div><br></div><div>And if you know the techniques to give more and take less then gg</div>

if you are talking about my KB, am doing a technique called Hybrid blockhitting, that is all I am going to tell you :p<br><br>Jitterbridging is allowed aslong as you do it legit ofc, so no autoclicker

To all those saying blockhitting &nbsp;doesn't give more knockback, yout right but only if youre doing it constantly. If yiu hit blockhit hit blockhit with the right timing it's basically like w tapping since it resets your sprint.&nbsp;<br><br>@OP I blame Avi Kb xd. But really, it's just people with certain ping that get more kb and people that know how to w tap.

They are all forms of sprint resetting, even sneaking before hitting gives you KB.

I doubt someone would be able to hit you once and make you knockback 7 blocks unless the KB just messed up. Perhaps there are techniques to give you much more KB than others can. However, maybe some of the things on Avicus may have an effect on the KB you deal.

As you might have noticed, avicus has a a tendency of bias KB. Myself, I have American ping. I take no knockback but I give more than you could imagine. It could be hacks, but I doubt it. Probably just a pinger like me.

I've always felt that kb boost from people who click fast, but I've been told any times it doesn't affect kb. Thanks for telling me.
