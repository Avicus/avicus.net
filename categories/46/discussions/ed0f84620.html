Well today I had the most brainiest idea ever, it was a village defence kinda thing. So how it works is that there is a village with 7 villages in it and then zombies come in waves, the zombies are meant to kill the villages and you are meant to protect the villages by killing the zombies. Depending on how many zombies you kill depends on how much exp you get. In between waves thats when you are able to change kit, you can also get items from what the zombies drop. <br><br>This could be added to and if you have questions just say.
