Not really sure where the suggestion area is so I'm just going to throw it in here.<br><br>Not sure if this is a thing already or not but I'll just fire away and see what happens :P. This suggestion is for Nebula, the rundown of the suggestion is that the farther you are away from an enemy will equal in you gaining more credits from the kill. Lets say I shoot xSeb from 30 blocks away I get the normal amount of credits, if I shot him from 50 Blocks away I get x2 the amount of credits and so on, let's say I shoot him from like 100 blocks away then I'll get x4 the amount of credits.&nbsp;<br><br>Just a short little idea I think that will be hella sexy.<br><br>Thanks for reading.

Interesting idea, but this would somehow have to include donor ranks as well, since donors already get more credits than normal users.<br><br>I like your idea though!

I don't mind about the idea, it seems ok for me but Kylo really needs to implement a place for suggestions in the forums ._.

Have this not apply to OiTN maps please. Venomous TDM is a big enough credit farm as it currently is.
