<a href="http://www.badeggsonline.com/" title="Link: http://www.badeggsonline.com/">http://www.badeggsonline.com/</a><br><br>Ended up playing this a lot during school hours to pass the time, and eventually it became more than some simple flash game. I've been playing it a lot for the past 4 days, and if you don't know what it is, it's a combat game oriented around eggs. Though there are premium perks, they did a pretty fantastic job balancing everything and it's super fun, so I'd recommend registering and playing some 1v1 matches against other lower levels to build up your XP. Very customizable too!<br><br>To get higher levels, you participate in matches and kill people. It's very strategical and there's quite a few maps to try out. I got hooked on it and also would like to know if there's any bad eggs players on here!<br><br>If you don't want to register but still try it, you can play as a guest but nothing will save. I'm on level 19 so far, and will be hanging out in 1v1 matches for a bit. Post your username below and I'll send friend requests:<br><br><b>Username:</b> ttaiku
