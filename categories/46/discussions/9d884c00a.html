I don't think new kits are really needed. The kits so far are fine, they just need to be fixed or nerfed or buffed

Agreed. Everyone should just always start with only a compass, and stone sword. If &nbsp;not removing the kits, then they need to fix them. Stomper is too OP, magician is only good for 1 map, and it's almost OP on that map (Tetris Swamp), and no other kits are really used. But, I agree. It's not really walls when you have all these things helping you get half your armor before you even have to think about mining, or killing anyone. It's too easy, too simple.

-fix most of the kits, nerf stomper so it is not 100% guarantee no fall damage, but more damage on impact. I see most people on walls use it for the no fall damage purpose, not even using it for hurting players most of the time, why bother call it stomper?<br>-Compasses need to be fixed as well, not sure if the mapdevs know so.<br>- I think there should be kits; It would be more of a challenge, going against different scenarios of kits, the game would get very boring in a while without them and also there would be just one strategy for the whole entire map, over, and over again. almost knowing what the players behind their walls are going to have, considering they know what they're doing, just like you do. That is just PVP. Walls is made so you dont know what you may face behind the sand/gravel wall. same strategy is boring, mix it up with some kits and you can have a great time playing.

<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; ">&nbsp;<i>I think there should be kits; It would be more of a challenge, going against different scenarios of kits, the game would get very boring in a while without them and also there would be just one strategy for the whole entire map, over, and over again.&nbsp;<br><br></i>That's why the maps need to be focused less on kits, and more on game-play and skill. As of right now, the kits are pretty much there to give you an advantage over other players. If they were to keep kits, they need to pretty much re-do all of them. Make it less based on potions and no fall damage, and instead on just some helpful things for the build time.&nbsp;<br><i><br></i></span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; "><i>nerf stomper so it is not 100% guarantee no fall damage, but more damage on impact.&nbsp;<br></i></span><span></span><br>Oh no<span> no no, don't make Stomper have more damage. If anything it should not do damage, and just be like feather falling 4 or something. It's too OP as it is, and&nbsp;the&nbsp;damage&nbsp;just&nbsp;makes it more OP even as no one uses it&nbsp;in&nbsp;that way.<br><br></span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; ">. same strategy is boring, mix it up with some kits and you can have a great time playing.<br></span><br><span>If you have the same strategy for every map, then the maps need to be make different. With more in middle, and more on each side. If the only reason walls is fun is because of kits, then the maps are nowhere near good.&nbsp;</span><br><span>Take Village for example, this map was amazing before stomper, before&nbsp;cookie monster. It hasn't been played w/o kits, but I&nbsp;can tell you right know it'd be a lot more based off of getting stuff before you mine. Walls isn't only about the PVP, but it's&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;a big part in it. Learning the maps is the biggest, PVP is second. You need to know how to use the map to your advantage, not only in a kits way, but for running, chasing, mining, looting, everything. Learning the game-play of maps, and the way they work is third. <br><br>Kits should&nbsp;<b>not</b> effect if a map is good or not.&nbsp;</span><br><br><span><br></span>

New kits tho&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br><br><br>kits wont effect if the map is good or not. <u>BUT</u> certain kits are best for certain maps, which gives the player an advantage. If tetris swamp had no kits, where would the enchantment table be? even though the new magician kit does not have the table, that map would basically be PVP, using the diamonds from the ravine and the chests. we need kits so we can have a new style of PVP, with effects and different things than what you would get if both players had the same exact armor, knew all the spots, and knew the same strategy.
