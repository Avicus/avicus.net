Server Hosting Question...

<a href='/users/Numberz_.html' style='color: none'>Numberz_</a>

</h1>
Heyy, <br><br>So recently I've been thinking about getting my own private server, but... I need a little help. I want to know if the type of host I'm looking at will support my needs. I am currently looking at is the Starter plan from HostHorde which has 1gb RAM and 5gb of memory. Is that enough to support the Essentials plugin and still run at a decent speed? I don't plan on having any other plugins and the playercount will be 1-5. If anyone knows about this type of thing help would be greatly appreciated!

Yup works! I used that server for quite some time and it ran smooth most of the time (it was laggy when I did large WE stuff), but maybe instead of hosthorde use their cheaper company "Minespan".

Have you used Minespan? Does it work as well as HostHorde? Also do you know how I get Plugins? xD<br><br>-Edit: Do you need to fill out all the address, phone and stuff, or can you just put a fake one? From your experience.

The plugins are easy to get, its not much harder than installing a forge mod.

I used this hosting service.&nbsp;<a href="https://triangle.gs/servers" title="Link: https://triangle.gs/servers">https://triangle.gs/servers</a><br><br>You can get servers from free as long as you renew it every 24 hours, but I have no idea how the pricing compares to other services.

Using minespan for my server and as far as I know Alex does too. Plugins are really easy to get, there is a point under "files" i think and you can put the plugin name and click on install.<br>I assume you can put fake details, never received a letter or a call from them...

I have been trying to get a free server from them for a month. &nbsp;I tried doing the short cut to skip the queue but it was stuck on the second step in installing server files. &nbsp;Finally gave up and let the server expire

HostHorde is probably the worst company...they oversell, Minespan is just as bad.<br><br>Try giving Shockbyte a shot. I've used them for 1 year and they're great, ticket response times take usually between 10-45 minutes. Their 1gb plan is like $2.50/gb, so they're pretty cheap.<br><br>*I'm not an advertiser for them.<br><br>Don't use triangle.gs, not to mention their service doesn't even work.

BisectHosting is a good host. You can customise your server with approximate plugins, players, etc. They're cheap to some extent too.

Thanks for all the suggestions and feedback on hosts. I'm probably going to with HostHorde because of the dedicated IP.<br><br>I have one more question though, other then essentials, which Plugins would I need? And where is the best place to find them, Spigot? Or Bukett?

Always install Spigot since it is actually Bukkit with more features. ;)

2.5$/gb is cheap... I pay 15â‚¬ (~16.5$) for 8gb ram, 100gb memory (or even more than 100, but definitely&nbsp;not beneath 100gb) and fu***** 1gpbs up &amp; download speed<br><br><br>THIS is cheap.<br><br>EDIT: Now I pay only 4.5 Euros for 4GB Ram, 200GB and 1000GB bandwith a month (about 5-10% of these 1000GB a month will be used for MusicBot only) and idk 100mbps or more download/upload speed.

I'm not sure. Just purchased it and seems to be running quite smoothly on 5gb memory and 1gb RAM.&nbsp; I also installed Spigot.
