Now Avicus is an excellent server with a great sense of community but I myself<br>was wondering what would you change about the server. I would definitely<br>fix the block lag and a topic that I believe is important is one created by sevo<br>saying that people turn to name calling and being arrogant when behind a computer<br>screen. My question is how do we fix this and what other things need to be improved?
