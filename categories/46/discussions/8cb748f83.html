Okay so recently i have noticed a few things going wrong with Avicus.....<br><br>1) They've added back the old maps, which is all well and good because they give some variety, but in reality they should be placed in the Throwback server, but instead they are in the main stream lobbies, which i totally dis-agree with because i hate the first gen maps and when i go on DTM01 or 02 i want to play the up to date maps.&nbsp;<br><br>2) Out of the 7 Nebula servers, 3 of them are offline, 2 of which are Throwback and Mix01, which are normally the busiest of all lobbies, can someone explain to me why they are offline?&nbsp;<br><br>3) Lag... Time and again we talk about lag, but i cant bridge without block lag and then dying, i try and run about every 5-7 blocks i get slingshotted back, Sometimes i will engage in combat and the player will literally freeze, and still be hitting me and i die. Can we sort the lag out?<br><br>Other than that the servers fine and sorry to be a pain, but i couldn't find anything on the forums about the issues and it's been bugging me lately.<br><br><br><b><u>PLEASE COMMENT IF YOU HAVE ANY ISSUES OR IF I HAVE MISSED ANYTHING OUT.&nbsp;</u></b>

Nametag glitch, when random nametags of players run with you and you cant even place blocks normally or quickly anymore, most especially when bridging or blocking in at the monuments<br><br>Hotbar glitch, idk if anybody else has it but whenever i try to eat my golden apple or food, my hotbar scrolls into another slot, this happens alot to me, most especially during midfight or when im low on hearts and even random players kill me

Yes the blocklag has been a problem for awhile, but the devs are working on it, they aware of it lol it hasn't been fixed yet so it must mean it's difficult to fix.<br><br>The server is too small to get any great devs to come and work their magic, so we gotta just hope that kylo, javi, pav (?) And the new alm can get it done as soon as they can, but it's obviously not an easy job, if it was, it'd be fixed by now XD

I thought no one else had that hotbar glitch.&nbsp;Happens to me all the time, and kills me most of the times because someone is trying to kill me and they are runnimg behind me.

Theres not really any point making these kinda threads atm. The devs know what's wrong and I guess they're tryna fix them. This is like the 3rd post I've seen recently saying 'fix this, fix that' why say it now when you could've pointed out the problems when the update first came...not weeks after the problems have been established?
