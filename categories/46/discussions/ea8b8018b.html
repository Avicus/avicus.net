At that moment innocents have a chance to pick up the bow, thus becoming the Sheriff. <b>(THE MURDERER CAN NOT BE ABLE TO PICK UP THE BOW)<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</b>4. Killing an Innocent:<br><b><br></b>If The Sheriff Happens to kill an Innocent, both the Sheriff and The innocent who was shot die.<b><br></b><br><b><i><u>Innocents:&nbsp;<br></u></i></b><br><ol><li>Objective:</li></ol>To Survive as long as possible and not get killed.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2.

Upon Death:<br><br>When The Innocent Dies, he is out of the game, simple.<br><br><br><b><i><u>MORE INFO:<br></u></i></b><br>It is a one round game meant to be played in small maps (4-6 chunks).<br><br>The players are told what they are before the round starts.<br><br>It is a 2:00 Minute timer, but every time the Miner (Murderer) kills someone, the timer is extended.<br><br>Anti-Tk: Innocents Can't harm other innocents but Sheriff Can<br><br>There is to be 1 Murderer, 1 Sheriff, and Atleast 5 Innocents.<br><br><br><b><i><u>I Know what you are thinking:<br></u></i></b><br>Ripoff of TTT!?!?! No. It is not. It has sorta the same concept except in this, weapons are not scattered, and innocents do not have weapons (unless picked up from Sheriff's dead body. And the only way to tell whether someone is a Murderer or not is to SEE them kill someone, so the Murderer has to be sneaky.<br><br><br><br><br>This Idea Was brought to you by The Following:<br><br>Nitwit Core Team:&nbsp;<a href="https://avicus.net/teams/36" title="Link: https://avicus.net/teams/36">https://avicus.net/teams/36</a><br><br>-AlexTheEpic99

Actually the Innocents have something to do, they can spot out for the Sheriff and also if the sheriff dies, they can become the sheriff.

Yeah but they "can become the sherif" what happens if the sherif dies and the murderer puppy guards the bow? That's no fun

Then stay away from the Miner because if the timer runs out, Innocents win.

How would you know  that he/she who is near the bow is the murderer? This really does seen like a boring idea. No offense. If your a civilian then your pretty much dead since all you do is walk around and not do anything. You just wait either for you to die or for you to find the murderer/find the dead sherif
