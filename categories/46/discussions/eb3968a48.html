Hello guys. This is first post that I write.<br>I was lagging so much and I was dieing because of blocklag in DTM.&nbsp;<br>It happened to me everytime and I was stucked in a wood block and keep glitching. Even I try to move, I went back to the same place.<br><br>I know I did wrong. But because I was annoyed, I said F**k. Which I got banned for A MONTH. Because of one swear word.&nbsp;<br><br>Anyway to get unbanned?

Hi ShinnyGaming!<br><br>If I'm right, you need to apply for unban via email address. I'll tell you how to apply for unban later, let me just look how to.

You should try to apply in "Appeal an infraction" section.

Hey ShinnyGaming,<br><br>To appeal an infraction you can either email our support email: support@avicus.net or create a new discussion here:&nbsp;<a href="https://avicus.net/forums?topic_id=50" title="Link: https://avicus.net/forums?topic_id=50">https://avicus.net/forums?topic_id=50</a><br>Please be sure to follow the correct format when making an appeal in that area.<br><br>However, please be aware that you were not banned for profanity. You were banned for excessive infractions.<br>I'm going to lock this discussion now due to the fact that the question has been answered and there is no longer a need for this.<br><br>Sincerely,<br>FrostedCupcakez
