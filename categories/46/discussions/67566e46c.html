Hi I am kind of new to the server and I was wondering why do people not play The Walls at all on this server?

Since I'm the one working on Walls I'll give the best answer I can give.<br><br>For a long time, Walls had a lot of problems with a lot of different things, and they were just never fixed so the people that did play Walls stopped and it started to die. With that, the development side of the server (Map Devs and Devs) saw less and less of a reason to fix Walls. Eventually it was removed and recently it's been added back. When it was added back there was some problems with the kits and the maps. I'm working to fix those.&nbsp;<br><br>Maps-<br>For the maps, a lot of them are actually very good, and are very well liked by myself and other Walls players. The problem is that those maps have diamonds on them. Diamonds that are known by people that have been playing Walls for years. New people don't know where to find those diamonds and end up getting 2-4 shot after the Walls fall. As a new player I'm pretty sure getting 2-4 shot after every game, and after preparing for 10 minutes, I would not play again.&nbsp;<br><br>To fix this, I'm planning to get rid of the maps that have lots of diamonds, and replace them with maps that have mostly iron with maybe 2-4 obvious diamonds that are easy to find. Obviously, to do that the maps have to be made so it will take some time, but the end goal for the maps is to make them fair for new and old players to play against each other.<br><br>Kits-&nbsp;<br>The kits were already updated, and they are much more even than they were before, but there are a few things that need to be adjusted with them. This is much lower priority, but it's on the list to work on.

The only maps I liked were the Tetris ones. Extremely easy to learn and navigate, loved the themes and it added character to the gamemode.

I agree, some of my favorite maps, but they sucked in terms of new and old players playing together.&nbsp;<br><br>Any old player would have full diamond, especially on a Tetris map. The new maps that are coming use the same mine without diamonds, so that should help with that problem.
