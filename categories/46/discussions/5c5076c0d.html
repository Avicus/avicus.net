True story: So I'm on walls playing tetris swamp and I get the Evil Witch Pickaxe &nbsp;and I'm mining the diamonds and I see on of my teammates come down realizing hes too late to get the pic and diamonds. &nbsp;I'm thinking he must be soo sad he missed the diamonds, so I kindly give him 4 out of 10 of the diamonds I mined. &nbsp;And then this troll decides to drop lava on me. &nbsp;So now I'm really upset that this sad meatloaf that you call a player team killed but killed me AFTER I give him diamonds. &nbsp;Now I report him but no mod shows up, don't blame em' got other problems to deal with in the server. &nbsp;I stay simply because I want to see him die. &nbsp;He not only kills me but decides to take out the other guy of our team. &nbsp;Now I'm really upset, but what really what riles me up every time this happens is the guy wins the whole map solo. &nbsp;Has this ever happened to you and what moment in avicus gets you mad when it happens?

Next time you get team killed, please use the /report command. It will notify all staff online and at least one will attend and investigate your report. You might as well report the player a few times if you see that no staff are coming. Also, we do not notify players when we investigate a report, so the staff may be there without you knowing.<br><br>If no one comes, get some evidence (screenshot/video) and post them under the player reports forum tab.

The problem with getting evidence is I can't record all the time so its hard to get any evidence.

sorry homie but so funny.&nbsp; Teammates killing you isn't very fun.&nbsp; However, you showed good judgment by giving you teammate the diamonds and reporting him.&nbsp; Just remember that you are the better person and he is a jackass.
