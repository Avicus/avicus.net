Are Staff Equal?

This goes out to everyone out there playing on Avicus who have experienced difficulties with staff. Should staff be respected by force or should they be treated the same as every human should be?

Not a really hard question.&nbsp;<br><br>Everybody should be respected equally. And just do you know, you don't have to like someone to respect him. I don't like a lot of the staff, but I don't disrespect them. Forced respect obviously doesn't exist on Avicus if you take a look at the community's posts. And it's a good thing they do what they do. &lt;3

I am having trouble comprehending what you're trying to say, however staff are no different than regulars, they're just regulars with a few more commands, that follow the same rules as a regular.

I agree with you. I have been recently kicked for team grief when i was only trying to help out. They did not even give me a warn when i just get kicked. I accidentally blocked the obi when Snow the Mod. was trying to mine it. He clearly saw i wasn't going to mine the obi. I was trying to defend so the other team would not enter there obi and get it back to there control.

Ok, one misconception;<br>Everyone, well, majority of players here believe that being a staff member is a job. No, it's a <i>volunteer </i>job - meaning all staff members are expected to withstand hatred no matter what extent.&nbsp;<br><br>Therefore, with that logic, staff members should be respected and hated depending on the situation.

I'm not salty cause I was demoted. The admins that demoted me are no longer there. What I am salty about is that Sr Staff and Admins&nbsp;<b>broke the rules</b> and got no type of punishment except a 5 minute ban for "harassment".<br>That is why I'm salty.<br>So don't be calling me salty for a reason that I'm not.

I was banned by Peachy for "harassment" because I called Friends a bad show. It was a joke ban. Peachy let me get on my phone to get back on because he was too lazy to remove it. I logged on to get banned again by Auratix_ for "ban evading."

This isn't a problem with one staff. It is with most of the staff. Who believe they have superiority over regular minecraft players and we need less of those staff.

It is the same with with staff and a regular minecraft player. <br><br><br>In addition to this. When there is a problem with staff and a regular player, and if there are more staff in the lobby or game. The other staff have the right to step in to help, but what side do they mostly choose? The staffs position. They less likely choose the player with less power. Want to know why? I'm just going to tell you. You do not want to break the friendship with other staff and you also do not want to start a conflict with another player with superior power.

They usually side with the other staff because the other staff is correct and/or has a better point.

If you punch a kid in the playground youll get suspended and dont be surpised if you do.<br><br>what im trying to say is yes staff members at times can be dicks, so what, anyone that knows me knows that i can be a total dick and i bet everyone here has been a dickhead at some stage as well. <br><br>The thing is staff members dont have to be staff members, if they wanted they could just leave. They've made a commitment to the rest of you players out there to help you and make the servers a better place. So they get angry at you for a petty reason, whoopdee do, they also banned that fly hacked a minute ago and that kill aura kid that was shredding your precious kd.&nbsp;<br><br>So can you stop just focusing on the negatives. "Snow kicked me for something stupid = Bad mod?" what about the 3 hours Snow's been doing nothing but server hopping to spectate ppl who've been reported. And maybe 10 or so hackers he's banned, and the 10 ppl he's told to calm down and maybe theres a bug on one of the servers he's trying to fix. I'm not seeing you creating a topic over all the good things.

That commitment came with them to not be over the rules.<br>But there have been higher up staff members breaking those rules.<br>That is the difference with teachers, they won't break rules but they will make mistakes when someone may not be legitimately breaking the rules.<br>But I do agree, you break a rule you should get punished, no questions asked xd. You shouldn't be shaming staff on that part unless it legit is wrongful and it happened multiple times.

I 100% Agree. You think all the staff do are get in biased arguments or situations with players? The staff side with each other in many cases cause the other staff have a better point. I am also tired of people complaining about "biased" staff. leyva26, you&nbsp;got what? A kick? So one monument lost, so like 10 credits down the drain? Who cares. I understand that a in some cases staff have gotten above the rules but it's the past few of those staff members are even still staff.

I can not understand what you mean here. It was just a simple question and I was just agreeing with other players. This is what i mean. People make situations into a big deal. Including myself. Yes like I did right now. But people do really need to control the way they look toward things. Including staff. Also we need to be less bias on choosing sides when a staff is trying to punish a player. The staff should at least give a warning first. Not an automatic kick. That is unbelievable. Maybe the player may take it into consideration if the staff was at least trying to comply with the player. For example, Say if the player were trying to block the entrance to something<b> important.</b> The staff saw what the player and just kicked him. At least let the player explain why he or she blocked the entrance to the important thing. In addition, staff need to stop <b>assuming</b> things and let players explain the situation and then the staff and player can work things out. This will dramatically increase the respect of a player to a staff. It would also help people in life to make better decisions and not do them again. If the staff and player were to <b>comply</b> together there would no conflict and peace. This is a really important message. Please read and thank you. :) I hope this really changes things' up a bit with the community. :)

I can not understand what you mean here. It was just a simple question and I was just agreeing with other players. This is what i mean. People make situations into a big deal. Including myself. Yes like I did right now. But people do really need to control the way they look toward things. Including staff. Also we need to be less bias on choosing sides when a staff is trying to punish a player. The staff should at least give a warning first. Not an automatic kick. That is unbelievable. Maybe the player may take it into consideration if the staff was at least trying to comply with the player. For example, Say if the player were trying to block the entrance to something<b> important.</b> The staff saw what the player and just kicked him. At least let the player explain why he or she blocked the entrance to the important thing. In addition, staff need to stop <b>assuming</b> things and let players explain the situation and then the staff and player can work things out. This will dramatically increase the respect of a player to a staff. It would also help people in life to make better decisions and not do them again. If the staff and player were to <b>comply</b> together there would no conflict and peace. This is a really important message. Please read and thank you. :) I hope this really changes things' up a bit with the community. :)

I was a staff member for 5 months I know the rules it is an instant kick for monument blocking end of story. Before you say the reason I side with the staff was because I was staff, I'm not. I was demoted I did something wrong and received my punishment just like everyone else.

That's actually kind of disrespectful to Venomous considering you don't actually know what he was demoted for. You also just believe that all the staff continue to act high and mighty after their demotions (wanting a final word). I don't see much evidence to back up your claims. I've been on the staff team, yet I'm not in it to say the last word, I'm in it to justify. If that comes down to me having the last word, that's what it comes down to.

I'm going to bring up a point here. No, staff are not treated equally all the time in terms of punishments, and that's a problem that needs to be fixed (if a staff member is <b>legitimately breaking the rules)</b>. However, every time someone sees a staff members messing or joking around, they come to the conclusion that the staff member is bad, and is breaking the rules. @Vlad IIRC I was playing the Spanish dialogue in the Music Room (not in a regular chat) and people didn't complain. In fact, they seemed to enjoy it. I don't see how that, in any way, is breaking the rules. I guess the issue with Pop was cleared up, but I'll leave you to that. Anyways, what some people fail to realize is that we&nbsp;<b></b><i>are</i>&nbsp; playing a game. People come here to have a laugh and enjoy playing minecraft together. Staff members are a group of people who make sure everything is going smoothly so that&nbsp;<i>everyone</i> can enjoy their experiences on the server. This doesn't mean staff members have to always seem unapproachable and distant all the time. When any member of the staff teams finds themselves in a serious situation, they need to be mature, understanding, and somewhat assertive. However, on TeamSpeak, where most people are there to enjoy their time playing, it's completely fine for <i>everyone </i>to be relaxed,&nbsp;<i></i>in addition to joking and generally having a good time.

The staff are trying to deal with the problem, and it really is common sense for you not to troll other players, build in front of spawn, block people breaking monuments etc. Also, for every player that has a good excuse for doing something that would normally not be allowed, there are 2 others that are just trolling for a laugh and won't stop unless you kick them. In addition, if a staff member were to ask you why you were doing it and then you had to respond back, that would dramatically increase the amount of time it would take to deal with a report, and less reports could be dealt with, which in turn will let more people get away with things that are punishable.

This isn't a problem with one staff. It is with most of the staff. Who believe they have superiority over regular minecraft players and we need less of those staff.

When there is a problem with staff and a regular player, and if there are more staff in the lobby or game. The other staff have the right to step in to help, but what side do they mostly choose?

You do not want to break the friendship with other staff and you also do not want to start a conflict with another player with superior power.

Staff are meant to enforce rules over players, making the server a safe and friendly environment to play on. They cannot, in any circumstances control other players, even if the player is breaking a rule (if they are, and even after being warned, they choose to continue, a punishment is issued, but even then, nobody is controlled) In the comparison you made with officers, the officers cannot show superiority. They are not above the law, they choose to enforce it, and to be a good role model, they themselves must follow those rules and regulations, otherwise they are fired (demoted if looking at this in a minecraft point of view) We are not above any other player, as we are all equal beings who are meant to help the reputation of the server, not obliterate it. I think maintaining a carefree attitude as a mod or any staff member in fact, is important. I try to always be friendly in a way that any other non staff member will talk to their friend online. Only then do I show strictness, when it is required to help maintain a high quality environment. Other than that, I joke around and have fun with other players. This responsibility as a mod is something that someone volunteers for, as long as they are fulfilling their duties, they can still be great community members as long as they aren't breaking rules themselves.<br>(This is my honest opinion, nobody has forced me to say this if you think that way. :P )&nbsp;<br>Btw, sorry for bad sentence structure, it's 6 am and I haven't slept :P<br><i>~kammy<br></i><br><b>EDIT:&nbsp;</b>While reading through these posts, it seems that based on the judgment of one staff member, all of them are now tyrants. If one of them messes up, I'm certain talking to them in a mature manner would help resolve the issue. Unfortunately, the route that people keep taking is the one where a mountain is made out of a molehill. Grudges are held, and frustration builds up. Is this seriously necessary when there is a much better option? It honestly concerns me...<br><br><i></i>

Okay, this post has gone way off topic, but from what I've read it's pretty much a complaint about your kick. <br><br>I said this before, but there is no way we can tell whether you monument blocked intentionally.

Being a mod or staff means more prioritizing to who is on top. The admins are on the top and are the most influential to new players. That being said you get respect from them and their helpers(mods) by following the rules. If you break a rule, you will not get a lot of respect and that is in a motion that can be kick, warn, ban, etc. If a higher up is seen as disrespectful to the player base in one or more ways they will loose their respect and get a demotion or on avicus a spank in the bottom. If a higher up doesn't act as a leader during this time the player base will see him/her unfit as a leader and will want someone who has the characteristics. Everyone reacts to different character traits. I can act like a goof ball and silly and not many people will care. A mod or higher up does that? He/she will be treated as unfit for the position. I literally just quoted the Mods v Player base section in another server. What that is saying is no. Mods are praised higher from the start if new players come onto the server while donators can be generalized by new players as the best pvpers.Everyone gets a start at being introduced and later you will be socialized by the way you act on Avicus services such as the server, forums, ts. It might not look fair but it is. Different elements get thrown into the way and boom, people are praised higher

I can slowly see the staff team actually improving, the last few days, &nbsp;I have seen more reports getting noticed, more quicker, and I can see less moderators being biased. So just stop. I want to thank you, the moderators for putting your time and effort on the server, even though the journey was rough before, it is becoming smoother. I do not want you guys to stop improving but if you can keep on improving staff like this, I can see Avicus having more players, also you will need to sort issues like Block Lag. I don't want to sugarcoat this, just improve, have fun, and if you need anything from me, any help or advice, contact me ^.^
