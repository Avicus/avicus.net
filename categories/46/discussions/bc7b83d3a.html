I was just wondering if anybody around here had played these two amazing games?<br>Try not to give away any plot points or spoil anything, feel free to suggest similar games!

Played Walking Dead also. Really really good. A nice break from all the FPS and generic games.

Season 2 felt too short. I couldn't connect with any of the characters as I did with #1. Don't get me wrong, It was still a good game.

I'd start with 1 anyway and I think the first episode is free anyway so if you don't like that then you don't have to buy anymore.

I think they've cut too many characters off in season 2, it leaves you less attached to the survivors. <i>But.... Kenny ;_;<br><br></i>I don't know if they can ever reach that same level of character design as the first season, the end was almost heartbreaking<i>.<br><br>@</i>Arachadonic<i><br></i>I've played both seasons, I was wondering which one you guys preffered ;)<i><br></i>

I &lt;333333 The Walking Dead Season1. &nbsp;I connected with the characters more emotionally than I did with the ones on season 2.

Bump for timezones.<br>Anyone's opinions of The Wolf among Us?<br>Personally I think it's just as good as The Walking Dead.
