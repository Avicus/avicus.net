I got my account on February 5th, I changed my name on the 7th or 8th... Then I started playing on Avicus around the 10-12... Since then, i've only had 4 infractions... And now I'm banned for life. It makes me wonder how my friend never got banned before me because he had too many infractions. So if i'm being banned now, why was he never banned. I am hopelessly confused... I'd even be ok If I got temp banned, just I have no understanding of why I was banned under so few infractions. I hope I won't have to dump 30 dollars to buy a new account JUST to play on Avicus because my friend screwed this one up... This whole situation just makes no sense and any help would be appreciated.
