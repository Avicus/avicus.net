A 'friendliest players' list is always going to be biased, as is a 'best at PvP' list.

There is NO such thing as "the best pvpers". Everyone has different ping. some people have not warmed up yet. some are laggy. some hack. There will always be somebody better than you and somebody better than them...

Yes there is. If you have lag and it makes you worse than someone else then it sucks but you're still worse. If someone hacks they don't count as better than you. Being the best is usually interpretted extremely subjectively though when there is such a big pool of people to choose from, even in a case like avicus with around 300 active participants. The best player is whoever consistently beats everyone else. This subject of being the best changes a lot though as people's skill fluctuates depending on factors such as how much they play. &nbsp;For example on OCN it was Breezily for a while, Melynlas for a while, and Unphair for a while, but ginie1 all time
