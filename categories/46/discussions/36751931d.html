</h1>
Hello everyone!<br><br>As some of you may know, my YouTube channel has just hit 300 subscribers! &lt;3<br><br>Because I have reached this milestone in just one year of YouTube (could be a lot, could be a little bit, depending on how you consider it), so I was thinking of doing something special!<br><br>I already have a pretty cool prank call recorded (yes, it is appropriate for all ages), but I have already done many other prank calls, so I need a new idea; something creative, for my 300 subscribers special video!<br><br>If you have any ideas,&nbsp;<b>please&nbsp;</b>make sure to let me know!<br><br>*<b></b><i>I was going to do a giveaway, but I've decided to save that for 500 subscribers, if I ever reach that goal*.<br></i><i><br></i>Thanks everyone, stay awesome!<i><br></i>

Actually, I was thinking of starting a "Shoutout Saturday" or something like that.<br><br>It gives YouTubers a chance to get bigger! :)<br><br>Also, thanks for the idea!

I've done quite a few PvP montages, I kind of want to do something that not many people do; something that I don't do regularly.&nbsp;<br><br>Thanks for the idea though!

Hrmm... maybe try do a collab with some of the upcoming talented youtubers here in this community (or elsewhere, but I'd try keep it Avicus related). Would both promote them aswell as make you aware to their subs so everyone benefits! Plus the server if you film it there.

Do a Nebula Video but make a huge arena for you to 1v1 diamondporkchop3 and get everyone else to make their own seats (using the materials given when they spawn). And then have them cheer one of you two and record the 1v1 ?<br><br>If you like this idea, please give credit hue<br>:)

You have to be different, you should record my comeback on Avicus and be my first kill and you will multiply your amount of subscribers (Lol I'm joking xD). <br><br>As you only have 300 subscribers, it would be best to actually collab with other youtubers, i'm thinking of someone with more than 500 + subscribers, not the Avicus ones who have a maximum of 100 subscribers.

If I do happen to do that, I would blur out the name; I would not show everyone that a certain player is hacking.

Yeah... but, I am saying that you can do a video like OllieGamerZ did...<br>He did it a "*CN Guide" for know what do in each one of the situations.<br>He just in a map record like if he was in OCN but he did it in a private server... We need that someone do it on &nbsp;AVN

You should do collarbs! And maybe a nebula montage? That shout out Saturday would be cool but you should only give shout outs to people with at least 100 subs to see if they are good at youtube(or if they have good content but low subscriber rate). And if you'd like, play Five Nights at Freddy's(and record it, duh) &nbsp;&gt;:D Muahahahahahahaha

That's what I'm thinking; if they have good content, they will get a shoutout, they can't be all bored in their videos, not keeping anyone entertained.
