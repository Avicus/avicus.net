So i was with my m8 earlier and he was taking about mojang and servers he said stuff along these likes:<br><br>Mojang isn't happy that ppl are making money off his game so he i making it so the only thing you can sell is stuff you made yourself like mods ,so no ranks, this'll bring down most of the servers coz they are expensive to run. appraently this has been a term/condition for a yr bt now he desides he eants more ppl on realms so he gets more money so canceling buying stuff makes ppl not go on servers but on realms.<br><br>I belive unless he changes this minecaft wontbe played as much.<br><br>However my mate said if it's a major serever which means about 500 on at a time it won't be as significant so my question is what will hapen to avicus?<br><br>-Whale<br><br>P.S sorry 4 bad typing and this is just what i herd got no proof but theres prob stuff on web

I don't think so. The staff seems very confident (let's hope)

Probably not pets, as they're really only cosmetic and don't affect gameplay in the slightest.<br><br>Here's an FAQ from Mojang about this. Really clears up some rumours flying around: <a href="https://mojang.com/2014/06/lets-talk-server-monetisation-the-follow-up-qa/" rel="nofollow">https://mojang.com/2014/06/lets-talk-server-monetisation-the-follow-up-qa/</a><br><br>But, really, there's been quite a few threads about the EULA on Avicus already, and I'm pretty sure the staff have answered questions about it. No real need for worry, as I'm sure the team will work something out.
