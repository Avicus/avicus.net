This is for all people that are good with PCs and I'm pretty damn confused on a topic related with monitors, as I'm going to buy a new one soon.&nbsp;<br><br>First of all, I would like to know how much FPS these specs would get me on the following games (at 1080p and tell me in lowest to highest settings)<br><br>Specs:<br><br>Intel-Core i5-4460 @3.2 Ghz (4 cores) CPU<br><br>EVGA GeForce GTX 750 Ti 2 GB Video Card<br><br>8GB DDR3 1600Mhz RAM<br><br>Games:<br><br>CS:GO<br><br>TF2<br><br>MC<br><br>Borderlands 2<br><br><br>Second, is that is it worth getting 144Hz over 60Hz if I want the optimal experience?<br><br>I mean, I would like 144Hz but I was wondering will I benefit from it?<br><br>Third, is the difference between IPS and TN panels.<br><br>Fourth, I need some information on how to overclock a monitor's refresh rate.<br><br>Fifth, is there much of a difference between&nbsp;<br><br>-5 and 4 ms<br><br>-5 and 3 ms<br><br>-5 and 2 ms<br><br>-5 and 1 ms response times.<br><br>Thanks! Also, these are the two monitors I was looking at:<br><br><a href="https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/part/acer-monitor-umfg6aab01" title="Link: https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/part/acer-monitor-umfg6aab01">https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/part/acer-monitor-umfg6aab01</a><br><br><a href="https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/part/benq-monitor-gl2460hm" title="Link: https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/part/benq-monitor-gl2460hm">https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/part/benq-monitor-gl2460hm</a>

1) I have personally no experience with it but from what I know there is a difference bewtween 144hz and 60hz and it is noticable. you get a better experience. One problem you might have though is that if you are not able to reach 144 fps you are going to have screen tearing, so it might be useful to also get a moniutor with g sync<br>2)The difference between IPS and TN is mainly that IPS got better, colours, better viewing angles and TN got less latency, and is cheaper. Finding a 144hz IPS panel is very hard and will also hurt your wallet ALOT. So don't be afraid of going with TN. They have evolved alot in the last few years.<br>3)I wouldn't risk overclocking your monitor. A) you will void your warranty,B) You might kill your monitor C) most of the times you will only be able to get a slight increas (like 5-10hz) which are barely noticeable. All of those points are very general. might differ from some monitors&nbsp;<br>4) anything below 5ms is good. I can't see the difference tbh

144hz is definitely worth it

Thanks!<br><br>The problem I was worried about was not reaching the 144 FPS I need, but I can always turn the quality down, or even turn the refresh rate down. I'm sure I'll be fine though, since most games I'm going to play won't be much demanding and I'm only running on 1080p.

144hz are better than 60hz, you'll feel the difference.

144hz is best. If you can't reach that FPS you can go to 120

Ok then, I'm going to test the games out and see if I am reaching 144 FPS. I need FRAPS to view my FPS right?
