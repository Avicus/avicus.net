Ive been looking for a &nbsp;(preferably wireless) gaming mouse with a few easily programmable buttons, like wun for optifine zoom, sprint F5 etc. I dont wanna pay tuu much for it, preferably around $50. My friend has a razer ouroborous which i can easily get around 16 cps (which i need because ping likes to not register my hits &gt;:E) &nbsp;with and find it really comfortable so if yew guys know of anything similar or a way of getting it cheaper that would be greatly appreciated. &nbsp; &nbsp; :D

If you use claw while jitterclicking then Logitech G502 isn't gonna be the mouse for you, even if it is a good mouse. The side thumb button is very intrusive. Logitech gaming mice are high quality and good products. Imo Logitech G402 is a great option for really presice aim. If you want to look into the higher price range the Razer Naga is a great option. I'd suggest a Logitech mouse for the price range you're going for though.&nbsp;<br><br>Look at other underrated mice brands and look on amazon. Great deals.&nbsp;<br><br>Logitech mice are more worth the money at that price range than other well-known brands like Razer.

Don't get a wireless mouse, very slight delay when using one. Although, I only had experience with cheap ones, so more expensive ones may be a&nbsp;<i>better</i> solution, but a wired mouse IMO is the way to go.

I still highly recommend these mice, regardless.&nbsp;<br>Logitech G502 and G402 are both amazing. G402 is ridiculously accurate. If you want a mouse that preforms well without many to no macro buttons as a sacrifice for something cheaper and good quality, look into steel series mice. I still reccomend Logitech over it though.&nbsp;<br><br>G502's macro buttons are more conveniently placed than the G402's IMO and are very nice, but if you want a very precise hand movement to mouse movement ratio, you want a G402.&nbsp;<br><br>Do some research and decide which mouse suits your style.
