<span><i></i>idk I don't see any point in a super nice mouse but if you get one DONT get a wireless one... I got one thinking it would help keep cords uner control but at some point after using the mouse for about 4/5 maybe 6 hours it starts to lag. so any wired mouse that fits on you hand good should be fine :D</span>

I personally use a Mionix Naos 3200 (adjustable dpi settings (3) and 2 side macro buttons) which is great for palm grip and fits your hand very well. Razer Deathadder is another, great performance and click speed but if you want to save a bit and get something perfect save $70-80 and get the Razer Naga. Beautiful mouse with high cps abilities and 12 macro buttons on the side for hotkey efficiency. It's what I'm getting in the next 2 months either for christmas or I buy it myself.

Still very good mice, but to understand why the 02's are Better you have to understand logitechs product naming system.<br><br>Current gen Logitech gaming mice are the G402, G502 and the G602.<br>The G 4/5 series are mainly fps mice, aimed towards those who play fps games.&nbsp;<br>The G6 series is primarily targeted towards mom users that utilize many side buttons.<br><br>The series, in order go (Astericks replaced by which number series it is)<br>G*<br>G*x<br>G*00<br>G*00s<br>G*02<br><br>That was in chronological order from release dates. A few things to note. Logitech only produces one product from each series at a time, being the latest one. Eg, Logitech no longer manufactures the G500s, G400s or the G600. All of these have been replaced with the '02' series.&nbsp;<br><br>Basically, if you were to buy, say  a G500, you would be two generations behind and buying something that has been sitting in a warehouse for 3 or so years. Driver support has either been discontinued or will be discontinued soon and the features and ergonomics will be inferior to current gen.<br><br>tl;dr buy the ones ending in '02'

I use a G600, only good if you play more than Minecraft like MMO's. It's really big for my small hands but I got used to it. I recommend you use it if you have a mouse pad and don't mind having a crap ton of buttons at your disposal. The G602 looks better tho. :/

G502 is a good mouse. Not sure if you want to buy it but I have dropped it multiple times and not even a scratch. Not to mention couple extra buttons and a DPI shift (DPI goes up to 12k). Its a very nice mouse. Heavily recommend.

I've had G500 since i got this computer. My earlier one broke because the wire was rubbing on the table so the metal wires cut. I have had the new one for quite some time now and it's very good.
