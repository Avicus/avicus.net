If you use Scout I recommend staying with the Scattergun, for the other two slots I personally find Flying Guillotine and Sandman (I use that heheh)<br><br>For Soldier a good weapon is the Black Box since it heals you everytime you land a hit on someone else. As a secondary weapon I use the Reserve Shooter since it gives you mini-crits for 5 seconds after you switch to it + it gives you faster weapon switch. (You can also use the Reserve Shooter with Pyro).<br><br>If you like using the Medic, the Crusader's Crossbow is a very good primary weapon imo, if you shoot your own team members you heal them, and it deals fairly good damage as well.<br><br>If you're going Demo I recommend either Loch-n-Load or Loose Cannon (depends on how you like to play/which one suits you best). Then a Splendid Shield + Persian Persuader and you're gonna do good B}<br><br>Not saying these are the best loadouts for these classes but I personally find them good and I am able to play decently myself with these weapons. Good luck!

Engineer is also a really great class if you know how to use it. When you get 11 achievements with Engineer, you get "the gunslinger" which allows you to build a mini sentry, and it's probably one of the best engineer items. Besides that, I would use the wrangler since it allows you to take control of your sentry gun, and you can shoot much farther than when the sentry is shooting by itself. For the main weapon I would use the widowmaker (very easy to obtain) since it uses metal as ammo, and you also gain ammo every time you hit an enemy. Basically if you are hitting accurately with it, you'll never run out of ammo. Best engineer loudout in my opinion!

Actually, I have been using the engineer class a ton! So far I'm doing pretty good! Do you know how to switch/edit your username though?

Yep! When you're in-game, just hit Shift+Tab, and it'll bring up the Steam menu. From that, right click on your name on the top right corner and click "change" or "edit" (I don't have it open right now but it's something like that).<br>That's pretty much it!

Can you change your overall Steam profile name as well?
