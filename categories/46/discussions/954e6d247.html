<span><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;">I am going in order for these, from left to right in the /kits list.</span></p><br><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;"><b><i>Changes/ removals:</i></b></span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;"><b>Barbarian</b>- Make this a sharpness I iron sword, and give 5 steak, and maybe a stone pickaxe. As of right now this kit it very under-powered. Yes, it’s the first kit, and shouldn’t be very good, but it should not be to the point of that everyone who uses it has a disadvantage.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;"><b>Miner</b>- Looks good to me, maybe add an unbreaking of efficiency enchant? Just throwing out ideas, :)</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;"><b>Cook</b>- This kit used to be very good, and very useful, now, no one uses it. I’d say go back to 5 steak, and 2 golden apples. It was actually useful that way. c:</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;"><b>BeastMaster</b>- Not a bad kit, but no one uses it, and there is not really a reason to. Either make all the wolves 1 bone to train, and add more wolves, or remove it. Imo, remove.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;"><b>Snowman</b>- Right now, it blinds opponents when you hit them with it. No one uses this, it could be useful in some situations, but it’s useless in most. Remove.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;"><b>Tarzan</b>- Completely useless. Remove.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;"><b>Poseidon</b>- Used to be useful, made it bad. Make it regeneration 1 in water, and constant water breathing. Nothing more, nothing less.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;"><b>Builder</b>- Not all that bad, but not worth adjusting. Remove.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;"><b>Archer</b>- Never seen anyone use it, I think it gives 32 arrows, and a punch 1 bow. Not worth it, bows and arrows are easy to get. Remove.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;"><b>Healer</b>- No, just no… It should have regeneration 2 forever, and maybe 1 or 2 healing 2 potions.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;"><b>Lumberjack</b>- More food, maybe a diamond axe?</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;"><b>Smelter</b>- This should just give you the iron/gold as soon as you mine it. The point of this kit would be to get iron and gold as quickly as possible. Making a furnace and punching it with iron ore in your hand is faster, but not worth it. Either fix what I said, or remove.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;"><b>Sonic</b>- The speed 2 was perfectly fine, it was slightly op, but speed 1 is too underpowered.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;"><b>Cookiemonster</b>- Remove the strength, healing, and resistance effects and add some negative effects, and you’re good.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;"><b>Leech</b>- Sorry, this kit is not bad, but too hard to fix and not be way too OP. Remove.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;"><b>Stomper</b>- This one will be controversial, but it’s too OP. Make the kit give you diamond boots with feather falling 4. It’s too OP as it is right now, and if skybases are going to be added back (as they should) this kit will be too OP.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;"><b>Tank</b>- If I remember right, this kit is full leather...Seriously? Remove.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;"><b>Wither</b>- Give wither 2, and make the effect longer. Not worth the kit as is.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;"><b>Ghast</b>- Really? This kit is the most pointless kit ever. I would say remove it, but I think there are ways to make this kit better. I had an idea for the kit to be able to hover for 1-2 seconds. Would be useful when taking skybases, when falling, or even just going across a small gap. It could be a very good kit, and very much worth it, but not too OP.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;"><b>Alchemist</b>- I don’t remember what this kit gives/does, but I do remember it’s very bad. Remove.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;"><b>Magician</b>- Not a bad kit, add more lapis, and a stone pickaxe and I’d say it’s good to go. :)</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;"><b>Fireman</b>- Good for team killing I guess? Who wants that.. Remove.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;"><b>Guardian</b>- Has diamond helmet and iron chestplate right now. Not really a way to fix this one and make it worth using, without being too OP. Remove.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;"><b>Maniac</b>- If I remember right, this kit gives 2-3 seconds of strength from each kill. That’s not bad, but not really worth it with the smaller number of players playing walls these days. ;( Remove.</span></p><br><br><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;">I will need help with names. ;p </span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;"><b><i>New kit ideas: </i></b></span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;"><b>Multiplier</b>- Maybe something that gives double or triple the blocks when mining stone or logs? It could be very useful for getting blocks to take down a skybase, a much more efficient.</span></p><br><br><br><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;">I will add suggestions of new kits ideas and changes to this list. Kits that will help take down a skybase are recommended, if the height limit is going to go up a little bit more. :) </span></span>

Tank is not full leather, it has a mix of iron, leather, chainmail and gold.<br><br>It isn't the best kit. But we need some choices, cause from your post you want to remove half of them, not allowing any choice.

I would balance some kits out, have some debuffs, and take a few of the ones nobody even knows what they do out.. So make some kits more OP but add debuffs like weakness and slowness when you use an ability?

Stomper is finer for now, but what if they make the height limit go back up, so there's actually a possible chance for a skybase? Then stomper will be too OP. The 0 falling damage against a skybase is too OP, skybases pretty much rely on fall damage. :/ I love stomper just as much as everyone else, but it's too OP against a skybase

Maybe make it that stomper kit only gives no damage if you fall from, say 50 blocks. And if you fall from more than 50 blocks you take fall damage?

Maybe add a slowness 2 effect when you land? Or a blindness effect? Some kind of&nbsp; debuff? <br><br>EDIT: And what Pat said is also a great idea.<br>

Stomper should take no fall damage, but give none as well, you can build sky bases still, and the goal is to knock the opponent off when they get close, the whole transfer damage thing is just so bent

Healer with infinite regen 2 would be the new Poseidon except without having to be in water. I think it's fine how it is.&nbsp;<br><br>I also disagree with the sonic being changed back to speed 2.

It's not that great but it's viable and I see no reason to remove it.&nbsp;<br><br>I'm pretty much on the and page with the other ideas though.

<span>"</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; ">Healer with infinite regen 2 would be the new Poseidon except without having to be in water."<br>-Poseidon was like regen 3, regeneration 2 isn't all that OP, it's useful for regenerating after a fight, and while running, but aside from that it's really not that useful. If you use a regeneration 2 potion right before a fight, you can still die fairly easy, it's no where close to as OP as Poseidon was. lol</span>
