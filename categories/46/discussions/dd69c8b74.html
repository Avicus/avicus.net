Ninja bridging is staircasing.<br>Many people get confused by this.<br><br>Ninja Bridging is staircasing without shift.<br>Shroom Bridging is straight bridging, while letting go of shift for a split second.

Its not. About 5 tournaments ago on OCN a team called ninja squad first used the shift un shift tactic and thus called it ninja bridging, This could be used in going straight or staircasing.<br>3 tournaments later, Shroomtastic did the staircasing technique without shifting at all and he name shroom bridging became a thing. Recently Breezily used a technique in one of his videos were you don't shift at all and pres "a" and "d" repetitively. That is called Breezily bridging

Your facts are a little wrong. GoG was the first tournament that ninja bridging was attempted and it was by either Badlion or Starfish. When it was done it was fast...for what it was. The Ocn community knew about this bridging for two more tournaments before Shroom did that. Take Varis Hawk for example. Varis is the fastest person to do a spread, but he didn't make it. There are also rumors that Badlion could of done that type of bridging if they lasted longer then GoG.

All this bridging histroy debate lol<br><br>Anyways, it isn't really hard. You technically don't even have to get to the very edge of the block.

Only peasants ninja bridge!&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZwwDCtiefs" title="Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZwwDCtiefs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZwwDCtiefs</a><br>Edit: Didn't realize you were talking about staircases, in which case the best way is to bind placing blocks on your left mouse button and jitter clicking while jumping and pressing s in small coordinated taps, don't hold it otherwise you'll die

I haven't tried it in 1.8. But if you're connecting using a 1.7 client it's a different story. Not really easy to teach though. You have to practice, just like anything else.

I'm gonna avoid naming the techniques since nobody agrees on them.<br><br>If you're aiming at staircasing while letting go of shift at a rhythm, you basically want to let go right before placing a block. Immediately after releasing shift, press down space for a tiny amount of time, just enough for you to place a block while jumping up once. Then, let go of space and press down shift again. I usually hold my mouse down for this one. It'll take a lot of practice to get the timing correct, so don't be frustrated if you can't get it your first try.<br><br>If you want to staircase without shifting at all, I learned to just spam my click as fast as I can while keeping my aim steady. Alternate between pressing space and either a+w or d+w, depending on which side you're facing. It'll take a lot of practice to get a good-looking staircase fast, but it's really useful. If you can't jitterclick while keeping your aim steady, like me, you can train yourself with the rhythm by either using an autoclicker in single player, or taping down your mouse while clicking. This is only for training purposes.
