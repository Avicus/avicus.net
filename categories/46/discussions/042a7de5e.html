So I've been using a cheap old logitech normal mouse and I don't like it that much =P.<br><br>My budget is 60 but I would prefer a 30$ one (Canadian)<br>So, Halp!!<br><br>EDIT: I would also like it to be wired just cause i'm used to it and I don't want the mouse to shut down on my while I'm playing

Logitech G502 or G402 at that price range. $30 you can't really get anything worthwhile imo&nbsp;<br><br>They're both around $50

I have a deathadder. If you can get it on sale go for it. The mouse is absolutely amazing, even though it takes a little to get used to the way you grip it.

I like it. Has side grips for thumbs when I jitter. My jitter aim isn't too good, but I feel like I have quite good control over the mouse. Customizable dpi helps as well to suit your style. Really depends on how you hold the mouse tbh, but overall good control.

Most gaming mice have smoother clicks, so they generally let you click faster (AKA why people jitterclick with DeathAdders and not with $3 wireless mice).

A cheap and very well mouse for gaming is the Logetech M310. I am saying this because this works very well with gaming even though its not a gaming keyboard and plus its under 20 dollars.

Sorry to come to this after 9 months, but I might as well bump this instead of making a new discussion.<br><br>My DeathAdder is nearing the end of the warranty, and I've been told that the right click breaks around 6 months. I took a couple months break around 3 months ago, for exams, and I've seen it break just after the warranty ends for a lot of people on the internet. For that, I need a backup mouse. It needs to have 2+ buttons, at least 5000 DPI, some lighting (preferably green) good feeling switches, a right handed ergo shaped design, a good sensor, a good mouse wheel, rubber side grips, good build quality, and it needs to be under 80$. I dont mind where it comes from<br><br>I was thinking this<br><br><a href="https://www.asus.com/ROG-Republic-Of-Gamers/ROG_Gladius/" title="Link: https://www.asus.com/ROG-Republic-Of-Gamers/ROG_Gladius/">https://www.asus.com/ROG-Republic-Of-Gamers/ROG_Gladius/</a>

Dude you don't need a back up mouse, i have had a deathadder for 10 months and nothing has even slightly gone wrong, it's still in perfect condition. Unless you are beating it then i don't know how you could break it.

First of all, don't judge. Second, I never said I want 12k dpi. The G402 has around 4000, and I play with 5000. Not everyone is used to playing with control. My hand Doesn't move much, so high dpi is important. I also need something light. Again, some people do use the 12k xD
