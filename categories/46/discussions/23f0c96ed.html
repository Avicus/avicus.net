<ol><li>I was playing a map today... I think it was Battle of &lt;something&gt;, it's a nebula map and you start out with nothing. So today I saw SO MANY people spawn camping/killing. Just a request, should this map be removed? With the limited 10 minutes and size of map (and the fact that you start out with nothing), i don't really feel it as a Neb. Map. Also the fact that there is spawn killing.</li></ol><br>I couldn't report anyone cause literally EVERYONE was spawn killing on my team. They also blocked the area so none of the other team could move as soon as they respawned.<br><br>#StillTryingToLearnHowToUseTSForModApps

Heey I think it was "Battle Of Margor", but that's a nexus map. And this is a really big problem... The only thing you &nbsp;can do is /report or record them and fill an forum report out. the second thing is better I think. Hope there is something that help you :D

The best thing you could do when that happens is that you record that.&nbsp;<br><br>@resepignev<br><br>There is a nebula map called that.

Im the maker of BoM. First im sorry if this is happening. 1. its not TDM its suppose to be DTM. 2. The spawns are suppose to be on the boats. 3. You should start with items. Do not call it bad when its not in the right Gamemode.

I think it was meant as a nebula map, but got messed up. I mean, there was an obsidian block on the boats. Just that there was no spawn protection and kits and etc...
