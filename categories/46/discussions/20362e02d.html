Anything about the game, have you guys played it, do you like it? I'm currently in Season 2: Episode 3 and stuff is heating up a lot. I'm still sad Lee died though :c Carver is...evil, not as much as me though...Sarah I feel bad for. Kenny is back! But the same..any thoughts about le game? I think it was pretty good. I can't say I would choose it over minecraft because if I finish the game...what's the point of playing it again, besides choosing opposite interactions. What do you think about the game?&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;So, I've actually played all of the available episode and let me tell you that I love them. The first season is my personal favorite though. The relationship with Lee and Clementine is, in my opinion, one of the greatest pairing in video game history. You actually felt for them and could relate to them. The ending of the first season made me feel "the feels", but I felt like it had to happen. Overall,&nbsp;definitely one of the best games this decade and possibly one of the greatest stories of all time.

When my decision was to kill Lee I was soooooooooooo sad. But when season two came I was really happy with that decision because Clemintine is more bad a** in my opinion one of the best games I've played c: the different characters, the setting, it was all awesome.

I like the story very much. The gameplay was not my favorite. I prefer something like heavy rain because your actions have more impact on the story. The seconds season is pretty good so far.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Of course it was going to be sad. It was like you died and was just waiting for it all&nbsp;to end.&nbsp;When a character that you've invested time in has died, it definitely leaves an empty void inside you. I totally agree with the Clementine part. The only thing I would hate is that if Clementine dies and you take over Sarah next season. Like, no. She should live through the whole thing. This game does&nbsp;prove that the&nbsp;story and characters are much more important than graphics.

Wait I thought Sarah was dead though. And I hope Clem doesn't die, she made season two ultimately epic, she had to do all the dirty work while they were imprisoned in Carvers thingy. SHES BASICALLY LEE &nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Dead? More like unknown. Rule "insert number" of The Walking Dead: "If you didn't see someone die, they are not dead". Kenny is an example of that. I'll rage if Clem dies. It wouldn't be fair. Anyways, do you have&nbsp;any thoughts about Carver?

Oh good point, Carver I think he made a pretty good villain, he was really agressive, killing Reggie was pure cruel considering the fact his arm was chopped off. Making Doc hitting his daughter also got to me, but it did make sense to me, Sarah did need to see the really cruel side of the world. Deciding to watch Carvers death was pretty disgusting, What did you decide to do when you saw Sarita get bit?&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Well, I chose the arm. But here's the problem: Clem used the tomahawk to kill the walkers before the decision. So the blood of the walkers probably went into Sarita's bloodstream. Thus, possibly killing her. I think that either way, she might die. It's a shame because I liked her ._.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Oh Lily, I actually liked her. I hoped that she would come back with a pimped up RV or something. The thing is, she might have been the Lily from Woodbury from the comics. If that's the case, I don't think that she will come back. You know, to keep the game canon. What are your thought about Ben?

I knew Ben was doing it from the beginning he was really fidgity and stuff, but I felt bad afterwards when he died. I gained lots of respect at him when he snapped at Kenny.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yeah, same. I liked him for some reason. One of the things I didn't like about the game was that some of the choices didn't matter. Like, I pulled Ben up from the bell tower, but he dies like a day later. I wanted to form my own group with my choices, but it's totally understandable from a developer perspective.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So, what do you think about the fate of Christa? I feel like she will return, but she will die soon after.
