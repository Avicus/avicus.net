Practice.<br>There's no tip that's going to make you instantly good. There's a few things here and there that make a slight difference. But the only thing that can drastically change your skills is practice :P

Well first it is about <b>Practice</b>, without this, there is no way you can improve in PvP. I was a terrible PvPer 1 year ago, now I have improved dracastically! Then try different techniques, which one will be the best one for you, Jumping while Sprinting and hitting to get critical hits or is it shifting while blocking hitting? Or &nbsp;jitter-clicking? Try these out but first do it on a Soup/Pot PvP server to do it, Avicus, well it is quite difficult to focus on your techniques when there is a huge variety of people trying to get you while 1vs1, you can focus on the player in front of you, first 1vs1 server then Avicus to see if you improved! Also improvement does not take place in a short period of time, maybe one month will get you to a Better PvPer than before!

I am not great at PvP but I have picked up a few tricks that I have noticed are working.<br><br>1. Strafing, if you don't already making sure you run semi or full circles or even left to right around the enemy to confuse them and make it harder to hit you. Take note that you will not win when you first start, just forget about your KD and focus on hitting then and not being hit back.<br><br>2. Block hitting, pretty simple you block hit when you are in a tunnel or a place where you cannot move.

Also you have to always block hit but only when the enemy is hitting you. Blockhitting in a chase is a bad idea because it slows you down. Blockhitting is just left clicking and right clicking at the same time. It hits the person and also blocks you. It is a very perfect technique for being really good in PvP.

Shift tap, block hit, and strafe. Start by strafing, and once you have landed a few hits, shift tap and block hit.

I usually crack my fingers and get a little warmed up before I PVP because I'm a nerd x3<br>Personally, I love to strafe and then block hit if you're getting low or if there's multiple enemies you don't know if you can take on or not. Another thing that I find super helpful is if you have multiple, to always eat your golden apple if you don't have the full 12 hearts. If you don't eat them before you go into combat, you might never make any use of them.<br>Good luck! (:

<b>I feel that playing here and on minecade really worked for me as here it's such a quick game(not&nbsp;necessarily in speed, but you can instantly re-spawn) and the walls on my other server your playing against great players and games take a while to start so you have to think and use kits or biomes to your advantage.<br><br>I also go into&nbsp;single player in creative and build skybases, spawn a bunch of mobs in them and then fight them off.

I am not prestige.<br>Means, in my opinion, nothing.<br>I can hold my own against most people in the server, because I have been like this for a while.<br>Here is some tips:<br>-Practice long shots.<br>-Practice making quick structures that help you win the 1v1; ie, pits, sniping posts<br>-Learn the maps, and use them to your advantage.<br>-Use the other teams armor (just don't run straight through them. &nbsp;Only worked once for me on senex)<br>-Jump and swing your sword to achieve a critical hit (however, makes you knockback-able and gets "ctdggd hacks, you killed me in 3 blows"<br>-Go on ocn. &nbsp;Great training zone, in my opinion.<br>-Take occasional brakes. &nbsp;Never do marathons over 2 hours without one break.<br>-Use teamspeak<br>-Use gaming materials (razer, turtle beach, etc)<br>-Make sure you are comfortable before you start playing<br>-Have fun<br>-Don't call people a noob (look whos talking) ;)<br>I'm out.
