Hi everyone! :D<br><br>So lately i have been playing this game in Steam called Counter Strike Global Offensive (CS:GO). Its a very fun, tactical team/teamwork based FPS game that is being played professionally by pro teams at a tournament now with a prize pool of $250,000(usd i believe).<br><br>So any way, i was just wonering if anyone else played it? To you play MatchMaking comp? What is your *rank? And are you interested in playing with me?<br><br>*The CSGO ranking system is extremely important to me, as i think we need people of a similiar skill level, as apose to one person that carries the team, or one person that is a bit slow on the calls, rotates ect.<br><br>my current rank is only Silver Elite Master so i am looking for people of roughly Silver Elile/Gold Nova 1. If you have absloutly no idea what i am talking about, go to your web browser of choice and type into the images section "CS:GO Ranks", and that should give you a rough idea of what to expect.<br><br>So, then i began to wonder if Avicus could have a CS:GO team, or if that was too big of a dream... We would just need basically the Avicus Logo as a picture thingy and possibly a TeamSpeak server...<br><br>If anyone is interested please respond here, or if you need any more information/help please... Leave a reply here...<br><br>Have a great day/night depending on where you are, hope to see afew responses by tommorrow.<br><br>PLEASE NOTE: I am in Australia, and would much rather have Aus players rather than EU/US players, just because of connection problems.<br><br>if this is breaking the rules in what ever way shape or form please kindly remove it or what ever :) thank you

I've got it, on my alt I got Gold Nova and on my new I got Silver 2,&nbsp;I didnt play competitive till 2 days ago on my new account (Im aiming for Master Guardian by a month at least! ).<br><br>A CSGO team would be great, since I know a few avicus players that have it.<br><br>Btw I had a m4a4 asiimov field tested and and this guy is willing to give me&nbsp; stat-trak m4a1-s atomic alloy factory new :O<br><br>Add me Through steam my name is mepanda2, it should come up with ZERO-TICK<br>This is my new one, so it is really bad, even if I have alot of playtime, since i thought&nbsp;I would not get a alt!
