I know this isn't Avicus related, so a staff member can archive/lock this if they want.<br><br>I've been running a server for a while, it's going pretty good and I have nice staff, but, I've been having problems.<br><br>IDK anything about plugins and coding.<br><br>I need someone that can do stuff like:&nbsp;<br><br>-Portals from the hub to Factions/KitPvP/Mini-Game worlds<br><br>Disabling PvP, blocking placing, etc. in certain worlds and certain places.<br><br>-Permissions. Right now the lowest staff rank, Helper, which we want to just have /kick, has the same permissions as owner.<br><br>Thanks for reading!<br><br>-Zach

The more you try to do on your own, the more you learn.<br>The things you listed are rather easy to configure.<br>If you don't find anyone, try getting some help from google and so on, pretty sure it wouldn't take too much time ;)

I would recommend World Guard for those worlds you want protected but as for the others, all those plugins so just visit&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.bukkit.org">http://www.bukkit.org/</a>, check out the plugins and download the plugins you want. Good luck!

I have a lot of experience with bukkit developing as well as client side modifications. I can help you with your server if you need. Do you need a portfolio?

A lot of Bukkit plugins aren't customisable. I would recommend learning how to program, it'll be so much easier in the long run...

We know, we have most of them. It's just that none of us know how to/understand how to use them, and we don't have enough time to figure this out.
