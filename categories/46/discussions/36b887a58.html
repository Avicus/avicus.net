So, I was browsing the interwebs to come across a new graphics card to replace my shitty "business" one and found this&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/EVGA-GeForce-Profile-Graphics-01G-P3-3731-KR/dp/B00L5GZOOK/?&amp;tag=bom-tomshardware-20">http://www.amazon.com/EVGA-GeForce-Profile-Graphics-01G-P3-3731-KR/dp/B00L5GZOOK/?&amp;tag=bom-tomshardware-20</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>Its within my budget (very slighty, we dont have much computing money :/) a bad graphics card and a fucked up OS has been identified for my extreme fps drop as i run an i7 and still fall under 10 fps .-.<br><br>anywaysh is this any good?

I would recommend resetting your OS, and the graphics card looks good.

Considering your budget, that should do great! I have a similar gpu, and I can get up to 200 fps!

Any Nvidia GEforce is good, or any GE period. I personally have a 660 and it works very well

How does this compare with the intel HD 4000? Is it worth the swap?

I have Nvidia GEforce G10 and I run Minecraft great. I'm probably gonna upgrade but that's only because I'm going to be playing games that may require a better one. (Plus I'll be able to run MC even better then).<br>With my current graphics card, I'm usually at about 60 fps at highest settings. Get optifine tho if you don't have it, it helps a lot.

Intel graphics are pretty entry-level, or integrated graphics, so pretty much any stand-alone graphics card eill be better. Also, what is your budget?

Ok, respond if this is ok with your PC and your Budget, if not Ill look into a great performing GPU for less money and that will be compatible with your PC.<br><br>hmm, If you have a high budget go with this card:<br><br><br><b>gigabyte radeon r9 270x</b><br>Spec:<br><ul><li>WINDFORCE 3X Cooling system</li><li>Powered by AMD Radeonâ„¢ R9 270X GPU</li><li>Integrated with 2GB GDDR5 memory, 256-bit memory interface</li><li>Features Dual-link DVI-I/ DVI-D / HDMI / DisplayPort</li><li>BASE:1050MHz / BOOST:1100 MHz</li><li>System power supply requirement: 500W</li><li>Size:&nbsp;H=43 L=290 W=142 mm</li></ul><br>And IF you have a low budget, Idk<br>And can I see all your PC specs?<br><br>EDIT: Looking at your budget...

The quality of graphics card you'll need depends on what games you play. If you're just playing Minecraft, you shouldn't need something extremely intense (unless you wanna play with, like, SEUS shaders and still have full fps lmao) If you're also playing some other games that are more graphics intensive, that's when you'll wanna get something more expensive. Like I said, my card is fairly cheap. I mostly play only Minecraft, and I run it at full graphics and get great fps.<br>Like vsplesk said, what are your other specs?

The r9 270x Can handle MC up to 300+ fps with a right processor, and if you have a decent enough CPU then you are set for gaming..

OK, You might as well not even try to help.<br><br>I dont see anything bad about AMD, The radeon 200 series is one of their best GPU's they've made, so Im not complaining.... take a look at some reviews on it, I do agree that NVIDIA is better... But AMD has a crossfire method, so that way you can place 2 or more AMDD graphics cards, doesnt matter which type... It can be a radeon r9 280x + another AMD that is totally diffirent...<br><br>I'd actually perfer to have an AMD for gaming as I see they are pretty good, now yes NVIDIA and the GTX series is better, but look at the price, AMD makes good GPUs for a lower price range...

I rate you to keep your money until you have enough for a real gamer gpu, gtx 740+.<br>I just waited years, and now I have one of the best gpu's, but if you can't wait for more money, I rate you to buy some amd. It's very cheap for the price. (But it's still shit :DDDDDDDD)

<u></u>I have a low end AMD gpu (r7 240). My average fps on minecraft is 120 on max settings. And can peak all the way to 300 fps and never drops below 80. I can also play bf4 with medium settings and 50 fps. The card only cost me $40 USD. That is why I go with AMD. It is really good for the price. Nvidia <i><u>is</u></i>&nbsp;more reliable, but you pay a lot more.
