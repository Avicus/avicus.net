All we know there're much lag spikes and surely it was reported on the github repository of issues. Ivy knows it, but he's too much things to-do so it will take time to fix it :c

I mean FPS Lag spikes, as random FPS drops. Sorry, should have made that more clear!

That is maybe your PC, then.&nbsp;<br>Maybe sometimes your ram is full or your CPU is, maybe you have to buy a better GPU or maybe search it up on Google. Maybe your PC has some viruses or you should watch some YouTube videos about have a better FPS...

:/ But he said it wasn't only on Avicus, it was just FPS drops or Spikes, I told to him that was the problem, and he said just NOT, that was what he said, it wasn't only the problem you are saying, read all before commenting... :)

Yes, but it will change only like 5-10 fps, nothing very "good" though.

How much RAM does your PC have? I recommend you add less than a half of your RAM.

Adding more ram to mine ready can increase your fps by more than 15. It just depends how much more you add.... &nbsp;e.g &nbsp; when I played with 1 gig, my min fps was about 50 and max was around 200. After allocating mc 4 gigs, &nbsp;I now get at least 80 fps, and a max of 330

If you're using too much RAM then your PC and MC will lag. I built a PC and have a good amount of RAM, but still only use 1G and everything works fine and I suggest using 1G. Uninstalling and reinstalling seems to help with almost anything xD, so try it. Also, you may not realize it, but your brother's laptop may have a bunch of junk files. Try installing YAC, it's a junk cleaner, system and boot-up optimizer, add-blocker (enable in settings), internet usage monitor, etc and a free trial of anti malware. Avast is a good anti-virus program that's free as well. I'm just trying to address all issues that may come up :P.

well you seem to be making a lot of help posts recently, so I try XD. Lol, you need to set up a Skype account so we can talk sometime and also help you keep in touch with other people. My Skype is in the about section of my profile (the side tab was being stupid .-. and I never bothered to set it up after). Talk about PvP and issues and stuff :P. 1v1s as well. If you ever look to get equipment for your computor or look to improve your PC/whatever, I can help a bit.

Normally, I just re-log and that fixes it.<br>Even if it doesn't, it doesn't last long for me anyway.
