So there are 25 teams registered in the Omega Tournament and, the original plan was to have only 16 or 32. If it is still going to be restricted to 16, 9 teams won't be able to play.<br><br>My feedback:<br><br>Allow all 25 to play.<br><br>Possible options: (Leave feedback below!)

Some have 0 - 10 players so they will be removed.

Um, no. All of the registered teams have twelve to eighteen players participating in the tournament.

Perhaps hold some sort of team cut? Like a type of competition to release 9 teams? The only other thing I could think of would be making some sort of 25 team bracket. (Which would be hard).

I might have a solution to this if all 25 teams stay<br><br><br>• 5 groups of 5 teams<br>• Each team plays the other 4 teams in the group<br>• Points system is used and the top 2 teams in each group advance (now there are 10 teams)<br>• Out of these 10 teams, the 4 that were registered last are randomly paired and put through an extra match<br>• The two losing teams are eliminated, the two winning teams are still in the bracket<br>• There are 8 teams and the tournament advanced as normal

I'd rather have all 25 teams play and it would also be complicated to seed them because the seeds won't reflect how good the teams are.

Guys, we have still 1 month before this tm starts, I think we should have an extra 5 days to register, or until we got 32 teams

I doubt we are going to be able to field 32 teams that are big enough to compete.

Well, I think that there are a lot of OCN teams that might be interested, And there are lots of OCN players playing too. Those players will get their OCN team ready than I think.

I think the remaining 9 should have a smaller tournament like the the omega micro tourney, or a there could be a few ransoms games as qualifiers. Having heats is another option

Only 7 more teams need to enter. I'm sure that can be managed

It would be pretty hard to compete with only four members. You can't even be sure that all four would be online at the same time.

I didn't really expect we would be able to compete as my team is &nbsp;only friends from school and we don't really know anyone :/

It might work but all the OCN teams would get "bad" seeds
