So basically the avicus gamemodes right now are getting pretty boring IMO. So I want to know what you guys like about gamemodes or making a completely new gamemode.<br><br>My Idea:<br><br>Survival Games + The Walls.<br><br>How this would work:<br><br>Instead of mining for your items you have to completely rely on chests. But the chest won't be stacked they will be filled with regular items that you would find on sg games. <br><br>The Reason For It:<br><br>People complain when someone gets full diamond and they only have full iron and they completely destroy you, but if you had the same odds nobody should be complaining about what gear people get because it is at random what they find.<br><br>&nbsp;So tell me your opinions on my idea and post some of your own gamemode ideas!<br><br>Thanks!!!!!!!1<br><br>-Dawson

(Gracias Para &lt;3)<br><br><br>&nbsp;I like your idea, but instead of making it it's own gamemode we could try making it a sub gamemode. Nonetheless, great idea!

Avicus needs to fix it's current problems first before introducing anything new.

I really liked that idea yourself and your brother came up with! I'd love to see it implemented on the Avicus Network
