LED monitors won't be good for your eyes long term, your better of getting a bit more expensive on with glass over it for example acer.&nbsp;<br><br>To have 2 screens all you need is 2 cables that you can context to your graphics card on the back of your pc, I have 2 HDMI cables. When to have that so e just go into configurations on your OS and in monitors press whichever one you want to be tbe main one.

LED monitors are good quality its just that your eyes may get tired quicker, it really depends on the person.
