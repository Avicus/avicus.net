Hey everyone. So I've been trying to record a game on my computer called "Mount &amp; Blade: Warband", and i was getting a solid 60+ frames in-game when I was recording, but when I watched the file afterwards, it was the laggiest thing I've ever seen.<br><br>I recorded 2 episodes of this game a few months back, but didn't continue it, and it didn't look laggy ay all:&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9-41Lf-xfA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9-41Lf-xfA</a><br><br>I've tried updating my graphics card, but all drivers and everything are up to date.<br>I really need help with this, I haven't been able to upload for almost 2 weeks, which is the longest amount of time that I haven't uploaded in.<br>The software which I currently use is "Fraps".<br>I've tried using Camtasia Studio, but it doesn't capture the game, just my desktop.<br><br>Thanks for the help! :)<br><br>-Porks

When you record, your FPS generally drops quite a lot, but 60+ is still good. I don't record personally, so I can't really help, but I have previous experience with others recording. When you upload, I have been told that the FPS is really bad and therefore it looks laggy. Try and get Bandicam, that's better, but I'm not sure. I don't get it because if you watch <a rel="nofollow" href="http://youtube.com/markiplier">Markiplier</a>, he doesn't get lag, but plays at 30fps, so I don'g get it lol.<br><br>Sorry I can't really help, but try different recorders and maybe invest in a more powerful laptop.<br><br>BiZa

check the number thingy that pops in the corner, whatever number shows there is how many frames the recording software is recording at
