LG looks really solid right now and so does Na'vi, so I wouldn't count them out yet. Hopefully EnVyUs actually shows up to this tourney because they haven't been doing to good.

Hope to see nV bounce back, and it would be cool to see Astralis do well. I'll be watching the final in Spain :)

I'm going to watch, and my predictions are a bit different from others.<br><br>I think NIP is going to have a fair chance of winning, think about it. The last tournament, the (I think) IEM one, NIP went 16-14 against fnatic. They aswell won (ESL pro leauge) against fnatic 16-6 on cache, and lost 16-10 on inferno (which is by far fnatics best map). I think Threat have done a lot of impact over the past months with Pyth added, and I think NIP can do quite an upset against them.<br><br>Most likely will Lumonisity have some proper pure strats which will play a big role in getting them far in the tournament.<br><br>EnVyUs have sucked ass the past tms, sometimes not even getting out of groups, but they may recive motivation for a big comeback for the major, will be fun to see.<br><br>VP is shit atm, Pasha had like a 0.5 kdr the past 5 tms or something like that and only really show up 1 per 10 game.<br><br><br>So, NIP or fnatic, imo.

Good predictions. I agree that it seems that NiP are making their way back and they are looking quite good after the league, the question is if the real Get_Right will show up because when he does, you don't want to be around him.

Flipsid3 has a decent chance. Sometimes they play like a Tier 3 team, but other times, they play like a Tier 1 team.<br><br>I remember they came close to Fnatic recently.<br><br>Astralis is probably going to choke in the quarter/semi finals.
