that's what the nubs say. Pyro gets hated ALOT because everyone thinks it's w+m1. In reality that isn't true at all. The compression blast is vital plus the flamethrowers' range is short. You can use the flare gun and axe to get some nice combos on the enemies. Alot of kids flock to pyro because of the flamethrower, but Pyro is seriously underrated. That compression blast is really godamn annoying.

It's the type of game where you have to use strategy and skill. It's a really good game and the characters make funny remarks. The people who say junk probably don't know how to play. :)

I love this game! I'm still pretty bad at it though x3<br><br>I usually play Soldier (easy to pick up) and Pyro (but I think they nerfed the Axtinguisher) but sometimes I'll go Sniper :P

Sniper<br><br>all you gotta do is position yourself right in front of the enemy so that they can't see you but you can see them. Then you just go for the easy haedshot kills.
