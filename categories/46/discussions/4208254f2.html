<span><i>Do not cooperate with the enemy team in order to give your team an advantage.</i></span><br><span>Today we buildt roller coasters (<a href="https://avicus.net/forums/discussions/7788843ce?reply=288854" title="Link: https://avicus.net/forums/discussions/7788843ce?reply=288854">https://avicus.net/forums/discussions/7788843ce?reply=288854</a>)<br>And Zedther came and kick some ppl for "cross-teaming"<br><b>Question is:</b> Does roller coaster give an advantage to someone? Where is word "cross-teaming" in this rule?<br>If building rc with other team doesn't allowed, you should change this rule to "</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; ">Do not cooperate with the enemy team" or you made a mistake and this shouldn't be punishable.</span><span><br></span>

You are allowed to make roller-coasters. However, building with the other team is not fine since your'e not killing each other. It sounds pretty mean but thats how it is. If we allowed cross teaming, people in walls could just frolic in pansies together.

Who cares? Players cross team multiple times to build things together.. If you're going to punish them for it, do it. But its only killing the player count quicker.

Alright, I have a question.<br><br>Let's say I'm on Rendezvous I and I'm on blue team and some of my friends are on red team but we don't want to kill each&nbsp;other, so we make an agreement that we don't but if someone from the other team comes we do kill each other. So to recap I'm chilling with my friends at their defense and someone comes from my team, or vice versa, and we start killing each other, would that count as cross teaming?&nbsp;<br><br>Basically were truced unless someone intervenes.

Well, considering the objective of Nebula is to break monuments and kill people, cross-teaming rules in this situation should still be in place IMO. It's honestly fine (and really fun) to build rollercoasters on maps, but if you can't get everyone who wants to do it on the same team, message a senior staff member to start a different game for you guys to do it without worrying about cross-teaming.

We did it every time, when others (coaster haters) came and played normally. So we've started other servers: DTM and CTW, not only throwback. We run away, they followed.

Few memes for ya.<br>1. The objective is to break the mons/cap wools.<br>2. Killing is just a way of protecting your objectives while attacking the opponent's.<br>3. People are allowed to take their colored armor off and shift to sneak past enemies.<br>4. With these three things we know that: you are not responsible for attacking every enemy you find and that the goal is to break mons/cap wools rather than kill players. Therefore unless the rollercoaster gave one team an advantage this would all appear to be legal.
