Does anyone else feel like they would play survival games if it was more active? I'd love to use it however it never has any players, and I'm reluctant to wait in the survival games lobby until it gathers the players and I'm sure all of you guys feel the same way. Give me a +1 if you'd like to see survival games become more active and post suggestions as to how we or the mods can fix the current inactivity. Thanks guys.

Not sure what the dying comment has to do with SG, but alright. :&gt;<br><br>Anyways, I think making some mini unofficial or official events could help a bit. Maybe 10k for the winner?

I'd only play sg if the servers weren't as laggy as they are.

I suggest that two survival games servers should be taken down, since SG isn't played anymore.
