I heard about this a while ago, but i wanted to share this with you guys, so pretty much there is a new game coming out (Planned in september) it is&nbsp;<b>Super Smash Bros. (Name)</b> This is a very popular game, and one of the award winners of 2012 for Melee. I am super exited and i wanted to know what you guys think of what &nbsp;the new characters could be, and what you think about the other games like brawl and melee. -Matt

I loooove that video game series!! It's just so much fun to sit down with a friend and have some fast-paced gameplay that can either be layed-back or competitive due to how you feel. I won't be playing the new one, though because my house is far away from town and not very many people come over ):

I can't wait for the new SSB! I recently got Project M (a mod) for SSBB and it's amazing! It'll probably keep me covered until the release :D
