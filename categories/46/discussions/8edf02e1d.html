Alright, If you're a person that doesn't know much about the release of the TITAN X or are not&nbsp;familiar with Graphics cards at all, please look at these before you start replying here:<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BEdK5R-VAs">GeForce GTX TITAN X Overview (LTT)</a><br><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgZ7w7i19Do">What Is a Graphics card?</a><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.geforce.com/hardware/desktop-gpus/geforce-gtx-titan-x/features">Features of the TITAN X</a>&nbsp;(NVIDIA Website)<br><br>Now that you are somewhat&nbsp;familiar with this, lets talk about it:<br>So I want to hear some opinions from you,&nbsp;<br>1) In your opinion is it worth the Price?<br>2) If you had one, what would you do?<br>3) Has it changed much from the Titan Z?<br>4) Will NVIDIA Make profit out of it<br>5) If you had the money, would you buy it, or an SLI of 980's?<br>6) Is it worth $1000?<br>7) What do you feel about the new Design of it?<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>For me personally, I don't really know why they bother to release the Titans, I mean they already have monster GPU's, such as 980's and what-not.<br><br>I got to give it some props tho, for having over 3000 Cuda cores, not too bad for $1k.<br>Even tho the Titan Z was overkill with 5000? Cuda cores, It was still around 1.5k...<br>(Idk where Im going with this)<br><br>Now the design of the Titan, isn't impressive... sure, the colors turned grayer, darker, blacker.. But honestly they need to change their stock cooler, its getting boring now...<br><br>If I were able to buy it, would I? Well NVIDIA saying that the X card is 'The fastest GPU', I wouldn't go that route, instead I would go with 2 SLI of 770 Classified, which deliver whopping 700+ fps on MC (Without recording, don't believe me look it up), And with recording (Fraps) drops to about 400-500, somewhere around there, Idk if the X would do that, but It probably can.<br><br>The Good old 4k Display, Ohh boys, having 12GB of VRAM is just overkill, even for 4k / 5K, not an expert with resolutions here, but Having 12GB is just why, in benchmarks it only exceeds around 6GB for 4k, exactly what a Titan Black can do.<br><br><b><u><i>Now I realize people will hate me for giving bad information, and stating my opinion, but whatever xD, I just want to know what you guys think, Yes, im bad. Bi</i></u></b>
