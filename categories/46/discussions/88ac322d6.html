Actually, 1.8 made people with bad computers lag more. Take me for example, during 1.7, I could actually play the game. In 1.8 I couldn't. That's why I lounged on a build server during most of the time.

In my opinion, all the servers are switching to full 1.8 support. If we keep being held back, we will be left in the dust.<br><br>1.9 is coming out soon, if avicus is still 1.7 by that time... I'm gonna be sad.<br><br>For all of those who do not have good PCs, I'm sorry to say but you're the minority... the majority play on 1.8 and try and get used to it. Including me.<br><br>Besides, with 1.8 the system of enchanting is less randomized and more customizable. Think of all the 1.8 maps that we are trying to use.<br><br>When 1.7 first came you guys were complaining and stayed on 1.6...<br><br>But now that 1.8 is out and 1.7 is still here... you guys still complain... its a cycle...<br><br>I understand your hardware isnt up to par. But instead of getting a new PC altogether you could buy parts to make a good one. Buy an intel i5 or i7. Buy some more RAM even a GTX Nvidia GPU.<br><br>This is 2015 guys... if you have a 2007 PC then you're PC is outdated AF... as time passes by, games will have more graphic fidelity and therefore, if you still have a 2007 PC then you will not be able to play online...<br><br>Imagine, its 2037 and one still has a PC from 2007... thats 30 years right there. Even now, its almost a decade...&nbsp;<br><br>its like its 2008 and one has a PC from 1998...

I liked the server on 1.8 but this is really hypocritical. Basically this complains about people complaining over their inability to play on the server because of the update(s) being ran then it proceeds to complain about the author's inability to play on the server because of the the update(s) being supported. Something you have to realize is that forums are here to give feedback and form a community. This community will have a major say in the proceedings of the server since they are the target audience to the entertainment avicus provides people with. I'm not saying don't complain if you get lag, I'm saying don't complain about other people voicing their opinions then expect all your demands to be met when you voice yours. Part of a democracy is that everyone gets a say or none of us do. If you hate 1.8 great say that you hate it. If you hate 1.7 being supported great say that you hate it. Don't however go around thinking that your opinions are the only ones that matter.

So many good points were made on both sides of this argument, but I still think 1.7 was better. &nbsp;Less buggy, laggy, blockhitting was still a thing. &nbsp;In terms of pvp, &nbsp;1.8 didn't really add much, &nbsp;mostly just lag.<br>Just something I'd like to throw out,to all the people saying to just 'buy a new computer' just don't. If it were that simple, &nbsp;everyone would have one.

It's people like you who really put us in a bad light and make the staff more reluctant to listen to our pleas when you whine pretentiously about something a myriad of other players have been requesting. I wouldn't be surprised if a moderator decided to rant here about the community's asking for one thing, then demanding the opposite after they got what they initially desired. It's inconceivably egocentric and selfish to expect the server to accommodate solely for your wishes with little (if any) regard to anyone else's.<br><br>What's with the opposition to keeping support for 1.7? I agree that the server can't run on an old version of Minecraft indefinitely, but using the "all servers will inevitably switch to 1.8" argument is senseless. If a history textbook has two versions — both of which supply the same fundamental material — and the "newer" one presents it in a more irrational and inefficient format (true story), why "upgrade" from the older one? To digress, I've asked before why the need to drop 1.7 support was so exigent all of a sudden and never received an answer, but now, as far as I'm aware, there was some code for which 1.7 was too obsolete to utilize, judging by the recent downgrade. That, on the other hand, is a valid reason.<br><br>Anyway, I feel the same way about 1.8. Sure, having new blocks and items is cool... the new enchanting system is much more preferable as well. I very much like those facets of the update. But, at least when on Avicus, the PvP aspect of gameplay — what this server invariably revolves around in almost a subjugated, slavish manner — is completely butchered. I don't even need to delve much into this specific issue because it's been evinced countless times by others (Stimulating and Tino, to name a few), and the forums are already cluttered with enough threads on the subject.<br><br>I used to be one of the most active players in Nebula prior to the Omega Update; when said update was released, I played one match of DTM. Save for a (pitiably few) brief, intermittent instances, I have not been on the server since. This is entirely because I can hardly get a single kill anymore — I literally have to strike someone four times before they take damage. If I ever charge at a member of the enemy team headfirst, I always lose — even when in superior armor — because the game is practically weighted in their favor to grant them the first hit. After that, I either succumb to an inhuman combo, or fly off the map; this is all due to either (a) Avicus using 1.8, (b) poorer latency on the server's end, or (c) both.<br><br>That effectively makes Minecraft completely unplayable for me. Ultimately, retrograding is at best palliative; a temporary, relatively sufficient fix for a more divisive issue...

Quite a few valuable points are being made in this thread, but I'm just going to state one thing that has been mentioned before a few times.<div><br></div><div>1.9 is indeed under management and is due to be released sooner that we'll expect, by the looks of it. This means we're going to need to get people to start coping with 1.8 so that we're all geared up and ready for 1.9. Otherwise, the community will begin to crumble into even more conflict once the anticipated 1.9 is released.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>And I may be drifting a little off topic here, but they&nbsp;<i>did&nbsp;</i>state that 1.9 was the combat update, so there may be a little spark of hope for improvements towards the state that PvP is in now.</div>

So it's all about YOU and how YOU lag but some people can't afford to buy another computer and actually lag less on 1.7 instead of hardly being able to run 1.8 but instead YOU are just complaining how YOU lag when a lot of players have come back just to play 1.7

<p>^^^ I can barely play on 1.7 without lag, I can get maybe 5 minutes without it. #BringBack1.8 xD I'm now saying that having 1.7 is bad, but all the maps that were made for 1.8, all the work that went into 1.7, just to switch it back to 1.7. Plus 1.8 enchanting for walls, at least, is&nbsp;so much better. You know what you are going to get, and you can get sharp 2, prot 2 so much easier, it adds a new aspect to the game that I personally really like. It makes you feel OP, but you also have to be careful, what if another team has that same stuff. Plus when ever we updated back to 1.7 so many glitches came around, of course there always will be, but I like 1.8. I've gotten used to it, for the most part at least, and I prefer it.</p><p>(My opinion don't hate me &lt;3)</p><p>-Micah</p>

This is true, but at least for me, I get huge lag spikes every 2 minutes or so. Not fun.

You guys keep saying that we are hypocrites like "you asked for 1.7 now you hate it?????"<br><br>What if these were the guys who did not support going back to be 1.7, maybe they wanted from the get go to stay 1.8, some of you are being quite rash in assuming that the ones complaining are the ones who wanted to go back to 1.7.<br><br>By the way, for those saying the community asked for 1.7, that's a lie, most "go back to 1.7" posts were 50-50 when it came to who agreed and who disagreed.<br><br>I personally think it should be only 1.8, we can't keep holding on to what's behind us, now I don't agree with this posts reasoning, I find it the wrong reason to go back to 1.8 because of ONE PERSONS LAG, but I do believe that we need to move on, 1.9 is coming and when it comes, we will be stuck at 1.7 because we are too sentimental

For me, 1.8 is better than 1.7 I have an Intel Pentium, and with 1.8 go good, but with 1.7 there is a lot of lag.

Please, elaborate the point of this thread to me.&nbsp;<br><br>The only thing this thread is doing is repeating the counter to the outcries from the community. We've already seen this over and over, and it's becoming absolutely sickening to see this issue come up over and over.&nbsp;<br><br>If you want players to stop complaining, take action using a different procedure. Half the people who see this thread will not even bother to keep what you said as reference.&nbsp;<br><br>Let whatever needs to happen, happen. But please let it happen in peace.&nbsp;<br><br>Honestly.
