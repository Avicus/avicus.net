Sylveon is cursed. But why leafeon? I'd say umbreon just because of personal preference of types and colour schemes.

Try playing on play.pokemonshowdown.com. It's a simulator where you don't actually have to train up your Pokemon (you just generate and build the team). It uses almost the exact same aesthetics as a regular online battle in ORAS/XY.

I don't have one either. However I've 3 different DSs, each I use for trading/farming in each game. I got a Spiritomb in Platinum because I logged on my Pearl game and just kept capturing my own flag. Also, my Pearl game was a previously owned game in which the first owner had about 200 PalPark events. So then I obtained Pokemon in Platinum that I wouldn't otherwise get without a code or an original Gen 2(?) game.

The newer games are way too easy. EXP. share needs to be desperately nerfed.<br><br>Games like Pokemon Platinum are those hard-ass games where you actually have to try.

Why would you not take competitive seriously when it's literally called competitive? That image doesn't show anything other than someone just thinking about the plays they make - which is done in literally a few seconds if you're good at competitive. If they find it fun, I don't see what right you have to call us assholes.

There's something called being over-competitive, to the point where your mistakes become their entertainment, and your success become their demise. Obviously, being a competitive player myself, I know that I have to take it seriously, which I do, but some people just step over that fine line between competitive and over-competitive.<br><br>Also, when I say assholes, I hope you realize that it only applies to a select few...<br><br><br>sorry for for the confusion lol

The newer games are way too easy. EXP. share needs to be desperately nerfed.<br><br>Games like Pokemon Platinum are those hard-ass games where you actually have to try. I went up against the Pokemon League and lost, and ever since then I've been binge-training...<br><br>And I liked the idea of "Challenge Mode" in Pokemon White 2, it actually made the game fun.

Same, I used to be that way as well<br><br>And scald is a good option, even if the opponent switches in, since there's the 30% burn chance.
