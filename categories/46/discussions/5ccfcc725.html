(Firstly, I'm not trying to enhace any flame war with this post. I just want to hear other people thoughts and opinions on the video and what not so if any staff were to archive this I don't think they'll have any basis to do so since I'm not doing anything wrong in any way. BUT, that's not the point so without further do, I'll proceed with the OP).<br><br>Not really in the mood for making an extremely long or elaborated opinion but how in this world can we have staff members who seem not to be capable to giveaway a proper response against something that's not really hard to manage, in this case, an issue regarding a, TS ROOM? The most simple kind of stuff someone could have ever thought of.<br><br>I've seen a lot of people getting unfairly demoted these last 2 months and trust me, I think they'd do a rather better job as a senior than Pel did in that call (From what I saw only). Once again and I repeat, I'm not trying to shame anyone publicly but we really need a staff training process now, and not only for hack detection but for how to react against those type of problems as well.<br><br>Feel free to answer this, I wanna see discussions being held.

Lol. Wrong? How so? I found a channel and joined a channel (didn't make it). Since the channel was just created there was no rule-set established. When the lobby broke the people who played survival on the random vanilla world weren't abusing glitches they were simply participating in a broken part of the server, same concept but on TS. :D

1. Lol, Pelpel had no reason to ask me to move out in the first place and I don't listen to commands without reason. <br>2. I am special. <br>3. I thought multiple times which exceed the quantity of twice but I came to the conclusion idgaf. <br>4.I didn't abuse a glitch. Avicus staff didn't remove nitro's rank and then he made the channel. I then decided to join it. At no point did I cause a glitch since the channel would exist with or without me in it. I simply participated in the broken bit of avicus much like people who mess around in the broken lobby which include yourself but since you think that is abusing a glitch please feel free to request a temp ban on yourself. :) At no point can I be considered responsible &nbsp;for the creation of the channel nor did I abuse any permissions.

Actually minimodding is discouraged by staff. If you have a problem with someone and what they are doing you are told to report hom/her rather than handle it yourself, as you are doing. :)

I removed the link to it twice, I didn't realize it had been reposted, sorry.<br><br>Cena, as Poeky said, adding a disclaimer to your videos doesn't make it appropriate for the forums. Lots of posts have been locked/archived/etc. because of this even if they had a disclaimer. Feel free to keep the video up, but don't advertise it on these forums please. :p

I dont want to be mean, and I really dont want to get on your bad side, but it is kind pf annoying. Its ok when someone hackusates and you say "Please use /report if you think someone is hacking, because if they are they might turn them off before a staff member comes." But if you are gonna do things like this then why did you retire? Youre basically a mod ;-;<br><br>Once again, I dont want to get on your bad side, Im just stating my opinion.
