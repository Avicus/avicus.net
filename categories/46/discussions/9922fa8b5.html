Is there a mobile version of Teamspeak, because my mic on my mac is not working and it won't work for anything, but facetime. I was wondering if there was a TS for my phone, since I know my phone's mic works, but I was wondering if it was free, thanks.

Yeah, I rather spend my $4 iOS money on music from Sia, but the next time I get more iTunes credit, maybe I will get it.

Javi sent me a free version for android but I forget the link. There is one though, 4$ version ain't worth it.

The only reason why I'm currently asking, is because my team members are getting mad that I'm not talking since my mic doesn't work.

I had almost the same problem. My computer didn't see microphone, so i thought it was broken and bought a new one. But it wasn't (lol) and when started speaking in TS, everything was okay with both mics.

iOS TeamSpeak app is completely trash and not worth the 4 dollars or what ever it is.<br><br>It's full of bugs and somehow I can't connect to some servers using WLAN, just with 3G/4G... Buggy.

The bugs might only be for you. I have TeamSpeak installed on my iOS device and I've only had roughly 2 minor bugs. Except from those 2 bugs, the TeamSpeak runs smoothly for me.
