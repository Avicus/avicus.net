When i was playing the game walls, i made a skybase and killed the last guy. After i won the game, I jumped off my skybase thinking i wouldn't die, but the other team won. please fix this. And by the way this happened 18 months ago.

<br>If this is the same issue that occurred 18&nbsp;months ago like the previous one, keep in mind we had a massive server update and it has never been reported since. The problem is fixed, if it happened 18 months ago there's really no need to worry about it, since it can't happen anymore. :)
