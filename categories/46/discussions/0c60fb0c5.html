Hold W along with A or D and aim at the player, that's a basic strafe. Simple but if you can pull it off well, you can kill 85% of the players on the server.<br><br><br><br>EDIT: A lot of PvP is about aim, no one can teach you how to aim, you just have to practice. Try going on practice servers like Badlion or Kohi (Sorry, can't give you the IP). You can improve your aim there.

My usual tactic involves in doing a regular strafe, like mentioned above, then, I mix in some block hitting and some jittering. If I'm low, but I think the opponent has more health than me, I'll swap to a circle strafe, spam the sprit key and jump for crits.<br><br>By no means am I a professional PVPer, but I'm OK at it :)<br><br>Hope this helps!

Right. My time to shine. <br><br>Strafing:<br><br>You need to run around your opponent whilst fighting them, otherwise they will get more combos on you. Try and jump as much as you can whilst hitting them to get critical hits. (This works best when you have a better ping)<br><br>Blockhitting:<br><br>My favorite, to do this click left and right as much as possible and you will block hit (It works in 1.8 but doesn't show up) This allows you to take less damage as well as hit the opponent. Do this whilst jumping. It is best to do this underground, but I do it everywhere.<br><br>Killfarming:<br><br>Mainly on Avicus,&nbsp; some maps you can Kill farm on. This is where you get good armour (Mainly diamond) and kill the players as they come out of spawn (DO NOT SPAWN KILL) This is good for getting kills and XP.<br><br>Rushing: <br><br>There are lots of ways to rush, some include taking off armour or running through spawn. You can sky bridge, tunnel or go along the ground pathways. Rushing is hard at first but it gets easier.<br><br>Bridging:<br><br>There are loads of types of bridging, Ninja bridging, where you press shift and right click to place a block, and then unshift and run to the edge of the block and repeat. This takes practice but it is great to learn. Breezily bridging, just walking backwards and placing blocks to bridge, but you do not hold shift. This is incredibly hard, but some can actually do it! <br><br>Bow Strafe: <br><br>When firing a shot, jump left or right. This makes it harder for the opponent to hit you. <br><br>Lower ground advantage:<br><br>In sword combat, you can sometimes hit the player if they are above you without you hitting them. <br><br>Hitbox stretching:<br><br>Never ever walk backwards in pvp. This causes hitbox stretching where the opponent can hit you and you can't hit them<br><br>Thats about all I can think of at the moment, there are tons more strategies though :)

As said earlier, aim is the basis for every move you do.<br>If you do not have good aim, almost no tactic works.

Circling is great but better when you have Speed, when you don't have speed- as much as I hate it x3- you should are probably better off using crits and blockhitting

i'll give you a tip that will make you top tier:<br><br>start of with an easy jitter strafe (5-6 cps), aim for the legs, get your opponent in a 2-3 hit combo so they rely on your kb and is out of their normal hit range.&nbsp;<br>now you advance on to an air combo. basically, after the 2-3 hit combo they'll be in your "kb", so what you do is rapidly re engage sprint and put 2-3 rapid hits (re engage sprint after every hit) on your opponent before he takes anymore kb. because of the latency this will build up more kb. also try to variate your swinging movements (right, left) while advancing to an air combo. if you are able to put 3 hits rapidly into your enemy before he launches, you will knock him 10+ blocks. this is great for knocking people out, or knock them away if you're in trouble. 2 hits will be enough, but if you can do 3 thats great.&nbsp;<br><br>and soon you'll be a KB MAGICIAN

If you have above 200ms don't bother with combos, people will always combo you easily because they have the speed advantage. I would strongly recommend that you strafe, I rely on my strafes and not my combos because I never get them.

For this server, I found the best way to kill someone is to strafe and get a hit, then trade hits with them (since you're ahead damage-wise) by block-hitting and critting them. I've found it to be quite easy and effective :3

Actually combos&gt;Criticals so jumping around your opponent is very dangerous since they can get a combo of 2-3 hits while you only get 1-2 crits. And sometimes you get launched in the air and take fall damage. Get a crit combo only works if you out ping them greatly.

I never got 30cps, the clicks per second website I used was glitched and made the clicks double themselve.<br>So 15cps was my real cps but then my hand started to hurt so I stopped and got regular 8cps.

Here's how I see it:<br><br>If you play the game long enough, your aim and click speed will likely improve. And keep in mind that the point of a game is to enjoy it. If you get to the point where you have flawless aim, then you can open up to so much more. Ping doesn't matter. FPS doesn't matter. These just make the game easier. Just keep trying and eventually you'll get there.

fps does matter, way harder to play with 20 fps than 100 fps even if you get used to playing with 20. You can get used to any ping and do the same as someone with lower/higher ping. But yeah, minecraft pvp is all practice there's no trick to getting good instantly.

I like to do a bunch of different tactics when I pvp.&nbsp; Some times I like to 8 block (still don't know how to do it MLG style), some times I would strafe either left or right, and some times I would alternate "A" and "D".&nbsp; This is a way to stay out of your opponents range.&nbsp; A very good tactic.&nbsp; I also would do the "Twerk" or hit Shift just before you hit your opponent.&nbsp; This is kind of like a sprint glitch where you can get some good knock back.&nbsp; I only do this when my opponent gets me into a nasty combo.

I get 260 on AU Kohi, use the delay in between them hitting you and you actually getting the hit registered on you as an oppertinity to get a combo, ask anyone I've fought on AU Kohi, I tank the first hit then get a 4+ hit 8-block every time. Try that

You can do the circle start or just run past each other and swing that would be a really good thing to do, but i prefer circle strat.

Find the strafe that works best for you. I Cayden Circle (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYegol4Xksc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYegol4Xksc</a>) a lot when people leave themselves open or I circle and combo. If their aim is good, I will zigzag approach and look for oppertunities to cut inside. Without speed, blockhit and zigzag strafe a lot, only crit if you outmatch your opponent. Circling doesn't work nearly as well w/o speed. If you can hotkey try for bow combos on servers like Avicus and OCN.

Right. My time to shine. <br><br>Strafing:<br><br>You need to run around your opponent whilst fighting them, otherwise they will get more combos on you. Try and jump as much as you can whilst hitting them to get critical hits. (This works best when you have a better ping)<br><br>Blockhitting:<br><br>My favorite, to do this click left and right as much as possible and you will block hit (It works in 1.8 but doesn't show up) This allows you to take less damage as well as hit the opponent. Do this whilst jumping. It is best to do this underground, but I do it everywhere.<br><br>Killfarming:<br><br>Mainly on Avicus,&nbsp; some maps you can Kill farm on. This is where you get good armour (Mainly diamond) and kill the players as they come out of spawn (DO NOT SPAWN KILL) This is good for getting kills and XP.<br><br>Rushing: <br><br>There are lots of ways to rush, some include taking off armour or running through spawn. You can sky bridge, tunnel or go along the ground pathways. Rushing is hard at first but it gets easier.<br><br>Bridging:<br><br>There are loads of types of bridging, Ninja bridging, where you press shift and right click to place a block, and then unshift and run to the edge of the block and repeat. This takes practice but it is great to learn. Breezily bridging, just walking backwards and placing blocks to bridge, but you do not hold shift. This is incredibly hard, but some can actually do it! <br><br>Bow Strafe: <br><br>When firing a shot, jump left or right. This makes it harder for the opponent to hit you. <br><br>Lower ground advantage:<br><br>In sword combat, you can sometimes hit the player if they are above you without you hitting them. <br><br>Hitbox stretching:<br><br>Never ever walk backwards in pvp. This causes hitbox stretching where the opponent can hit you and you can't hit them<br><br>Thats about all I can think of at the moment, there are tons more strategies though :)

KB is everything. Just do 1 block hit kb and you can straight-line combo him (in Avic/OCN PvP)<div>On kohi or diamond PvP, just strafe after the kb and try to get him in a corned, water or the void. Most of my battles on DTM are played in like 3 seconds because I use the void, don't take risks or damage, just use everything you have.</div>
