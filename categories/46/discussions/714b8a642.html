Ayy, so recently, (not really, been trying for 3 months now) I've been trying to learn to jitter click. I can never actually shake the muscles in my hand and they don't vibrate at all. I've tried a lot of different techniques but none worked. I've tried butterfly clicking but I got the same amount of clicks from that as my normal clicking. If there are any simple clicking strategies that don't involve shaking your hand muscles, I'd like to know, thanks! :}

You could try practicing your index finger's reflexes. Should be easier to do compared to vibrating your hand from its core.<br><br>I PvP with a trackpad, I would know.

Use a WACOM tablet. They're so sensitive, they'll make you quick like mad.<br><br>Honestly though, I just tense up my fingers. Drag clicking is also another technique.

I'm sorry about this.<br><br>The Srs removed the posts as to not provoke continued discussion. However, they didn't clarify the situation. Riley, I believe, is writing something up to define and sum up the confusion.<br><br>I understand how this must seem to you, as this whole situation sent alarms in my own head. The staff didn't mean to delete your posts to silence opinions, and I believe they were going to write an explanation.<br><br>Again, I'm sorry. Have a good day.

Not a problem. Its the least we can do.<br><br>The last thing needed is distrust, and the impression that we are silencing the community's opinions.

To be honest, if you can't jitrer after a lot of practice you won't be able to aim properly even if you do learn it at one point. I recommend either butterfly clicking or just normal clicking. I normal click for PvP and butterfly for blockspam.&nbsp;<br><br>The video I showed you was me proving that I don't autoclick when I was butterflying on the Combo Ladder on BL. Apparently, butterfly isn't allowed on BL, so rip.
