PS4. I have always followed Sony - I got the 1st gen PS3 on the week it came out - I've had it since 2007 and have loved it so much. I then got the PS4 on Christmas 2013 - I love that, too. PS4 all the way. Add my PSN - rhysdude70 if you wish.

PS4, Xbox 1 live is complete bullsh*t, doesnt allow you to swear! Like what kind of person made XBOX?!. But the PS4 for some reason gets more fps :P (What i can tell from my eye)

PlayStation 4 is better IMO. From what I heard it has better specs than the XBox One and overall PlayStation 4 is just more polished from what I've seen on YouTube. Another thing is the price.<br><br>XBox One also has its camera on all the time watching you and its voice control also does not allow you to swear.<br>Playing FIFA 15 (example) can lead to a foul if you swear a lot during a match and such.<br><br>Some might be personal preference as well but overall PlayStation 4 seems better to me.

Wii u is in a completely different league than ps4 and Xbone because of the completely different games, I don't own a wii u to play cod or assassins creed, that is for my ps4, I own a wii u to play Mario titles and all the other amazing Nintendo only titles.

Since it costs money to go online with playstation 4, I really don't see a difference now. I prefer Xbox though, much comfier controllers and I feel Xbox live has a better feeling and runs more smoothly.
