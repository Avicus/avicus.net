I am looking to start a youtube channel and need your help to suggest recording softwares with low CPU usage and little lag (for windows 7). I usually get around 40 to 50 fps when i play and it lowers when I record which makes it harder to PvP and rush. I need some help on finding recording softwares. Any Suggestions?? :D

OBS is well-known, haven't tried it before though.<br><br>I would recommend Action:&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://mirillis.com/en/products/action.html">https://mirillis.com/en/products/action.html</a>&nbsp;it's free with a watermark, the premium version removes the watermark, but you could probably crack it.

Just a small note.<br><br>I have used Action in the past and ran in quite a few problems with audio-video syncing and it actually recording audio.<br><br>I won't say "don't use it" but just a small note from my experience. Could still work for you though.
