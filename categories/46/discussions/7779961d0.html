What do you gain from a keyboard, mouse or mouse mat that is designed for gaming? Like, are the mice quieter or something? Could someone just explain what you benefit from getting 'gaming editions'.

Gaming mouses generally make it easier to click faster and I have noticed gaming mouses follow the pricey=best system.For example, mouses such as the razer deathadder (£47.00) enables you to click much easier and faster than normal mouses.This can really help in pvp especially when you are going against similar skilled players.<br><br>Although, (in my opinion) Gaming keyboards really don't help much...Its just another way to take loads of money off people.Also, mouse mats don't really benefit you either.It just makes it slightly easier to move which can also be achieved by turning sensitivity up...<br><br>To be honest, if you don't have a decent mouse already, I strongly recommend you get a gaming mouse but no a new keyboard or anything like that. As I know, you are a really good pvper and i'm pretty sure you will improve if you do get one :)<br><br>So yea, this has to be the longest forum post I've ever done #Tookme10mins :)) Hope you read it all :3

Also, judging from your comments, I thought I should elaborate. I currently click at about 8 - 9 CPS without jitter clicking and using the palm grip. I can jitter click (15 CPS) with the claw grip however I feel my current mouse (Logitech M185) is too small and my hand slips off the end of the mouse. When at my best, my aim is really good, I just lack CPS and a bit of movement (forget that though, this is a gaming mice topic ;3). So, I would like a mouse that is good for clicking. Also, is it worth buying a smooth mouse mat?

I think it is worth buying a smooth mouse mat, so your sensitivity is raised just that little bit more for better pvp. I do not recommend a gaming keyboard though, because they are a total rip off. You get a smoother feel to the keys and it looks a lot better than normal keyboards, but I do not care about that in a keyboard. Up to you though. <br><br>I recommend getting the&nbsp;

















E-3lue Cobra EMS109BK mouse. It is super lightweight, very fast for clicking and it is only&nbsp;like $12. Also it is very sexy with it's blue neon lights on the side. I would get that gaming mouse with a&nbsp;

I STRONGLY recommend the Deathadder. Great for CPS and control. You can also set macros for other games and set custom DPI and so on. Deathadder is also good with all grips, claw, palm and finger.

Thanks a lot for you recommendations!<br>I really need a new mouse mat because my current one is soft/ smooth in some parts and rough/ hard in others so it gets really confusing when I PvP because my mouse moves into different areas of the mat. xD

Do not get Razer keyboards without a lot of research. They may be the right board for you, but they are often overpriced, and have bad build quality and software. Also, they use Chinese 'Khail' Switches; knock-offs of real Cherry MX switches. They are not necessarily worse but have not been tested to the extent Cherry switches have. I would recommend a Cooler Master board with real Cherry switches such as the QuickFire Rapid or QuickFire Rapid XT for a full size board. Also, if you want backlighting, look into Corsair products with Cherry MX RGB switches offering per key RGB backlighting - miles better than Chroma. Also, a cheaper board such as the K60 or K65 has backlighting, real cherry switches and better build quality than Razer at a similar price.<br><br>I have a QuickFire Rapid with Cherry MX Blues. Wholeheartedly recommend.

I would also like to say that there are many types of Cherry MX switches. Most common are:<br><u><b>Tactile</b></u><br>Blue:clicky(You can hear the click loud) and a little bump close to the actuation point,bit harder to press down(50cN)<br>Brown: as blue with out the clicky noise(50cN)<br>Clear: the same as brown and a little bit harder to click then black(65cN)<br><b><u>Linear:</u></b><u></u><br>Red: no click, no bump and little easier to press down (45cN)<br>Black: as red but even harder to press down then blue(60cN)<br>Most common under gamers are brown and blue for the good orientation where the actuation point is and red because you don't have to press as hard to press down.

BTW it doesn't look that good at all, but it is actually a great and underrated mouse pad.

The Deathadder has worked great for me for a year.<br><br>I'd recommend getting Cherry MX Reds for gaming.

Cherry MX Reds are marketed as Gamer switches; and for many gamers they work well. I would however warn against getting them on this basis alone. They are light to actuate and some people find them mushy. Try out different switches in a shop or get a <a href="http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/index.php/review/product/list/id/89/category/12/?limit=50" rel="nofollow">switch tester</a> before you buy.

I really don't know why mouse pads are really necessary to buy. I know a lot of them are cheap but I don't see the big deal with them. Anyways I have Razer BlackWidow Ultimate keyboard and I use a Logitech M310 mouse.

I just ordered a steelseries mouse pad and a ReDragon LAVAWOLF ! I recommend them as they are both excellent for the price

But it honestly depends on stuff like how hard you press and stuff man, cos like I prefer the blues and browns compared to the reds; honestly, if you try the reds and you like them, you're good man :D. But for other ppl they should get a feel for which one they like better.&nbsp;<br>Plus if you absolutely want to you can build your own keyboard and customise your keys and stuff; it's kinda tough for an amateur, but otherwise it shouldn't be too bad, just some soldering and stuff.

In my opinion, Razer mice/keyboards are overpriced for what you get, so are most other brands, however they are not as overpriced as Razer. Logitech has really good, reliable and extremely fast mice for good prices. I'd recomment the G402 Hyperion Fury ultra-fast gaming mouse if you cant spend too much money, or if you can stretch your budget a bit, go for the Logitech G502 Proteus Core. Both of them are excellent, quality mice.&nbsp;<br><br>Keyboards don't matter so much, although again, Razer keyboards are extremely overpriced, so go for another brand you can trust.<br><br>And as for a mouse pad, well, as long as you have one good enough to stop your mouse from jumping about on your screen, you should be fine!&nbsp;<br><br>:D
