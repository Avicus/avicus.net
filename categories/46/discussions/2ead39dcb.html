To get a reply, it can take anywhere from 1 week, to 1 month. If you do not get a reply within 1 week, just resend the email. Good luck! :)

It usually takes 1 or 2 days, but recently we have been low on Senior Staff, so it might be a bit longer. Although, we will have more Sr. Staff soon!

I'm going to tell you the truth because Dreams and Spartamex are wrong.<br>This days, Sr mods barely check the e-mail, why?, I don't known..<br>You won't get a response unless they check e-mail again but that will happen in a long time, maybe, even a year.<br>Also, if you contact them on Skype, they won't answer you as they afk all the time, my hopes are on Tel so het his Skype and ask him for an appeal.<br>I'm telling him the truth so please no hate.

No, they are both correct. Typically it would be a matter of days, but we are getting caught up from a recent influx of emails.&nbsp;<br><br>Wait a week, if you don't hear back, try to get in direct contact via Skype or in-game. You can resend the email, but we're probably not going to get to it faster as we are on a first-come-first-serve basis.

Good point, I have no idea... I just want to continue playing on Avicus. I've even been supporting the channel on Youtube, and there's been a misunderstanding about my ban... I just want to be unbanned so I can continue making Youtube videos and playing Walls...

To both of you, wait and we'll send a response via email, assuming the appeal has some validity and content.

Ok, getting back from my 10 month ban I asked a lot of questions,the best way to contact them is in-game. I got my TeamSpeak rank yesterday from DoctaPop and on the support it could of taken like 2 weeks but I got it in a day. 

PS: it also helps making friends with mods..

I'm basing my opinion on other people's thoughts..<br>Everytime they send an e-mail, they complain about the long period of time an appeal takes to be answered and they're not few, they're more than 20 people.<br>Now, I'm not going to go on with the discussion as I don't care about this, I was just stating something real that needs to be solved ASAP.
