Hey everybody,<br>I've had quite a bit of experience with sports and standings and, seeing the NHL Stanley Cup post, I thought, why not bring that to Nebula? It could have a similar concept as the scoring in sports played today. However, it would require some coding and some planning to hold matches. <br><br><b><b>Scoring: </b><br><i></i></b><i></i>Win- 2 points<br>Loss- 0 points<br>Overtime/tie- 1 point<br><br>Basically, depending on the number of teams we have here, we could setup a really neat statistics page. Below are some things that should be included.<br><br><b><b>Team Statistics:<br></b></b>Win/Loss/Tie Ratio ex. (7-3-1)<br>Monuments Destroyed<br>Kills<br>Deaths<br>K/D Ratio<br>Standings compared to other teams.<br><br><b><b>Player Statistics:<br></b></b>Game played<br>*Note that players will not always be able to attend every game.<br><b><b></b></b>Monuments Destroyed<b><b><br></b></b>Kills<br>Deaths<br>K/D Ratio<br>Standings compared to all other players <br>*Note that you could have different standings filters such as, most monuments broken, highest K/D etc..<br><br><b><b>Game Scheduling: <br></b></b>Basically, a set schedule should be set perhaps 1 game every 2 weeks. It would also be essential to have the timezone information of all the teams to be able to coordinate a reasonable time for a match. <b></b>If we could input some sort of html coding which would allow us to state the timezone of each member in a team, matches could be suited to a reasonable time. Perhaps, we could have seasons (each 3 months long). <br><br><b><b>Scorekeeping: <br></b></b>This would be an absolute necessity. There is this program called SportNGIN Live. It allows you to create teams and has a simple way of handling statistics. The whole plugin comes with everything you need such as the game schedule bar, statistics, etc. One of the downsides is that, the program was made for sports, not for video games. Perhaps they have a sports layout that might fit the game of Nebula however. If not, I believe many people here would be willing to contribute their coding skills (i hope). If this program somehow fits the standards of nebula, you would be able to create admin accounts that will allow people to scorekeep the game. Once you finalize the game, all statistics are automatically updated for you. <b></b><b></b>I know this because, I scorekeep some Rec. League hockey games. If you would like an example of a layout, visit this website. <a title="Link: http://www.kihawaii.com/" href="http://www.kihawaii.com/">http://www.kihawaii.com/</a> <br><b></b><b><b>(It's a bit expensive so, custom coding may be the better option)<br><br></b></b>If money is not an issue, feel free to visit <a href="http://www.sportngin.com">http://www.sportngin.com</a><b><b><br><br></b></b>Anyways, this<b><b> </b></b>is just an idea and I believe that if this were to work, this will bring in thousands of players. Competition is<b><b> </b></b>what brings people in. That's why sports are super popular and I believe the same concept could be achieved here. Hopefully this can be achieved and if you are reading this KyloCode, I thank you. <br><br>Any feedback/suggestions are welcome as long as you have reasoning for it. <br>Thanks!<br><br>-PokerFace<br><br>*1 more note. Perhaps, the top teams during the season can gain eligibility into the tournaments. Similar to the concept used in the NHL.

<p>I don't know, I feel like the organisation of the whole thing would be difficult to pull off. It would be really messy having a set date schedule.&nbsp;I don't think the tournament access via team standing positions is great, that should probably be left alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;So overall it would be hard to setup up, but the idea has a lot of potential.</p>

I'll give a slight bump since only 6 people saw this.<br><br>Also, the SportNGIN program is a bit expensive so, custom coding would be the better option.

What makes you think that? This would be easier to pull off than the whole Omega Update.

I'm going to bump this because I do not feel there is enough input on this.&nbsp;<br>Also, I noticed there are restrictions on the amount of teams that can participate in the tournament. This can do that for you.

It would be good to have regular matches that get recorded, but it will be very difficult and would take a long time. The dev team haven't managed to get 2 teams into a scrim server sorted yet. I'll be happy just having friendly matches every now and then. The tourney has taken alot of time and effort, along with fixing bugs and glitches from the omega update.&nbsp;<br><br>I agree that having a scrim league would be really good, but I think there would be a large gap between the good and bad teams, so the lower teams would get a regular thrashing. I thing a higher and lower league would be necessary. Also people should think about diversifying scrims away from DTM.<br><br>&nbsp;I'm not trying to say that your idea is bad and don't do it, I think its a great idea. I'm just trying to give you a fuller picture of what your getting at.
