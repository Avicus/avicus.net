Just dropping this here, what are your opinions about it?<br><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/376870/" title="Link: http://store.steampowered.com/app/376870/">http://store.steampowered.com/app/376870/</a><br>For my thoughts it's that it's probably going to be the worst thing since broccoli.<br>I was thinking about making a series on it and just criticizing everything about it for laughs.

You don't need to bring up 9/11 and a game and compare it to that but this looks okay, I wouldn't play it but im sure it could entertain younger kids going on a hour long car ride.

Hopefully this isn't just a way for mojang/microsoft to pull more money out of us. It looks interesting however I would need to play it or watch gameplay to see whether I would enjoy it.

I think it would be good if they did it about steve and not som random guy. Also the people in the game have super ugly skins.

Actually looks pretty good<br><br><a href="http://youtu.be/3mK-gB4TXhw">http://youtu.be/3mK-gB4TXhw</a><br><br><br>only problem to me&nbsp;is: Who would pay $24 just for a game that is based off another game?

HI BILLY MAYES HERE BRINGING YOU MINECRAP<br>DO YOU LIKE THE LIMITLESS ADVENTURE OF MINECRAFT??!?!?1 WELL TOO BAD BECAUSE WE'VE BROUGHT CRAPPY MC GRAPHICS AND REMOVED ALL THE FEATURES YOU LOVE LIKE: GENERATING MAPS, INVENTORY MANAGEMENT, MULTIPLAYER. BUT DON'T WORRY BECUZ WHAT WE LACK IN THINGS YOU LOVE WE MAKE UP FOR IN THINGS YOU HATE LIKE: BORING ONE DIMENSIONAL CHARACTERS, STRAIGHTFORWARD STORY LINES, KEY CHOICES THAT DON'T ACTUALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE! SO FOR A LIMITED TIME ONLY GET A GAME YOU LOVED STRIPPED DOWN TO IT'S CRAPPIEST ELEMENTS AND PACKAGED UNDER A STORYLINE NOONE GIVES A CRAP ABOUT FOR AROUND THE SAME PRICE AS THE REALLY FUN GAME THIS COPIED. ORDER NAO!!!
