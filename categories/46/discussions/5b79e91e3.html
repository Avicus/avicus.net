Hai.<br><br>When people graduate primary school in my family, my grand parents get them a camera. I dont want a camera, and surprisingly they told me that before I told them =P (I wouldnt tell them, daz r00d)<br><br>So, the other day I told my aunt that Im building a PC, and about my non-mechanical gaming keyboard, and after that I got told that my Razer DeathAdder isnt as good as I though it was. My grand parents told me they spend about 250-270$ for a camera, so I was like "Mechnical keyboard and mouse, easy."<br><br>So, I need suggestions, and for the first time n my life, there isnt a low budget, so I can go as ham as I want.&nbsp;<br><br>Here is the keyboard I was thinking of:&nbsp;<a href="http://gaming.logitech.com/en-ca/product/g710plus-mechanical-gaming-keyboard" title="Link: http://gaming.logitech.com/en-ca/product/g710plus-mechanical-gaming-keyboard">http://gaming.logitech.com/en-ca/product/g710plus-mechanical-gaming-keyboard</a>&nbsp;I really like it, but, dont hate please, I really want something with colored backlighting =P. If anyone can come up with what I suggested only with a colored LED backlight, that would be great. Im looking for:<br><br>-Mechanical keys, has to be silent, my parents hate the noise.<br><br>-Anti-Ghosting<br><br>-At least 5 macro keys<br><br>-Palm rest<br><br>-Tilt legs<br><br>What I would like:&nbsp;<br><br>-<u></u>Colored LED backlight, I would prefer mulitcolor.<br><br>-Media keys<br><br>-Gaming mode key<br><br>-Mute and volume adjust<br><br>Now, for the mouse! I would prefer something simple, but with at least 3 extra buttons, DPI adjust, durable, and it HAS to be small. One of the biggest problems I found with my DeathAdder was how big it was, and my hands are small for my age. Im a claw grip, and I will mostly be using this for FPS games and MC.<br><br>I was thinking this, but I need more feedback:&nbsp;<a href="http://gaming.logitech.com/en-ca/product/g502-proteus-core-tunable-gaming-mouse" title="Link: http://gaming.logitech.com/en-ca/product/g502-proteus-core-tunable-gaming-mouse">http://gaming.logitech.com/en-ca/product/g502-proteus-core-tunable-gaming-mouse</a>&nbsp;I need to know if the scroll weel is string enough, because Im used to the DeathAdder's scroll weel, and I must say it's amazing. I really like to FnS people, you know,MCSG style, and, no hate, I like debuffing people.&nbsp;Im not really good at hotkeying, so I need a good mouse weel. Also, do you think its big or small?

Mouse go for a Kone XTD I think they're smaller, you can check the measurements, and from what I know it's a great mouse.

By "multicolor" you basically mean 16.8 million colors (RGB) lighting.<br><br>Don't expect tilt legs much; they're easy to make yourself and a lot of keyboards don't come with one.<br><br>What Cherry MX switches do you want?<br><br>Without the answer to these questions, as long as you're willing to work with software for a while, the best keyboard that fits your description is the Corsair K95 RGB (with 18 macro keys).<br><br>For mouse, overall, i'd pick the Logitech G502; it's easily the best mouse. Also, like you, before I got my Corsair M65 mouse, I had a claw grip and I have small hands; however, I now use a palm grip on the M65; it's very easy to transition.<br><br>This keyboard+mouse would cost about $230.<br><br>What to avoid:<br><br>Logitech G910: The Romer-G keys feel more like rubber domes.<br><br>Razer Blackwidow Chroma: Razer switches suck. Also, they don't last very long.

Sadly, the Logitech G502 is just as big as the Deathadder, both are meant for palm grips. If you can deal with that, it's a great mouse.<br><img src="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/5IknfkmtdyM/maxresdefault.jpg" title="Image: http://i.ytimg.com/vi/5IknfkmtdyM/maxresdefault.jpg"><br>

If not, I highly recommend the Zowie Gear FK2. Not a lot of people know about this brand but it's one of the best mice out there thanks to its simplicity. It's considered by many to be THE best mouse for claw grip. It has 4 programmable buttons and it's quite small. It also has an outstanding sensor, very accurate and precise. I wish I would've known about it before buying my new mouse.<br><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Zowie-Gear-Ambidextrous-Optical-FK2/dp/B00QIH1GD4/ref=sr_1_2?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1433977829&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=zowie+gear" title="Link: http://www.amazon.com/Zowie-Gear-Ambidextrous-Optical-FK2/dp/B00QIH1GD4/ref=sr_1_2?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1433977829&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=zowie+gear">http://www.amazon.com/Zowie-Gear-Ambidextrous-Optical-FK2/dp/B00QIH1GD4/ref=sr_1_2?s=electronics&amp;ie=...</a><br><br>As far as keyboard goes, I also recommend the Corsair K95, it meets your criteria perfectly and is very reliable. It has Cherry MX Brown switches (most quiet) and you can even make it quieter by installing o-rings.&nbsp;Corsair keyboards are very popular because of their durability and design.<br><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Corsair-Gaming-Mechanical-Keyboard-CH-9000082-NA/dp/B00N4OBCWY/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1433977553&amp;sr=8-5&amp;keywords=mechanical+keyboard+with+macro+keys" title="Link: http://www.amazon.com/Corsair-Gaming-Mechanical-Keyboard-CH-9000082-NA/dp/B00N4OBCWY/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1433977553&amp;sr=8-5&amp;keywords=mechanical+keyboard+with+macro+keys">http://www.amazon.com/Corsair-Gaming-Mechanical-Keyboard-CH-9000082-NA/dp/B00N4OBCWY/ref=sr_1_5?ie=U...</a>

Just curious, what do you need the 5+ macro keys for?<br><br>Edit: Also, another thing;&nbsp;<b><i>MECHANICAL KEYBOARDS ARE NOT FOR SILENT ENVIRONMENTS.</i></b><i></i> Mechanical keyboards are much louder than membrane keyboards, especially for bottoming out on an aluminium keyboard like the Corsair K95 RGB. If noise from keyboards is such a big problem to your parents, either don't buy a mechanical or install o-rings, which reduce bottoming out noise. I've also heard that putting a towel under the keyboard helps too.<br><br>Edit 2: I advise against the Logitech G710+ simply because the keycaps are really bad at lasting; if you buy another set of keycaps this would be avoided.<br><br>Also, last one I can come up with if you sudden don't need the macro keys; <b>the Ducky Shine 4</b>. It's a $150 keyboard made in Taiwan. Ducky is known as a smaller company, but it's known for being a keyboard enthusiast company, and it makes <b>extremely</b> high quality keyboards. For anyone else considering a mechanical and not wanting G keys, this is an amazing keyboard.

I need macros, and I think ill be getting the Corsair K95 RGB and the G502. I just realised my PC is gonna be in a room, upstairs, so no worries for the sound. Still need help tho, if anyone can come up with something better than the K95 RGB, that would be great, since it is a BIT ugly, too big tbh, but Ill get it if there isnt anything else. I need it to be shipped to Canada. Milki, the macros are mainly for hotbar slots in MC and typing keybinds.

The Blackwidow completely fails what Sevo wants here; it's not RGB, and it also has a poor build quality.

Look at the soldering; it's poorly done. Also, the Blackwidow is made of plastic, while Corsair mechanical keyboards are made using aluminium.

Im a good mix of both, so I would like something less loud so it wont kill my ears. So I think either Cherry MX clear or brown will do the trick, I think briwn is good. Also, dont worry, my desk is huge.

Cherry MX Brown sounds best; might want to buy a switch tester to make sure.<br><br>And best of luck with your new keyboard and mouse!
