If there is a way it would be great because i prefer defending but at the end of the match i don't get as many credits as i wish i could. Any suggestions of how it could work?

Umm... Maybe at the start of a game you can pick what position you would be with a tab. And then credits will be given out equally. Just a thought.

Actually it might be simple. Maybe mark a certain region around the monument and if you kill a player in that region, you get a 1.5 credit boost for any kills that you get in that region.

Actually before the omega update defenders didn't got any credits for playing. Only if you break a monument or you kill people you got XP, now you get credits for playing. In my opinion it's not needed if defenders get extra credits since they already get credits for playing.

I agree with this.&nbsp;<br>5 Credits for a kill (Diamond rank)<br>50 for a monument (Diamond rank)<br><br>This pattern is the same for:<br>Gold<br>Emerald<br>user<br>pretty much all donor ranks<br><br>You need 10 kills which I find easily done to get the same amount of credits as breaking a monument.

Yes, it is. It could add up the total number of blocks and kills that you got within a certain radius of your monument. If it is above a specific number you get credits at the end.

Set a region around the area of the map classified as the "defending area".<br><br>If the player stays in that zone for a set amount of time during the game, and kills people etc in that zone, they get credited as defending.&nbsp;<br><br>Would it work? I think so ;)

It would have to be more as we can't have half credits (getting .5 credits). It would have to be the same as kills with non donors getting 1 for everything. Also, the the reinforce would have to be longer in time as it could be op. Maybe every 20 seconds?

I assume that he tries to suggest this idea not because defending is cool and he wants to get credits for it, I can tell from my own experience that people rarely defend rather than rush, which makes the game really boring and quick and non-challenging for offense players. By that, makes the public matches less interesting. I agree with glitchy's idea

It is well implemented on ShotBow's Annihilation. You get x2 cridits for killing people near the nexus(monument)&nbsp;<br>So +1

I like this idea, but also I think if you die in said zone, they guy who killed you should get the multiplier bonus. ANOTHER THOUGH: If you kill a guy with a bow and he was attacking your monument, you wouldn't get the bonus credits. But campers shooting their bow from with in this area would. Also, if its based off or a radius, make it extend vertically forever so any kills from sky raids count and anyone you knock into the void counts.<br><br>+1 But keep in mind what I said about the bows<br>^

Keep it simple and have it give more credits when killing someone without a certain radius. I don't really see anything wrong.

I like what most people are saying, when you kill someone within a radius of the monument, you get extra credits. Even if you use a bow, you're still defending, and even if you're just kill farming, it's still defending, it all helps, and defense is pretty rare. Even when people do defend, most of the time it's 1-3 people, that get over run by 10-15 people from a sky bridge, it's not a challenge.<br><br>+1

I'm also a defender (On Cronus). But when I defend as marcwood said I get like 20 credits. It'd be nice to get credits while defending. But I don't how it would work.&nbsp;<br><br>/summon JaviPeeePeee

Defending is getting more common<br>And it's usually a lot of people defending.

I actually think that this is not a bad idea since I love defending more than rushing. It's possible and not that hard to implement. To prevent players from being afk just add a timer. And to check if player is in range of the monument, just spawn an invisible entity and check if the player is in its range. That's how I'd do...

Afking won't matter if it's the number of kills you get within that radius.

Also the defending time should be counted too. So this is where it's needed to make an Anti-AFK system... At least imo, every player has his own views on this topic...
