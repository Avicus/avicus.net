Information:<br><br>- Possibility of a remastered Version of Call Of Duty 4 (<b>Name: Call of Duty Modern Warfare remastered)<br><br></b>- Possibility of the setting of the game going back to the old times like MW2 and so on. (<b>Name: Call of Duty Infinite Warfare</b>)<b><br></b>

The series has so much more potential than what people give it credit for, and the series itself already had a golden age (for me, at least) playing Call of Duty 2 and Call of Duty 3.<br><br>Also, I don't think Modern Warfare really needs a remaster. It's not worth the development time to add a few more pretty shaders and change some ground textures which 99% of all remasters do.

This.<br><br>Call of Duty is boring now. It's more or less a rehash of the old games.

The futuristic stuff is the reason Call of Duty is sinking and they are realizing that now hopefully it's not a futuristic one.

I got to say that Call Of Duty has had many great games, World at War, Call of Duty 4, Mw2, Blackops 1 and 2, but recently Ghosts, Advanced warfare and even in some opinion Bo3 Suck. I like blackops 3, maybe just because the last two have been shit and I have low expectations from Cod. Any1 else agree?

I love that they are finally remastering it, I haven't bought COD since BO2, so I'm really hyped for this one. No more hackers, one man army, noobtubes, etc etc

I hope it implements mechanics such as reloading in zero gravity.<br><br>That would be funny.<br><br>Button mashing to catch your floating bullets.

No offense, but Call of Duty was ALWAYS the same game every year.<br><br>The only game that introduced new things was CoD AW with the advanced parkour mechanics.<br><br>Given, the campaign is really well done with each game, especially modern warfare series and black ops.<br><br>But the multiplayer? Pfft. Run and shoot. Run and Shoot. Run. Shoot.<br><br>When will we be able to drive vehicles? I want to try out one of those vehicles that CoD has, the M1 Abrams or a T-90MS will do.<br><br>How about a jet like BO2 or Ghosts?
