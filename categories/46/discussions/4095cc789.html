"I don't know if Minecraft 2, if that's the thing that makes the most sense.The community around Minecraft is as strong as any community out there. We need to meet the needs and the desires of what the community has before we get permission to go off and do something else,"<br><span><br>-Phil Spencer,&nbsp;</span>Head of Xbox.

Actually there is already a minecraft 2. It was released as joke around summer last year. It has stained glass, before the version 1.5. It also has a tame pink either. If I find the link to the gamepedia post I'll post it here. And from what I know there will never be  a minecraft 2.0. It would go 1.9.9, 1.9.9.9, and so on, cuz MC 2.0 would be a whole remake of the whole game.

With the updates, I think they could do 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 1.10, 1.11, 1.12 and so on.<br>I don't think they have to stop at 1.9, you can keep going.

According to my very broken knowledge making games and everything, the first number in the version shows a very important update, like a complete revamp of things, or a remake of the coding (like general rendering cough cough I'm looking at you, minecraft) the second number shows additions like new items or features maybe like multiplayer or a singleplayer change, like a new gamemode on minecraft. The third number is like some bug fixes or really small additions like something really small.<br><br>&nbsp;If you didn't already know, the lag in minecraft is caused by TERRIBLE allocation. If allocates 200 mb in a freaking second, blah blah blah <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1272953-optifine-hd-a4-fps-boost-hd-textures-aa-af-and#c43757">here</a>. If Microsoft was to make minecraft 2, if might not be a bad idea to fix up the coding, along with some random features and stuff. If they would finish it by a year, or at least include most of minecraft features I think that it would do them some good.<br><br>Something I don't like that people talk about is minecraft 2 being spherical, too graphical or lots of features. I say no. Lets look at Team Fortress 2. The change from tf classic to tf2 did not change it completely. Lots of stuff were changed/improved, while the game was still the same (kinda). There were classes that varied in weapons and stuff, but Valve improved it by well, &nbsp;y'know, adding maps, changing character designs, adding shops, lots of fancy stuff. They didn't change it completely, they added stuff to it. (A bit basic, but you get my point.)<br><br>Yeah.
