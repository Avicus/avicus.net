Guys last Saturday my parents yelled at me for using cussing words in discord and mc. They took my computer, ipad, headphones, mic, and a keyboard. Mic, keyboard, ipad, and headphones were thrown away on &nbsp;the trash :( Guys is their a way to get my computer back? If I keep using cussing words my parents will take me to jail. I'm really serious.

If you're being serious, then I know how you feel (kinda).<br><br>I think the problem is beyond the cursing. When parents hear their child curse, they don't directly throw their electronics in the trash, they start by getting mad first. What I think happened was that your parents were previously mad at you for some reason, and the cussing was the last straw. Oh and if you want your PC back, don't ask for it. They already threw your other stuff away in the trash, you don't wanna risk losing your PC. Do something great and maybe your parents will reward you with your PC.<br><br>And also, your parents won't take you to jail for cussing...but don't cuss in front of them another time&nbsp;<br><br>If this is a joke thread then the 2 minutes I spent writing this are wasted (like every other minute in my life)

Why not just sell the electronics instead of trashing them? Your parents could've made some money from those "investments"
