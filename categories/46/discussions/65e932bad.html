- Don't Update to 1.9!<br>- Keep the server playable in 1.7 (for 1.7 players) and 1.8 (for 1.8 players)<br>- you could create like a mini-server for anyone who wants to play in 1.9 w/ a different IP<br><br>- ill add on more later when i can think of more

People are just going to have to accept change. Minecraft cant stay the same forever or it will get boring. Avicus will have to update the 1.9 when it comes out or the player count will drop even lower.<br><br>Personally, I like the change and in looking forward to the update. Shield, awesome. Not sure how the duel arms are going to work though, but i like the idea of it. Quivers are cool, but im not sure about the new arrows. If the avicus community hates it that much when it comes out, they can block 1.9 mechanics.

He does decide, but we can't stay on 1.7/1.8 forever. At least, that's my opinion.

I'm sure it's pretty possible that those servers can code fixes to not incorporate 1.9 items, or not even add it in at all.

What stops pavilion from removing them? Why is kylo the "supreme guy"?<br><br>If there was enough community input, I'm positive he'd make a statement. Though more effortful of a task now, he still is capable of responding to feedback if it's brought to his attention. If it's a private, dev-savvy matter, he still would privately reply.

The only thing I see not useful is the complaining about change.

Ok to start with, they haven't fixed the mechanics they ruined in 1.8 which makes it even more worse. Mixing something that's broken with something disgusting isn't ok right? KB is just trash right now and you can clearly see it in CTH for example where you can just hit someone twice and he would literally fly 8 blocks away or, sometimes if you hit someone over 10 times, he would just move 1 block. I don't really know how could they mess it up so much.<br>Hit detection is another problem, sometimes you wouldn't reach the hitbox but still hit the other guy which gives some people an insane advantage over the others. If you don't get what I'm trying to say just imagine someone that can't aim at all but giving insane combos without even looking at the other guy (Noobs &nbsp;being good cause of the broken mechanics again) or imagine the autoclickers as well + the delay here in Avicus is amazing, it doesn't matter if you're lagging or not, your hits still wouldn't register at all sometimes.<br>Block lag, well, I don't need to explain this right? You can ask some rushers and most of them will tell you they're annoyed with it.<br>Duel wielding. This is not an FPS game, you got COD, CS:GO and some other games for that. The main purpose of MC is survival and bulding and I find it useless having more weapons just to kill the few type of mobs we have. The sword and bow were just enough + how would block hit work? I don't like the idea of swaping from one weapon to another, it doesn't match with the game's main aim.<br>Servers and cheaters. Imagine what would happen with the 1v1 servers we have right now. Imagine shields in Kohi or bows with op quivers, it wouldn't fit and I already see people quitting from here. Cheaters would just make more clients and abuse the new weapons and the damage they can do which would break the game even more making it more unfair than it already is.<br><br>I can keep going on but I'm too lazy, sorry for the bad grammar, I'm in a hurry.

1. Yeah, so, do you have any problem with that?<br>2. You might be right, they brought CTW back but the mechanics Avicus has right now are trash as mentioned before.<br>3. Ok?

So people want to keep a combat system where the only skill is the combination of movement + clicking you use...? That's weird. The new update should double the amount of skill in PVP, for which I am glad.

They make perfect sense to anyone willing to understand 'em, I offered plenty of reasons why you guys are overreacting. Simply hitting cube people with sword is getting a bit boring.<br><br>So why not spice things up a bit and add more features? You haven't even tried the new stuff out and you guys are already complaining. <br><br>Atleast wait until the update actually comes out then you may wish to complain about the little itsy bitsy things that seem to anger you guys as if someone stole your money.

The block and hit has always worked, am I right?

It has gone now, and will be banished as Blocking is removed.

Honestly everyone, we should give it a try before complaining. It could turn out to be a great update.

<b>What I've Found While On The Snapshot.</b><br>-Blocking is still a thing.<br>-Block-hitting more closely resembles the 1.7 version as opposed to 1.8<br>-Cannot use bow in off-hand slot.<br>-Ender Pearls are smaller and move faster.<br>-Splash water bottles. They can put out blocks on fire and entities on fire.<br>-We seem to still have 1.8 style knockback, but I'm not sure about hit-detection because I can't find a pvp server on 1.9.<br><i>This is the first snapshot, MANY things will probably change. Certain features are still supposed to be added, while a majority of features now are still not finished. I.E. Dual wielding, dragon respawns, etc.</i>

I think this update &nbsp;will be harder to use because what if someone comes up to you with an iron sword and an enderpearl how do you know which one he will use and whatsoever.
