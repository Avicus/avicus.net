This is my opinions on mojang.<br>I understand that they help run minecraft but....<br>Ever since Dinnerbone took most control minecraft started to go downhill<br>This is what im saying to mojang.<br>Fix minor bugs that are easy to fix, instead of adding useless shit like bats and bunnies.

How about they optimise the game so that I don't run battlefield 3 smoother.

The only good thing that I think that can come from 1.8 is the stuff that adventure map makers or minigame makers can do :/

Don't hate on mojang. People were mad about adding "nothing" to minecraft. Lots of people wanted bunnies, so they added bunnies. Lots of people were really really mad about nothing in oceans, so they added underwater dungeons. People were crying about the sprint button, every game has a sprint button, why not minecraft? Beacons were a nice way of adding permanent like potion effects, and you pretty much had to add colour to them.<br><br>And all terrible changes? What? What about the stacked doors? What about different woods for different wooden blocks? What about the banners, wait maybe not for you but I love them a lot. People were waiting for new types of decoration blocks and wanted more underground features, so Mojang added all those new rocks. You can now customize the world easily, sponges are finally back, villagers can do something now other than give you almost nothing, lapis is finally given a major use (enchanting), and there are much better skins, something that many had waited for(***king yes asymmetrical skins!).<br><br>What would you do if you were mojang? After fixing those mini bugs, what would you do? Add dirt tools? Implicate all of those cool but in another way ridiculous mods into minecraft? &nbsp;Adding a sword that will one hit kill everything? Adding Herobrine? Adding females to minecraft? Making babies when a boy skin and a girl skin sleep in the same bed?&nbsp;<br><br>Mojang had given what hundreds of thousands were waiting for, and now there are more raging back.
