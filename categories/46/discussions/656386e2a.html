So, I heard about this game for the first time today, so thought I might as well make a thread for things related to it. Talk about the Story Mode in whatever way you want!

Sorry for the minor bump but I felt like it was appropriate to give my opinion and allow other opinions from others who may or may not have played it.<br>So I just finished episode 1 (2 and up still aren't out yet) but in my honest opinion it would be worth getting.<br>You may have watched video's of it already but tbh it's much different when playing and when watching. When watching you don't have to be too alert to the actual gameplay and your watching the commentary and a bit of the story. When playing the game there are a bunch of actions that just pop up that you have to do, keeps you sucked into the story/game making you understand the story that much more thus creating suspense that makes the game awesome.<br>Animations are ok, but the voice overs, the plot of the story and the actual gameplay is amazing!<br>I do recommend it :)

So yeah, I just finished playing episode 1... and I agree with Vlad. The story is very interesting and you get so immersed in the world. It has the original Telltale feel, but it adds new game play mechanics that make Minecraft, well, Minecraft. It has its own crafting and combat system and hilarious time-lapses of the characters constructing buildings. The graphics look really nice, if that even matters. The voices are great as always. Like I mentioned before, the story/plot is so unique that it'll have me thinking about it for hours. I have to admit, this is the first Telltale game I've bought/played (I've watched playthoughs of all of the other games) and I was definitely&nbsp;not disappointed. If you still think this game is lame, well, it's your loss. Highly recommend it!

I watches Aureylian's let's play of it episode 1 yesterday.<br>I quite like the story but I won't be picking this one up.<br>The story's good but it's a bit too tailored towards kids.<br>I'll continue to watch let's plays of it though.
