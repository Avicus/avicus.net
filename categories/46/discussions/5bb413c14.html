Hey guys<br><br>I don't know if many of you have played this, but it's an awesome FTB modpack that I've been playing. Basically, you recently crashed on a planet that is literally nothing but dust. You can start getting supplies from the shuttle to build up a new home and life on the planet. It's hardcore mode, but if you choose the "easy" option, you can get a machine that clones you so that when you die, you can respawn. It's pretty interesting. There are quests to complete to help you along the way, and eventually you can build up a system to get everything you need. The planet is hella hot though, so you gotta, like, drink water and stuff. And going inside cools you down..<br><br>So basically... anybody &nbsp;played this? Got any tips? I'm kinda stuck on what to do now. I know there's a city that you can raid, I'll go there eventually.<br>If you haven't played this, I highly suggest it. It's super hard but worth it.
