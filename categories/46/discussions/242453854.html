It is certain that it doesn't give you any advantage in game. It's just an animation mod such LabyMod which is allowed in almost all the servers in Minecraft. To be honest, I don't think it will give you an unfair advantage such as extended reach or improve your hit detection. I wouldn't give an infraction to someone that is using this mod (because I already tested it and it's the same as Minecraft Vanilla).<br><br>The moderating team will discuss about it, and he will get a response in his appeal if is needed.

The mod that banned that guy didn't give us any evidence, so I'm guessing that he wasn't using NoSlowDown
