Mojang is blacklisting servers that don't comply with the EULA.<br><br>Almost 2 years ago, Mojang announced the EULA but since then it has rarely been enforced.<br>So much so that servers didn't think Mojang was enforcing it at all and have since knowingly broken the EULA.<br><br>However, after decoding a "blocked servers" link. It appears that the following servers will be officially blacklisted by Mojang.<br><br>PhanaticMC<br>MineVast<br>PrimeMC<br>GuildCraft<br>ParadiseMC<br>IH-MC<br>DesiredCraft<br>Menoxia<br>The Archon<br>TimelessPVP<br>Datixel<br>Minetime<br>Brawl<br><br><br>Personal standouts for me would be The Archon and Brawl.<br><br>The Archon is a massive factions server run by popular Minecraft YouTuber TheCampingRusher. The server also has a lot of big YouTubers that actively play on it. The YouTube presence on that server is huge, and is the main reason why it has up to 1000 players on daily.<br><br>Brawl is a massive mini game server that has been around for years and is more of a me thing, it's the first minecraft multiplayer server I actively played on. Their unique CTF plug-in was awesome.&nbsp;<br><br><br>The servers mentioned won't be blacklisted until 1.9.3 comes out.&nbsp;<br>When it does, you will no longer be able to log on to these servers. However, if you use 1.9.2 or lower, you should be fine.<br><br>In theory I suppose you could still run these servers at 1.9.2 but eventually that'll negatively affect the server's development (staying at 1.9.2 forever isn't a long term fix)&nbsp;<br>But that's just me making assumptions.<br><br>It'll be interesting to see how these servers react to these developments.<br><br>Imagine if Avicus caved and broke the EULA, it'd be in the same boat.<br><br>Thanks for reading.<br><br><br><b>Edit:&nbsp;</b>So DramaAlert released a video about it.<br><br>One of the GotPVP owners was interviewed and explains why their server won't&nbsp;comply with the EULA. <br>He goes ahead to say how his server will die if the comply and urges his player base to stay on 1.9.2 <br>He also wants to contact someone from Microsoft because,<br>"Mojang don't really know what they're doing"<br><br>Video:&nbsp;<a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HhsQ49uBeng">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HhsQ49uBeng</a><br><br><br>Sources:<br><br><a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/KEEMSTAR/status/726289940942884865/photo/1">https://mobile.twitter.com/KEEMSTAR/status/726289940942884865/photo/1</a><br><br><a href="https://mojang.com/2014/06/lets-talk-server-monetisation/">https://mojang.com/2014/06/lets-talk-server-monetisation/</a>.&nbsp;<br><br><a href="https://oc.tc/forums/topics/5724a76367d5226d0b000007">https://oc.tc/forums/topics/5724a76367d5226d0b000007</a>

Looks like it. When 1.9.3 comes out you will no longer be able to connect to these servers. <br>But I did read that you would still be able to connect using 1.9.2 and older. <br>But that'll eventually hamper development progress.

Keys aren't currency.&nbsp;<br>For Avicus, credits would be classified as the in game currency.<br><br>So if you could pay money for x amount of credits, then we'd be in breach of the EULA.<br><br>Keys are just a shop item. Like a donator rank.

lol plz tell me you're joking, all of the donator kits are soooooo op, you can't open half the stuff if you're not donator, you pretty much can't compete with donators most of their PvP based gamemodes
