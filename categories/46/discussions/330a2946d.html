How much money would I have to pay to get a PC that would get me around 80+ FPS?<br>EDIT: I'm really sorry for not explaining this, just to make sure, when I say I want around 80 FPS, I mean 80 FPS on a 40 player Nebula rather than just on a 1v1. Sorry for not explaining this. ;3

@S3M3L I'm just inquiring at the minute. ;P<br>@Sulorak Just Optifine and completely low settings apart from Potion particles: On, Particles: All and Items Animated: On. Oh, and only minecraft running. My laptop is really bad so I rarely play and I play on the least settings, most tweaks and get around 30 FPS Dx But I still like my particles on because it only makes a 5 FPS difference. Specific enough? x)<br>@Samir I'm just inquiring but 12,000 will definitely not be in my budget ;) But thanks ^-^

Depending on the size and the resolution of the monitor you will get more or less FPS. This is because the the Graphic Card needs to work more to have every section of the screen working fine at the same time.

Mine gives out 60-120 fps depending on my settings, and it can prob go further. It cost like 400 dollars. Depending on your internet and where you buy it... 80 fps costs 400-600$.

As QFrog said I recommend building a pc. It will save you lots of money and it will be effective. My cousin built a computer in 2007 and he still manages to get 60fps off that computer because he keeps his parts updated.

If you have a 720p monitor, which is common for many laptops and cheaper monitors, you could get a good 100+ fps for about $600-700. &nbsp;If you use 1080p monitors, which are higher quality, then you will need something along the lines of $800+.<br><br>If you don't know your resolution, tell me the name of the monitor, and I can find out for you.

I have a HP Laptop. Not the best but if there are not much data on it. It can go up to 120-180 FPS with little bit of files and data. But it is pretty expensive doe. My laptop is 800$. I might recommend you to save your money on something else cheaper.

Yeah, those people are just people who play on consoles who are known as "Console Peasants". Their consoles can't get past 30 FPS, so they say you can't see beyond 30 FPS, either, to make up for their poor performance. The human ye can see up to 120 FPS, although there isn't that big of a difference between that and 80 FPS.&nbsp;<br>Anyways, I bought a <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16883258020">pre-build computer</a> that can max out settings and still get a good 150 FPS. It's only 650$, too; it's the best you can get for the price.

Sorry for the late reply, I haven't had internet these past few days ._.<br>Anyways, I have a Samsung 300E5A. With Razer, Optifine and a few RAM tweaks, I get about 50 FPS in a 1v1 ._. So in Avicus I get about 15 - 20.

No need to buy a new computer, that's quite expensive.<br><br>Go to BestBuy and ask for a graphics card that can run Minecraft. They'll take you right to it, and show you that some are around 250$ (USD) Or some could be around 40$ (USD) I reccommend getting the 40$ one to start.<br><br>Afterwards ask where they have their RAM. You can purchase RAM on average of 40 dollars as well, which should increase your FPS significantly if you buy both the graphics card and the RAM along with it, for one of the cheapest prices out there.<br><br>Hope this helped.

Ooh, you don't need a monitor if you have a spare TV lying around. I just got a 10$ HDMI cable and plugged my PC into the TV. You might have to adjust your native resolution first (it's really easy), but it works fine with no problems :D

Realmente lo que importa para que valla bien minecraft es :<br>1.- La RAM<br>2.- Tarjeta gráfica<br>3.- Y GM en tu disco duro<br><br>Y ya no hay más historias, ademas que si solo tienes 60 FPS esta bien, y el PING que tengas también es importante, cuanto menos PING tengas mejor iras en los juegos.

You can't determine FPS through specs, however you can always search the model type and see a video of how smoothly it runs and they should show you on what settings they are running on and what FPS they usually get!
