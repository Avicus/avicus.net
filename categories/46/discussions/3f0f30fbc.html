<h1><br></h1><h1><b>The Code</b></h1>So Mojag's source code implies that the last player to hit another player the killer where &nbsp;health bar = 0 in result to get the notification of the kill and that +1 or +2 xp. The code does not count how much damage player 1 has done to Player 2. This means that at the current stage of Minecraft, there is no chance of getting Kill Assists with out the use of a mod (modification).<br><br><h2>Why not use a mod then?</h2>Well my dear Player, by using a mod we would be affecting what the original Minecraft game play. But this dose not affect the game pvp.&nbsp;<br>This means that by using a mod we would maintain the same standard of pvp experience without interference of a modification that could have created an advantage over another player. &nbsp;<br><br><h2>The mod it self.</h2>The mod it self would have an effect on the source code but it would intensifier with other aspects of the code. E.g.: a mod called mo-creatures (old mod that adds more animals into the game) the code in that mod changed nearly every aspect of the mob side of Minecraft.<br>The kill assist mode would have to count how much damaged was made by a player and the changes to the other players health.<br><br>This would put more pressure on to the server as the mod would have to be in server files constantly putting calculating players, health, weapons, armor, food bar and regeneration.&nbsp;<br><br><h2>Opinions.</h2>As I have a good knowledge in java coding, would this sort of mod interest anyone to be implemented; I'd create it myself if the community would use it.&nbsp;<br>If not then that's fine lets move on to another idea.&nbsp;<br><br>If you have any question feel free to ask.

As you said it doesn't affect gameplay so don't say that I get a PVP advantage with just telling me what my armor is at.

I'm sorry what do you mean? Are you saying you use a mod that shows you states of your armor? Because as you said no that mod doesn't help you in PVP. So I don't understand where your going with this.

That introducing kill assist won't affect the game play as some people tried to reinforce that.

Think about how many players hit one person before they are killed. If this number were to be counted, then it would put some heavy load on the database.<br><br><b><i>EDIT: Thought it was an idea for Avicus. My bad.</i></b>

Yeah thats what i mean, it would of been a great addition if the mod wouldn't put some much pressure on the processing.

You mean a plugin? &nbsp;If you want it to be on Avicus, it won't be a mod, it will be coded as a plugin.

Too much memory? It would take up mostly the processing power meaning server lag could accrue, this wouldn't be a small addition but a big change for how the server would process different parts of the files.

make it a bit like combat logging<br>30 seconds after player 1 has hit player 2, if player 2 hasn't died, it resolves.<br>say P1 hits P2, then 6 seconds later, P3 kills P2. Depending on the # of hits P1 scored, xp would be distributed accordingly<br><br>However...<br>That means processing power.&nbsp;<b>if it counted all hits</b><br>LOTS<br><br><b>EDIT:</b>
