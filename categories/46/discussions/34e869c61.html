Well obviously avicus is closing and i wanna make a post rather than just comment on the thread. For people who don't know i use <img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/afd1641730d047f792f6ad68f1ce43f2?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/OCDs.html" style="color: #5D5D5D">OCDs</a> as my main account but i decided to come on this account as i believe i'm more known on this one.&nbsp;<br><br>Although i critisize this server a lot and i have to admit i have had problems with how things are done i can't stop the fact that I have been on Avicus for a very long time so to see it close is sad, i just wanted to say goodbye and that i love you all! I'm not going to write a whole list of people to thank but you know who you are. I don't really know what to write xd However i will miss everyone here and if we are close i will probably stay in touch and if we have ever fallen out or aren't such good friends on here i do apologise as i will miss the server as a whole.<br><br>Yeah, well it was great while it lasted guys &lt;333
