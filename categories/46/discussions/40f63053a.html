<span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">Hey All,<br>I recently have found out that my $2,000 computer has finally broke down on me, and It costs way too much money in repairs. Because of this I am planning on making a much cheaper computer ($200-$300) with ideally a good graphics card. And because I am not very up to date on the new and cheap graphics cards, I need some ideas from you computer wizards out there.&nbsp;<br>Thanks &lt;3</span>

You might as well just identify your PC's problem, and buy the part you need. If you can't, an amazing low end card is the GeForce GTX 750 Ti. I have it, and it runs MC at about 500 FPS with OptiFine with an i5 4460.

Can vouch for the 750 ti, very good price/performance/watt card. Shame it costs $180 in Australia. The 260x (which is $110 here) is also a good option but only get it if you can't afford the 750ti or if it is considerably cheaper.&nbsp;<br>Once you go lower than that you start losing performance/dollar and you would be better off just going with the A10 7870k or 7850k which is both a CPU and a GPU.

I got the GTX 750 (Not Ti) and I run MC with 600 fps with optifine, with a pretty bad CPU. I had the GT 630 before and it's horrible, so I wouldn't recommend that xd<br>I'd recommend the GTX 750 Ti or not, not that much of a difference.

Remember, you use a default edit. I use a 512x pack xD.

I can use 512x packs and run them smoothly on around 350 fps. I use default edits to record videos so they will be less laggy.

So the 750 Ti gives you 150 FPS more than the 750. 350 FPS is still pretty damn good xP.

Please give me your part list, budget, where you live and what you are mainly going to do on this PC. If it is mainly gaming, what games?<br><br>It's not like I don't think you are good at this stuff, in fact, I have no idea how good you are. I just want to see how much I can get out of your budget.
