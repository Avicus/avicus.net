</h1>
This is a mini event that I'm hoping to turn into an official event. But for now, here it is.<br><br>I know many people in our community plays PlayPokemonShowdown, which is basically an online version of battling people in the Pokemon games. After having a few battles with the other staff members, I decided to host a mini tournament.<br><br><b>How the Tournament Will Work:<br></b>After getting a minimal amount of applicants, I will split them into 1v1's. During the first 5-6 days of the tournament, each player must find time to battle their opponent once. The winner of the battle must then report their battle to me through Skype&nbsp;<b>WITH A REPLAY LINK.&nbsp;</b>Without a replay link, the battle will be deemed useless and you must conduct another one.<br><br><b>Website:&nbsp;<br></b>play.pokemonshowdown.com<br><br><b>ORAS OU TeamBuilder/Reference:<br></b><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.smogon.com/forums/forums/oras-ou-teams.261/">http://www.smogon.com/forums/forums/oras-ou-teams.261/</a><br><br><b>Details:&nbsp;<br></b><b></b><i>Format:&nbsp;</i><b>OU (ORAS)*<br></b><i>Maximum Amount of Different Teams:&nbsp;</i><b>3<br></b><i><br></i><b>Requirements:<br></b>3 teams following the OU rules. To read the OU rules, please refer to this link. All credit goes to the creators of the original rules.<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.smogon.com/dex/xy/tags/ou">http://www.smogon.com/dex/xy/tags/ou</a><br>If caught violating these rules during the match, you will be&nbsp;<b>KICKED AND DISQUALIFIED&nbsp;</b>from the tournament automatically. No exceptions.<br><br><b>Time of Starting:&nbsp;</b><b><br></b>6:30&nbsp;<b>EST, Sunday,&nbsp;February 8.<br></b>3:30&nbsp;<b>PST, Sunday, February 8.<br><br>Time of Ending:<br></b>6:30&nbsp;<b>EST, Sunday, February 15.<br></b>3:30&nbsp;<b>PST, Sunday, February 15.<br></b><b><br>ALL APPLICANTS OR THOSE WHO WISH TO APPLY MUST STATE SO BELOW WITH THIS FORMAT:<br>IGN:&nbsp;<br>Play.Pokemonshowdown IGN:<br>Skype:<br><br>You will be added to a Skype chat soon.<br></b><br>*The match will be done through Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire rules. This means that new items from these games will be used during the match.<br><br><b>FAQ:<br><br></b><b>What is PlayPokemonShowdown?<br></b>PlayPokemonShowdown is an online battle simulator for the widely popular games Pokemon. This tournament will use Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire rules, which is a Pokemon game that was released last November.<br><br><b>I am not very good at Pokemon, what can I do?<br></b>Start studying on all the tournament rules. If you don't know how to play, you may potentially get kicked from the tournament for violating a rule that you do not know about. Though players can enter if they wish, it's not recommended that you join if you don't have basic knowledge about Pokemon battles (Mega Evolution, Natures, OU rules, etc).<br><br><b>What is Mega Evolution?<br></b>It's a new feature that was introduced very recently in battling. Most, if not all, players use Mega Evolution sometime during their battle. If you want to exceed, it's recommended you have a team with one Mega Evolvable Pokemon. Keep in mind you can only mega evolve one pokemon per match.<br><br><b>Is there a prize?<br></b>The only prize is bragging rights. If this turns into an official event, I will coordinate with Jake to create a prize. Sorry :)<br><br><b>Reminder:&nbsp;</b>You CANNOT switch teams during battle. You will get kicked and eliminated from the tournament right away.<br><br><b>APPLICANTS(To be Updated):<br></b>Sethskye<br>Tempus<br>RileGuy<b><br></b><br><b>LEADERBOARD(To be Updated):<br></b><br>Good luck.

Sorry, not joining :c<br>However, I'm quite inspired by this; maybe run a tournament for osu! :3<br>One concern of me for doing tournaments is the number of people who will show up; Avicus's community is quite small and it would be difficult to organize a tournament in anything but Avicus.
