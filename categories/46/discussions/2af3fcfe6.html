Hey guys it's penguin102002 here today I wanted to discus the player clockracer&nbsp; I know you think he is a average player on minecraft but today at school he almost fainted and scared me so bad. I know its none of your business but he totally changed my life and changed my heart. when he almost fainted I know you might think i'm a wimp but I was scared for him and cried I think of him as a parent someone you can always give your love to. (not gay) &nbsp;someone you can think o "hey this guy is a intelligent cool kind person who studies a lot and actually cares about of his life. I know you do too but he really really&nbsp;(you can say that word for 5 hours) cares about anyone. the slight touch he makes on you he says. "sorry" and you know what! He friken chicken bought me gold rank TELLL ME WHAT KIND OF FRIEEND DOES THAT! sorry caps but this is my appreciation to clockracer. He is a very different in a good way person. He will one day become a man and maybe saves someone's life maybe&nbsp; like if he gives them money or he helps them from a criminal or whatever. He is very special and will always be I would certainly risk my life for him and hopefully you would too. I even wish I could be that type of smart person who enjoys life like he does and never gets upset for stupid reasons. Please don't report me for caps but I really really (like I said 5 hours later) appreciate this kind of friend and if you don't like me&nbsp;him get a life!&nbsp;Sorry didn't mean that. This is a friend who actually appreciates who I am and doesn't beat me up like other people make fun of me or do that bullying stuff. He will some day be rewarded&nbsp;with something special.&nbsp;Ps: on&nbsp;Monday ill repay him but I don't have that much money so ill give him like $7 sorry I don't have all the money clockracer. :( but have a good&nbsp;day and feel better buddy! :) join&nbsp;the penguin army everyone!&nbsp;&nbsp;(")&gt;

Get a room already.... :P<br>But seriously wow you two are great friends, i think if i was fainting my friends would start laughing and i would never hear the end of it. However they are still my friends, i think that everyone has a different friend taste and good for you that your friend is one who always sticks by you.&nbsp;<br><br>Also i don't know if the title is meant to say my goof friend or my good friend, just pointing that out.
