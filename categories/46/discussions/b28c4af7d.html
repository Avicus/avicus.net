<img alt="Cubition" src="http://i.imgur.com/5OvE2Ce.png" title="Image: http://i.imgur.com/5OvE2Ce.png"><br>I thought I might as well post here, and as well share something that myself, and a few others have been working on over time.<br><br>In short, this is pretty much a sandbox game that has been in development since earlier this year, and though inspired my Minecraft. The game is completely open-source and is available to those whom are developers willing to contribute to such project as it's driven by the community ;).&nbsp;I'll do my best to keep this short and simple whilst including a couple screenshots from a couple months ago, as well as links to the source, and our forums.<br><br><h1><b>About</b></h1>Initially I drew the motivation as per this project's creation, where I had asked a friend of mine whom is a decent developer if he wanted to make a game that actually works, in which he had agreed on, and thus created the foundation of this project. At the time, I didn't not have much time on my hands to contribute nearly as much as @beeselmane had, so I decided to cover the expenses of the project (setting up a forums...etc.). I purchased a license for Xenforo, and was soon approached by the company, Shockbyte, in which had offered to host our forums, and I was delighted by the offer. This was continuing to increase the potential of Cubition.<br><br><h1>Screenshots</h1>Please do note that these are from Sept. and a lot has been going on since, so these may not be updated, however more will come upon quite soon ;).<br><br><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/5omQhZn.jpg" title="Image: http://i.imgur.com/5omQhZn.jpg"><br><br><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/kpR7afr.jpg"><br><br><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/e6S4MDL.jpg"><br><br><h1>Links</h1><b>Source Code:&nbsp;</b><a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/Cubition-Project/">https://github.com/Cubition-Project/</a><br><b>Forums:&nbsp;</b><a rel="nofollow" href="http://cubition.net">http://cubition.net</a><br><b>Downloads:</b>&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://jenkins.jselby.net/Cubition">http://jenkins.jselby.net/Cubition</a><br><br>*I'd recommend you do not download these builds as they are in development stage. The only thing that'll be showing up atm is the launcher. A playable build will be coming along the way!<br><br>**Our download server seems to have gotten hit offline. If we are not able to resolve the issue within a week, we may have to merge into a way for temporary downloading capability until the issue is fully resolved. I'll edit this as soon it does ;)<br><br>I cannot state a clear ETA, however we'll work hard to get a playable &amp; stable build to come around soon (hopefully by the end of this month :D)<br><br>And finally I'd also like to add that without the motivation, it can sometimes be boring to be sitting for hours developing a game. Every little contribution that you make, makes it a lot easier on us. (E.g. The more members we get on our forums, the more enthusiastic we are about this game). It's a natural thing. ;p

Upon the release prior to Cubition, we'll also be revealing an FPS with our own little twist to it! This project is managed by the same team, and its first glimpse will be uncovered on Christmas day (or on New Year's Day)! I can't guarantee a release of this game quite yet, but I can assure you that I'll be working on this quite frequently.<br><br>I prefer screenshots over a video presentation, however since this is an FPS, and most people prefer seeing a quick game-play of it, I'll go ahead and make it a game-video demonstrating the different features in it. <br><br>Below is a QA answering questions that you may be curious about.<br><br><b>What language is this game written in?</b><br>This game is written in C++ using Ogre3D as the game engine, this is to help boost the performance levels (aside that I understand the physics behind C++ a lot better than I do with Java :P)<br><br><b>When will it be released?<br></b>I don't have a scheduled release date, sorry. But as of current plans, I do have intentions of releasing it somewhere between January and February. Note that I started developing this on my own over the summer, so it's come a long way already.<br><br><b>Would there be anything I need additionally to run the game?<br></b>It'll run fine on the default software most computers come with.<br><br><b>Will multiplayer be added?<br></b><b></b>Eventually, yes. It'll allow you to host your own servers and things like that (don't expect that right now ;).)<br><br><b>Will it be open-sourced?<br></b><b></b>I don't plan on open-sourcing it atm, for now its closed, until I do a code-cleanup and enhance it a bit.<br><br>If you're wondering what has been going on with Cubition, feel free to view my last announcement on our forums.

An idea cannot be copyrighted. Cubition was an idea (and still is), being developed as its inspiration came from Minecraft. If we were to take the code in Minecraft, copy/paste it into our game, then we can be legally accounted, but this isn't the case since we're building this project from ground up.<br><br>Thanks for bringing that up though :)

Let's clear some things up, as this thread has been quite for nearly a month.<br><br>I'll be honest right now, I was on edge of deciding whether or not to shut this project down for good. There were cues everywhere that it was dying anyways.<br><br>To confirm and finalize my decision on shutting this project down, I contacted the most current developers, and the developers whom resigned a while ago. Discussion had led us to decide NOT to close down the project but redo everything and start from ground up, this time with a&nbsp;<i>real</i> plan. The lack of organization had led to the downfall of Cubition, and with hopes that we don't make the same mistakes...again.<br><br>Knowing that we are going through a full re-code, don't expect a release anytime soon ;).<br><br>If you are looking into following up on this project with broad detail, feel free to visit our forums (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://cubition.net">http://cubition.net</a>). We're renovating the entire project, not just development-wise, but forum management as well.<br><br><i>Note to staff: If you feel that the links I've provided is a form of advertisement, remove them if you wish. <br><br><b>Edit:&nbsp;</b>If you have questions in relation to this project, feel free to ask!<br><br><br>.<br><br><br></i>

Depends on how you'd like to help out. (Forum management is undertaken quite well by current staff) This is an open sourced project, after all, you are more than welcome to make contributions to it. We won't begin to code probably until the next few weeks. We need to properly plan things out.

Yes, definitely we're going to be distributing minecraft with shaders pre-installed, cause we have nothing better to do :D.<br><br>Please read my two most recent posts above, it (should) explain everything. But I didn't answer your second question: It's never going to follow minecraft's path. That would just be a nightmare.

<span>About 2 weeks ago, I announced that this project would be going under reconstruction. Since then a lot has been going around through development. In the period of those 2 weeks, we spent over 5 days straight planning this damn thing out. We're working on multiple things at once, that way we can get this game out faster, and more efficiently.&nbsp;The old project literally had gotten updated once every 2-3 weeks, which soon went down to once a month, then nothing.&nbsp;<br><br>Anyhow, this is how the launcher itself appears as of now:<br><br></span><span><img alt="" src="http://i.gyazo.com/329d7cc46b4ee1c67b8e5408485e0734.png"><br><br>Note: The background image will be changed once we get the terrain and all setup ;)</span>

Just wanting to give an update/announcement, hopefully a small one.<br><br>Recently we've been working on the Authentication Server/System. Within the next week or so, you will be able to begin choosing your usernames. The AuthServer is done, however we're going a "work-around" to give things a good first impression.<br><br>Also, as a heads up, I will no longer be as active as I was on these forums, I'll come to check things out every month or so, yet I'll only post occasionally. You know where to find me if you'd like to speak to me ;).

Just wanting to give another quick update, relatively important to those wanting progress.<br><br><div class="" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><div class="row forum-post" style="margin-left: -20px;  padding-bottom: 5px;"><div class="span9" style=" min-height: 1px; margin-left: 20px; width: 700px;"><div class="converted post-content"><p style="margin: 0px 0px 15px;">We are now allowing user-name registration. For the Alpha Test, there will only be 100 slots, but that may change depending on the amount of traffic it gets.</p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 15px;">In order to register an account, you must also have a forum account. The email that you register with for your forum account is the one that&nbsp;<strong>you must register</strong>&nbsp;with when registering for an Alpha account. This allows us to filter out those who create multiple accounts :(. The only way that this could be bypassed is if you create multiple forum accounts, each having a different email, if that's ever going to be the case, you will be banned from the forum and from the Alpha test.</p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 15px;">The account page overall is about 80% done, and most of its features work perfectly fine.</p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 15px;">tl;dr</p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 15px;"><strong>Registering</strong></p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 15px;">1) Visit&nbsp;<a href="http://cubition.net/" style="color: rgb(0, 136, 204); text-decoration: none;">http://cubition.net</a></p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 15px;">2) Create an account.</p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 15px;">3) Confirm your email</p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 15px;">4) Login to your forum account.</p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 15px;">5) Hit the&nbsp;<strong>Account</strong>&nbsp;tab on the navbar.</p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 15px;"><em>You should be directed to&nbsp;<a href="http://auth.cubition.net/" style="color: rgb(0, 136, 204); text-decoration: none;">http://auth.cubition.net</a></em></p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 15px;">6) Hit the&nbsp;<strong>Register</strong>&nbsp;button at the top right</p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 15px;">7) Fill out this form:</p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 15px;"><img src="http://i.gyazo.com/f64a5d52dac82017f8678b375df2a213.png" alt="Registration Page" style="height: auto; max-width: 100%;  border: 0px;" title="Image: http://i.gyazo.com/f64a5d52dac82017f8678b375df2a213.png"></p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 15px;">8) Hit register</p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 15px;">9) You should be logged in, if not hit the&nbsp;<strong>Login</strong>&nbsp;button and login manually using your credentials.</p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 15px;">Thanks, and enjoy your name ;)!</p><div><br></div></div></div></div></div>
