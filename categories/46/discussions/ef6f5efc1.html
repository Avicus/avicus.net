Hello, 1.9s first snapshot just came out, what's ur opinion about it?<br><br>Myself I think it's actually pretty cool, it will bring something very special to pot pvp ;)<br><br>If you don't know how to enable snapshots, this is how you do it:<br>Go to "Edit profile"<br>Press Enable experimental development versions<br>Go to "Use version" and pick snapshot 15w31a<br><br>I'd recommend you checking out the end.

After playing with it for a bit, it's not that bad...The poison arrows look really cool and useful. I am excited to see what else they add.&nbsp;<br><br>Also, the left hand thing is pretty cool, but putting blocks in there is kinda dumb because you can't really block spam with a sword or bow in your hand.

I tried it and I found it weird. I am a little disappointed with some arrows that were put in the game but it will be interesting with how they can be implanted to the game. Pvp feels much smoother which I love and after seeing it a bit I actually hope block hitting gets removed. It would make much more sense &nbsp;with the shields which will be way less ping based for players

I dunno.. im worried that this update is.going to turn mc pvp Into call of duty complicated pvp which I just think doesn't suit minecraft. I'm also worried that good server with simple mitigates like amicus will turn into a server with lots of plugins.s and to many games like mineplex and hypixel say if u agree with me :/

I am going to disagree with you and say it has changed a lot more for a pvp experience and it will continue to change. That being said, change is not always bad

In a future snapshot, I'd like to see a way to use the item in your off-hand instead of the item in your main hand.&nbsp;<br><i>Shifting would allow you to place a block that's in your off-hand, while a sword is still in your main hand.</i>

That's a good idea, but I feel it would have to be where you press a different key instead of shift because that would get annoying.
