PvP is 100% about aim. Aim is the most important thing by far. To get more kb just spam w, try strafing or blockhit.

Best to start off with basics, no need to rush into advanced stuff right away. You need to get these things down first before you can start getting much better, and thanks

I'm really just learning stuff myself honestly. I get like 5-6cps on average, and my aim is horrible. Decent with a bow sometimes at least! xD I like trying to learn new stuff though, saw people doing that fast bridge and gosh it took me like a whole day of practicing to just get good enough to be functional! xD<br><br>A lot of it is practice, and to get a feel for things. Some basic tips:<br><br>If you're low ground, you take advantage of it. The reason there's an advantage is because your vision comes from the top of your character, so your reach extends from there (not from the middle xD). You basically want to keep as much out of their reach as possible.<br><br>If you're high ground, keep them back. Drop an arrow to knock them back before closing in so you can get the first hit and prevent them from getting you in a combo where you can't reach them. Try blockhitting, you want to knock them back down. Fall damage hurts!<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;If you're on a small bridge, you want to get the first hit, and combo them off the side. Same thing here, you can use a quick arrow to knock them back before you close in for an advantage. Try to blockhit, keep yourself from being knocked off the side to your best ability, and try to hit the corner of them instead of just head on after you get in, so you don't just knock them backwards on the bridge.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Getting behind your enemy helps a lot. Can't hit you if they aren't looking at you! I like to circle around them, I used to always be holding w sprinting at the enemy, but I find just holding the w or a key to circle can throw them off pretty well (But only after you're there, don't just sidestep to the enemy from 10 blocks away xD). This is fun with speed xD<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;If you catch somebody who isn't paying attention, if there's a ledge knock them off as quick as possible! And if there isn't you want to get up close and jump start jumping and hitting them as you fall to get as many crits in as possible, and drop them before they notice you.<br><br>&nbsp;Don't stay still when you shoot. (If they're looking at you) Even if you're on a little bridge, move around it as much as you can. Jump, walk forwards, backwards, turn around suddenly. Make it a pain to shoot you!&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Those are tactics I can think of off the top of my head, to get better at the sword and bow it's just practice practice.

Honestly, I can help you PvP. Yes, I'm not the best but I'm pretty damn good. You need to learn how to ninja bridge too, that's important. I can help you with all this, I am pretty damn good at the game and get a heap of kill streaks because of kb enhancing techniques alone. You also need to learn every map BY HEART. This is very, VERY important. Know there's a ledge when running away from a player? Turn around and knock them off the edge! Know where the monument is and how the area is built? Take advantage of that!&nbsp;<br><br>I know now your going to defend though so I can't really help you with that, as I'm bad af at defense, but learning how to PvP is vital.<br><br>EDIT: Wow such modest totally not cocky af<br><br><br><br><br><br>am as sorry as I am savage

Well, as smitdalt told me:<br>DO NOT move around while firing a rifle, the accuracy becomes crap.<br>If you want to strafe, I suggest getting an SMG or a pistol such as the MP7 or The Revolver.<br>If you just want to block hit, take out your StaTrak(tm) Knife and block hit.<br>If you want to use hacks, (WHs) are the best :)<br>Hope this helped!

If you have good enough aim to follow a minecraft player's movement all you need is cps and ms.<br>Blockhitting, w tapping, tactics only go so far if you don't have cps.<br><br>Test hitting someone with 5 cps and then with 10 and then with 15.<br>KB is effected massively.<br><br>Sevo no offense but you have 1120 elo on kohi and 1400 global on BL.

If I'm 100% honest, I'm mostly looking for ways to refine my PVP technique. I'm good (I'm not being arrogant, I think I'm good but not on the level of some of the best people on this server - most likely not even close) but I have a habit of making stupid mistakes in the middle of a fight, like moving in the direction that I know will get me killed. I'm also learning how to combat different techniques, which I'm always grateful for help in.

tbh a good way to become better is to play against people who are way better than you. When I was really bad I fought against fluenza a ton and now I can beat him like 60% of the time on au kohi (tbh I think we are about the same) <br><br>&nbsp;@Sevo when u say straightline you make it sound bad lol fight any good player, you 100% can't strafe them. I think I'm a pretty good player. (I had 1550 global elo on kohi with &nbsp;300ms and like 30w-6l ranked and 380+unranked wins to around 42 losses) and I fight a lot of good players with insanely good ping (50ms tops) &nbsp;but if I fight someone like gold I'll get destroyed because he gets good cps has good aim against good players and straightlines like a god (wtaps amazingly) &nbsp;but the problem is even tho gold is way better than me, he won't be able to strafe me because I still have good cps and aim. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;TL:DR/didn't understand ; basically good players cannot strafe other good players. Do you see Stimpay strafing people like drummerreviews? no because it's impossible, so I don't know why you out "straightlines" &nbsp;in that context like it's a bad thing. oh and imo you're good at Nebula but not good at things like kohi. (typed with phone = might have mistakes ggautocorrect gF)

When I was really bad I fought against fluenza a ton and now I can beat him like 60% of the time on au kohi (tbh I think we are about the same) <br><br>&nbsp;@Sevo when u say straightline you make it sound bad lol fight any good player, you 100% can't strafe them. I think I'm a pretty good player. (I had 1550 global elo on kohi with &nbsp;300ms and like 30w-6l ranked and 380+unranked wins to around 42 losses) and I fight a lot of good players with insanely good ping (50ms tops) &nbsp;but if I fight someone like gold I'll get destroyed because he gets good cps has good aim against good players and straightlines like a god (wtaps amazingly) &nbsp;but the problem is even tho gold is way better than me, he won't be able to strafe me because I still have good cps and aim. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;TL:DR/didn't understand ; basically good players cannot strafe other good players. Do you see Stimpay strafing people like drummerreviews? no because it's impossible, so I don't know why you out "straightlines" &nbsp;in that context like it's a bad thing. oh and imo you're good at Nebula but not good at things like kohi. (typed with phone = might have mistakes ggautocorrect gF)

I agree with most of what you said. Even though I'm not the best and certainly better at Nebula, I am good at Kohi. Not as good as some people (cough you cough) but I can beat most people there.

Kohi stats are a pretty good way to judge since it's a straight up, even 1v1. The reason why you don't judge by stats on Avicus is because of things like suicide, double teams, etc.

1. Did I call you an idiot? No. I said you are displaying a lack of self-control by using an obscene word for absolutely no reason in a petty argument about a block game.

1. Did I call you an idiot? No. I said you are displaying a lack of self-control by using an obscene word for absolutely no reason in a petty argument about a block game. I did&nbsp;<b>not&nbsp;</b>call you an idiot. Either stop taking my words out of context, or stop wasting my time with pointless replies that have nothing to do with what I said.<br><br>2. That's funny, because I do. You don't speak for everyone, so stop acting like your opinion is common one. The funny thing about the internet is that, if you don't elaborate on what you say or why you believe what you believe, then you get criticised for that, too. It's impossible to do both.<br><br>As I've already said, just drop it. I have no desire to continue this petty argument.&nbsp;<span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">You have expressed your opinion on the matter, and this is mine. Now please; let. It. Drop</span>

I guess the key to pvp is to start insulting each other, now i can be a PRO.<br><br>Anyway, i cant help with pvp tips, not being good at pvp myself.<br><br>As for the arguers (You know who you are), take a chill pill, you are all beautiful, you are definitely making this thread fruitful in its efforts to help out aspiring good pvpers

Great reply there. Because someone makes a thread about helping people with PVP, you automatically write them off.&nbsp;<br><br>You might want to try utilising full stops, by the way. You seem to have missed one in your first sentence.<br><br>You think you're so superior because you're good at a block game. Newsflash: You're not as good as you think you are, and being good at a block game is hardly an achievement. Try basing your retorts on something solid, not the name of a thread.&nbsp;<br><br>And by the way, it does not make sense. I have thought about it, and you seem to have your grasp of English mixed up. A lack of self-control and an idiot have little to nothing in common. You're connecting the dots in an area where they are not intended to connect, and that's a problem.<br><br>But whatever, what more could I expect from someone who spends his time acting like he's the prodigy of PVP.<br><br>One final thing - If you're going to try and argue with me or insult me, do try to use punctuation. You also forgot a question mark in your second sentence.

Great reply there. Because someone makes a thread about helping people with PVP, you automatically write them off as being inferior to you. For your information, this thread is intended to help those who are struggling in PVP.<br><br>You might want to try utilising full stops, by the way. You seem to have missed one in your first sentence.<br><br>You think you're so superior because you're good at a block game. Newsflash: You're not as good as you think you are, and being good at a block game is hardly an achievement. Try basing your retorts on something solid, not the name of a thread. I'm trying to help people, not put them down as you are.<br><br>Also, it does not make sense. I have thought about it, and you seem to have your grasp of the definition of English words mixed up. A lack of self-control and an idiot have little to nothing in common. You're connecting the dots in an area where they are not intended to connect, and that's a problem. Having no self-control doesn't automatically brand you as an idiot.&nbsp;<br><br>But whatever, what more could I expect from someone who spends his time acting like he's the prodigy of PVP?<br><br>One final thing - If you're going to try and argue with me or insult me, do try to use punctuation. You also forgot a question mark in your second sentence.<br><br>A little humility goes a long way, and humility is something you are sorely in need of.<br><br>Sorry for offending you, but it really irritates me when loud-mouthed people on the server act like you are right now.

You knock a thread intended to help people. That doesn't exactly sound like humility to me. It sounds more like ignorance or arrogance; take your pick.<br><br>Not as much as you sound by missing out basic typing skills that every child learns before they leave primary school.&nbsp;<br><br>Unlike you, I do not need "and" English course. It seems you don't care about anything on the internet, which makes you sound like even more of an ignorant fool. If you think that spelling words wrong or omitting simple writing/typing techniques makes you sound tough or cool, then you are sorely mistaken.

I only knocked the thread after you decided to act like a retard and thought I cared about English and grammar? It's not even my first language and I only started learning English when I was 7, obviously it must be pretty good if you thought it was my first :]<br><br>I don't care about arguments like this on the internet, why the fuck would I? Give me 1 reason lol, I just find it funny how you're giving me these responses that barely make any sense, you obviously aren't reading where I say<br><br>Did I say I thought it was cool to spell words wrong? No I fucking didn't, again, if I did please show me proof, oh wait haha, there is none!<br><br>Damn and avicus wonders why it's losing players to walking salt monsters like you
