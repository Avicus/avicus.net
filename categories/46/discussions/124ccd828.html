Im getting a gaming mouse. &nbsp;Nuff said.<br><br>I dont care about price.<br>&nbsp;I only want a nice, comfortable, (Slightly affordable :P Nothing over 100$) mouse, I would also like it to be able to click really well and improve my pvp WITH side buttons.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thanks! &nbsp;-Raven<br>&nbsp;

I would go for a Logitech gaming mouse, possibly the g500 or g502. Both are very capable mice. I would not go for razer branded mice.

Get The Razer Naga 2014 edition.<br>it's The Best (in my opinion).

I recommend the Razer orochi. It's Â£60 of Amazon and it clicks really fast. Either that or Logitech g600 which is a similar design to the Razer naga but in my opinion it's better.

If you are going to buy the mouse online I recommend buying it on Amazon, it is much cheaper there.

Razer Deathadder is really cool and nice !(Well seems like it for me since I have been playing minecraft with a Mac mouse for a year, almost any other mouse seems nice :P, but this mouse is actually really cool) I can get around 7.5 to 9 clicks per second with it(Thats good, right?)

<img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/JGlnGuM.png">I would say Razer Deathadder, it costs $79.99&nbsp;on the offical Razer&nbsp;website&nbsp;but on Amazon you can get it&nbsp;$61.57<br><br>Razer: <a href="http://www.razerzone.com/ca-en/gaming-mice/razer-deathadder" rel="nofollow">http://www.razerzone.com/ca-en/gaming-mice/razer-deathadder</a><br><br>Amazon: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Razer-DeathAdder-Ergonomic-Gaming-Mouse/dp/B00AAS888S/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1401655700&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Razer+Deathadder" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Razer-DeathAdder-Ergonomic-Gaming-Mouse/dp/B00AAS888S/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1401655700&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Razer+Deathadder</a><br><br>The Razer Deathadder is what I have and it is one of the best mice you could get your hands on. It is compatible with Windows and it is also compatible with Macs. It comes with it's own software called Razer Synapse 2.0. and on there you can change the settings and create macros etc. Macros are against server rules so don't use them. But Razer Synapse saves all your settings to the cloud on your created account. The Razer Deathadder is a very good mouse and it is in the "The top 10" for most owned gaming mice. It is an award winning gaming mouse and it is in a price range of below $100. All in all this mouse is really effective and effecient and I was really happy when I got one for my birthday, more suprised then happy. If you get this mouse then I hope you have fun as Razer is a really good company for gaming.<br><br>Thank you for reading this reply.<br>~ Splade<br><br><br><br>

Golden, I don't think you'll find any mice under $20, I got mine around 2 weeks ago, it's NOT wireless but I find it easier than my old wireless mouse I used to use. I also got my Gaming Mouse for $40. (I didn't buy it off the internet)
