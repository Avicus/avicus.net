So as you guys will probably know avicus has changed from full leather armour to only having a leather helmet.<br><br>in my opnion this has ruined gameplay, you die instantly wth a leather helmet. You die within 3 hits with an iron sword and you don't last long. Also I saw people kfing on curabitor... I'm a kfer myself but srsly on curabitor!? If people has full leather, this wouldn't happen.

It works with most maps but not with that map. Since iron is behind you, it people are less likely to make armor due to the extra inconvenience. Plus the way the map works is similar to Quintus, but worse; the long pathway infront of spawn acts as a funnel for kfers. On top of this, the reduction in armor leads to a more bow-centric PvP style but you don't get many arrows and thus tend to run out.&nbsp;<br><br>Overall I don't mind the helmet only but this map just isn't made for it imo

We removed leather armour (except for the helmet) because we wanted players to make use of the other resources in the map, such as iron.<br><br>So... Craft iron armour and that will fix the problem.

I think if the iron was moved closer to spawn, more people would use it.

It is slightly annoying only having a leather helmet, but you may get lucky and find some iron/gold gear ;)

I think it's fine how it is.<br><br>Although I've always like the idea of removing iron all together and having both teams just have leather-spawned armour, this way both teams are equally balanced throughout the entire duration of the game.
