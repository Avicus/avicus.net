TitanXs are all around 1000$ And they are totally overkill. Anyways, he needs a OS, a monitor, DVD/CD drive, gaming mouse/keyboard, and he would really like a 120 GB SSD along with a 1 TB HDD.

That's a pretty unbalanced PC with the processor and the graphics card, not to mention the processor is unlocked and you got a cooler when you can't even overclock with that motherboard. You can also find very good, if not better mechanical keyboards for half the price. Also, that SSD is not very reliable.<br><br>@OP: Please add me on skype, alienaxuz

They're very overpriced and unbalanced when it comes to the hardware, they put in high-end CPUs with cheap GPUs so people think they're good and buy them because people don't really know that the GPU is the most important thing when it comes to gaming computers.

Really bad, as loo said, an Overclockable chip, that can't be overclocked because of the motherboard.<br>Not to mention the Graphics card is 2 years old. At least a 960. Second he has 1.5 - 2K To spend on his PC, at least give an i7.

He told me 1.5k, and on the graphics card, dont take my word for it. SenseiTechUS told me it's as good as a 980 only without 4k. I dont think he'll be doing any overclocking, unless he really gets serious into this kind of thing, and is confident. I honestly don't think he'd be up to doing something that might destroy him PC. He doesnt really need HyperThreading, so an i5 will do. I'm getting the best out of what he can get. but an i7 and 960 is gonna be overkill. the 180$ he saves is for him to decide. Ill ask him if he wants anything else. But a 960 would be nice =P, it''s just not a good idea because of the games he's playing. He might as well get something that's useful.

NVIDIA GTX 960 or above such as 970, 980 or even if 980Ti very good for games.

If he can't afford the money for that build, tell OP to change his budget, because it's clearly within "under 2k."

He only plays MC and GTA 5...<br><br>It is overkill. I have a 750 Ti and it works perfectly.<br><br>He doesnt have enough money for that build, and I doubt he'll spend his money on a 4K monitor. 16 GB of RAM is too much, 8 is plenty already, You don't really need a water cooler with the build I gave, and I think it will be much more of a hassle than a normal fan. I also gave him a modular power supply. He doesn't even WANT 4 monitors. Look, I admit, the build is incredible, but he just doesn't have the money, and he might as well spend it on other things. This build, sorry, is overkill af for him. Maybe not for you, because you probably play games that are power hungry af.&nbsp;<br><br>I admit, the video card is bad, but I was told it was good ;-;

He has the money, check his budget lol.<br>And I honestly think you don't know how to build PC's. If the PC fits the budget, then get the BEST parts you can get. It will save you money in the future, because you won't have to waste it on a new computer in a year. Plus, I don't think anyone wants a PC that looks like crap, so I gave him an option with a Red + Black system build.<br><br>EDIT: And I hope you realize how affordable 4K is now..

He told me he has 1.5k on Skype, which means he can't afford it. He also told me he doesn't care how it looks like, so I gave him a case without a side window, so he won't look at that crap, so it will be a neutral scheme for the case, and it will be good for the RGB peripherals I gave him. And btw, I don't think spending 700$ on 4K would be a good idea, since I bet you it will become 200$ if he waits 5 years. Unless he really wants 4K, he shouldn't get it. As for the video card, I agree with you, but he still doesn't need an i7 if he can get almost exact same thing without hyperthreading with an i5.<br><br>I admit, there are some parts I screwed up, now that I look at it, but its not like I've been doing this as long as you have, so building a part list that's perfect would be hard to do in 10 mins over Skype, before he has to go...

Cut costs.<br><br>Don't use RGB peripherals; he should allocate more of the $1500 to the computer rather than the peripherals. Instead of the RGB keyboard, go with something like the CM Storm Quickfire Rapid.<br><br>Also, for the mechanical keyboard, since he has the money, tell him to send $7 or so on a switch tester; it'll save him time and money in the long run, and he'll have the knowledge of knowing exactly what switch he wants.

If he wants, he can get the new G.. Skill keyboard, the non RGB 120$ one. Also, I told him to get a tester, but it'll be hard since he lives in AU

"decent $300 for a keyboard, mouse and headset" that's honestly such a waste of money that could go in your PC, why would you go cheaper on some of the important stuff like GPU just to get a $200 keyboard and mouse. It's much better to get the best hardware possible now and get better peripherals later because they're much easier and cheaper to replace.<br><br>Edit: He lives in AU and you gave him a Canadian parts list

He's not overclocking it LMAO stop suggesting K versions of CPU's if you even said he's not going to go as extreme as overclocking (which it's not honestly).<br>Better GPU? K son. Can play most games at mid-high settings "better GPU". Might as well get the first build I suggested.
