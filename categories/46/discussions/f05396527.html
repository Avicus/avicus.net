<p>I&nbsp;assume you know about most of these, but if you don't id like to tell you. :)</p><p>Walls-</p><p>- There is nothing to work for. Not fun to play when you have all the kits.</p><p>- It auto-joins, which is nice, but its impossible to change teams (as far as I know at least).</p><p><br></p><p>Survival Games-</p><p>- Strength... This is not a game where everyone has full diamond. It's Sg...</p><p><br></p><p>Other-</p><p>- It's all 1.8. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>

I like how Walls make you auto join.Because most of the time i see friends without ranks just keep leaving and joining to end up on the same team.<br><br>Regarding 1.8 you just have to accept it. Soon enough majority of servers will not use 1.7 and you'll be stuck with 1.8 so get use to it.<br><br>I do agree that there needs to be a progression system in place like exp and prestige.

How is the server being in 1.8 a glitch exactly?

I agree with you said about the auto join but if I wanted to team with a friend I can't do that, even as emerald.

<p>Lol, it's not. My bad, this was more meant for things I saw that I personally didn't like. I was trying not to complain too much. </p>
