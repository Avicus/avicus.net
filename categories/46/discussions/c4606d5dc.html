I don't know where the fuck to post this so I am posting it here<br><br><br>
<center>
<h1> How to play! </h1>
<center>
<p> You just give basic things on what has changed about you or what you have improved on from the last year or 2. </p> <br>
<h1> Rules </h1>
<p> 1. Don't write stupid posts that have no meaning (As you can see it ticks me off)<br>
2. Be respectful to others!</p>

<h1> Mine are.... </h1>
<p>I was so bad at grammar last year. If you check my posts on like my 40th page you could see I sucked. I am not saying I am pro at grammar now but I have improved :D</p></center></center>

Love how you tried to include some nice fancy vocab in there :P<br><br><br>I have improved my team management skills, i feel like i am quite good at understanding people and their personalities and motives which i definetly was not good at last year. I have improved my organisation and probably the largest one being my body has greatly improved. I'm a gym lad now.<br><br>Minecraft wise, i have gotten so much better tactically and at leading my team, i have developed my cannoning to a good standard, of course i have also improved my pvp, a lot. All in all i was a complete and utter dick last year so i feel i have improved a lot.
