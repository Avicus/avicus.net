Title says it all. Need a headset with a mic, that covers my whole ear. USB would be cool and I need some LED lights. I have a normal sized head, for a 12 yo :P, so I need a small headset. Please don't make it blue or green, since I'm trying to get a multicolour kind of rig, my mouse is green and keyboard blue. Good audio and mic quality too<br><br>My budget is 105$<br><br>I was thinking the Razer Kraken 7.1 Chroma, it's 100$ on Amazon.ca and even though it isn't the best, it's amazing for the price, and I can choose any colour I want. It has 7.1 surround sound which is good, it fits my head well and it seems pretty damn comfortable. I NNED IT TO HAVE LED LIGHTS!<br><br>Anyways, thanks!

Razers are good, but if you want me advice, try to get a wireless one. &nbsp;The Razer Kraken (which I am currently using) tends to have a strange curve to it's wires, and as such it tangles and gets stuck. &nbsp;After about a year of this, simply moving the headset the wrong way can cause it to twist, and break connection with your computer. &nbsp;I'm currently on my second kraken, and my next purchase will definitely be wireless.

Not wanting to get in a long argument with you as I've seen on the forums before, but just putting it out there that I didn't say why the Kraken sucks in my first post. The reason why I said that is because if you look up on the Internet any popular known headset vs Razer Kraken, most of the time it will be the other headset instead of Razer, based off of other people's experiences and reviews. Websites just empathize the positives of things, and that goes for every item you would see on the Internet. I'm actually not even going to reply to this thread anymore anyways. All you do on here is bud in on people and start arguements. I just wanted to help someone out on forums, but I guess I won't anymore you want to argue about this small thing.

100% agree; if you're really willing to spend $100, just go for a separate mic and headphones.<br><br>But if you really want an LED headset, I'd say the Steelseries Siberia V2 does it quite well if you pick Frost Blue or Heat Orange.<br><u><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DXTA5TG/ref=twister_B004B8VCJU?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1" title="Link: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DXTA5TG/ref=twister_B004B8VCJU?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1">http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DXTA5TG/ref=twister_B004B8VCJU?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1</a><br></u>(For Heat Orange)

Nope, just heard the mic on the Siberia, not good enough. Anyways, it looks ugly to me. Could someone explain to me why they dont like the Kraken 7.1 Chroma? It looks amazing, no one can argue with that. The sound quality is amazing for a 100$ gaming headset. RGB backlighting is awesome. retractable mic. 7.1 surround sound. noise cancelation. good build quality and its very comfortable. There isnt anything WRONG with it, which makes it amazing. Most high end gaming products these days are the best at everything and have a very annoying flaw that is unlivable with. Example: Logitech G502. Best sensor on the market. Adjustable weights. 12k DPI, and more. The scroll wheel though, probably the worst scroll wheel ever. The notched version is too stiff and has no grip. The free-wheel version is too free. The weight is annoying too.

Do you have any complaints? Im looking for the best possible answer. Its hard to tell from reviews, because usually, the best youtubers who review this kind of thing are paid to, and the other ones are either in another language, or crap quality. The only reason I come here almost all the time is because I want the average consumers point of view, so I would like it if someone would give me his realistic review, with pros, cons, and other thoughts, and of course, this would require someone who actually HAS the headset. The reason for this is because Ive always doubted Razer, because they have a bad reputaion of being overrated, so thats why I take extreme caution before buying them. They have extremely cool looking products, so thats why I always take a look at them, in the rare case that they have a good product, like this headset (possibly) or the DeathAdder, or the DeathStalker (its overpriced but its amazing and looks godly for a membrane). Sorry if I ramble too much, I just need to know =P.

My parents didnt let me get the K95, since its too expensive, and my grandparents were gonna get it for me, and you know, my dad didnt want my grand parents to spend that much money on me. But at graduation (In Quebec we graduate for primary school and secondary school, which is high school) I got a crapload of money, so Im getting something else now, and its pretty reasonable, its the Roccat Ryos MK Pro. Anyways, I dont need RGB since I wanted blue anyways, and 18 macros is overkill and ill only be able to reach the closest ones. The Roccat has 5 on the side and 3 underneath the spacebar. Im getting mx blues, since I somehow didnt like the browns and reds, and I really like the click on the blues. On another note, I really do need LED lights, because I really want this to look good. I imagine a blue led keyboard, with my green DeathAdder mouse (Im keeping it until it breaks, after that Im probably getting an Asus Strix Claw, the most similiar to the deathadder and has dpi adjustment, and is smaller for my small hands too.) and a pruple headset, with a shaded red backround on my monitor. Lol, I just want something of mine to look extremely cool for once in my life, and leds are important. Most headsets, like the seinnheisers, are ugly and expensive. Turtle beach is good, but that breaks fast too apparently, and The HyperX Clouds are ugly af imo. But on the other hand, I just have to agree with the firefly. Sure, if your willing to pay that much, why not, but overkill!.<br><br>But on the other hand, the quality for the headphones is pretty bad, but most people that are careful and dont bang their headphones on the wall which I usually dont tend to do, are good for an easy 2-3 years.<br><br><br><br>Anyways, try to recommend something WITH LED lights =P. and dont make it green or blue, cause Im going for a multicolor kinda thing here.

My parents didnt let me get the K95, since its too expensive, and my grandparents were gonna get it for me, and you know, my dad didnt want my grand parents to spend that much money on me. But at graduation (In Quebec we graduate for primary school and secondary school, which is high school) I got a crapload of money, so Im getting something else now, and its pretty reasonable, its the Roccat Ryos MK Pro. Anyways, I dont need RGB since I wanted blue anyways, and 18 macros is overkill and ill only be able to reach the closest ones. The Roccat has 5 on the side and 3 underneath the spacebar. Im getting mx blues, since I somehow didnt like the browns and reds, and I really like the click on the blues. On another note, I really do need LED lights, because I really want this to look good. I imagine a blue led keyboard, with my green DeathAdder mouse (Im keeping it until it breaks, after that Im probably getting an Asus Strix Claw, the most similiar to the deathadder and has dpi adjustment, and is smaller for my small hands too.) and a pruple headset, with a shaded red backround on my monitor. Lol, I just want something of mine to look extremely cool for once in my life, and leds are important. Most headsets, like the seinnheisers, are ugly and expensive. Turtle beach is good, but that breaks fast too apparently, and The HyperX Clouds are ugly af imo. But on the other hand, I just have to agree with the firefly. Sure, if your willing to pay that much, why not, but overkill!.<br><br>But on the other hand, the quality for the headphones is pretty bad, but most people that are careful and dont bang their headphones on the wall which I usually dont tend to do, are good for an easy 2-3 years.<br><br><br><br>Anyways, try to recommend something WITH LED lights =P. and dont make it green or blue, cause Im going for a multicolor kinda thing here.

It seems like you're really set on the Razer Kraken.<br><br>Let me repeat,&nbsp;<b>THERE AREN'T ANY GOOD HEADSETS WITH LEDS AROUND $100.</b> At that range, a lot of people settle for one of the top three options out there:<br>-Logitech G35<br>-HyperX Cloud II<br>-Steelseries Siberia V2<br><br>Basically, what you are describing basically limits your options to just the Razer Kraken, and that's probably not something you want to buy;&nbsp;<i>peripherals are an investment</i>, and you want them to last.<br><br>But hey, if that's what you really want, go ahead; we're not stopping you.

<i></i>Im going to be honest, I would get the G35 if it were 100$, but its 150$. The HyperX cloud 2 looks extremely ugly, imo, same thing for the Siberia v2, the Razer has better mic anyways.

$150? The G35 almost never goes to that price.<br>$67 USD on Amazon:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-7-1-Channel-Surround-Sound-Headset/dp/B001O5CCQK">http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-7-1-Channel-Surround-Sound-Headset/dp/B001O5CCQK</a>

Unfortunatly, Logitech software and Roccat software dont go together, so yeah. Im not biased for Ra\er, trust me. I was about to change my mind halfway into a review on Youtube when I reali\ed that =P.

Do you have any complaints? Im looking for the best possible answer. Its hard to tell from reviews, because usually, the best youtubers who review this kind of thing are paid to, and the other ones are either in another language, or crap quality. The only reason I come here almost all the time is because I want the average consumers point of view, so I would like it if someone would give me his realistic review, with pros, cons, and other thoughts, and of course, this would require someone who actually HAS the headset. The reason for this is because Ive always doubted Razer, because they have a bad reputaion of being overrated, so thats why I take extreme caution before buying them. They have extremely cool looking products, so thats why I always take a look at them, in the rare case that they have a good product, like this headset (possibly) or the DeathAdder, or the DeathStalker (its overpriced but its amazing and looks godly for a membrane). Sorry if I ramble too much, I just need to know =P.

Not really. I mean, The Mic is fantastic, sound quality is brutal, I really don't.<br>I'd go ahead and buy them if i was you,.

So basically, I just took a look at the Cloud 2 and loved the headset itself, but the look sucks. But them I saw the Gun Metal kind and I was like, ERMAGERD IMA GET DAT. Yes, the Kraken looks 10x better, but the Cloud is 10x better and looks pretty good too. So, Im going to compare them on a yellow legal pad =P. Keep giving the recommendations tho!
