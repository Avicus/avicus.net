If a mod says he/she is "being quiet on this one" that may mean that they are going to spectate them, and they need to he discrete so the hacker doesnt notice them.

I was in the same game while this was occuring and this was not the case. &nbsp;What happened was the Mod saw that you along with many other players reported the supposed rule breaker, so she went to spectate him. &nbsp;You then went on to keep spamming, telling people to report the player. &nbsp;The mod then told you guys to stop accusaing others of hacking, and that she was staying quiet because if she were to say something the 'hacker' would have noticed that there was a mod in-game, and therefore would have stopped hacking. &nbsp;After you countinued to ignore her, she then gave you another verbal warning, telling you to stop being disrepectful, saying that this was your last warning. &nbsp;After you still carried on, the Mod rightfully temp banned you. &nbsp;This was not the Moderator's fault at all.
