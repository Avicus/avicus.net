First of all, find a position that you find fun and that you're good at, so defence, rusher, midfield, etc.<br><br>Second, get a good PvP K/D, play on servers like Badlion to improve your PvP skills.<br><br>Third, make a post in the Looking for Team section, and say basic things like your preferred position, any past teams, can you talk in TeamSpeak, your PvP K/D, your Skype.

All of this is good, except for the PvP K/D part. No decent team judges you based off of that anymore.

IMO, it is considered, as it shows your position compared to other players in other teams.

A lot of people tend to just mess around during public games. But I can see where you're coming from. A bad KD can make you look bad I suppose.

People who camp or play defense have higher kds, doesn't necessarily mean that they are better at pvp.
