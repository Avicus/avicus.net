We'll it's finally here. I have decided to leave avicus. I have been playing on this server for about 7 months now and I have just gotten tired of hackers and the bullying on the server. Plus it has also gotten boring. I will miss all the friends I have made on this server and I wish them good luck. Perhaps you will see my on other servers but for now good bye to all.

Sorry, but leaving post are annoying!<br>And not for only me.<br>If you go, then you go and don't make a post about it.<br>You can contact your server friends via skype, teamspeak or something like that!<br>Maybe this is rude, but I HATE LEAVING POST and it's my opinion.

You've only been on avicus for 10+ hours, I don't understand why you have a great hated for leaving posts.Plus that's a bit rude posting that, not even saying goodbye :/
