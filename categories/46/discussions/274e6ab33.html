Usually if he fell for a scam, which 100% uses LogMeIn, then that person might still be there, and him no realizing. But at the same time that doesn't make sense, because he could stop it.

I used to have a problem on my old desktop where I would move my mouse and it would keep moving for a few seconds (kinda like if you pushed a hockey puck on ice, goes as long as you pushed it, then keeps going slower and slower until it stops).

If it's on your desktop, you just go to mouse settings and their should be an option somewhere to disable that.
