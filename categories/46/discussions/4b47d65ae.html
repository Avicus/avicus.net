I agree. I have tried with butterfly but have failed every time. To be able to do it without a client it would take probably about 20 cps, which is nearly impossible. I can breezily staircase with about 14 cps but I cant breezily bridge in a straight path.

I believe it may be possible with timing, but through jittering, I would say you would have to be very lucky. There is one way of breezily bridging without an autoclicker, but you need a hack (FastPlace) as Minecraft has a limit of how many blocks can be placed, which means you only need to jitter at 6 - 8 CPS.<br><br>And I've never hacked on Avicus, only on OCN (which I got banned for).

Heres what it said for anyone wondering:<br><br><br><p style=" margin: 0px 0px 15px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  ">Hey.</p><p style=" margin: 0px 0px 15px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  ">Overcast has been one of the best servers that I've ever played on. Unfortunately me and some other players have been deceiving you. Breezily Bridging is impossible without an Autoclicker. I autoclick. Even Breezily himself auto clicks, he has admitted it before in skype. If you don't believe that just watch his video again and pay really close attention. He pauses to activate his macros many times and places a lot of blocks by mistake at certain points in the video. Every time you see something sketchy, don't doubt it. Also, why else would he unlist his video? It's really quite obvious, you can see some of those mistakes in my videos too. That's just how it is, It's really very unlikely that you can keep your mouse from moving at all and still be able to hit above 30cps. Those who claim they are able to breezily bridge by clicking in intervals, stop. Clicking to the precision of less than half a second and continuing to do that is very very VERY unlikely. Since overcast is shutting down and Breezily Bridging was a Iconic "skill" used on this network I thought I would come out and tell you. I've gone so far to test this as to disable the sensitivity of my mouse and get my brother to spam right click while I use A &amp; D to strafe, and It didn't work. Don't listen to people who say if your blocks don't glitch in your inventory than it's legit, because they didn't in my videos and I was clearly autoclicking. People even do so far as to put clicking sounds in their videos and us their webcams to make pre-recorded videos of their mouse and keyboard, then put them alongside a gameplay video of them bridging to trick you into believing it. Some people have even created subtle macros with synapse to bypass autoclick detectors. Moral of the story is don't trust anyone who says they can Breezily Bridge. Since I'll probably be banned after this post, I wanted to let you all know that I've had a wonderful time playing on this server &amp; will always remember some of the people I've met on here. Thank you.</p>

People think breezily is about how fast you can click no it's not<br><br>My record is 16 blocks legit 3-4 cps with PERFECT aim on the blocks no need to spam click it just makes it harder. I think I had it recorded somewhere but I'm not on my pc atm so rip. If you keep practicing it consistently you can do it, I can do like 6 blocks average but I don't think breezily is that important so yehh

As well as that, you can get custom ghost clients (although they are expensive - developers like to charge people high), and so in a screen share, staff won't look at where you have the client, as people don't normally have it there.

It's quite hard to get past CheatSmasher (or so I've heard, never tested it as I'm a mac user), but when you inject your ghost client into the Minecraft code, you use the Attach API which loads your agent into Minecraft's JVM, as well as that, it loads of all required libraries, and most <b>good</b> ghost clients will have something like Javassist or ASM to inject code into Minecraft's core java files. When you "self-destruct" you have a file transformer that empties all the files, but the files are still left, so you have to restart Minecraft. I've made something like CheatBreaker that can find injected code, even if the .class file is empty.
