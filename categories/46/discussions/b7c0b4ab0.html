As you have seen before i posted a thread telling anyone who was interested to join in on a game of Elimination, sadly not that many people were interested. However those who did join in game me some info on why they did not enjoy Elimination as much as other gametypes, some of this includes: Prolonged games due to hunting, mining, or searching for items. This is why i feel Elimination needs a boost or more loving to create a player base that will return for more once a game ends. Calling all Mods! please take some time to talk about the revamping of Elimination!

My opinion how to make it better.<br>-Starting chests <br>-Smaller worlds <br>-Scoreboard<br>-Timer 10-15<br>-less prep time

The mods can do nothing... Only Ivycode the owner is developer here and he is very busy... There was a discussion started by howsie about this. The staff team already knows how the gamemode could be better. Just be patience...

Like I dont mind the game but then you have the people with like full iron and a diamond swords and the game has been going on so long. And like your just waiting hoping to kill them untill you realise you have 0% armor and they are geard up. So somthing like limted resources would be nice.
