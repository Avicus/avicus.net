Seeing Type and quantity of players In my opinion they aren`t going to finish the league, so for them is the final place, Also, for not making it Full biased, quality of players is quite bad &amp; experience.<br><br>¿Why I think "<b>Cronus</b>" `ll get the 12 place of Avicus League? Cronus needs a lot of practice &amp; organization, they are a really good team but the strats &amp; the organization they have ( Seeing on scrims ) Is horrible, But if they work hard I 100% think they can improve a lot!<br><br>Why I think "<b>Assasins</b>" `ll get the 11 place of Avicus League? Well, this team had grew really fast, but in many cases that`s not good. Timezones &amp; Players Experience &amp; Quality ( Specially Timezones ) will affect on this team, Like we saw on the first Week, Good Luck Assasins!<br><br>¿Why I think "<b>Reclaimers</b>" `ll get the 10 place of Avicus League? Fortissium ( Now named Reclaimers ) just left a really hard time when their leader Zac left them, I think that problem &amp; Quality of players &amp; Organization will affect the team on the next weeks, But really good luck for Reclaimers, You have potential!<br><br>Why I think <b>"Kaldorei"</b> `ll get the 9 place of Avicus League? Kaldorei has a lot of good and experienced players, but the time &amp; interest of their players, adding the strats will affect them on Avicus League as it`s ( on most matches ) really competitive and difficult, Best Wishes for the Vlad`s and he`s team!<br><br>Why I think "<b>QueDizii"</b>`ll get the 8 place of Avicus League? QueDizii is a full _ spanish team composed by good &amp; normal players that have pretty good experience on competitive Minecraft. In my opinion they`re a good team but they could be affected by interest, time and map strats `cause they are fully new on Avicus. GL for my Beaner compas!<br><br>Why I think "<b>Cacalmarin</b>" `ll get the 7 place of Avicus League? Cacalmarin has one is the best " minecraft social team" I`ll ever see. They are kinda`h good team, Has good strats and they work hard! Some problems that they obviosly `ll had is Timezones and the Quality of some players is regular -&gt; Bad. GoOd LuCk to PokerFace &amp; _DC for leadering Cacal on the league!<br><br>Why I think "<b>TheCrazyBeaners</b>" `ll get the 6 place of Avicus League? TCB has a lot of the best Spanish &amp; Latin players of the overcast community, all of they have full experience on Competitive Minecraft. The problems that TCB`ll have on the League`ll be Interest &amp; Map Strats `cause they don`t even train or see the maps before they play them, lol. GL for compañeros beaneros y aprendan a ser mas humildes n,n!<br><br>Why I think "<b>BadCompany</b>"`ll get the 5 place of Avicus League? 1 - 2 months ago BC was the team that any competitive player of the Avicus Community wanted to join on. Now when they loosed the Avicus RTV Final against PPB, Robin, Juano &amp; BmB ( Leaders ) left the team, that changed all what BC was. In my opinion BC will get problems on Strats and Quality of players is worst than anytime, but It`s quite acceptable rn, GL Zzat &amp; BC!<br><br>Why I think "<b>LosJardineros</b>"`ll get the 4 place of Avicus League? I can`t say anything of this team, the experience they have ( Punishers ) says what they are and what they want here. Problems they could get on Avicus League are Interest ( `cause maybe they wouldn`t have much time every week for play ). GL Puni!<br><br>Why I think "<b>EthernalCross</b>"`ll get the 3rd place of Avicus League? Saying any biased word, EC is a decent spanish team with a quite amount of players full experience and others without much experience but w/ great potential, I think EC wll get the 3rd place of Avicus league Because we are a really united team and we always train &amp; try to get on top of this community n,n! Problems we might have on the league are that it`s Summer holidays here so some weeks some of us will not be able to play... GL For my teammates n,n!<br><br>Why I think "<b>Apollo"</b>`ll get the 2do place of Avicus League? Apollo is Apollo. Apollo is the MOST hard worked team of all the avicus league, they are really united, their players are quite good and they have a really good communication &amp; strats. I don`t see any problem they could have on the league. GL To Apollo n,n!<br><br>Why I think "<b>PPB</b>"`ll get the first place of Avicus League? PPB is a full experienced team, with extremely good PvP players ( And pingers :P ), They have the interest, the potential, the players ( kinda`h better than Apollo`s &amp; EC`s ) and the passion for winning this league! Good Luck PPB!<br><br><br><i><u>Good Luck for all the teams playing the Avicus League Season 1!</u></i><br><i><u>For second time, I`m trying to rage some1 or a team, I`m just giving my predictions biased on each team stats.</u></i><br><br><br><b>Go on, Reply your League place`s prediction n.n!</b><br><br><br><br><br>✦Nova✦. <br><h1><span class="mw-headline">( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) </span></h1>

Dopamin won against Street Sharks with 3-0, which put Street Sharks in the loser baracket, however, Street Sharks won that baracket and therefor went against Dopamin in the grand final, where they instead won with 0-3

No, I'm the master sir.<br><br>@OP I wasnt the only member who left fort; other recent leaves include ari, bleeple, zilvex, p4cki, elly, shiny, ginie, wilie and twistz. However Reclaimers leadership has done a solid job of rebuilding aquiring l3ne, aalan, lubki, lft and more coming from trials. Reclaimers should be a solid team, perhaps not in league but in the future.

Saying because I under bridged isn't a valid argument, if it is LEGAL then why use it as an excuse? If your team would have actually looked at maps before hand and realised it was possible maybe you would have beaten us, you also nearly won because of an under bridge that Tazz did but the god named Delta was able to slay him.

Saying because I under bridged isn't a valid argument, if it is LEGAL then why use it as an excuse? If your team would have actually looked at maps before hand and realised it was possible maybe you would have beaten us, you also nearly won because of an under bridge that Tazz did but the god named Delta was able to slay him.

Stop arguing. It doesn't matter why or how BC lost to PPB, but to be honest, it doesn't matter to most of the people on this thread. Either drop it, or take it somewhere else away from the forums.

So? I couldn't care less whether it was said to be legal before the game, in the game when I did it, it was legal.Tazz followed up by underbridging too? &nbsp;And you nearly won because of it so don't try to say you lost purely because of an under bridge there is more to it than that clearly.

But in a way, It was the reason. Because even if tazz did underbridge. You were all aware of it. So the element of stealth was gone. Either way, it is a big reason. And I think we can both agree that the organisation wasn't great on the officials behalf.
