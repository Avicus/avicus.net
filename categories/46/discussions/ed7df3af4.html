so my community used to have everything what this community had and the owner of that communtity is a very good friend of mine we are going to start back soon but we also had a crazy idea we are going to have an old version of minecraft that Will always stay on the same version In case of that Microsoft screws up the pvp system we are planning to choose 1.7 or 1.8<br>so i want to hear all your issues with 1.8

I don't have any issues in 1.8 So just choose 1.8 because it makes everything better and faster.

Choose 1.7.<br><br>The lag is trememdous and the only way your gonna get 60 FPS+ is if you have a gaming computer. My cousins computer, which gets 300+ fps with HD textures and OptiFine on 1.7 was getting 10- fps on 1.8...<br><br>Also, no blockhitting and breaking blocks while eating and drawing back a bow.<br><br>Lets say you have 400 players on your server. About 60% will go away, because they all lag, and the rest are either regulars tht love your server so much they put up with 60 and -, or they have god computers.

The problem is when you talk to a pvp community there are a lot of problems that have to do with 1.8. Being able to hit slower, block hitting is harder, the lag, the tnt bug that is fixed. it might be a few things but it can still break a game.

Basically What Sevo, Porkchop and Pie said.&nbsp;<br><br>Laggy af, screwed up PvP completely.&nbsp;<br><br>No drinking pots and hitting at the same time on Kohi anymore T_T.&nbsp;<br><br>1.8 was just an&nbsp;<u>awful</u> update and it completely screwed up PvP.&nbsp;<br>I would probably just go to OCN if we switched to 1.8, no joke.

The lag is just unbearable and it is so hard to do stuff like pvp and even basic building.

Last time I checked OCN is planning on fully switching to 1.8 :p<br><br>@OP, I don't have a problem with it personally. It even gives me a minor fps boost.

I agree everything that everyone else said except the lag, because I have the same lag, almost none, that I did on 1.7 on my LAPTOP.

If you plan on hosting a public server on an old version it wont end up good. Even if some mechanics change in the future versions there will also be very important bug fixes. If something goes wrong with the server support also won't help you because you would be running an old version.<br><br>And about 1.8 complaints they just depend on the persons machine. Some people get better FPS some get worse. Any way you should update when you can to avoid bugs with your server and keep it up to date. Block hitting changed slightly with the animation, water pushes TNT but people will get used to that after the server updates.<br><br>So pretty much making it shorter: You should use the latest version if possible no matter what because running an older version won't attract a lot of players and it will do more harm than good because of bugs and no support.
