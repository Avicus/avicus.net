Hellllooooo everyone! C:<br>I'm not sure if a thread like this was introduced before, but with SSB Wii U/3DS in development, I thought it would be cool to have some discussion.<br>If you're not sure what Super Smash Bros is, it's basically Nintendo's "All Star" fighting game, with mechanics differing from traditional fighting games like Mortal Kombat and the like. It's super addictive, I highly recommend it!<br><br>Anyways, I'll start off a discussion: What character are you most hyped about being added, and what character do you wish they would add? (I doubt they'll add too many more since they've added so many characters already.)<br><br>Personally, I'm very excited about Greninja. Yeah, he basically killed off our dreams of Mewtwo returning (or maybe Lucario did, idk) but he's still going to be awesome. I just love his design overall and I'm excited to see his playstyle and moveset.<br>Also, they're adding 2 new Fire Emblem characters (Robin and Lucina) as well as keeping Ike and Marth (sorry Roy.) There's a handful of new characters as well, check them out here: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.smashbros.com/us/">http://www.smashbros.com/us/</a><br><br><b>UPDATE:&nbsp;</b>Yeah, sorry for the bump. However, the release date for Super Smash Bros. is only&nbsp;<b>2 days away</b> and I know many members of the community are avid fans of Nintendo and the Super Smash Bros series. Discuss your favorite and most hyped characters, maps, and new features!

I myself am really hyped for Palutena, Zero Suit Samus being her own character (and, I'm NOT trying to be suggestive at all here...), and maybe Robin. Looks to be a great game so far, and I'm glad Sakurai is taking the time to make it perfect. :D

That would be sick! But I think one of them is already an assist trophy... which means they're extremely unlikely to be added :T<br><br>They'd be cool Mario Kart characters though xD

Yes! I wish that the Wii u verison came out along side the 3ds version &nbsp;as I am a lot more hyped from that than the 3ds verison. it just doesn't feel right playing on a 3ds &nbsp;when I have played Melee and brawl all on the tv screen.

I'm pretty sure they're releasing the Wii U version later just because it has more features, and console games generally take longer to develop than handheld games.

Sorry, guess it's just not my era. I grew up with a N64, and later a PS2. NES games have never really appealed to me. (Except maybe Earthbound, if you count SNES)

Why would they make it for the Wii? It is so outdated.<br><br>also you should buy a Wii U. The games on there don't suck.
