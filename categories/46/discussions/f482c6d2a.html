Now I want to get this right this time and really commit to making a good team but how do you do this when people see the number of members and just say no? I would also like anyone to give me ideas on how to make the team grow or be successful!

Had to read this twice, now I understand. Coming from me, you may thing my feedback is probably "Bad" considering my team was failure but, I started off by making a "Looking for Members" post and then I went to the "Looking for team" post and got some members there. If no one apply's or wants to join, I just simply ask randies in game and train them. Hope this helped!

And how many of them have gotten denied already? Many people will join a newer team to get the experience to get a better chance to be accepted on better/older teams. But if you can get the right people and train correctly you can get a successful team and be the same or even better than the original team that your player(s) wanted to join.

His problem in the first place, is even finding people that want a team, unless I understood it wrongly.
