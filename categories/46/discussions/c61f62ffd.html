i dont understand, when ban appealing, does only the staff who delt the punishment appeal me, or can any staff appeal me. or is it only the staff. Could a staff help me?<br>&nbsp;Also, tell me where to put it if i have more questions.

The only moderators that are allowed to respond to your appeal is the user who punished you in the first place. Seniors are allowed to do any appeals however...

That just means that she won't be able to respond to the appeal herself which won't negatively affect the process all that much.<br><br>With appeals, the Moderator who was involved in the infraction can supply evidence and openly talk to the player during the appeal process. <br>But because this Moderator has retired, they won't be able to contribute to the appeal.<br><br>This is actually alright because the Senior Staff should still have the evidence relating to this infraction and will make a final decision.<br><br>The Senior Staff make the final decision regardless if the Moderator has contributed to the appeal or not (in every appeal) so it's not a huge drawback.

If the ban is false, it should be appealed immediately. Other bans usually take a 6 or 7 month wait from what I've seen.
