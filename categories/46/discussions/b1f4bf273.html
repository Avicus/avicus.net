Hey everyone<br><br>So I'm gonna buy a new gaming PC, and i'm thinking to go with Alienware 18.<br>What do you guys use?<br><br>I'm using it for over 50-60 games, including Minecraft.<br>So.. any recommendations as to what is good?<br><br>Also people say prebuilt PC's are better?<br><br>I'm willing to spend up to $4000 to the max.

MY FRIEND DO NOT SPEND THAT MUCH MONEY<br>Build your own you can get a PC as good or better than the alienwear for SO much less money..<br><br><br>The PC howsie showed you is a god build and would far outperform the laptop.

I would recommend not going with 8 cores @ 3Ghz because most games already use a lot less than that. This would be GOD rendering machine though. Also, we don't know where he lives xP. This build would be around 7 grand here in Canada xD.

I meant less cores xD. Yes, 8 cores @ 3Ghz= 24Ghz in total, which is very good for rendering. But since most games use around 1 core, 1 core @ 3Ghz vs lets say 1 core @4 Ghz.<br><br>I would still not get the 4770k though, and get the 4790K instead.

1) with DX12 games are going to use more then 4 cores<br>2) 8*3ghz =/= 24ghz<br>3) with that cooler you can easily reach 4 ghz on those 8 cores. I got 4.4 ghz stable on my 5820k with a similar sized cooler<br>4) even if all the points above wouldn't be valid, there are barely any games using that much cpu power. You could theoretically go with an i5 6600k

1 core?<br>No offence, but what are you on?<br>If it weren't for the hyperthreading on the i3, it wouldn't run half of the games on the market.<br>And you can easily overclock the 5960X to around 4.9GHz... maybe even 5GHz<br><br>But again, this guy has the money, why not get the best components so he won't have to waste any more 'mula' in the future?

You can go with a 6600k, but wouldn't it make more sense to buy the BEST components <u>th</u><u>at you can afford</u> now? That way, it will be more beneficial in the future...

Ok then.<br><br>Tell me if you want a specific colour theme and what you looking for in headphones.<br><br>I would honestly go with the HyperX Cloud 2 or Cloud 1 if you don't need a simulate of 7.1 Surround, I have them and they are amazing. They come in red/black, grey/black and white/pink. The Cloud 1s come in white/black, red/black and a styled kind of thing they created in collaboration with a designer clothes company.

Ok then.<br><br>Tell me if you want a specific colour theme and what you looking for in headphones.<br><br>I would honestly go with the HyperX Cloud 2 or Cloud 1 if you don't need a simulate of 7.1 Surround, I have them and they are amazing. They come in red/black, grey/black and white/pink. The Cloud 1s come in white/black, red/black and a styled kind of thing they created in collaboration with a designer clothes company.

I would prefer a white theme and just headphones that have a great mic quality and build

Okay here it is. Has an i7 4790K paired with a GTX 980. 120 GB SSD and a 1 TB WD HDD, still the best value storage pair in my opinion. Also has a white case from NZXT (I recommend getting LEDs to make it look a lot cooler). Has an air cooler, since I don't think you'd need to overclock. If you want extra performance in the future instead of upgrading just get a good water cooler and overclock. Made space for the headset I recommend the most, and since you wanted a white build the HyperX Cloud was an amazing choice as it looks incredible in white and black, has great sound and build quality as well as comfort. The microphone is detachable and is very good for Skype or TS, but I would get a separate microphone for recording or live streaming. Nice motherboard, can't really go much cheaper without sacrificing some good features, and does not clash with your themed build. 8 GB of RAM since you won't need more and is also white. The power supply is the one thing I had to go a little off plan because I wanted something that was modular so the ketchup and mustard cables didn't clash with the white theme, but was unable to because of heavy prices on them. You could always put someone mesh or paper over the cables though, and it would still look alright. Overall I'm pretty proud with this build and I can safely guarantee you a lag free experience. I wish you the best of luck with your build c=.<br><br>-Sincerely, Sevo.<br><br><a href="https://au.pcpartpicker.com/user/SevoPC/saved/#view=DjhQzy" title="Link: https://au.pcpartpicker.com/user/SevoPC/saved/#view=DjhQzy">https://au.pcpartpicker.com/user/SevoPC/saved/#view=DjhQzy</a><br><br>PS: Happy new year! 28 minutes to go here in Canada!

Replace the SSD and Motherboard, and it will be good.

Why? I have the same SSD and mobo and they work really well and are really good for the price. Yes, the SSD isn't that fast but definitely worth it for 60$ and the motherboard is fine.
