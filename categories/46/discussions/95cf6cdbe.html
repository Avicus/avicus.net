Hey guys, I'm an old player of Avicus. Been playing for a long time joined the website 2 years ago. Things I've noticed that Nebula seems to be the biggest game on the server, I barely seen anyone playing any of the other games. When I do it's the odd 5 or 10 so I have a couple of things that I think could bring in more players and just make a better experience overall.&nbsp;<br><br>Is it possible for one of the Developers to code a plugin where the arrow trails are different color/animation? That would be pretty cool thing to buy from the Credit Shop thing. Maybe donors would get there own selection of trails, and if you want to get crazy have a GUI where the donors can customize there own trail like Build-A-Bear.<br><br>What do you guys think about a Faction Server? Avicus has the PvPers from Nebula, why not throw them all into Factions and see which team conquers. After Avicus has a solid Faction Server you can easily use those players to go on other servers like Cannoning, Pot PvP, Soup PvP, and soon expand into a giant hub server.<br><br><u><b>Minigames Ideas<br><br></b></u><b>Search and Destroy (Change the name to whatever):<br></b><u></u>Small temples/structures will appear randomly on a giant forest/map. Players will spawn X blocks away and will have to battle each other to find the package inside and bring it back to the starting site. Once a player has been killed with the package it will automatically reset in the same location. Once the player with the package has made it back to the starting zone their IGN will appear on the screen saying "IGN has won!". They will receive X amount of credits for winning, how many kills they got, how long it took them to capture the package.<br><u><b><br></b></u><b>Hold the Site:<br></b><b></b><b></b>Players would be teleported to the map similar to Nebula and do /join. They will either be placed on Team 1 (Defenders) or Team 2 (Invaders). Invaders get teleported to their starting position which can be anything. They have to run to the Defenders which are hiding out in a structure. Once the Invaders have broken through the walls of the building and have killed majority of the Defenders a message would display across the screen saying "Invaders have control of the Site" or something along the lines of that. The Defenders now have a small amount of time to regain control of the site before the Invaders automatically win.<br><u><b><br></b></u><u><b></b></u><b>Weapon War (Gun Game):<br></b><div style="display: inline !important;">Start off with Wooden Sword</div><div>Wooden Sword - Gold Sword (2 Kills)</div><div>Gold Sword - Stone Sword (2 Kills)</div><div>Stone Sword - Iron Sword (5 Kills)</div><div>Iron Sword - Power 2 Bow (2 Kills)</div><div>Power 2 Bow - Flame 1 Bow (1 Kill)</div><div>Flame 1 Bow - Diamond Sword (5 Kills)</div><div>Diamond Sword - Stick with Sharp 1 (1 Kill)</div><div>Stick with Sharp 1 - Win (1 Kill)</div><div>Randomly around the map 3x3 areas spawn with random boosts:</div><div>Leather Chestplate</div><div>Gold Helmet</div><div>Iron Pants</div><div>Diamond Boots</div><div>1st get demoted a lvl</div><div>Player gets promoted a lvl</div><div>Player recieves Speed</div><div>Player recieves Strength</div><div>Player has to get 1 less kill to rankup</div><div>Player gets a random Skeleton following them around the map</div><br><b>Parkour Spots:<br></b>Have areas around the hub where players can Parkour at.

I like the ideas! Just so you know, we already have a parkour in the hub and it's pretty big, too. :P

Yes I did make up these ideas. I was in the mood for some ideas, they're all based off old COD gamemodes though.

Please no factions. It creates too much toxicity and most factions will probably end up being unstable.

There would be some toxicity yes, but there's always toxicity no matter on what server. Nebula has small players who love to be toxic. Yes the staff control them extremely well why can't they do that on a faction server? Please explain further by "Unstable"?

Factions is a no. I must agree with Ky. It brings an awful community, it's hard to manage, and it just overall wouldn't be a good idea for Avicus.

Most of the large faction servers are a cesspool of toxicity. I've seen players DDoS, dox, hack other players accounts, and pretty consistently call others retards/autists/faggots and tell others they have cancer/ebola. This all exists to some degree on a lot of servers but factions seems to amplify it.&nbsp;<br><br>Also I want to point out that most factions will have a lot of members who know each other well. However, most of those of those players will have friends or enemies in other factions too. This means that the faction <b>x&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;may have existing<b></b> friends/enemies in faction&nbsp;<b>y</b> and will be split on whether to ally/enemy/raid/help&nbsp;<b>y&nbsp;</b>faction. If the faction has members that won't fully agree on the decision that is made, it will weaken the faction internally. <br><br>The community is very connected and there is not reason to split it up by dividing players in factions. I love the gamemode, but it won't work with Avicus.

Yes that makes sense, thanks for explaining more in-depth. I just feel like Avicus should have a lot more players, trying to figure out ways to improve their player base.

Maybe Avicus should focus on keeping its current players first, by fixing the issues it has now instead of introducing new things trying to get new players.
