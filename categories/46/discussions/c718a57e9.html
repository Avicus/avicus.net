<b></b>I have had an idea for the reward that people should get if they win a tournament.&nbsp;<br><br>Maybe be they could win a special badge that could only be awarded to winners of tournaments. It can be a new design if anyone wants to come up with one. Just an idea:) maybe this:&nbsp;<span class="st" style="  color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: HelveticaNeue, Arial, sans-serif;">Ψ,&nbsp;<b></b>as suggested by SirCyanide</span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  "><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  ">And the color can be gold</span><br>Comment your ideas and your feedback.

That's a good idea! But could their be an identification for being in the hall of fame e.g a badge, a special rank, or just a word saying Hall Of Fame next to the name of the player?

Is that already a badge or did you just come up with it because I would prefer it to be exclusive rather than you can also buy the badge?

I think that would probably be the best idea too. I think that they should maybe get like 3k credits each + the badge. The added credit reward makes the tournament a little more competitive which will engage the players more. What do you think about it?

But surely having God and tournament winner before your name is a bit much. Surely you could just have either God or tournament winner before your name and another thing e.g badge, awarded credits

If there are any mods here could you put the idea forward about a special badge (maybe the one SirCyanide suggested) and maybe a credit bonus, since these were the most popular ideas, to all the senior mods so that we can incorporate them in to Avicus? Thanks a lot everyone for the suggestions :)

The prize was originally supposed to be a cash prize to spend it on anything in the "avicus store" (whenever pet packages were still a thing, but now it's just donor ranks). I have no idea if that has changed though.

A special tournament winner.<br>Credits are useless. No team that has a chance of winning the tournament are going to care about some in game credits.

i disagree with the idea of a trophy, maybe a subsection hall of fame might be better.

I think that would probably be the best idea too. I think that they should maybe get like 3k credits each + the badge. The added credit reward makes the tournament a little more competitive which will engage the players more. What do you think about it?

Maybe, I would say just a nice badge though
