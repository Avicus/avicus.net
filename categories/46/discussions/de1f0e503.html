It could take them longer, if they still haven't read it after 2 weeks resend the email.

If your email hasn't been read for a while, a week or so, then you can resend it. Emails can be easily lost and your not the only one who has had this problem. Your appeal will be read, don't worry :D

Peachy had to have valid proof to ban you. If you aren't accepted they probably won't answer your email. But if you think you deserve and answer after a while just send the email again.
