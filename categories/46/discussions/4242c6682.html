So recently I started to build my own PC, and I'm currently at the stage where I have to install the Operating System. I'm wondering which version of Windows is better for gaming: 7 or 8.<br><br>I searched all over the internet to see which one is better, but all I got was mixed reviews. So please, you people that have built many many PC's out there, tell me which is better.<br><br>When you do tell me which one is better, please tell me what version of those two is best for gaming.<br><b>ex. Windows 7 Home Premium<br></b>or<br><b>Windows 8.1</b><br>Something like that

I prefer Windows 7, but Windows 8 works just as well.

Windows 7 is better and more simple, 8 works fine but takes a long time to get used to.

Windows 8! Gets so much hate, only because it's different. I have to say, I hate the "Apps" on it - it's not a smartphone for pete's sake... Other than that, just use the facebook web browser or download the original skype, and you're set! :D

I'm currently a Mac user but I've had quite a bit of experience with both OS before. I'd choose Windows 8 simply because I like its design and flow better; you can multitask while you game (like watching a video or playing music) but other than that, no huge difference. Go with what you feel best.

I think I might go with Windows 8 because my mom just mentioned that Windows 8 isnt compatible with her work so I dont want her to be hogging it all day long

I don't like the charmbar and the apps and the new home screen. But what I really do like is how clean and neat the windows and the toolbar looks!<br><img alt="" src="http://i.gyazo.com/817502c08c9458550bec060da7362f56.png"><br>(really it's just a color change and less clear)

I have Windows 8.1 on my Laptop, and 7 on my desktop. &nbsp;They are both fantastic, but for gaming, I would recommend Windows 7, due to the fact that just a few more things are compatible for 7, gaming-wise. &nbsp;However, Windows 8/8.1 works fine as well.

I vote for windows 8.<br>It gets a lot of hate because it's got a new layout, but once you're at your desktop, it isn't really too much different to windows 7.<br>It may take a bit time of getting used to, but IMO once you do it's way better.
