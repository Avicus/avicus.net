It depends how it looks. Try being creative with it and see which option looks best.

Mostly its up to personal prefference but you should not only count the size in. I imagine all are 1080p monitors but you need to count the responce time and framerate that you will have.

Have you tried looking up the refresh rate and resolution of your monitors online?

And there are people willing to blow $1100 on a MacBook to play minecraft. Very few people spend $2000 on a pc to play minecraft, the most you'll need to pay is about $600. Don't bring an apple product into a post about things not being worth their price.

I'll be a bit ontopic if you haven't done your setup yet.<br><br>At the end its down to personal choice and what suits you best but I would recommend having the bigger monitor for your console and having the two monitors for your computer.<br><br>If your computer can handle a dual-monitor setup without any massive FPS drops you should be good to go. Having a dual-monitor setup not only lets you play games but you can do tons of other stuff on the second monitor like watching videos, movies or even reading the forums.<br><br>Just make sure you hook it all up like you want it to be
