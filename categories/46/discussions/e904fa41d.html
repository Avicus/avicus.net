If you are on a laptop then your GPU won't create unnecessery frames, so it won't work as hard and won't draw so much power. I don't know any benefits for a desktop but you could log them so your family doesn't need to pay more for the power bill :P

you can turn off vsync, but its good for not over heating your computer, also turning off vsync causes frequent lag spikes

If you ask for example, Unlimited fps, and your computer is unable to generate a stable Unlimited fps. It will use too much power and will cause overheating. Unlimited is the maximum it can achieve. Thus, lowering your fps to, lets say 100.<br><br>(That's for me and its most likely going to change for every computer)<br><br>If I set my fps to 115, which Is about the maximum my computer can generate without the fps variating, the fps will be indeed, stable. I will actually get better fps if I set it to 115 then if I set it to Unlimited which of course way bigger then 115.<br><br><br>It really just depends on your system :p

If you set your FPS to something larger than your monitor can display, it can cause screen tearing which is bad for your monitor. (Correct me if I'm wrong)

I use 120 fps, but it really depends on the computer. I also use Optifine, and that helps.<br><b>EDIT: Aren't screens limited to displaying 60 fps, so 60 fps and 300,000 fps are the same thing?</b>

Were did you get that idea from? I guess you might have heard about the human eye 60 fps thing. If you did mean that, it's invalid because the human eye doesn't work with fps.

Oh, it depends on your hz for your screen, like if you have a 60hz you can see 60fps at max.

If your FPS is higher than the refresh rate (the Hz) of your monitor can get screen tearing.&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.tweakguides.com/Graphics_7.html">http://www.tweakguides.com/Graphics_7.html</a>

You're right. Most screens are 60hz, so 60 fps. So yeah, doesnt really matter if you are getting 800 fps, youll only see 60 due to your monitor.
