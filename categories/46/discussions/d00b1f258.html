Hey there Milki, from what I've seen if you want a decent mouse, it's going to be over $20, around the 40's-50's.<br>For keyboards then you going to have to aim for $50 upwards.<br>If you want a decent keyboard, not designed for gaming, but is still good for MC, try out the Apple wireless one. I use it and so do several others, I think Pete does. ._.<br>It's easy to type on, and is rather quiet.<br><br>Here's a link to a topic on people's mouses and keyboards:&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://avicus.net/forums/14c88b360">http://avicus.net/forums/14c88b360</a><br><br>.

If you want a mouse under $20, I'd recommend the Redragon M601. Overall it's a good mouse for gaming, though it does feel lightweight and the side buttons don't feel sturdy. That's what happens with a mouse under $20. Honestly I would spend less on the keyboard and more on the mouse, mainly because I don't see a point in getting an expensive gaming keyboard. For me, any keyboard does the job, but the mouse would probably be more important.
