Hey, next saturday (19/09/15) me and tazz are organising an unofficial tournament for Avicus teams to compete in.<br><br>The map will be voted before each game, <br>i will randomise all the teams to find who they are playing. <br>If you lose a game you are eliminated. if you win you advance to the next bracket. <br>Minimum players needed 8, maximum 10. <br><br>The first game will start at 5pm BST and no games can start after 9:15 BST. Any games that still need to be played can be reschedualed.<br>Any team who no shows a game will be instantly dq'ed.<br>Any salt or abuse from any team member leads to that team member being banned from playing. If the team leader can not remove this player the team will be dq'ed.<br>Don't hack. If a player is caught hacking their team will be DQ'ed.<br>Subs are not allowed, only players in your forums roster will be permitted to play.<br><br>If you would like to referee the matches also add me on skype, please come with previous referee experience and staff is prefered so you can remove any cheaters or salties from the game.<br><br>If you are a moderator playing for a team and you believe someone on the opposite team is hacking then you can not make the decision, no matter what and how hard you try you will be bias.&nbsp;<br><br><br>If you are the leader of a team post here and add me on skype: b.banno321 to confirm and so that you can be added to the tourney leaders chat for further organisation.&nbsp;<br><br>Have fun.<br><br>Teams currently entered:&nbsp;<br>Bad Company<br>Apollo<br>Fortissimus<br>Patchi<br>Ethernal Cross<br>Vincible<br>BerzerkV2<br>PowerPuff<br><br><br>Bracket: <a title="Link: http://challonge.com/BarneyTazz" href="http://challonge.com/BarneyTazz">http://challonge.com/BarneyTazz</a>

we tried to do one of these yesterday but ended up being a mega scrim because lack of teams taking part. i suppose they are going to do that in several scrim servers to save time in matches (2 matches at a time), and its goiing to be dtm/ctw.

Isn't it sad how i simply scanned over your post unintentionally and you have to jump to this conclusion and look for consolence and attention over such a minor thing? I don't hate you and i barely knew you until yesterday; to me this just makes me think you're trying to make a scene and just looking a bit pathetic.<br><br>But yes i have added you.

LOL, not that I'm complaining, but the teams don't seem randomized. It looks like there was a general seeding and then you guys worked from there having the 1st seed vs 8th, 2nd vs 7th etc...

Yes that is how we did it. We weren't going to do like, BC VS PPB in the first round. If you have an alternative method go ahead.

Update: We have decided to do a loser bracket so everyone will play at LEAST 2 matches. The losers of the First round (being ro8) will play another loser and then the final will be after that. However, this may happen on a different day due to lack of servers.<br><br>Moreover, we might test the two new maps in the losers bracket. This will be confirmed tomorrow (Friday) at about 3:30PM BST

Why do you care so much about a stupid ranking..? Just win all your matches if you think you're that good and prove to everyone that you're what you say you are. The rankings in my opinion are actually really accurate, although the I think the top 3 would be a bit different IMO. :p

I don't see a problem with the rankings.<br><br>the only question mark would be over patchi, cuz they're new. But they've been judged by their roster, they could play total shit on the day or they could whoop everyone, so we don't have much to go off for them atm

FINAL INFORMATION:<br><br>Maps will be decided by a veto process. Each team will veto one of the three maps and the one that is not vetoed will be played. The maps are:<br><ul><li>Rendezvous 3 CTW</li><li>Boundaries</li><li>Senex Scrim</li></ul>Rules for Rendezvous 3 CTW:<br><br><ul><li>No using minecarts to get around bedrock walls.</li></ul><ul><li>Do not enter your own wool room.</li></ul><ul><li>Do not build inside the redstone lines when defending so the opposing team can not break blocks and enter the wool room.&nbsp;</li></ul>If any of these are broken, they will result in a disqualification for your team. Proof is needed however. Hopefully we will have Referees for the games, especially in the latter part of the tournament.&nbsp;<br><br>We will not be having a losers bracket. We decided this because it is quite useless. Furthermore, we would like players from the losing teams in the first round to volunteer to referee the remaining games.&nbsp;<br><br>All players on the field will be required to be in the Teamspeak3 server that your team leader has or is being given. If your team leader has not (Ethernal Cross), please get Max or Nova to add me on Skype.

I really like the way you say this stuff tazz, you put clear rules of what you can and can't do, and you say the team will be disqualified or whatever and the result, so it's really clear and good for the players playing in the tourney. I really think the next tourney post should be just like you made this one.

Instead of worrying about players going Into their own wool room, b4 the game starts, if u have joined ur team, try and fly into your own wool room. If u can't then you can start, if u can then reset the map until u can't enter
