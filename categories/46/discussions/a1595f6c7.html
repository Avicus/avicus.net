Hey guys, I have been working on how to jitter click/rapid quick and I need to know what mouse is the best for it. Currently, I have a logitech g4x mouse and it's working hard. But I wonna try other nice to see if I could click much faster then I do now. &nbsp;Please give me some ideas about gaming mice. Thanks :)

Any gaming mouse without a thumb rest (makes it hard to jitter click.) It can have pinky finger rest though.

jitterclicking&nbsp;is when you vibrate your fingers or muscles to hit faster, it is very bad for the body doe. And it doesn´t help at all imo!<br><br>Here is a video&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-FVXgmMxF0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-FVXgmMxF0</a>

JItterclicking doesn't help you at all as long as you can click 4 cps.

I need jitter clicking/rapid clicking for refills in kitpvp. There are some kitpvp servers and it is very helpful in those servers.

Holy crap, that looks terrifying xD<br>I don't see why you would need so many clicks per second when they don't even count, but hey, why not? x3

<b>@goldenwalrus</b> Minecraft can only register 2 hits per second on an entity (excluding high levels of poison and wither,) but in PvP, there's ping and internet connection. When you click on a player, it communicates to the server that the player you hit took damage. However, not all the clicks will register depending on your connection to that server.<br><br>In other words, you send hurt packets to the server, that will deal damage to the opponent; however, if your connection is less-than-optimal, not all those hurt packets will be delivered to the server. So, the more cps you have, the better the chances that those hurt packets will be delivered since they are being sent at a faster rate. At least, that's how I think about it. If you have a good connection however, you can still get pretty nasty combos with just 6 cps.<br><br>On topic: I use CoolerMaster's Storm Recon Gaming Mouse, but Logitech, Razer, and RAT have pretty cool mice as well. All depends on your preference. :)

Find me a peer reviewed research in which vibrating your finger muscles can cause damage.
