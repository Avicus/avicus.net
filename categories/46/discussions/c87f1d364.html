Oh my god yes.<br><br>I'm still experimenting with everyone, but so far, Zero Suit Samus, Little Mac, and Duck Hunt Dog are looking pretty awesome and I'll probably main two or all of those guys. But there's also Dr. Mario and Greninja which are good, but I'm also looking at Shulk... ugh, too many &gt;_&lt;

Interesting, I agree with you on the most part.<br>I have a few questions though:<br><br>What are the different forms of Shulk's neutral special?<br>What are the differences between Dark Pit and Pit?<br><br>I haven't been able to find those out...

Thanks! However, I already knew the first two changes but I was wondering if there were any minor, technical changes (hitbox/hurtbox tweaks, other damage modifications, etc.)<br><br>But the 1v1 with Pit thing is really creative. Not surprised since Nintendo always gives attention to the small details in their games, particular Smash ;)

Yeah, they did some pretty cool things with the 1v1 victories. You can also see it with Fox beating Falco, Falco beating Fox, Palutena beating Pit, Lucina beating every other FIre Emblem character (I think), Male Robin beating Lucina, and Female Robin beating Lucina. There's problem a couple that I forgot, however.<br><br>As for really minor differences between them... I don't know any. Dark Pit is Pit's identical twin, so it'd make sense for them to basically be near exact clones.

Perfect! A thread about Super Smash Bros &lt;3 I'm royally pissed they removed Lucas and added more clones. Nonetheless, I'm still excited to get it &lt;3 So anyone have a suggestion for a replacement for Lucas?

Ness.<br>Just kidding :P<br><br>Robin looks a tad bit similar to Lucas, with magic-based attacks. They have quite a few differences, but I think it's worth a try. He's pretty good at controlling space and his melee attacks aren't half bad.

I think you mean "Duck Hunt &gt; entire roster". In fact, we need a Duck Hunt sequel —&nbsp;<i>Duck Hunt: Uprising</i>, anyone? On a less facetious note... Duck Hunt is okay, but his projectile spam is oftentimes unbearable...

If only the final smashes were unique and they aren't FSmashes like Ike, Kirby, or whoever haves the final smash you need to hit the player with. Ppl like Wario Lucario and Ness have good ones. It isn't original like the players having FSs like Metal Knight, Greninja, etc. too many people have that type of FS.
