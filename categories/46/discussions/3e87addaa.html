Since i haven't had access to the forums until yesterday, I've just seen the leaderboards. I realised that people with 10's of thousands of kills are ranked quite low in comparison with people who have high monument counts and not so many kills. Do kills not count as much as monuments?

The kills are for every game mode I think, and the monuments are just for Nebula.

Yeah i did notice that, back when i used to play on a competitive cracked team-games server (Craftrealms; like Avicus it has a gamemode like Nebula but its called PvPWar), Kills is what will get you on the high ends of the leaderboards, but compared to that server, this server&nbsp;<i>Avicus Network</i> is more based on the attained objectives, thats why most players who are on the high ends of the LDBd's are more into completing the objective for a higher ranking, as compared to ppl who are on the low ends of the LDBd's, most likely they are either not into the objective of getting the wool/monument, or they try to but it isnt as efficient, or they are more into the <i>PvP Side</i> of things

I think that even though you get a ton more credits from monuments being broken, it's fair as they're way harder to get than kills.

A person's score is calculated by multiplying their monuments by seventy-five and their kills by three halves, adding the two, and subtracting their deaths (S = 75M + 1.5K – D; "S" is the score, and "M", "K", and "D" are the monument, kill, and death counts, respectively). <b>In other words, monuments are worth fifty times more leaderboard points than kills.</b> Needless to say, someone who's only broken a few monuments can easily pass another player, who's gotten a couple hundred kills (but no monuments), on the leaderboards.<br><br>Also, keep in mind that the scores for each gamemode are determined separately... but I'd assume the formula is similar (I haven't checked). Hacktivism, by the way, is the one who figured out the calculations, not me.

We should just copy OCN's leaderboards. End of story.&nbsp;<br><br><br><br><br>I'm not joking, they have a better system than our score system.

I actually agree here. I was 331st. now 2nd (nebula that is), it has completely removed the competitive aspect- in terms of leaderboard ranking that is. Maybe lower the value of a monument?
