It says on the update bit of the minecraft launcher (where it says what's in the updates). If you scroll down a bit it it should say that everyone is advised to change their passwords.<br>

I looked into his feed...and he said he was the one who hacked OCN. Not sure if it is true or not, but if it is true, that was one major question I had.

So this explains the first time the site went down. I thought he was referring to the 5-day shutdown for maintenance and database relocation/reconfiguration.
