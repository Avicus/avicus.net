Fort registered before <b>Xenarch</b> and <b>Nico and TheBand&nbsp;</b>so that's why those two teams won't be playing, the reason why they can still register is because it was expected to have 16 teams, so the only way to continue with the system that was supposed to be used is to halve the amount of teams, hence&nbsp;<b>8</b>.<br><br>Edit: Maybe 10 teams will work, I'm not to sure though.

Patchi and Xenarch aren't rejected, they don't have enough players that accepted the invite to participate in the tourney, thus, the "TBD" status is still on them.

I'm not sure about 10 teams. It is possible that is could work. I think 12 teams is possible if you tried.
