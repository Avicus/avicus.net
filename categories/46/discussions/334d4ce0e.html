I'd like to keep the pvp fairness in 1.8 in 1.9. Such as: no block hitting... Fixed knock back... And swing speeds.<br><br>i think the crossbow is a good idea, but generally a crossbow is quicker to reload. Maybe more valuable insted of slower. ( 3 iron, 3 sticks 1 string) and the arrows would need to be more expensive as well.

Dude, do you realize ping doesn't matter? With some training and having a high ping you'll still be able to 12 block people that have really low ms.<br>Also, "KB fixed", don't make me laugh..
