Hey guys!<br>I created this topic, because many people asked that.<br>In avicus, nebula is the favorite game of the most of us.<br>Some people, reached prestige 5 and level 50, and it started to boring.<br>As some people said, reset stats isn't possible.<br>My idea, is make more nebula prestiges, till 10.<br>6th- dark blue<br>7th- cyan<br>8th- green (not lime)<br>9th- dark purple<br>10th- Black<br>I'm asking from the developers, to make this changes on the next update.<br>Leave upgrades/comment below.<br>~Eric

I don't think this will be implemented, seeing as there is "<i><b></b></i><b>Veteran"</b> Rank for players that achieve 5th prestige in every game mode. Seeing as it would take a VERY long time to get 10th prestige in every one.

@D00ZiE: Most of people, as i said, their favorite game is nebula.<br>They loved that and played soooooooooooo much and reached prestige 5th and lvl 50.<br>They left nebula, and after that avicus.<br>We don't wanna lose people, plus- It will be more fun to play, reach more prestiges.<br>I thought about that, you are right.<br>Don't need any perfixes.<br>We need more prestiges.<br>Btw its not hard to get 10th because ou are already 5th, do like you did before.<br>Plus you can be 5th and lvl 50 and then just /prestige because you are already lvl 50.<br>It's good idea as many people saying.<br>You are level 50 and prestige 5, maybe it's not boring you to still play, but i'm sure it will be more fun to me, you and all the other avicus players to reach more xp.
