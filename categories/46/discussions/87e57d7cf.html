Hello, as many of you may know there is this event called dreamhack. On the event tournaments get streamed,you can meet famous people or just play in big lan halls.<br>&nbsp;2016 will be a big year for dreamhack and the event will be hosted in many countries. Me myself have decided to go to dreamhack Masters, a csgo tournament hold in "Malmö" in april. The tickets are getting launched the 14th. I will also go to dreamhack summer in Sweden with the hope of meeting people I loved to watch as a squeaker.<br><br>So I was gonna ask, are you gonna attend to any events? Will you watch the tournaments? And would you like to go if you had the oppertunity?
