I'm not that high of a rank yet, and I haven't played in a while. &nbsp;I used to use the noob champions anyway...stuff like Ashe, Yi, Fiora etc.

Lvl 30 unranked cuz i've only played one game and i want to learn ad a bit better before I really get into ranked, but I can play anywhere. If you really want me at my best, Thresh support is my thing ( I can play several supports including: Sona, Braum, Thresh, Karma, Soraka and saving for Blitzcrank.). Don't expect any god tier plays but i can certainly make things happen with even a decent adc (I can carry bot lane with Thresh and Braum, I need my adc to be decent if you want me to play the others to avail).
