On OCN there were 15 tournaments. Of those, only one was won my a spanish teams, and in the last 3 tournaments there were significantly more spanish teams than english (i believe 5 spanish to every english team in the penultimate tounament, Kung Fu Capture, which was the only tournament won by a spanish team)<br><br>On avicus there have been 5 tournaments, and none have been won by spanish teams.&nbsp;<br><br>Why do you think this is?

I have experienced playing with both Spanish and English teams, and I've developed some hypothesis of why what you say happens. I can think of many factors to explain this.<br><br>Mentality: For most of OCN history, Spanish teams hadn't previously won a tournament (before T14) or even gotten to the finals (T10) or top 4 (T9). Spanish teams before these moments didn't think they were capable of achieving such good places in tournaments, even if they were up to the level of a semifinal or a final. Apart from that, I've even seen some teams who didn't think they'd be able to beat a good English team on a scrim because of their better ping, but those are really isolated cases.<br><br>The offensive aspect of the game: Something I realised shortly after joining Yirang, was that one of the main reasons why Spanish teams tended to be worse, or to occupy less percentage in the top 5/8 was the (in some cases complete) dependance on their main offenders/rushers. I've seen loads of Spanish teams that easily beat worse teams, but when a decent/good teams manages to invalidate their offenders constantly, they can't find another way of pursuing their objective. This is the reason why Fussion won an OCN tournament - they worked as a team instead of depending solely on their offenders.<br><br>Ping: Although definitely not able to limit any player from beating another, it makes a small difference. Non-Spanish EU teams haven't won a tournament either.<br><br>Popularity of the English language and Spanish players in English teams: It's obvious that there are more Spanish players who are able to speak English than the opposite. This led to a good amount of top Spanish players joining English teams, and therefore Spanish teams level would be lower.

I think most of your ideas are right. Also I think that on OCN there was definitely an aspect that spanish teams kind of got disregarded because all the EC's only knew the english teams and stuff. In house of cores, kiube was easily a top 3 team (they held a lead against Oklahomies for like 55 out of 60 minutes on fractal descent in the quarter finals) but because they werent well known they got a worse spot on the bracket. The same thing happened to countless other teams too (Punishers in GoTW, FatalFury in SoC, UbeR in SoC and TLoA to name a few)<br><br>Btw im a scumbag so im gonna correct you that the first spanish team to make top 4 was instant crash in breaking core (tourney 6)

tbh i feel like your last point of how top spanish players joining good english teams is correct. and there arent many good english players who join spanish teams mainly because most spanish players also know how to speak english but english players dont know spanish. and also i feel like most english teams coordinate better than spanish teams idk why they just do. PS fussion did win kfc because they worked as a team but it would have been alot harder for them if they didnt have bryanism

I actually think/thought i was because most Spanish players were less competent. For example, in my opinion UbeR were still BY FAR the best melee team when they played in tourneys (aside from SoC but everyone sucked at 1.9 then).&nbsp;<br><br>Mechanically, Spanish players were far better than English speakers. But, Every single Spanish team aside from Punishers were extremely unorganized. No real "leader" Heims had me/Matt leading TDM and stuff in TLoA and we made a bunch of Mistakes vs Punishers despite we were actually the better team (misplaying on the day, UbeR/Shaikru were the most dominant in scrims but Pureblox would always perform past expectations in tournaments.)&nbsp;<br><br>Now, I personally think UbeR/Shaikru were the best teams of their respective Tournaments (TLoA and KFC) but both played worse in tournaments. On the other end of the spectrum, Yirang/Dopamine (US Team) Always playing decently/well is why they "succeeded" at all. Due to less intellegent calls etc... Yirang would be able to win despite (imo) being a Top4 team.&nbsp;<br><br>I don't think Minecraft on a competitive scale was big enough or had enough examples of this that I can remember, so yeah :v.

Most tournaments in Minecraft are won by the oldest teams or oldest players within new teams. It just so happens that in Minecraft or at least this sector of the Minecraft community, a predominant amount of legacy players are English. This effect becomes mitigated as the community evolves and the early adapter's advantage becomes mitigated. For example in OCN and in Avicus the oldest existing team almost always wins, or at least the top few are much older than the rest.
