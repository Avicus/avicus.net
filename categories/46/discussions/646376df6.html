What's the best defense you've ever had? For me it was either a giant office building on Rendesvouz or when I made a giant mansion on Proleium

Mine was with a couple of friends (orccaptain and awesomeninjaminer) when we built an impenetrable defence made out of iron and wood on senex I, it was a great game that ended with our team winning!

I love when I 'renovate' a monument with my friend Alicia_Nirui123. We usually do it on Senex II, there was this one time where we did this amazing defence and no one from the other team could get in it!

Mine was with my brother, cousin, two of my irl friends, and various people on a Ternio. We made the back monument like some huge wooden pirate ship/ vault/ fortress and just protected it insanely. It looked epic.<br><br>My other one was on a Justice, with my brother and others I can't remember, and we made this epic little box with train tracks in a circle around the monument and minecarts. xD Great times.

I remember mining the area under both monuments in Senex 1. Then people from the other team would jump down trying to land on the monument. I am going to guess that 90% of the time they missed the monument and hit the ground and die. but if they hit the monument they had an army of 17 full iron lads waiting for them!! LOL!
