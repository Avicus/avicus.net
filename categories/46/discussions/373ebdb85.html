So as many of you are aware, sfkwww was probably the best Nebula player of all time. Since he stopped playing Nebula, all of his videos continue to be viewed, and people keep wondering: "Where did sfk go?" As some of his friends know, he's retired. But he's temporarily come out of retirement to play some Nebula tomorrow with me and a few others. If you wanna join us, and hang out with sfkwww, be on tomorrow. If you don't know who sfkwww is: HOW???? Check out his YouTube channel (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/SfkwwwPlaysMC">https://www.youtube.com/user/SfkwwwPlaysMC</a>) and be nice and sub to him. And if you're feeling like being generous around the holidays, sub to my channel too (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/BlackjackMinecraft">https://www.youtube.com/user/BlackjackMinecraft</a>) My videos can be a little bit on the less serious side... Anyway Sfkwww will be playing Nebula tomorrow around 3:00 pm central standard time so be there or be square. I'll be recording the whole ordeal, and since we'll be teaming with some of the best rushers in the game, if you're on the other team you better watch out... I'll make a post in the media section when I edit together some of the footage. I've told Sfkwww, XHeat, and JKAwesome to do the same, so it'll be really cool to see from so many different points of view.<br><br>Peace out... or something. &nbsp;<br><br>P.S. I think I posted this in the right section... feel free to move it if it isn't. :/

This isn't really needed. Just let him play and have his space. Don't make a topic to make people actually join your game and bother Sfk. Plus team stacking like how you said (All the best rushers in the same team) will make all the no donors annoyed and leave plus if you do that it will make some of the non donors believe that if you pay you can win better(I've seen this happen). I'd just use /join. Who cares what team I join. If I'm on Sfks &nbsp;or not I don't care.

He is probably better than you are. However, this thread is stupid and doesn't need to exist.

Not to be rude to sfk or anything but you're acting as if he was a celebrity tbh lol, we're all just playing mc and we're all just players. Maybe he doesn't want random people he might not even know to be following him around Avicus when he is temporarily back?
