I have to agree with zed here, mega sableye will be OP with its only weakness being fairy.<br><br>Also i know for a fact that pokemon will release a new game before making remakes, so dont expect a d/p remake up till end of next year.

Sableye (I think) can learn poison type moves, so basically a supertrained mega Sableye is too OP. Fairy is weak to poison, so GG

Well, the Fairy type was just introduced this generation. Remember in Gen 2 when Dark and Steel were introduced? There were like, 4 pokemon with Steel typing and 4 pokemon with Dark typing, and the Dark types weren't even that good. (except for Houndoom maybeh.) Or what about Dragon in Gen Wun, where it had 3 Pokemon (all in the same evolutionary line) only and the only dragon move was Dragon Rage (which btw did and still does only 40 HP.) I'm sure that Mega Sableye won't be as game-breaking as Mega Gengar (Shadow Tag OP) and Sableye's stats weren't that great to begin with anyways (whereas Mega Gengar had 110+ Speed and Special Attack.) We're not even taking into account that Sableye has a possibility of losing Prankster, an overall amazing (and trollish) ability that made regular Sableye at least somewhat viable in the game. And it loses its Leftovers too (in place of a Sableyenite... Sablenite? idk) which hurts its defensive niche and utility. Not to mention that Fairy types have already shaken up the game with their unique type matchups and decent lineup of Pokemon (Mega Mawile, Gardevoir, Klefki, etc.) unlike the previous Dark and Steel types.<br>But who knows, we don't know much about Mega Sableye so it might get some ridiculously OP stats or ability or something :T

It doesn't learn a Poison-type move, sorry... Even if it did, Sableye's offenses are hilariously weak and aren't boosted by Prankster, assuming it gets that.&nbsp; xD

It does have a poison move :D... Toxic.<br>And even though Sableye's offenses are weak and not boosted by Prankster, priority Substitute, Recover, AND Toxic/Will-o-Wisp make it  the ultimate troll/utility mon.

&nbsp;Magic bounce is good and everything but I wish it would get a better ability like "defensive hold" &nbsp;where defense is doubled or something like that -_-

That I do agree with. It's already a pain in the butt to face competitively...<br><br>Also, I don't think losing Lefties will be that big of a deal either, since it does have Recover. :D<br><br>@Tigor Prankster's already one of the best abilities in the game, it's just not an ability that makes it a total powerhouse. It's basically the Heavy's Medic, if you get the reference.

Honesly sabelye&gt;mega sabeleye. The only reason people use sabeleye &nbsp;in competitive is for prankster and mega sabeleye &nbsp;takes away from that. It might have better defenses but its as slow as fuck with bad attack

Furfrou has an ability called "Fur Coat" that halves all physical attacks.<br>But seriously, an ability like that is stupidly overpowered, depending on the pokemon it's used on obviously.

ik, but mega mawile has huge power (btw this thing is a monster) so it would make sense that mega sableye would have an ability similar to fur coat (unfortunately it doesn't get this).
