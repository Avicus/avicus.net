I'm in love.<br><br>I got the game on launch day (Friday) and i love it i love it i l0ve it.<br>The music as it advances through the ages really creates that feeling of your civilization advancing ; their achievements along the way almost purely represented by the music itself. &nbsp; The graphics although they had lot's of complaints about being 'too phone like' or 'too cartoonish,' after about 3 hours playtime i began to love what i thought would take a lot longer to adjust to , the new fog of war system by far being my new favourite feature graphic wise. The new districts system creates a depth that Civ V never had , making the player have to plan/think harder than (in my opinion from playing Civ 3-6) &nbsp;Any other civ game. The new city state system as well is extremley well made in my opinion , making the used to be meta of stealing workers and glitching city states to take them now in to a much welcomed powerful ally. That's not to say it doesn't have it's fare share of things that need fixing , bad minimap , poor ai algorithim , bad border growth system , not the best at notifying you of nearby events etc and multiple small bugs. The majority of these will be fixed in hot patches however and i much look forward to the game that's left.<br><br>May write more here later but there's so much i could talk about.<br>It's fair enough to say i'm addicted with 14 hours already , kill me please. (Don't worry it was just for the first day Mr Pizza will be back on avicus like usual tonight :^) &nbsp;)<br><br><br>Discuss any opinions you have on the game/ arrange games with each other.<br>Steam name:Bomber334<br><br>I'll leave you with the stunning opening song.<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQYN2P3E06s" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQYN2P3E06s</a>

To get it off steam it's pretty heavy £50 so certainly not free haha<br><br>Also he was referring to the founder of Facebook who posted saying he was playing Civ VI&nbsp;<br>Why he thought anyone would get that from just his name is a different matter :P

Haven't played it or any of the previous versions, but it certainly looks interesting! ;o Used to play a lot of SimCity and Sims, kinda reminds me of that. Might have to give it a go.

It looks really good and I'd probably buy it, but my steam wallet is like a leaky cup. I'll never be able to keep $60 in it long enough to purchase the game.
