hello, My name is thebrosknows i have been playing avicus for a really long time but i just got an avicus acount so what my idea was maybe you guys can think about actually having creative as one of your games. So if people arent on other servers you can just go on the creative server and make your own plot. Another thing you could make a game call master builders its where every person is in a plot of their own they cant see anyone elses but there own and you give them something to build and then after 4 minutes is up you have every one rate each others creations with different stained glass, i hope you take this idea into consideration<br><br><br>P.S. the reason why im suggesting this is because i have gone on this server and their arent enough people to play, i want to play on this server but their isnt enough people so you should make creative cause any one could be on

Well, creative we definently aren't adding because you can just do that in singleplayer, and master builders is already on 2 different servers and it isn't original so we probably don't want that either.

well yes we need to update this server or whatever but the lag problem does sometimes depend on your wi-fi connection and how good the computer runs minecraft cause i have a really good computer and i hardly ever get lag
