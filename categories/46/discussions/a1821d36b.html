Nothing big but I just wanted to ask what would be better out of:<br>a) Having 13 - 16 CPS but no blockhit<br>b) Having 6.5 - 8 CPS and being able to blockhit<br>My aim would be the same either option F.Y.I

I would say, on Avicus, go with the blockhitting because of how far you can knock people back with it.

You can preform some amazing combos without block hitting.&nbsp; But the first one looks like jitterclick, and I am not a big fan.&nbsp; But, the bigger the cps, the better.

It isn't jitter clicking, it's 2 left clicks :P and use button 5 as my right click. Also I play Pot PvP 75% of the time.<br><br><br><br><br>EDIT: Bring back HG and I'll be on that 100% of the time :) (Minecraft time, I do have a life :P)

13-16 gives you more benefits imo, but if you utilize blockhitting like I do, depending on the situation, it could be more useful, but 95% of the time jitterclick, but don't over-do it and take breaks, getting carpal tunneling is Horrendous.

put two fingers over your left click and have each finger tap it once at a time, basically drumrolling your fingers on your left click to get that kind of cps without using that or jitter

This isn't why it is illegal, but it is very bad for your health and you can get problems with your hands from it.

actually unless arthritis runs in your family you won't get it from jitterclicking.&nbsp;<br><br>do NOT jitterclick with your wrist, use bicepts.
