Yes, the server has its fair share of issues and I acknowledge this. I just don't think it's right to have this amount of posts about this, it doesn't make me want to get up and play some Avicus because it's an awesome server. It makes me depressed and not want to play at all. This time let's focus on the positives and fight for the same relaxed feel that we all had a short time ago!&nbsp;<br><br>Great, welcoming community. A server that you can forge friendships on like not other server out there. Friendly staff.&nbsp;<br><br>And now I leave the floor to you, the community to think up some other amazing things about this server!&nbsp;<br><br>Why give up on something we all love so much?&nbsp;<br><br>#Fight4Avicus

Yeah, I've noticed alot of dying topics as well. It's kinda ridiculous. We know Avicus isn't like what it use to be, but complaining about it and making posts like that isn't very needed.

+1<br><br>Everyone knows Avicus is dying, but they are overreacting. Don't create lots of threads saying "Avicus is dying!" This is influencing players to leave. If you ask me, we just have to wait. The Staff apps will open soon meaning more staff and more people. Avicus is just having a tough time and making "The server is dying" threads will make this worse.

When it goes so far that players quit, staff retire and so many topics are created about this, I expect someone to at least acknowledge the fact that Avicus is going downhill.

I kinda made this post so we could look at the positives. I said I acknowledge that it wasn't what it was before but if you're going to be all depressing in a topic that 's supposed to get our spirits up, please leave this post. You can say this elsewhere man, I respect your opinions but this is not the right place for it. Thank you.

Well, the problem is, that there is almost as many ANTI-server dying topic as there are PRO-server dying topics. So really, you are just as spammy as the rest&nbsp;<br><br>&lt;3

To me, on all of the servers I've been on that are similar to this player size are filled with people saying 'It's dying.' It's not really dying until many people in the community start leaving, random crashes, etc. If it's only a few people it's not something really huge to mind imo.
