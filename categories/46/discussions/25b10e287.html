I have a distinct feeling that part of the reason that Avicus is losing players is because of all the rage being thrown about, and in this midst of this rage is excessive swearing. I remember on an old server I played on, they used to filter words such as 'shit' into a word with a bit of humour. They even translated 'lag' to 'kittens'. If this feature was added in, it might restore some of the children players who decided to quit because of all the rudeness and even some others.

No. People will just find a way to bypass it. This happened last time there was a filter. Maybe after someone says "lag" or "hacks" a message is sent to them saying<br><br>"Tip: Remember not accuse others of hacks. Use /report instead" or<br>"Tip: Remember, if it is lagging do not spam 'lag' "

How about instead of censoring, Avicus has one of those things where if you type in a message with a swear word, it doesn't actually send and instead has some message like "Do Not swear in chat"<br>The same would go for hacks "Do not publicly accuse others of hacks, use /report instead"<br>Not only is that easier, but it would lessen the infraction rates...<br>And before you say it, it would also bring up the message if someone tried to avoid this function, example sh it, fu ck<br>sh1t, and a55 would all not be sent :P

It's a good idea because people have been banned (me and others) just for exercising their freedom of speech A.K.A swearing and the reason the server is losing players is because i'm sure a lot of the people have been banned for swearing and other things.

They probably wouldn't care to much anyway. Their message goes in-censored. Plus, who knows, it might help with some of the newer players who don't know these &nbsp;things.

Well, bypassing it would make your swearing look lame and less offensive. Take this for example,<br>F.u.&lt; K You!<br><br>This would be hard to read and, &nbsp;I would be laughing so hard that they're such a try hard at swearing. Plus, people would need to retry their swearing at the moment because natural instinct is to type it grammatically correct and, it's hard to break a habit to spell wrong. It would be lengthy and to be honest, I'm sure everyone would rather just play the game.

If Avicus would add this, I can honestly say Avicus <i>will</i> go down hill, if it isn't doing it already. Hilarious? No.

+1, I see so many people cussing in game ;-; gets really annoying seeing "FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK"<br>&nbsp;(Yes, it is like that a lot of the times)<br>But like Zedther said, anyone types and presses the enter button any swear word/inappropriate word(s) then it would not send and then the console would send a private message to the player to watch his language. Would help a LOT.<br>Until then /report will be the best hope.
