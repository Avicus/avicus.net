yoyoyoyoyoyoyoyo<br><br>So EA just launched the new star wars battlefront integration's open beta and I was wondering if anyone had downloaded it yet. Would be great to get together a party of avicus chaps to have a gander at the game, it looks pretty great so far.

It sucks that there won't be Republic vs CSI, that made me pretty sad. :c The game looks nice overall, I guess.

Yeah I was disappointed about that as well and zero campaign or story missions was a bummer as well.<br><br>But generally so far, I've had a ton of fun, which was very surprising.

I got it for Xbox One and PC and played it all night, I am really glad they did an Alpha and Beta test for this and soon the release for it. One thing I am disappointed in though is the fact that no one on the Rebels side has no idea what to do on the Walker Assault scenario, they just run around shooting infantry and AT-ST's the whole time T-T

LITERALLY JUST PLAYED THIS AND HAD TO LEAVE FOR THIS EXACT REASON<br><br>I captured both those first two uplinks and they were gone in less than a minute because there wasn't a single defender in sight.

Played it on my friends Xbox last night. It was really fun, however I think I'm gonna stick to Battlefront 2 on the PC.<br><br>One thing I noitced though is for the Walker Assult, its almost impossible for the rebels to win. Anyone else agree?

I also noticed that, but it's hard to win in public games because no one knows how to win. Two easy ways I found to take down the AT-AT's is to either:<br>1. Use Orbital Strikes on the AT-AT's (1 does around 70-80% damage on one, which is ridiculously overpowered, I have a feeling that it will be nerfed later on in the game release)<br>2. Use the tow cable to tie the legs of an AT-AT, it's pretty hard to do although, for the controlling the speeder and not getting flanked by tie fighters everywhere, you have to be pretty stealthy to pull this off.

Didn't think to do the orbital strikes on it, will try that. Also I noitced that it is like super impossible to do the tow cable thing.
