I am planning to buy a bundle or just a mouse and a keyboard.<br><br>My crappy Acer mouse and Keyboard is all worn out, so I decided to get a gaming mouse for the side keys, and just the keyboard since mine is very worn out.<br><br>I am in a budget of about $40 or under.<br><br>I have found this on Amazon:<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/aw/d/B00DKXXAAQ/ref=redir_mdp_mobile?camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;creativeASIN=B00DKXXAAQ&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl&amp;tag=c0f710-20">http://www.amazon.ca/gp/aw/d/B00DKXXAAQ/ref=redir_mdp_mobile?camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;creativeASIN...</a><br><br>I'm not finding the mouse and keyboard for heavy gaming, just basic minectaft PvP.<br><br>Any suggestions?

To be honest you can't even get that good a gaming mouse for that much, just save. I used to have a gaming keyboard but it wore out. Which mouse you get depends on your grip. I use palm mainly but use claw when I want to jitterclick or have a higher clickspeed. My current mouse (Mionix Naos 3200) is really hardcore palm grip so it's hard to jitter on. If you want advice I'd say go for a cheap Razer or Logitech gaming mouse as they're both great brands.

That looks like a steal with the sale and looks good quality. Do some research but looks good.

Yea, I was considering that as well.<br><br>But I found out the keyboard was not mechanical so probably not going to buy it.
