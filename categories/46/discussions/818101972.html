I am getting a new computer for christmas and have all the parts selected. Now I am not sure if this build will add up and work. So I need your help!<br><br>The parts are here&nbsp;<b></b><a rel="nofollow" href="https://pcpartpicker.com/b/HN2RsY">https://pcpartpicker.com/b/HN2RsY</a><br><br>Also give tips on different parts if you think might be cheaper or better.&nbsp;<br>My Budget is 1100 EUROS.&nbsp;<br><br>I appreciate your help :D

Honestly, you've taken just about the best possible option for everything. Most of those components have a very good price/performance ratio! Looks pretty good to me as it is :D

It will definetly run shaders! Any Processor that is 3.5+ GHz (Mostly Intel) + GPU that is a GTX 720+ runs shaders pretty well, I have a desktop with an Intel core i7 4770k 3.8GHz And an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 780Ti, and that runs shaders at about 200 fps + recording = average of 100 :P

You don't actually need a good processor to use shaders with a high fps! all you need is a powerful graphics card, I'd recommend at least a GTX 660. As for processor, just about any quad-core should do great!

ummm......your gpu is what processes all visual things....while cpu processes everything else, and yes i does feed it to the gpu, but the gpu handles most of the load.....shaders put massive pressure on the gpu due to the amount of visual improvements, water reflection etc.....and also I have an overclocked i5 (3.8ghz) and a shitty graphics card (Radeon r7 240), and I get 20-25 fps with SEUS shaders.....

1. I prefer intel processors but I guess thats up to you<br>2. WD is a horrible company and develop horrible HDDs that corrupt so freakin often. Go seagate please.<br>3. DO NOT skimp out on the motherboard. It'll save you having to upgrade it later<br><br><br>Everything else is well chosen. Good luck :)

Ok, I dont think you understand this.<br><br>The CPU is what actually puts the information into the GPU no matter what it is, Graphics, Rendering, etc. You NEED a good CPU (And a good GPU) While running shaders, yes your GPU does most of the work, your CPU cant be left out.<br><br>Take it as here:<br>You take a sh*tty desktop from the 90's, you put a GTX 780Ti in it, It wont perform better because the CPU isn't powerful enough to process information TO the GPU. So while you need a good GPU you also need a good CPU, which you said isnt needed. I get what you're saying but your CPU matters too... and TBH you can buy an i7 and overclock it yoursel, of course with the right power supply, and CPU cooler.

It looks very reasonable, except for the CPU. The only things that I would change would be a i5-4770K and a over-clock capable motherboard (the "K" variant means it is over-clockable, and its is very reasonably priced). Everything else looks great!

You can have a GPU-focused build or a CPU-focused build. Yes, if you have a really crappy CPU and an amazing GPU, that will create bottlenecks, but it is totally legit (and common) to have a slightly better GPU than your CPU.<br><br>@Howsie, yes go for a Seagate 1TB Barracuda

That's called a bottelneck and also I think what Mumble wants to say is that the CPU doesn't matter that much while using shader ASLONG it isn't bottelnecking the GPU.&nbsp;<br>In most cases it isn't a problem as a i3 4150 for example won't bottelneck a 780 ti as there isn't much load on it.

I Understand what you are saying... Yes you need a good CPU and GPU, as having a slightly better GPU is ok, as long as you dont have like a GTX 980 as the graphics card and an 90's CPU, just doesnt work. But yes, I do agree with all of your statements, and sorry Mumble if you were trying to say that &lt;3

No no no. That is not how it works. Your graphics card handles graphics. Your CPU handles calculations such as which blocks are destroyed by TNT.&nbsp;<br><br>The Northbridge chip on your motherboard controlls what goes to your CPU, GPU, etc.<br><br>My CPU is not affected by the resolution I play at, graphics settings, whether I have shaders or not. That is the job of the GPU.
