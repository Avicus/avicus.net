Hello everyone,<br><br>As you know, Avicus is slowly losing players. If we vote for the server, we can make Avicus take a turn for the better. I found the link to vote for the server. You won't get any prize (unless they start this month)&nbsp;but, if you want to make the server better in the long run, you will help me by voting for Avicus as much as possible. If we can get 50 votes a day, we will definitely draw the attention of new players. Thanks for voting!<br><br>Voting link:&nbsp;<a href="http://minecraftservers.org/server/38340" title="Link: http://minecraftservers.org/server/38340">http://minecraftservers.org/server/38340</a>

It's been a while since numbers were this high.

Personally, I don't think voting for the server — at this point in time — will be all that beneficial because, while you may be able to attract some newcomers, I'm not sure if they would be captivated to stay by some of the server's... "shortcomings", for instance, the lag (surprise, surprise) and the disarray of the staff team (in my opinion). These issues alone may not be enough to deter old members of the community, but they certainly don't make recruiting new players any easier... I'm saving my votes until — if and when — the server starts flourishing again.

Voting for the server and increasing the chance of attracting more players is better than not doing anything at all and subsequently not attracting anyone.

We should work on making new people stay on Avicus first, instead of attracting players but ending up losing them.

Is there a way to make it mandatory for anyone who logs into the server to vote? If not, it should at least be one if the first welcome messages to appear if it isn't already<br><br>Actually, it should have a link somewhere on the forum homepage too. Otherwise it will probably be forgotten about again

Hi guys.<br><br>Good news! Voting links are currently being broadcasted in the lobby and so far, there have been 35 votes today. The new lobby messages were pushed today I believed so it definitely made a difference! Now, what if the message said "Vote for Avicus and get 50 credits!" I can easily see the number of votes rising to 100. 100 votes a day= 3,000+ votes a month. That would put us near 150th place on the mcservers.org voting page. If voting for credits could miraculously be pulled off by today, we would get a huge lead at the beginning of the month attracting even more players. Those new players that join would also contribute to the voting and I think it's safe to say we can easily be one of the Top 100 servers. It's up to the developers though whether to implement this. Right now is a vital time or else, we would have to wait for the end of August to come by to get another huge lead. Thanks for reading.

You should look at the averages on the voting website, we reached like 430 people ON AVERAGE at the peak time. We need to keep voting and bump the server up to a higher position so we can get back up there. (Or pay for advertising.)

You should look at the averages on the voting website, we reached like 430 people ON AVERAGE at the peak time. We need to keep voting and bump the server up to a higher position so we can get back up there. (Or pay for advertising.)

That's not the amount of people on Avicus though. I'm not sure what that average represents.

I feel like these are averages from 1/2 a year to a year ago because we hit 300 every day at that time. Or, it might average McZone into that, too.
