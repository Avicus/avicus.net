One time, there was a sky bridge over my defense back in MCZone.... on Zalidor...<br><br>So i was busy managing my defense with a few others. I was giving out orders and such...<br><br>I looked up and spotted a skybridge.&nbsp;<br><br>It was high up, very high.<br><br>So a diamond guy yelled "Im gonna use my no fall hacks." So he jumped down.&nbsp;<br><br>I aimed my sights at WHERE he was falling to in the middle of the air and i managed to hit him in the chest. I knocked him off course and he fell into the void.<br><br>"Zintenka Hax!" He replied.&nbsp;<br><br>I chuckled and reported him but he wasn't banned. I forgot his name... but i remember that that was one of my greatest kills ever :D

Favorite single kill is difficult. I have had some really nice streaks that I like but single kill would prob be shooting a very good rusher (name will not be released as I don't have means of getting his permission) as he block lagged while attempting to place a wool that would win his team the game. Idk felt satisfying when my team won. :P

I was in a Skype call with BloB_Gaming and made a bridge to our monument. I made a point of saying 'Oh no! Who made that easy to cross bridge to our monument?'<br>I then waited under him, bearing in mind, he has never destroyed a monument, until the monument was almost broken when I spleefed him and killed him.<br>He ended the Skype call and wouldn't talk to me for the next 2 days XD
