I've been asked by my family if I have any items I'd like for Christmas, and me being the modern teenager I am was extremely helpful and replied "nope".<img src="http://bangshift.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/y4055En.png" title="Image: http://bangshift.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/y4055En.png"><br>Yes, very dank I know, who even needs text these days? <i>*insert Lenny face here*<br></i><span><span style=" background-color: transparent;"><br>However, I realised that my headset isn't the best and using a PlayStation accessory on a computer isn't that smart.<br>Yes, you heard me, p-l-a-y... you get the idea. .-.<img src="http://s3.thcdn.com/productimg/0/600/600/91/10649791-1352225469-180883.jpg" title="Image: http://s3.thcdn.com/productimg/0/600/600/91/10649791-1352225469-180883.jpg">&nbsp;<br><br>Laugh all you want, but this pair of TurtleBeach PLa headset has served it's time well.<br><br>Price budget is &gt;£50.01 (75$) (that side ways triangle with one of the sides removed means less than, so smaller than that number). :):)<br><br>Please provide a link to it (preferably amazon or the company's official UK website), as well as a reason why I should give my money away for it.<br><br>Thanks, but no thanks,<br>Aura</span></span>

Of you are willing to pay 5 dollars more, HyperX Clous. If you want less accessories than that, for 5$ less than your budget, HyperX Cloud Core.<br><br>Also, I used to have that headset, broke in 2 weeks, lmao.

What is with gaming gear falling off of tables and dying? First Juano, now you. xd<br><br>Anyways, I'm not too good on headsets consider i'm using a $15 that doesn't even fit around my ears properly, but I've heard turtle beach &amp; Logitech make pretty good ones.

It has to do with cheap gaming products. Thats the thing Juano does not understand. How does a 120$ gaming mouse die after falling off a table&nbsp;<br>like a 30$ gaming headset? Lol.
