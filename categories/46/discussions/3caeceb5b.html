Best gaming mouse overal G502. But I would recommend a Deathadder if you are only going to play Minecraft pvp. Only prob, many people says they broke a few days after buying so I would recommend trying the mouse at a shop first and stuff

Most people say that they break around 6 months of usage, which is quite lame for any type of mouse.<br><br>@OP: If you want a gaming mouse, please, please, I cannot stress this enough,&nbsp;<b>we need more information than "I want a gaming mouse."</b><br><br>At least say what type of games you play the most (FPS, MOBA, MMO, RTS, and so on) and an approximate budget!

Ive used a deathadder for pretty much every day since 1 year and a half ago (school and gaming) and it works perfectly.

Logitech G600 if you're gonna play a crap ton of games ranging from Minecraft, Btd 5, Sas 3/4, Maple story or any MMO, or even Web browsing! I've owned one since 2012 and it works all fine. Only concern is managing the profiles, since there's so much.

If you really, really want to spend $75 dollars, get the Logitech G502. If you play a lot of MMOs and RPGs, get the Logitech 600. If you just want to spend $15, get the Redragon I linked earlier, based on reviews and friends' testimonials, I can highly recommend it.

Yeah, I ordered it and can confirm that it is a quality mouse. The only thing that I had a small problem with was right-clicking can be pretty problematic while left-clicking when you first get it. Once it wears down a bit, however, it's nothing to stress about. Just give it a few days ^-^

Given this Budget, the best mice you could probably buy (I factor in DPI, flair, durability, and functionality):<br><br>Overall gaming: Logitech G502<br><br>MMO/MOBAs: Logitech G600<br><br>FPSs: Corsair K65 (own this, AMA if you want)<br><br>Wireless: I'd say Logitech G700s; some others might disagree and go with Logitech G602.<br><br>Ambidexterous: Steelseries Sensei
