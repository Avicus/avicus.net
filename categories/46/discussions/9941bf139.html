Hi.<br><br>So, in order for you to justify that we "took" away your animal pack, we need a proof of purchase sent to the senior staff. Otherwise, you have no evidence to prove that we took away your perks... Sorry!<br><br>Why ask for a rank upgrade? $10 or $15 is not enough for a emerald upgrade, and we don't refund with those kinds of perks.<br><br>Also, we don't refund ranks/kits/packs, sorry to say.

Do you have prove of payment or prove of evidence the staff taken away your animal packs ? Not that we don't believe you just need the in order to refund purchases then after that email support Avicus and maybe they can help more there than posting it on here ! :)
