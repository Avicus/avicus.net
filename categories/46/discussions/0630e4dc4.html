Hello,<br><br>I'm very surprised cause the avicus community doesnt like the capture the wool, i've been playing overcast in the last 3 years, now, i want to play some avicus for having fun, but this is a thing that shocked me, sometimes i hear people that say "ctw sucks" or something like that... :o<br><br>So, i want to know, Why?<br>I suppose that is because the people usually camps in DTM servers.<br>Cause the people doesnt want to practice or dont play scrimmages and tourneys (i know that there are dtm and tdm maps in official events, but most of the maps are ctw).<br><br>I dont know, but, i would like to people in avicus try new things...<br>Its only a suggestion for improving...<br><br>Peace.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-Veopth (Dear Vieja).

I agree partially. I mean, people play what they want. I like CTW myself a lot and more than any other gamemode. I would like to see it being played more, but I don't have any idea in my mind on how, except making good maps for it

I'm intending on making and releasing some maps soon, and I have some ctw maps... It'll just be getting the regions done properly I think. Maybe once they are put live there week be another influx of ctw matches being played

No safeties, you're given 64 wool, for pretty much no reason, when 8 would work perfectly fine, since you can't pick them up.

if I understand yaml (or yml if you prefer) it is very difficult to put blocks down that are only accessable to be placed in a certain point. I believe that if yml was updated (be it modules or something) that there could be safeties, but IMO the best rushers can get back without needing safties, makes offending just that much more difficult

Usually people don't like it because it uses kits and in period isn't that active enough. With Nebula there is always a few people on it, so people tend to join that because of it.

I think its not about why people don't like it, it's more about the fact that a majority of players prefer dtm over ctw. I don't know why though, i myself love a good game of capture the wool.

Well, Avicus is a copy of OCN, just an extremely poorly coded one, this explains all your lag spikes. They need powerful servers because the plugins use up loads of RAM.

After playing these days a bit more on CTW I can give several reasons:<br>- CTW is a good gamemode indeed imo, however some people dislike it generally&nbsp;<br>- Some of the maps are really bad, no place to defend (I like to defend)<br>- Some regions are broken<br>- When I make a defense there's already the one guy that comes and starts covering my wall with wood etc<br>- No one else defenses. I rarely see other players then me defending on CTW, which makes it a very fast game where everybody rushes<br>- The rotation is very short. There are around 10 maps at total. The variation is pretty small so players start to get bored of this gamemode.<br>- The current 1.8 version is full of bugs like teleporting back, random inventory hotbar switching, spectator viewing glitch and other glitches which make the game, completely unplayable.
