For a while there has been a diagram about where kill farming is ALLOWED on Quintus. Not many have seen it, it has been enforced all this time. If you are caught hitting players in an Illegal area you will be punished.<br><br>EDIT: Original diagram (Credits to DoctaPop for making it, and Snoozin for recovering it) <a title="Link: http://m.imgur.com/sR64piq" href="http://m.imgur.com/sR64piq">http://m.imgur.com/sR64piq</a><br>EDIT #2: You are allowed in the red areas, but not to hit players.<br>Here it is:<br><br><img title="Image: http://i.imgur.com/XtgE3US.png?1" src="http://i.imgur.com/XtgE3US.png?1">

Two small mini pathways that came out the left and right of the dome would be nice. But of course, they'd be used against both teams.

You do notice that this is literally the first ever time that this exact diagram for the predicament of kill farming on Quintus has ever been seen by me, and more or likely shown in public. I literally saw a different diagram but similar to this that was created by another staff member over a year ago, but was never publicly released. And now here we are 1 year later, and they finally decide to release the photo diagram to the public?

Removing the diamond armor would be changing the originality of the map a lot. I can try to think of ideas to help with the issue of spawn killing when I have the time to actually sit down and think about this though.

Is this official?<br><br>P.S-<br>I personally think kill farming should still be a part of Quintus. That's just the originality of the map.&nbsp;<br>• People that are kill farming shouldn't be allowed in the inner middle part of the spawn and middle hallway so the opposite team has breathing space.

I agree with you, and you are right. Kill farming is still allowed, just not right in front of spawn. When you get to the point where you can turn left or right to get iron, that part isn't legal to kill farm in, just because it's literally right in front of spawn, and people won't be able to get past the kill farmers.

The old diagram was made by DoctaPop on my 1 year old post. That topic had around 1400 views from what I remember.<br><br>I brought that back up in Slack a few days ago. I'm sorry I could do it earlier, it was just that kill farming wasn't really much of a problem before.<br><br>Once again, I'm sorry for not being able to bring it up before. Hopefully problems will be resolved now.

I agree with Emmaye. I Don't understand how this was just now published when 2 people in the past 24hr got temp banned when they didn't realize the boundaries. There was no verbal warning, infraction warning, or a kick so it doesn't seem fair. How does someone know they are in the wrong when there hasn't been something like this released before.

Now, I haven't seen the evidence for Nemo, but looking at Crowman's evidence, I can infer that he was banned due to breaking rule B5:&nbsp;<br><br><ul><li><span>No spawn killing. This is defined as killing players of other teams briefly after their spawning. Ensure you allow time for enemy team members to acknowledge their location and surroundings. A staff member will use their best judgement to determine if a player is spawn killing.</span></li></ul><span><br>I want to stress the "killing players briefly after their spawning" as the players were being hit before they could leave the spawn. The reason for the harshness was attributed to previous infraction warnings of the same nature. I also believe that the diagram is being used to further&nbsp;clarify where the acceptable regions for attacking, as to prevent further spawnkilling.&nbsp;<br></span>

Actually, that's not such a bad idea. Only thing is, knowing people, some others still wouldn't obey it, so maybe we have to go so far as to redefine the spawn area to make it be the red area on the diagram (the area where nobody on the opposing team can enter).

Its funny, When I first started killfarming I never thought people would adopt it and play much more aggressively with it. When I first started it, I was always in that square thing (where the chests are with the armor) But as time went on, people started pushing up. I suggest making it illegal to spawnkill on the paths to iron/square thing and halve the square thing and the irons KF'able<br><br>o ya if you say "u didnt start killfarming" I started doing it in mczone. where I never saw another player do what I did.

The only reason why quintus is a fun map is because of the kill farming and all the monuments that you can get in one round. In my opinion if you start screwing around with the ability to kill farm on quintus you might as well take it out of the rotation. (In my opinion)

You've done it before, as seen in your infractions, and you love raising your K/D. The ban is three days, it shouldn't have even been shortened due to the amount of infractions you currently possess.

Yesterday i jumped on, i joined the rotation and quintus was playing. The kill farm was inside the dome. Before i could punish or record it the players figured i was in the match and moved back very quickly. Now with this in place there are no excuses or confusion towards the area's that are allowed. Thanks for this.

I think that killfarming is the heart of Quintus. When people see Quintus, they instantly think killfarming. Is this was removed, there would be a lot of unhappy people. That said though, people do go too far in so this diagram could be very useful. If someone does go too far, I think that they should be referred to the diagram first though as not everyone visits the forums. If they kept doing after seeing the image then that is obviously a temp ban. The other day I got kicked for going too far so I understand what people are talking about. Redirecting them to the image first though could stop many people raging over their temp ban

I remember the McZone and old Avicus Quintus in it's glory. It used to be about trying to get a penta break, the only map where you could get 5 monuments. It was a challenging to get all, but well worth it to pull off. Now it's just shifted to camping or trying not to get camped. IMO the killfarming ruins the map and I'd like to see it reduced at least. Quintus is a great map and it doesn't deserve to be only known only for killfarming. Seriously,&nbsp;every time I see the rot cycling to Quintus the chat gets flooded with "JOIN CYAN FOR KF JOIN CYAN FOR KF". People don't try to get the monuments any more, it's either about raising your K/D or trying to make it out of spawn alive. The map's even lost it's competitive edge. Some people will tell teammates to not rush so they can keep their killfarming going, thereby placing kills above actually winning the game. Killfarming will always be kind of present in some loose form or other but it's sad to see it have such a dominant influence on the map.

I love how kill farming on Quintus is so close to spawn killing, we have to have diagrams of where exactly you can kill a player :I

That's exactly what we did. Although the region might need some tinkering, because you can update the sign and it will break...

Whoever said that is wrong. The kill farm just has to be like a tiny hole where the player gets to choose to fight you. Just don't make a massive ditch. :)

No, it wasn't actually. I remember back in MCZone and early Avicus, all people did was try to get a penta monument break. The diagram and the red stone lies are lifesavers.

It depends. If the enemy has hit you, it means they're aware of their surroundings so go ahead. But I recommend just trying to block spam or bridge against the outside wall.

DoctaPop also posted it more than 1 year ago on a thread I made. I was running through my old posts and decided to post Docta's diagram into staff chat, and then we needed to tweak a little and voila! :p

I don't think you can be excused from a punishment at all if you were literally inside the spawn or within the little area before the paths split. It doesn't need an official explanation for anyone at all to understand that those regions are definitely off limits. If you know about the spawn killing rule (which you have the responsibility of finding out) you should not even have to question if that is not saw killing. Anywhere a little after those boundaries is a little harder to decide on, but in spawn and before the paths split, there should not be any doubt that it counts as spawnkilling.&nbsp;<br>Sorry if I sounded rude, that was not my intention :p

I think that the kill farming boundaries should be removed except for the spawn circle due to the iron mine portals.
