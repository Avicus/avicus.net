<ol><li>There are not many "free" video editing software but I recommend you cracking (technically illegal but 99.99% won't get caught :P)&nbsp;some video editing software&nbsp;like Vegas Pro or Camtasia Studio, for beginners. Camtasia Studio is easier to understand.</li><li>There are tons of people who can do that for you if you don't know how to do that or if you're just too lazy :P Contact someone and ask them.&nbsp;If you want to make one yourself, I recommend the photo editing software "Paint.NET" (<a href="http://www.getpaint.net/download.html" title="Link: http://www.getpaint.net/download.html">http://www.getpaint.net/download.html</a>), which is well-known, free and not hard to understand.</li><li>Again, you could just ask someone who knows how to do that kind of stuff, sadly I can't get you any names right now, but I'm sure there are people in the Avicus Community which can help you.</li></ol>Good luck with YouTube!

1. QuickTime Player is fine, but the thing is that when you export it, the file is quite big in size also it is kinda laggy, but not that much :P &nbsp;I use ScreenFlow 6 (it is not free - 16 Euros) but it is worth it.&nbsp;<br><br>2. ^&nbsp;<br><br>3. Lots of people say that my intro is sick and stuff. It is originally made by me (plus it is not that hard to make another one). So if you want one, you have come to the right person. I don't really know what genre of intro you prefer so before you request me to make one, I suggest you go to my YouTube channel (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxS3u40g_KBNu2EXb5Xb_YA" rel="nofollow" title="Link: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxS3u40g_KBNu2EXb5Xb_YA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxS3u40g_KBNu2EXb5Xb_YA</a>&nbsp;and check out my intro.&nbsp;<br>If you do like it, hit me up on Skype and tell me your preferences.&nbsp;<br>Skype Name: athena_the_chosen
