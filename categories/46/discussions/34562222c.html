<img title="Image: http://i.imgur.com/0Wv4RHn.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/0Wv4RHn.png"><br>So, as you all know, CTW was part of the "Omega Update". I really enjoy CTW, and I feel this was a great step forward. The only thing I don't like, is the way people are able to defend. There is no boundary, until you get to the wool room. This just creates a huge cluster of blocks infront of the wool room, with no real skill and/or strategy needed to set up your defences. Finally, it doesn't promote team work, something that should be promoted more. As you can see on the picture above, people also started building around the wool room, in order to defend. Along with this, people have also been able to glitch into their own wool room, in order to get the kit, that's available in wool rooms.<br><br>So, my suggestion is to create a bigger region around the wool room. This would allow for defences that require effort and team work to be built. It changes the game play, and make the game more enjoyable. It also promotes the game mode, because, why would you want to play a map where everything is clustered?<br><br>As I said before, I really enjoy CTW, but this is an aspect where I feel that improvement is needed.

I agree and look at this block spam everywhere. Could it be possible to punish people who are block spamming? it's kind of team griefing.

Imo the wool tower shouldn't be able to be destroyed. The boundary also needs to be moved forward a few blocks.

It most likely isn't the team defending block spamming, but the attackers. The blocks infront of spawn is the "defence".
