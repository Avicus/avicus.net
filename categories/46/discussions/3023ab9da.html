On the Walls theirs a really low height limit. you cant even skybase, if you try to skybase it will teleport you to the surface. please fix this its really annoying.

Trying to take out skybases is painfully time consuming. It's so annoying to spend 20 minutes trying to clear out all the skybases on the map just to win; half the time the fights are one sided and aren't even worth it. Maybe the the height limit should be raised a little, but I don't really want to see skybases 128 blocks about the ground level.&nbsp;<br><br>At least in McPvP's HG, all you had to do is was sit under the skybase and wait for the endermage to pull you into their trap.

It's annoying to get teleported down, based in what you said?

I agree with Ky.<br>It'll be nice to raise it a little but having skybases 100 blocks in the air would be a bit overkill

Oh my gosh, yes for the love of God please raise this. On Tetris Jungle you can't even get on top of the highest tree... imo the height should be 40-50 blocks above the highest point on the map. Because you can make it easier for yourself by just climbing to the top of the map, less blocks, less way to go up, that's where most of the skybases would be built off of anyway.

It does, but you can't get up, you can't walk, or build above the height limit, but trees grow as far as I know ;p

I'm weird, but I personally would rather fight a skybase then fight on the ground... I'm pretty sure that's just me though xD I don't think anyone else actually likes skybases although skybasing is fun, and not having then truly does change the Walls gameplay. Some of the most hated maps have tiny height limits, Without skybases, there will always be one person that wins. They can be OP at times, but they are also not all that hard to take down, and not always time consuming. Only if they are very high up, then they take forever, but those are usually easier to take down. Just depends on how you look at it. ;)

While I agree that some skybases may be fairly easy to take out, from my experience before the height limit changes at least 50% of the skybases I faced were at or very near max height. Attempting to tower up to the skybase required gathering a couple stacks of blocks to safely tower up, and a couple stacks extra to compensate for being knocked down by the barrage of potions, arrows and TNT. Attacking skybases from the side offered a bit more protection but still necessitated quite large amounts of blocks and still had the hindrance of an arrow barrage.&nbsp;<br><br>I'm all for people thinking of creative ways to win, but we must take caution when considering the hight limit, skybases tend to excessively stall the game. Just think from the perspective from someone who died earlier in the round. Now they have to wait for the survivor(s) to deal with the skybase(s) before being able to play the next round.&nbsp;<br><br>If the height limit is to be raised, it would at least be nice to have some kits with an anti-tower purpose.&nbsp;<br><br>TL;DR: I don't hate skybases, I just hate stalling. If you relax the height limit add some good anti-skybase kits.

I agree, I'm going to make a post on re-doing walls kits, and maybes to do this, fix some kits, remove some, add others. It will be up by the end of tomorrow most likely, if you have any ideas please comment. :)&nbsp;<br><br>Also, I'm not saying to put the height limit back to 256, that's insane. It should be <b>75-100 blocks above the&nbsp;<i>highest</i> &nbsp;point on the map, <i><u>NOT</u></i> from ground level</b>, from ground level shouldn't be a term used when talking in height limit. 50 blocks from ground level seems a lot, until you look at the 30-40 block trees on some maps. It's too easy to just simply build over to a skybase... This should not be possible, unless you build up higher.(btw not saying this for you lol, I'm saying this for any dev/admin/mapdev who is reading this. c:)<b>&nbsp;</b>Enough to make skybases, and kill someone with a new Stomper kit (Hopefully just feather falling 4 diamond boots.)&nbsp;<br><br><b></b>

Really? But does it have to be so freaking low you can't skybase at all? Thats not an excuse. I don't mind the height limit being kind of low, high enough to skybase but like Acceptancq said its so low on some maps the sturtures are higher then the height limit.
