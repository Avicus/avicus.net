Don't call out and say, "OH MY GAWD ITS **! HES A YOUTUBER I LOVE YOU!!!!"&nbsp;<br>dont even spam that.<br>dont make him/her feel weird, alienated, unwanted, or bad.<br>Play the game normally, not jumping around spamming blocks.<br>^^actually applies to all players^^<br><br>I made this thread to show everyone after a guy ahem*painostar*ahem started doing these things. It makes us feel embraassed and horrible. Just dont do that.<br><br><br>ps: plz help me add stuff that we should not do toward youtubers and players generally.

I agree with the part were they shouldn't change how they play. But I am fine talking to people who notice me and say hi.

I don't know, this applies for some people, but for me it's okay.<br><br>I usually have people saying "Hey MLGPorky I know you from YouTube" or something like that, but it's fine with me, I just respond back!<br><br>Anyways, this may be the case for some people, but with others it's completely normal. :)

Good point, I've seen SOOO many videos of servers with approximately the same amount of people as Avicus go berserk when a YouTuber comes on.. if anything imma try to kill them to make them really work for their experience &gt;:D<br>hahaha i dunno, but i agree nevertheless :)<br>+1

The greatest thing that Happens is when YouTubers join a server and they don't know how to play a game. Its really funny to watch SOME of them struggle.

Not much Youtubers that would come to Avicus due to the more popular gamemodes.&nbsp;<br>Hopefully the Update will be good :3

I think the best course of action here is to incessantly scream at youtubers on twitter to join avicus. Remember, always give in to peer pressure

For my it's weird, people tell me they know me from YouTube in servers like hypixel, mineplex woodcraft etc, that I don't even record on them..<br>but no one tells me that in Avicus. <br>Thats weird o_o
