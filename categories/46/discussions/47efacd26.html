Opinions on New Minecraft Update: In one of the more recent updates shields were added they function much the same way as block hitting where you can switch between them. &nbsp;Boats now are also not destroyable when hit again other things (which means that if in a boat in combat that it would not sink affecting combat) &lt;Have not tested it with a bow yet but I assume that based on collisions with blocks not causing issues. &nbsp;Also attack time and attack strength for swords have been added which changes combat as well. &nbsp;They also added a main hand that adds extra attack strength. &nbsp;When I go hunting for instance an iron sword would have a cow killed in one to two strokes but now it can take longer. &nbsp;This update is probably not new for you but relatively new for me. &nbsp;What are your opinions of these changes in combat and do you think the combat system is better or worse than before? &nbsp;I in my own opinion do not like the update at all, a projectile would realistically sink the boat, attack times are annoying, and the shield is not at all different from the block and hit with a sword from the past so is not really useful and not a change.

Update honestly made me want to kill myself. They went so many updates without changing combat, they could of left it&nbsp; as it was, mainly the only people who complained were the ones who weren't good at pvp. Factions, towny, and competitive scenes just are not good with this pvp, doesn't make it fun anymore. When I went to minecon, I asked the guy that works at hypixel(the server that ran the tournaments) if it was 1.8 pvp, he said "heck yeah, we would of gotten so much hate if it was 1.9, that update wasn't very good, especially the combat edits of it.

Don't like shields, &nbsp;don't like sword cooldown, don't like having the second hand, don't like that fishing rods don't hit stuff anymore, don't like the ender pearl cooldown, they ruined it entirely.

It all happened when Mojang were bought by Microsoft in 2013 for 2.5 billion. I love Microsoft but not for this reason...

Honestly I hate the new update because everyone liked the old pop method better. In the new update you have to time your hits and they can block.

Each update after 1.7 is making the game worse and worse... 1.7 was good, 1.8 is OK, 1.9 is the worst thing which happened to Minecraft, 1.10 worse and 1.11 probably even worse

Best days were 1.4.7 when you could only play SG, factions and creative servers and where you could enchant up to level fucking 50!!!!

Yay, I'm the first one to disagree?<br>First of all, yes, 1.8 pvp is fun, even for an update addict like me :P<br>But... I have some opinions:<br><br>1.8:<br>Pros - I quite like the pvp, fast paced and easy to learn for new players. Not too much thinking while fighting. I like the &nbsp;easy spamclicking and combo√Øng, just like most of you.<br>Cons - Even tho it may be fast paced, it doesn't require a whole lot of skill. Yes, I know there are some tactics me as a noob doesn't know, which may be the main reason I suck at it. I feel like after playing an hour of 1.8 pvp, I get bored of it. I need to do something else like building or 1.11, but that may be personal.<br>I feel like 1.8 is fun to play for me, but only for a short amount of time. I don't agree with people saying 'It's just spamclicking, best mouse wins.', but I do think it's less skilled and quite unfair for some players.<br><br>1.11:<br>Pros - I love this pvp, have to time my hits and also aim, which requires a lot of skill to do. It may be a bit slower paced, but it really isn't that bad at all.<br>This version can be customized a lot more than 1.8 too, little example on my own server: You start with normal 1.11 pvp and by upgrading perks you can hit faster and faster.<br>Lots of you may say 'You're special, you're one of the only ones thinking this.', but check out twitch for example; Half of the streams are modded, which doesn't have anything to do with versions, and most of the others are 1.9+. Honestly the only streams on 1.8 or below I can find are the ones with a few viewers, which indicates it's less liked.<br>Also, 1.11 pvp scared away quite a lot of cheaters, lots of servers which have both 1.8 and 1.9+ pvp confirmed they get way less reports on higher versions, and more players on those.<br>Cons - It's pretty hard to learn at first. And convincing people to switch / try this kind of pvp is extremely hard. My own 1.9+ server (no advertising :/) staff called me an idiot when updating to 1.9 and above, but after the first few days they got addicted and hate 1.8 right now. Where some of them were full 1.8 pvp addicts at first :P<br><br>Anyways, I think people should play whatever they feel like playing, without telling others they are idiots for playing the other versions...<br><br>Fish

True. <br>I'd like to play 1.11, but Avicus doesn't want to update. (maybe it is because of Hyp-l.)<br>So I wish Hyp-l will update soon and won't support 1.8, and we too following them.<br>One of my youtubers said: "<i>Who likes Minecraft updates? We all hates them :D"</i><br><br>Btw, people love to call others idiots, especially in <i>this</i> age.
