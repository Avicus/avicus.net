Why exactly is it, that we, as a human being, enjoy playing MC so often, or just video games in general?<br><br>Why do we find it easy to play Video Games on a bright screen for hours upon hours, but have trouble running, or just sports in general?<br><br>I'd like your opinions on this.<br><br>-Zach

I think it's because we usually have goals that we want to achieve. &nbsp;No matter what type of games we play. (:

Some people are extremely creative, but don't really have a place to let it out.<br>They may like how they can easily get their violence out without it bein illegal.<br>Video games are like interactive books, you are the main character, you follow the plot, etc. And it may appeal to those who can't read, such as people with dyslexia.

All the things mentioned above really. Although when It comes to multiplayer games like MINECRAFT with thousands of communities, I think that people who feel lonly in their real life world might use Minecraft as a route of interacting with new people. It is much more easier to interact with people over a keyboard than in real life as any skeletons or baggage you have in your life, the person won't know of it because generally they just know your username<br><br>8. Am in the morning.<br>eat your heart out Dr.Phil..

To answer your questions:<br>We find computer games easier to do for a longer amount of time because it's physically less demanding than participating in a sport for a few hours. <br><br>Playing sport for a while requires you to move around and keep moving for a long time, which gets tiring no matter how fit you are.<br>&nbsp;Where as computer games require much less physicality as all you're doing is sitting in your chair concentrating on what's in front of you.

For me, it's the lack of fun things to do-- I live in the middle of nowhere..&nbsp;<br>I don't like to play other games too much because Minecraft is the most fun for me. You can change the environment however you please to help you succeed and the fighting is just addicting. The server involves lots of strategy and quick-thinking as well as good PvP and some creative thinking. As for other build servers and stuff, you can let out all of your creativity very easily, with a few clicks of the mouse, even. I usually play for 4 hours a day or so, but I really don't want to.. It's just the only thing that's easily obtainable and fun I can do c:

I do it because it's super fun and I love it, but also to distract me from the horrors and bad things in life. For a long time it was from the TV show "Lost"... That scared me so frickin much xD

Games can also be a great inexpensive way to train, learn, or just have fun in general. One of the worlds greatest Formula 1 drivers &nbsp;uses an interactive, virtual racing game to train. Just proves that gaming isn't so useless after all...
