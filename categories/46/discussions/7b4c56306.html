A lot of players miss the old Quintus, but I don't think it will go back to the old one, sorry.

I really didn't want the mapdevs to change throwback maps until Atlas came out. Some of these edits have thousands of complaints... Asked the past few Dust Devil matches if they liked the edits and I've gotten not one yes but lots of nos. We still have throwback, it's just being ruined at this point. If it's poorly recieved, not sure why we've kept it. We even have departments in the mapdev team now to edit the throwback maps, which destroy their purpose.<br><br>Petition to get the head mapdevs to wait until Atlas? :c

It's at the lake now?<br><br>You've seen Abandoned Park and Darkwater District, right? Maps with monuments above water are even more worse. Skybridge? No problem, jump right down. Waterfall? No problem, boat right up. Land? Tunnel right under it. The lake is the worst position for the map to have the monument at, maybe put it closer to spawn or something...

Past few days I've seen DTM01 more active than usual and DTM02 came up with some players. Throwback is usually the first in line, but it's fallen off. May be because of the edits, they're just not as fun.

You misunderstand, I created an island in the center with a castle at the top. If you wanted to fall onto the monument directly all you'd land on are blocks.<br><br>Just take a look at it, I made sure that the lake acted like a moat instead of 99% of the monument's whole area.

Throwback will be remove, and old maps will be edited. I wish, today quintus isn't the final version (and Dust Devils, and Rend.) and it will look like new Luar or something.

Why dont you just remove all the tb maps and just have a week every month or 2 or 3 where there is the tb rot. This would make them more special to play and would take people away from the bad gameplay since theyre played less often

No, the community should know the changed first and give opinions on the changed since they're the ones who play the maps. Not the other way around, until we finish all the edits..

Remove Dust Devils Entirely and, give 4 extra blocks of diamond to each team on Quintus and make the monuments closer to the iron, or just make an extra monument like Ternio. I think you'll have a lot less complaints after doing this c;.
