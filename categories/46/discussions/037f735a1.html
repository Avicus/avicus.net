So this is something that I will update as I play the map more but now I'll start it simple with what I experienced when I first played it (the review will be in bullet points also other points from people I asked in game)<br><br>- Theres a room you fall in that gives you a battle sword I believe? I dont know what activates it but around 4/5 TNT go off which make my laptop lag<br><br>- Others have noticed the (block) lag too, but this might be changed if its a one time thing<br><br>- Someone wanted me to point out a Sharp 3, Knockback 2 sword + a strength potion is too much<br><br>- I havent played fully but it looks like you can pre-kill people from the towers which isnt good I spose<br><br>- The way it set out confused me and other players: having chests in the corners and not being able to get to them (I dont know if that was the lag or not)<br><br>- People (including me) really like the look of it<br><br>Overall rating so far: 1/5
