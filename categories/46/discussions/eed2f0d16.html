This all depends on what game(s) you're playing. &nbsp;If it's MC only, I 'd recommend an AMD graphics card. &nbsp;If you play other games, NVIDIA is the best choice. &nbsp;The processor is good. &nbsp;The hard drive will take a while to boot up your computer, so if you can get an SSD, that would be best. &nbsp;Otherwise, it looks good to me. &nbsp;<br><br>Calling DoctaPop for further review &lt;3

I recommend an AMD graphics card, 1st they are better Than NVIDA (Most are) and second, They provide the BEST fps possible :)

You don't need an i7 for gaming, let alone one that is nearing 2 years old.

I have an i3 and it runs well, there is no point getting and i7 unless you want to have it run even better, but it's up to you.

You should spend less on your CPU.<br><br>If you want to have a good gaming PC you have to spend more on your GPU unless MC is the only game you play and will ever play.<br><br>How does this look?<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://pcpartpicker.com/user/poptyler945/saved/LdZ9TW">http://pcpartpicker.com/user/poptyler945/saved/LdZ9TW</a>

You really don't need an i7 for gaming. An i5 would be enough if you are not going to do massive editing (if you will edit you should also get 16GB RAM).<br><br>You also should get an SSD.

Sorry guys :P I have chosen an i7 purely because of the reliability, if i got an i5 i would have to upgrade within the next 2 year where as an i7 is more reliable and i will have to upgrade in 4 years and yes I will be doing a lot of editing

Just a minor note for after you finish the pc, get windows 7 instead of 8, its a minor note but will make a major difference while gaming, because it might not allow you to play certain games like generals zh

i7 is the better choice if you do rendering and etc<br><br>But if you only plan on upgrading in 4 years.. I don't think a 750ti will suffice.<br>The gtx 980/970 and 960 are around the corner, I would wait if I were you, since the gtx 960 will most likely be very close, if not beat a (performance-wise)&nbsp; gtx 770.<br><br>I'm waiting for the gtx 980 c;<br>And maybe if you went a spent a bit more, you could get a 970, which will most likely beat a 780.

I use a 2 year old bottom of the line, mobile i5 and I can still handle demanding games such as battlefield 3. A 4690K will suffice for 5 years at least.
