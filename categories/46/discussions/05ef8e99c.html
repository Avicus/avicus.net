Hello everyone! So for thanksgiving I got a new laptop and I've been telling everyone that, it works as a charm but there's one thing in Minecraft that feels weird. I go to Minecraft Servers, and I put new servers like avicus and etc. After I do that, I play a bit of Avicus and another server. Then I close Minecraft. I come back after ten minutes and its all gone. I put all the servers in again, then I go out of the Multiplayer list and come back after a while. Then its gone! And for one last time I put two important servers on my list, and later it somehow dissapeared. Can I please have some help on how to fix this because it is pretty annoying. Thanks!<br><br>PS: I am back on Forums again, and I'll try to be active. :D

Try deleting .minecraft, then moving your old .minecraft from your old computer

I don't think that will work so well because since I am not using my old computer, it is still good so my dad started using it and deleted everything I had and added his stuff... but atleast I found out I can put the avicus ip in the direct connect and still it will go.

This issue has happened to me, my server list would randomly empty out the servers. You might want to contact mojang about this if you haven't already reinstalled minecraft because I'm too lazy to.

I'm pretty sure that this is a glitch with Minecraft 1.7. Try using 1.8 (it's not as bad as people make it out to be.)

I'm always having this problem and I've never found a solution. All I can suggest is that you copy the servers file from .minecraft and paste onto your desktop. That way, whenever it deletes itself, you can replace the broken one with the one from your desktop.<br><br>I did however find this solution but it didn't work for me:&nbsp;<br>Rename servers.dat_tmp to servers.dat (remove the _tmp)
