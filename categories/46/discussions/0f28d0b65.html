I'm actually not going to say anything because I'm shit when it comes to pre-built. I have a couple of recommendations but all of them are WAYY over your budget.&nbsp;<br><br>If you could build it though, I'd be skipping so much of excitement the I would explode. PLEASE, PLEASE build it. I'm 12 and picked some of the most confusing parts and it took me 5 hours with an extremely complicated video. I can send you 1 good video and you can do it. Trust me, you will get MUCH better performance if you build it.

Yeah you're right, I don't know why I assumed he has a laptop. I'd go with a Radeon R9 390 and possibly a new power supply if it's needed.

Lmao, I thought he had a laptop too. Anyways I would still build it and I have a couple of questions before I get a build for you.<br><br>What type of games are you going to play in the future?<br><br>Where do you live? Country will do. Do you live near a Microcenter?<br><br>Do you need a monitor, keyboard, mouse or headset \headphones? If so, do you want high quality or just normal, and will the cost be seprate from the 1000$ budget you have or included?<br><br>Do you want a specific color scheme? If so, what color would you prefer?&nbsp;<br><br>Are you going to record and render a lot? If so, would you like to have ShadowPlay? Take note, Shadowplay is less good quality than other recording softwares such as OBS, but will make no difference in performance when recording. Take note, this will probably mean your overall performance might suffer.<br><br>Do you want a side window? And what kind of case would you like? (simple, gamer-y, a mix, etc) Would you like LEDs if you wish to have a side window?<br><br>Do you need a DVD drive?&nbsp;<br><br>Are you planning on doing some over clocking? Do some research on that if you want. It's basically increasing performance in trade of a little of your PC's life and some thermal performance.

Well here i is;<br><br><a href="http://pcpartpicker.com/user/SevoPC/saved/wWs2FT">http://pcpartpicker.com/user/SevoPC/saved/wWs2FT</a><br><br>Basically went with a good i5 (4690k).&nbsp;A 390 as well, as it's better than the 970 in every way and because you don't need ShadowPlay. Went with a Hyper 212 for at least a little room for over clocking as well as stock coolers are shit if you have a K CPU. Also a 1 TB WD HDD and a Samsung SSD with 250 GB on it. Went with the S340 case because it's beautiful and simple and really easy to work with for 70$, and also because it covers the PSU, which is semi modular 750 watts, which is overkill but it fit in the budget so yeah, and it will also make your cable management better. At the end it went 30$ over budget, which is fine I'm guessing.&nbsp;<br><br>If any of you would like to make changes tell me so I can make them, and explain why. I know I can give unbalanced builds sometimes so I would like to learn.

I still personally feel it's a little wasteful of your cash.<br>You have 8gb of good RAM sitting there.<br>You probably have a decent case that you can either use or salvage fans from.<br>If you're wanting it only gaming i would maybe get a new CPU as yours is a pretty old model.

That's like 200$ over your budget.&nbsp;<br><br>I was going to go with that CPU but it was difficult to do it with the 1k budget. The case is pretty bad but I can't argue on cases. It's &nbsp;just going to be harder to build, but whatever. I would change the GPU to a 390/390x because it's better than the 970 in every way, unless you changed your mind about ShadowPlay. Honestly it's a good build. I went almost exactly with that while choosing your parts at first (except for a different case and GPU) and then adjusted to your budget. Honestly if your okay with the budget go for it. I would still go with a better Case though by saving a bit on the motherboard, get some CableMod red and black cables for your Modular PSU and maybe some LED strips and you have a ballon looking PC.

The refunds of the 950 and psu will cover that I think, and I did tell him to get another case. The gpu wasn't my choice either.

390 without the X at the end, but if you can afford it then it's obviously better.
