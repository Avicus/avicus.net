Sorry to be so cold, but I think this has to be said.<br><br>1.8 sucks, people constantly tell them to put VBO on, or OptiFine, or even tell us to get a new PC...<br><br>Just stop it, 1.8 sucks, and all the bugs are back anyway.<br><br>And Kylo, you say 80% of Avicadians use 1.8. Well what about the other 20%? Do you want your 100% STAY 100% or 80% to be your NEW 100%?<br><br>Its just stupid, Im not telling you never update the server, just make it stay 1.7 and 1.8, and Kylo, you still say that we have alot of lag with 1.7 and 1.8, well 1.8 alone is doing MORE, so why not just 1.7 AND 1.8?<br><br>Everyone will be happy.<br><br>Until this happens or if I get a new 1000$ PC with an extremely strong graphics card, Im going to be leaving MC in general.&nbsp;<br><br>PS: If you see me ingame Im probably my cousin with an extremely good PC.

1.8 is lots less lagy due to the new chunk loading being re done by not loading underground when your above for example. Also optifine makes it even better! With all of this i have a AMD A8 APU 6410 with randeon R5 graphics for only £319 and i get around 30 fps on start up then up to 80-90 when warmed up!

When you get used to it, come back to avicus-most of the bugs will probably be gone. As for "what do I LOSE if I say this?" Eh, nothing but you don't really gain anything. Its a bit pointless :/ but I do agree with your reasons, I don't think that another thread should be made :p

Sevo, I understand you're upset, but this has more to do with the state of your computer. It's not really Kylo's fault. I have a good computer, and get over 100 FPS on 1.8. However, we can't switch back to 1.7 purely so that you can get decent FPS.

IMO, I do not like 1.8 personally not because it sucks but the new features werent as good compared to the other updates. The only things i like is probably Flags and Sime Blocks but what i really hate about 1/8 is the water now moves primed tnt so it breaks cannon pvp :/

Well, sorry to tell you this, but most servers were bound to change to 1.8 anyways, and if you can't cope with that, then I'm honestly surprised with how you can cope with changes in your life.<br><br>What I'm saying is change is normal. May not be good or bad, but change happening is inevitable.&nbsp;<br><br>Seriously, don't come on the forums to complain about an FPS problem. Problems don't go away by complaining. You'll have to fix the problem yourself or learn to live with it.&nbsp;<br><br>And, before you come here to start saying Kylo did a bad job, you have to remember that we have opinions too. We know 1.8 is laggy and the update is buggy, but we're not super humans. We simply just learn to lie with it and take satisfaction out of what we DO receive.&nbsp;<br><br>Also, the amount of "1.8 sucks" threads have gotten out of hand. You're only dragging the community down with threads like this, as they have no benefit to the forums whatsoever.&nbsp;<br><br>And sure, 1.8 may suck, but take what doesn't suck from it and use that instead.&nbsp;<br><br>Honestly.

I want to point out that the idea that everyone having 1.8 on the server now would make it so that 1.7 block hitters would have more trouble doing what they do, which somewhat would even out the pvp style in a way where they would also hate it.

for you. You have 25ms on AU Kohi and 18cps so even if on NA servers, you have great reach anyways. PvP in 1.8 is a THOUSAND times easier when you constantly outreach people tbh. You gain 1/4 of a block reach if you get first hit. You lose a lot of reach if you don't. &nbsp;<br><br>So no crap 1.8 pvp is easy for you

It's subjective, we just needed to decide when to pull the trigger.&nbsp;We determined 20% was fair, considering so many servers&nbsp;have already switched or accept 1.8. Thanks to the update too, we have better server performance, decreasing costs and increasing the quality of gameplay. Overall, this should help boost player count.

The server should be taking the feedback on the new update. Most people really don't like it (assuming from all the posts I've read). I think it was a major mistake to force people to use 1.8. I don't dislike the people that are enjoying playing on 1.8. But I think it would be better if it could be played on 1.7 and 1.8. That is possible, there are servers that do that.
