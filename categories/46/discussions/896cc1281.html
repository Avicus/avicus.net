Where to begin?&nbsp; The weight of my keys is heavier today, and I know it is not only for the tears that have fallen when first I discovered what was to be.&nbsp; It is the weight of memory that burdens me, leaving my fingers weak and cowardly, too shy to pluck their final keys, to strike some final harmony in this discord.<br><br>Friends–for I know after all these years, no matter&nbsp;who you are, this is how I should call you–it is time.&nbsp; I will not miss you.&nbsp; I know from my long time here that this, to me, was special.&nbsp; A formative moment in my growth from a young and supple boy to and older and less supple man.&nbsp; I will not miss you for I refuse to leave you behind.&nbsp; I will find ways to keep you in my thoughts and my life, or at the very least, in my prayers.<br><br>Avicus awakened me to my Faith, in a way only a Minecraft server could.&nbsp; I, like many of you, was greeted by the many Fathers and Pastors who play block games in His name.&nbsp; Through them I came to understand God, his Son, and the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; It was His words that first called to me...that gave me my calling.<br><br>"Win tournaments," said He.&nbsp; "Win in my Name, so that it may be yours, as well.&nbsp; I am the rock on which the world stands, the block which builds the smallest and the greatest in this world.&nbsp; Build with my power, that all may see.&nbsp; Shun those who would say unto you, "Hacker."&nbsp; Those of my ilk will see in your deeds no such deception, nor anything less than the greatest of miracles."<br><br>I did as He said.&nbsp; I played in the first Avicus tournament and won each and every one since the beginning.&nbsp; My teammates did not matter when it came to victory–that was assured by He who rules over us all.&nbsp; And yet I knew my time would end–as now this server ends–and so I took on 12 to follow.&nbsp; Those 12 have learned and now they stand as high as any other in this world. Peace be unto them.&nbsp;<br><br>I digress.&nbsp; I stall and I talk, but words are no stopgap to fate.&nbsp; I have won and believed, and that is the greatest victory.&nbsp; Even then, I stand here amidst the ruins–a Caesar outliving Rome.&nbsp; Let not the rubble fall and crush what you have come to be.&nbsp; Run forward and do not look back.&nbsp; We were born together in this crucible of faith and block interaction.&nbsp; From here it is to us, to spread the Word of God.&nbsp; To all that will hear, sing:<br><br>There once had been a server by the name of Avicus,<br>And all the people loved it, although something was amiss<br>The money had stopped flowing and the servers couldn't hold,<br>The time was past for action, be it clever, slick, or bold.<br><br>The server then was closing and the people gathered 'round,<br>Amidst them in their memories some happiness was found,<br>The sadness turned to anger and then finally to peace,<br>The server might be closing, but their friendship would not cease.<br><br>They started then with other things, their passions and their skills,<br>They had their shares of happiness, of peace, and love, and thrill.<br>And one day in the future which is never too far off,<br>They came together once again, and beat eachother off.<br><br>And so, this day, and every day, I wish you all the same:&nbsp;<br>A merry, merry Christmas in our favorite sand-box game.<br><br>Thank you, but never goodbye...<br>Cratain
