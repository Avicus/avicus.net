that's not the "Devs" I meant. Learn the difference. Ivy has to code the tourney plugin and that's not on his priority right now, plus he's busy will school.

As much as I love your optimism, this is unlikely. It will take a while to make a solid plugin and maps. I would rather this take a very long time and be high quality, then to have it be rushed and terrible quality. I have spoken to members of the committee and that is that they are planning to do.&nbsp;<br><br>Quality, Lengthy Release &gt;Terrible, Fast Release

There has been WAY too many threads about this, it's not that difficult to make an unofficial tourney, you just need a good server and someone with experience, and you can get some nebula's map by asking the map makers.<br>btw...the official tourney is "coming", but I don't know if it is close or far

It just feels like you are poking the player base with a stick that you add a team section to the forums. When avicore came out a manager was talking about a tourny(I could be wrong on the rank). The community is getting tired and soon you might loose them to OCN's tourneys

There are lots of unofficial teams, even before a tournament committee was ever established, not having a teams sub-forum would make organization difficult.<br><br>Also, while a tournament isn't exactly guaranteed, there's been a lot of planning going into it.<br><br>When the new website comes (hopefully soon), teams can be officially formed and their stats tracked.
