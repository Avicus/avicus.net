Ok, lately my hdd has had some issues. After a few hours running it would start making this screechy noise that would go on for a couple of seconds.<br><br>Today i come back from school, boot up my pc, and I get a popup from windows saying that the hard drive is broken and I should immediately make a backup. Anyway, haven't made the backup yet 'cause windows is stupid and it keeps failing on doing it.<br><br>Did some research and downloaded this tool to see my HDD's health, here's what I got (I am running a laptop btw, should be updating to a Desktop soon):<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://i.gyazo.com/32392144a965de13c73566ab2089a1bd.png">http://i.gyazo.com/32392144a965de13c73566ab2089a1bd.png</a><br>I don't care about losing anything because I don't have any importand files that I will lose. My games and all are in my steam library, so I've got nothing to worry about.&nbsp;<br>What I am worried about is, my mother works on this computer (She makes digital albums). And I dont want her to lose all her work, and we're not in the best economic situation at the moment.<br>Any help on what I should do? I will ofc take it to someone to repair it, but the backup keeps failing, no idea why (Using a USB for it).

Oh and I dont know if this is related to the harddrive, but lately my computer keeps freezing completely for about 3 minutes, and makes a VERY LOUD buzzing noise from my headphones/speakers (Depends on what Im using at that very moment).

Dats y u buy an SSD kids!<br><br>But... Tbh idk how to replace an HDD, all i know is how to install an SSD without the HDD put in... But i recommend finding a good Hardrive for your PC (Try too) And look at some tutorials on how to replace it.... And to make a backup i think you can get another hardrive (external) and put all the files into it, although i dont think it will save all the system32 (cuz u needz it)<br><br>Again idk really what to do, try? looking some tutorials up on how to fix it, (Or helpful videos) :)<br><br>Maybe this will help?&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf7C34MaMLs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf7C34MaMLs</a>

Thats because I quit minecraft.<br>And trust me, you dont need a good pc to get 60 fps in minecraft. It's that I &nbsp;recorded on small window 480p with region selection mode. You literally get no frame loss if you use these settings, and for the 480p thing I just later converted to 720p in sony vegas.<br><br>This laptop runs CS:GO with 20-30 fps on 4:3 stretched 800x600 which are RIDICULOUSLY LOW SETTINGS<br><br>so yes this sucks kthx.
