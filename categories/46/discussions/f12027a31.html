I literally have never heard of this until a few days ago when it came out. After doing some research, it actually looks really cool. Whenever I would play games, I would always think of ways it could be improved and what I would include in a game if I made it. Destiny is basically this game for me.<br><br>So I was wondering, because I am still pretty misinformed about it, could anyone give me some recommendations on whether to get it, if you enjoyed it, what you like and what you dislike about it?&nbsp;<br><br>I don't want to hear anything about a rip-off of Halo or any other game. I've never played Halo so I don't care. The only one I've played CoD and I can safely say it does not compare.&nbsp;<br><br>And I swear to god if anyone tells me to get a ps4, xbox 360, or xbone, I will track you down and kill your favourite pet.

I played the beta and it was awesome.&nbsp;<br><br>I recommend that you get it. 10/10&nbsp;<br><br>Chose a Titan for armored person, Warlock for magic dude, or assassin or whatever for sneaky stealth dude.

Rip off of halo?<br>It was made by Bungie and Activision (Bungie was the company that made halo 1 - 3. It also made reach, but 343 also took part in it.)<br>TBH, it looks like Halo, Cod, mass effect and warframe put together.
