It's been a while since I've played on Avicus, but I know lots of you are great with computers. (way better then me anyways heh)<br>With my 2 month old laptop I was getting an average of 150-200 fps (yes I'm aware your eyes can only process 60 and of screen refresh rates and such).<br>Ever since windows 10, minecraft has dropped to a whopping 30 fps max. I'm not the only one with these problems, and what ever "fixes" I try are temporary. I tried to fall back to windows 8 and old nvidia drivers, but to no avail.&nbsp;<br><br>Laptop info (actually found it through a form on here, overall I'm happy with it)<br><br><span class="a-list-item" style=" color: rgb(17, 17, 17);">15.6-Inch FHD Display (1920x1080). NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960M 2G GDDR5 Discrete Graphics.</span><br><span class="a-list-item" style=" color: rgb(17, 17, 17);">Intel Core i7-4720HQ 2.6 GHz (turbo to 3.6GHz). 16 GB RAM</span><br><span class="a-list-item" style=" color: rgb(17, 17, 17);">1 TB 7200 RPM Hard Drive</span><br><span class="a-list-item" style=" color: rgb(17, 17, 17);"><br>Not sure what else you need to here's the link.&nbsp;<br></span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00T7XRH2A?psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00" title="Link: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00T7XRH2A?psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00T7XRH2A?psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00</a><br><br><u></u>I realize I might have to wait it out, since windows 10 in brand new, but just thought I'd ask.<br>Sorry if the link doesn't work, just let me know.<br>Thanks in advance guys!

Yeah, I'm not the only one though, so it's most likely Microsoft and their issues, maybe someone has an answer!

I have Windows 10 and a Nvidia card, but I didn't experience these issues.

I wonder if it's something I'm doing? I've checked everything I know to check, I have read plenty of info on the nvidia website, as well as other forms. I guess it could be a actual problem with my computer, but fps was fine before windows 10.

Do you mean the new windows 10 drivers on their home page? That's what I did and it only worked once. The next time I went to play, back to 30 fps :/

Minecraft is getting a "Windows 10" version in the future, that will probably fix the issue. In the mean time, I recommend getting windows 7 if your looking to get one.

Isn't the Minecraft windows 10 separate from the desktop version? I tried it and it seemed like the xbox version but on pc. Also my laptop was orginaly windows 8, so I'm not sure I can fall back to 7.

Yeah it is, but your fps will get better with that probably. Anyways, all you need to do is go to your local Best Buy and buy windows 7. You will be a given a disk, that you will put in your optical drive (keep note that once you put this disk in, you cant put anything else in) and a code you have to put in.

Please don't say our eyes can't process more than 60 FPS, there's a reason 144Hz monitors exist, at least you didn't say 24 FPS.<br><br>Anyway, I also have an Nvidia GPU and it's working perfectly fine with the latest drivers. Make sure you're using the latest version of Java or wait until new drivers are released.<br><br>If you really want to go back to Windows 8, download an ISO from Microsoft and use the key that came with your laptop to activate it.

You could look at your settings within Minecraft, too. Maybe consider Optifine? Or look on YouTube how to boost your fps, there are plenty of videos on the matter.

I dont recommend you to downgrade your version of windows. Why? Because most of your things will be deleted. Im going to put an example. Imagine that you are playing a 1.8 map, but you decide to play it in 1.7, what happen? Yes, all the blocks that there arent on 1.7 will be deleted, because they arent compatible. So that will happen to you if you have win10 and downgrade it to win7. The best option is to borrow all your things and then install win7.

What minecraft version are you playing on ? make sure to have the latest java version.<br>I would install a program called msi afterburner to maybe check your temps. If your gpu or cpu are running to hot the will throttle themselves. In that case get a can of compressed air and blow into the fanslot.

I'm using optfine, and it's not really a minecrfat problem, it's either a windows or nvidia problem as far as I can tell. My settings aren't set to max, or best performance either. Somewhere in the middle that's usually quite comfy.

I bevel &nbsp;I have the latest java version, I'll be sure to check. In terms of my laptop temp, I have a cooling pad with a pretty strong fan, and when it's running I can't feel any heat.

Sorry :p I was never one to buy into the "you can only see 60!!!" but I didn't want to mention 100+ frames and have some tell me it didn't matter,

I downgraded back to windows 8 and everything was fine. However it didn't fix my problem. I'm not really interested in downgrading any further, I'd like to find a fix on either 8, or preferably 10. It seems the only thing to do is wait for new drivers :/ I know I'm not the only one with problems, forms are blowing up all over the place. You should see the GeForce page :p

Just saying that Minecraft has it's own version of Java in the latest launchers, you don't need a separate installation of Java to run it.
