Hi, I am buying a new laptop and have encountered a problem... I have no knowledge on graphics cards.<br>I was wondering what graphics card would be the best to play Minecraft out of these: AMD Radeon R7 M260 2GB Dedicated graphics memory or Intel Iris Graphics 5100.<br>If you have any idea please leave me a reply, it will be much appreciated.<br>From, 2002simi.

I would go for the&nbsp;Intel Iris Graphics 5100, but that's just a personal opinion.

Let this speak for itself.&nbsp;<br><br>AMD-&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.game-debate.com/hardware/?gid=2293&amp;graphics=Radeon%20R7%20M260">http://www.game-debate.com/hardware/?gid=2293&amp;graphics=Radeon%20R7%20M260</a><br><br>Intel-&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.game-debate.com/hardware/?gid=1782&amp;graphics=Iris%20Graphics%205100%20Mobile">http://www.game-debate.com/hardware/?gid=1782&amp;graphics=Iris%20Graphics%205100%20Mobile</a><br><br>Keep in mine that the Iris 5100 is integrated into a haswell processor, meaning it's just an integrated graphics card.&nbsp;I would definitely buy &nbsp;the AMD R7 260m here.<br><br>@Atdit, do some research before just assuming intel is better, it makes you look pretty daft when you don't.

AMD..... intergrated gpu's are crap. I once had a laptop with integrated gpu... About after a year of having a smooth minecraft experience, it started to get jittery and laggy. The laptop now never gets more than 25 fps in minecraft. So go for the AMD gpu

Well always go for an intel there catches are amazing for minecraft dont go for an AMD ive got one and i dont get the best fps despite i do get 60 fps. If you can go for a intel I5 and if u have the money go for a intel I7 there are amazing and if you are minted go for the intel xeon (top of the range) and if you can get a graphics card with a high L3 Catch they are good, so get some with a high ghz catches and lots of them!

That information is almost completely irrelevant in corelation to OP's question. Also, try not to genralize, it just makes you seem unintelligent.

I would recommend the R7 260m.<br><br>Definitely better performance then the Intel Iris 5100.

For those who dont clearly know what integrated graphics are:<br><br>It is built into the motherboard, and shares the resources with the rest of the computer, so you cant dedicate a certain amount of memory to it... However with a "Dedicated" graphics card, depending on what the Manufacturer set it to, it can be 1GB, 2GB, 3GB (AMD Radeon, etc.) 4GB (EVGA GeForce GTX 970 (+)) 6GB, a TITAN Z. And it can go on.<br><br>I highly recommend buying a "Dedicated GPU" that is actually going to use "Private" resources so to speak, or RAM to actually do its job.&nbsp;<br><br>OP:&nbsp;<br>For Laptops, AMD graphics, +1000. AMD has all sorts of products for PC's (GPU, CPU, And I think they sell motherboards?) so they probably have more knowledge on how to properly build in graphics in the motherboard (If you're looking for that), at the same time, make GPUs for laptops and several other Formats of computers.... yea.<br><br>Again, not a computer guy, I screwed a TON up in this post, But I did try my best to give you useful information :)
