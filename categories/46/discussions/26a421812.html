So recently I joined an Avicus clan to play in the upcoming tourney. I have been seeing in chat people raging and forcing others to relog. Its causing spam in chat of &nbsp;&lt;Player&gt; relog please. Or "YOUR INVISIBLE." What are your opinions? Is this a nuisance? Should players get punished for repeatly spamming in chat Relog? I got kicked for abusing glitches in which I can't help my self. So what are your opinions on this topic? Should player get punished for spamming consistantly after report the player for being invisible?

Considering you already reported the player and continued to spam relog. And no its not. You can't help being invisible.

Well since Kylo said he could see players that were apparently "invisible" means that the person that can't see the other player should relog (Yeah pretty confusing but that's it). So, with this said, I think punishments for spamming "Relog!" or "You're invis!" in chat should be made from now on as this is useless because new players don't get this and it's the playing spamming's fault because he's the one that should really relog.<br><br><br><br>Off Topic: Please Devs, forget about the other glitches for a couple of days and focus on this one, I know it's hard but try! c:

You can't force someone to relog. They have to do it their selves. Good thing I didn't spam relog in chat...

It's a glitch. And when someone is invisible and is abusing the glitch it can piss him/her off. But if a player is spamming with caps and harassing the other player to relog. Then it seems legit to punish him/her. If they don't relog they will be kicked for abusing a glitch simple as that :)

Imo, if you're spamming and constantly telling them to relog, you deserve to be kicked for spamming, if you just say it once or twice and they don't listen, they should be kicked for "Removing Glitch" instead of "Abusing Glitches".

If you're spamming it, definitely, but if you just mention once "dude you need to relog, you're invisible" can actually stop the person from unintentionally abusing the invis glitch.<br><br>i saw a guy today break a monument while invisible, even after a couple ppl had explained to him what was happening and why he needed to relog, and imo abusing that glitch is worse than having people say to relog.
