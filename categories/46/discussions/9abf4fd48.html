Hello everyone!<br><br>Today, I would like to discuss with you all about Pocket Edition.<br>As most of you know, Pocket Edition has released the "Multiplayer" button.&nbsp;<br><br>I thought "could I play on Avicus using Pocket Edition?"<br>I attempted to do so, until I came across with this problem.<br>It asked for "Server's Name","Server's IP address", and "Port."<br><br>I am familiar with the first two slots, but not with the port.<br>Therefore, I would like to ask you all two questions:<br><br>1. Is Avicus compatible with Pocket Edition?<br>2. If so, what is the port number? Or hoe can I find the port number?<br><br>I would really appreciate if someone can answer these questions.<br>Thank you so much for reading this.<br>I will see you guys in game.<br>Bye!

Avicus probably isn't with pocket edition.<br>And pls no. There are 6-10 year olds using pocket edition too.&nbsp;<br>I'm sure their parents don't want to hear "KYS YOU NIGGER FAGGOT" in chat lmao

I normally would love new players to come along and join us... but I'm afraid that I have to agree with Vlad here...<br><br>They aren't as mature as you, Ateh... :/

Yeah they are two completely versions of Minecraft. Although you can play PE with the Windows 10 version of Minecraft, there really isn't any gain for Avicus if it adds a server there.

We don't support MCPE currently, but that is not to say we never will.<br><br>It's pretty neat, but definitely would need more work. Fun to try things out :D<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Jig25JI.png" title="Image: http://i.imgur.com/Jig25JI.png">

They're still working on it. Hopefully it'll get fixed soon though!<br><br>@OP: I don't think Pocket Edition would be that good as it'd be hard to PvP players using computers, unless the Pocket Edition players only fought against other Pocket Edition players [if you know what I mean].
