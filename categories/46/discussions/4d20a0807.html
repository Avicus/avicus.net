Hey guys!<br><br>I just got a PS4 a little over a year ago, and Iv'e realized, I have been playing a lot of mc, and not some of the PS4 games! I was wondering if you guys have any fun game suggestions! By the way, I don't like COD, but I do like other games with shooting involved! I mainly enjoy strategy and action games! Thanks for the help!&nbsp;<br><br>Peace!<br><br>-C_P<br><br>p.s: Is Far Cry 4 any good, i hear a lot of people talking about it at my school! ._.

Get GTA V, Far Cry 4, or Destiny.<br><br>Personally, I don't have a PS4. However, I have all the previous consoles. :P If you want any game suggestions for the PS1, PS2, or PS3, come and ask me.

The Last Of Us was one of the best games of 2013.<br>It has a brilliant story-line and is on the next-gen consoles.

Ok.<br><br>I have a PS4, so here we go:<br><br>1. A great game that I started with was The Last Of Us. If you like shooting games that are slow paced but with tons of action, buy it. I recommend it a lot. The multiplayer is great, and it plays at 60fps, which is huge.<br><br>2. Another game I am currently playing a lot is Watch Dogs. It is a lot different to any other game around, but is really fun and has a great campaign while also blending decent multiplayer features. There is a lot to do on Watch Dogs - it is a great rival to GTA.<br><br>3. There is a free to play shooting game called Blacklight: Retribution which is a multiplayer - only game that is great. Basically, you get the game for free, but if you wish to buy any gun upgrades or armor upgrades, you must pay at a small cost. However, I have a great loadout on that game that I only spent £3.99 on, which is great instead of paying £40 quid+ for the game with free upgrades. It's really fun, and the multiplayer is great, but it is also challenging.<br><br><br>I also recommend that you get The Crew, COD Advanced Warfare, Far Cry 4 and Assassins Creed: Unity as they all look great and would make good Xmas presents.<br><br><br>BiZa :)
