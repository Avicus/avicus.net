<b>This is my first discussion, so sorry if it is a bit strange or vague, but I thought maybe that there should be a map on The Walls where you start with absolutely nothing, just like single-player Survival. I think it should be like the Hunger Games, where there are 2 teams - The Tributes and the Careers. You have to go underground to get resources, and there are animals overground to kill for food. You can make farms and the whole thing last half an hour, and it is TDM. The team with the most kills obviously wins. You can include diamonds and iron, and everything you may want to be stronger. Opinions on this?</b>

True - I suppose in the 1.8 update we could add it then and put slime blocks underground.

I think this would cause a large amount of team spleefing, and raging. I also think a lot of people would play the map once or twice, get bored, therefore the map taking up space and being a wasted build. Also, it defeats the aspect of Nebula, being killing people and levelling up; not collecting resources. <br><br>Personally however, I think this is a great idea and would be something<b> I</b> would enjoy. Maybe this could be a new mini-game, or they could develop a new style of walls maps (cause your idea sounds like Walls, just with a nebula map instead).

Okay, will consider using this in The Walls.

Well this&nbsp;<b><u>could</u></b><u></u> be another gamemode,however,I don't think that kind of play style fits in Nebula,plus,these days there are a few maps like this,where you start of with leather armor and all the other stuff you get normally,you have to opinion to mine ores to get better gear or you could go straight with the bashing and kill some people...

It would certainly be a very cool twist, to walls maps!
