Ok so I am going to buy a new gaming PC, and I am going to spend at the maximum $800 preferably less, so I was wondering if you guys know any good gaming PCs in that price range.

If you can save up, you should get a Mac.<br>A lot of people think they're really bad for gaming, but they're actually very nice and beefy.<br>PRICE: About $1200...

Best option is to build your own, and there are plenty of $800 builds out there.

Pre-built or custom?<br>At that price range you won't get pre-built gaming computers. That's not to say you cannot game with these computers but they are not built specifically with gaming in mind.&nbsp;<br>Also, what is your $? US?

I recommend you build your own computer. Macs are just too expensive for your price range, and pre-built machines won't get the best performance for your price range.<br><br>I'm not an expert if building computers myself, though, so ask someone else to help you ;)

I would say build your own. There is lots of $800 builds and besides building your own is a lot cheaper.

Get something around the more expensive zone. If you look to spend cheaper look for the 8 Gb ram and a decent hard drive space. And SSD ( solid state drive) would help alot according to jkawesome :D

Are you planning to record or just play minecraft? Ram is necessary. You may be running skype, minecraft, browser, and some music at the same time so ram would be needed. Hard drives need to have a good amount of space.<br><br>Asus and acer make good gaming pc. If you are looking to buy a cheap one that is good wait for awhile till christmas or boxing day for discounts. It would save you money.

Macs can handle games like Minecraft but if you plan on something more like COD (just an example) those games don't even support OS X or whatever Apple calls it.<br><br>But for 800$ you should be able to get a decent build. However you don't buy a computer. Most computers you see that are already built in shops and such are just a ripoff. They will turn the price very high and you don't get what you pay for.

And you don't need more than 8GB RAM if you are not doing massive editing, rendering and animating.&nbsp;<br><br>Another note. Get an SSD.<br><br>@ViolentBoo: Do you really need an optical drive? Since you will do everything through USB even install windows, which you don't need to buy. You could get it (not illegal way) for free. One person that does this is diamond22 (skype: dweller12_). Also no SSD. That build could be improved. Once again diamond22 can get you an improved one.

Two reasons why I will always include a DVD drive:<br><br>1. You never know when you'll need a CD. Maybe for your LAN Drivers for your motherboard and there's no other way to connect to the internet without those drivers. And the occasional time to watch a DVD.<br><br>2. It costs 14 dollars. T_T

If you're playing only or mostly Minecraft, I would recommend <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16883258020">this</a> pre-built computer for $670. It's the best pre-built computer for the price :D<br>I always average above 60 FPS with almost-max settings, which is really all you need. So, if you want an easy computer built for Minecraft, there ya go :3

Whats your monitors refresh rate? If its 60 its 60FPS etc. I doubt you see a difference above 120 FPS as well and the highers frame rate on a monitor I have seen is 144 which is not far away from 110 so you cant just "see lag"<br><br>And for that price it should handle it 120+ fine. Or something is not working as it should or you got ripped off

"Lots of ram" - For gaming overall you don't need more than 8 GB. If you won't render, animate etc. its pointless. Also allocating more RAM to Minecraft does NOT help it run better. Keep it on the default it has.<br><br>"Good graphics card" - Can't disagree<br><br>"Good cooling system" - Usually the stock CPU fan is enough to cover it unless you do rendering etc.. 6 cooling fans and 3 exhaust fans (as how you said it) is overkill and useless.<br><br>"Lots of slots for USB's, Jacks etc." - Depending what you will use it for. I don't see why you would need multiple 3.5mm in and out jacks. One mic &amp; speaker on the back and one in front is enough unless you are going to work on music production a lot but in that case you might want a sound card. USB slots is just how many you need pretty much and even later you can buy a splitter (or whatever its called)

Whats your monitors refresh rate? If its 60 its 60FPS etc. I doubt you see a difference above 120 FPS as well and the highers frame rate on a monitor I have seen is 144 which is not far away from 110 so you cant just "see lag"<br><br>And for that price it should handle it 120+ fine. Or something is not working as it should or you got ripped off

WTH! Shaders doesnt need forge Omfg...<br>Btw 110 fps is laggy, but people dont fcking realize if you get 110 fps, turn VSync on God dammit, When you have VSync its stable fps when its not activated FPS jumps around and it looks laggy like Wth people...

@AtditC - As far as I know shaders do not require Forge.<br><br>@vslesh101 - Sometimes turning VSync off is a better idea than having it on. It kind of just depends on your setup. It depends on what FPS you are getting and on your monitor refresh rate. If you get 30 FPS with a 60hz monitor VSync might not be a good idea for you because it wont really make it stable.
