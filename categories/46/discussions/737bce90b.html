Nebula Player Sizes Adjustment

</h1>
Avicus usually only has 1 or 2 servers running, and often only one of these is full. When a match cycles to a map with a smaller map size many players end up not being able to play, because the other server isn't full/online, and their friends are in the current server.<br><br>I was thinking maybe some team sizes could be adjusted or maps grouped so their player sizes are more uniform. Or, just remove the smaller maps and make Nebula have only maps with a large player count. Currently Nebula's map's player sizer fluctuate a bit, so if it were OCN it would sort of be like changing to a Capture-style server, where all the maps have 64 player size.<br><br>For me, if I can't join within a few minutes I'll usually just leave.<br><br>If there were more servers the answer to this question would just be 'find another server' but when Avicus really has only 1 full server running at a time this issue can be a huge turn off to non-donors.

I agree, I've waited up to 15-20 minutes waiting for a chance to play. So +1

Some parents don't allow their children to buy ranks. Or they simply can't afford them.<br><br>OP: Despite being a donor myself, I totally agree with this. It can drive people away from the server in some circumstances. +1

I understand your point but, that is what ranks are for. If we lose another perk, whats the point of donation ranks anymore?

The perk isn't going to be entirely useless. This thread is about increasing the team sizes, not removing the team limit completely.

I think one solution to this problem would be to set the rots so the maps with the least slots are first, and the one that can have the most people last, making sure each map has more slots available then the last.

Donors can't join full games sometimes due to the new "Team Limit"

I agree and see how annoying it must be when only one game is going and it is full, but at the same time Senex 1 will never house 64 people.&nbsp;<br><br>Perhaps we could just make more littler maps, so instead of 1 server going with 40 peeps and a 30 limit, we could maybe have 2 20 player servers going?

This might work, althought it might be chaos when the server restarts

2 20 players servers might be a good idea too, althought that would require new rots as well because some big maps aren't enjoyable with just 20 players.<br><br>Ideally I was thinking Avicus would have a slight shuffling of rots, move some outlier maps in terms of team sizes around, and test slightly increased team sizes on some maps. Just refine the rots a bit more while keeping this issue in mind.

Rilo what you were saying about the perks of having a rank is not quite right. You still get a premium suite on teamspeak, a prefix before your name, extra perks, etc. and you have to agree that the maps are always full with no room to house any more players.

Ternio especially, sometimes full to the point where not even donors can join.

As much as I have a rank and don't care about skrubs who cant join :P, I do feel that we need to add more player spots because as almost everyone has said, if people can't join, they will leave and play OCN like smelly poopers -.-
