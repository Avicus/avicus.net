HEY GUYS!!!!!<br><br>Recently we have had a big breakthrough in making competitive Minecraft a legit thing! Many of you who are active on the OCN forums may already know about this, but this subreddit is focused on making the competitive side of Minecraft PvP easily accessible to more players. It lists events that are taking place on dozens of servers around the world, and just how you can participate in them. Avicus may not have shown its own competitive side yet, but they are very welcome to start with the collaboration of these other servers. Avi mods and coordinators, I advise you to reach out to the leaders of this subreddit and leaders of other servers to start up. It may help Avicus gain a larger player base!<br><br>I do not take credit for this in any way, but it is my duty as a competitive Minecraft player to spread this message to any and all who would be interested! I hope to see many of you active on the forums and in game!<br><br><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveMinecraft/" rel="nofollow" title="Link: http://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveMinecraft/">/r/CompetitiveMinecraft</a><br><br>Cratain's OCN <a href="https://oc.tc/forums/topics/5529f0695f35b923270038e1" rel="nofollow" title="Link: https://oc.tc/forums/topics/5529f0695f35b923270038e1">Forum Post</a><br><br>Please guys, take this time to actually support something that could be big. I may not be a popular user on here, but I am trying to help. It takes seconds to upvote or comment, and you may find some very interesting gamemodes to try out.&nbsp;<br><br>Also! Spread this to as many people as you can! So many people who play Minecraft have no idea that Minecraft PvP even exists. It is your duty to let them know!<br><br>Thanks!

Ok, seriously guys. 43 people have looked at this and only one decided to say anything? I'm trying to help expand Avicus' horizons and kickstart the competitive play style to make Avicus great again! It takes seconds to respond, and even less to click the link and browse the subreddit.

Don't you mean competitive Minecraft PvP instead of just competitive Minecraft?

Well, yes, however I felt it was clear enough. Also, I didn't make the subreddit, so I can't change the title.

Are you serious?<br><br>If you're serious about what you just said, that is honestly the most immature comment that I have read all year.<br>If you're not serious, take the jokes somewhere else please.

<p>My respect for you has just decreased. Just because it's made by another server doesn't mean you trash on it like that. Also the post was not just for OCN it's for other servers as well, it was trying to expand the PVP community.</p><p>Regarding your comment as a whole it was very rude and immature.</p>

Higger sorry about what I posted last night. Reading it over in my head it sounded fine, but after reading it this morning and hearing how rude it sounded, I just want to apologize. At the time it seemed fine, but it really wasn't. I was being way too quick to judge, and whether or not I do enjoy other servers like OCN, I was being really rude. I hope no one was hurt or affected negetively by my comment, and once again I'm sorry for writing what I did. I feel that the way I disrespected you, I disrespected the whole community.

Thanks for apologizing. It's fine. Just a little fed up with the pessimism that this brought from other players on other forums.

Excellent, however it's not only a resource for the event committee, but for anyone who likes Minecraft PvP and is willing to devote time to it.

Yes! It will bring much needed publicity to Avicus. You and the other event coordinators should compose a post about it.<br><br>EDIT: Post it before registration opens to allow any new players to participate.
