I'm posting this here as I don't know any other good, online forums that have a clue about tech related stuff and although I've been gone for ages I still trust your advice.<br><br>Specs:<br>Quad-Core i5-2400 @ 3.1Ghz&nbsp;<br>8gb ddr3 1300Mhz ram<br>250GB 7200RPM HDD<br>GTX 750ti&nbsp;<br>(unsure of other parts as I'm buying it used online)<br><br>So what I am doing is buying and old Lenovo M81 (for 350 AUD) and adding a GTX 750ti, I chose this card as it is small, quiet and low power consumption. I need this as the case isn't that big, I'm unsure of the wattage and isn't cooled great (but is still good value as the equivalent parts would cost me about 500 AUD). Would this be any good for GTA V, MKX, TF2, FO:4 and MC? I'm not used to great performance (lowest settings 30 fps on MC for 2-3 years :P) but I would enjoy playing med-hi on GTAV and MKX. I'm excited for fallout 4 but unsure about specs and MC/TF2 are very low requirement games.

You should list your budget. People these days come up with insane builds.

That's a pretty good deal, the GTX 750Ti can definitely handle MC and TF2. GTA V and MKX might be a little harder to run and you might have to turn some settings down, but not by a lot (Med-High). There isn't any official information on Fallout 4's system requirements but your PC should be able to handle it at playable framerate.<br><br>I don't know how much money you can spend, but if you can buy a slightly better card, it will be better for the future. Your CPU is still very relevant and can definitely handle a faster card.<br><br>Whatever you decide to do, just make sure your power supply is enough and you should be good.
