Avicus has to pay servers with a lot of power, because their plugins were inefficient (this is what I was told quite a while ago, whilst Avicus were using Avicore). If Avicus had developers who understood how to make applications more efficient, they could downgrade their servers.

If Avicus wanted to make very efficient plugins, they would need very good developers who would need to be employed. Even if the server downgraded with more efficient plugins, most or even more of the saved money will need to be used to pay the new developers.

I agree. Although, even if the server plugins were to become more efficient, the potentially lowered cost server and the cost of advertising would still be substantial and so premium badges etc need to be added for an incentive for people to donate.

I believe charging for stat resets aren't uncommon.<br><br>And having exclusive badges isn't really something a lot of people care about tbh. Considering the value of badges has never been..well high.<br><br>Honestly, this is a good move for Avicus financially, because it's such a small server, innovations need to be created in order to keep the server afloat.<br><br>And if you don't like stat resets or badges, don't buy them. Simple.<br>You're not being forced to do anything.

If we had such inefficiencies in our plugins we would be quick to fix them, you have that wrong. I'm sure there are small things to be improved, but when dealing with a maximum of 60 on a single server or so, there's really not any noticeable improvements that can be made.

I'm quite an experienced developer. I create private injectable hacked clients. If you're going to say stuff about me, I recommend you get the facts right.

And that was what? 6+ month ago?... Avicus completely recreated their coding system for Atlas, to make it easier to use, update, and add plugins. I don't know all the behind the scenes stuff of that, but I know that whatever Pav told you doesn't matter anymore...

For like 2 years people have been saying that Avicus is dying and that the server will shut down in the next few months if the staff/devs don't fix it, while the player count is very low now there is still an active community here and we lasted longer as an independent network than OCN who I always felt like were doing much better than we were.

As stated above me, that was 6 months ago... before everything was updated. Maybe&nbsp;<img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/c2a4c847653e482ab62ed7f8b64330cb?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/ALM.html" style="color: #E77400">ALM</a> can shed some light on this.

I'm quite an experienced developer. I create private injectable hacked clients. If you're going to say stuff about me, I recommend you get the facts right. Also, I was told by an old developer (pavilion99 or something like that) that the plugins were very inefficient and so Avicus needs powerful servers to run them.

OK, just going to jump in here since you seem to have some extremely old information.&nbsp;<br><br>The fact that you create "injectable hacked clients" does not mean you&nbsp;anything about working with bukkit and the minecraft server API. That's like saying I cook&nbsp;Italian&nbsp;food in&nbsp;Brooklyn so I know how to make a better sushi than you. It just&nbsp;doesn't equate.&nbsp;<br><br>Pavillion was an active dev ~1 year ago. Since then, we have undergone a major update inside ALL of our plugins. I can assure you that we are not using any of the code we used when you were informed of these&nbsp;inefficiencies. I suggest you as&nbsp;well learn the facts about what we do here before saying things about our practices.<br><br>Also, I will remind you that attacking individuals or groups of individuals is against our forum rules.&nbsp;

Kylo is a developer himself, and the plugins are written mainly by him. The developers (who are bad) should work with the better developers to improve their abilities and code style.<br><br>As a developer myself, I know that you can always learn other things from looking through open source projects, and decompiling other projects.

True. Agree with you

Actually, the Bukkit API got me into Minecraft. The reason I started Java development was because of Bukkit. I've now moved onto lower level languages (such as C and C++), as they are useful for injecting code into the Minecraft process. If you don't believe me when I say I make clients, I can show you some of my work. I'm going to be releasing a client soon.<br><br>Would you please quote where I was "attacking individuals".
