Recently last night I saw a mega hacker flying to the monument and breaking it just flying everywhere. I sent out a report to a mod 2 times and &nbsp;not a single mod came. My KD was getting even more messed up from that person. They got full diamond armour from creative somehow in venomous and was flying around. I forgot the name but it was a girl skin and it's name started with an m then and a I think please watch out because I have seen a lot of people flying of avicus lately -Strongy1210

I'm sorry, but you'll need to supply a name with proof clearly showing the use of illegal hacked clients. Please use some sort of recording software and record them next time, and link the video here. I understand there are many hackers, but we can't do anything without any proof. Thanks!

A recording software called FFSplit works great. I recommend the use of it to catch hackers and report them to us here.

I really doubt they could fly but anyways, you must post some sort of evidence in the player reports section of the forums.<br><br>How to report a player:&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://avicus.net/forums/05401ddf7">http://avicus.net/forums/05401ddf7</a>

Sorry that a mod didn't come. There are a lot of reports though and if only one mod is answering you can't get to all of them. I suggest recording them and uploading to the forums under the section player reports. If you don't have a good recording thingy you can use Camtasia it works pretty well and is fairly simple&nbsp;

Look, if you want to really get it done. I have two ways.<br>1. Spam. Although it seems like a bad way to approach it, basically, every 1 minute send a report. For 5-10 minutes do this process and surely there will be a mod. They can't ignore the same person over and over again. And it at least gets them there.&nbsp;<br><br>2. Take a Screenshot. Recording devices, IMO, no one actually wants to buy them... just to report a hacker. If you see them flying or hacking, picture it. It's less easier, but gets the job done and dandy. &nbsp;<br><br><br>

Pull out your old 20th Century Polaroid and take some photos :)<br><br>l0l<br>He's flying. It's obviously going to be caught. You can't get Aimbot in a screenshot, but you can grab someone floating 100 blocks off the ground. Use the force (f2)

It doesn't really matter which one(we still are using NCP), if you don't want to get lagged back whenever you sprint then you are gonna have to deal with a few fly hackers here and there.

I'm referring to just normal PvP without hacks.<br><br>Also it is pretty common for fly hackers to lag back when they are flying.

Strongy, don't freak, the probability of him actually being a stalker is approximately 30%, and the probability of him being a succesfull, good stalker, is about .05%<br>strongy, you can post screenshots with imgur , by copying the direct link<br>and, best not if you post the screenie here... make a player report<br>And... also, its pretty much impossible for him to see your computer files, your firewall would prevent him, and the chances of him being a well-talented (actual, not minecraft) hacker, is EXTREMELY slim

+1 Roman<br>Strongy, calm down. You realise that he assumed that you did that {screenshotted} because he's a fly hacker. It just makes sense. Don't worry about it. As Roman said, "~the probability of him {her} being a successful and good stalker is about 1/20 of a percent."<br><br>Most of the hackers that are in minecraft are like 9 year olds who downloaded a modded client thinking that it was the legit client. And proceeded to hack. Either that or they're just n00bs who want attention and a good K/D for no reason.
