Normally, you'd have to apply for staff once they open. As of now, they aren't. Maybe you should try once they do open up. :D

You are going to have to wait until Staff Applications open again. Rumor has it that they will be back up in June and that is when you will be able to apply again.

If you miss applications, you have to apply once it opens again. :P

@res @Pyro @Random thanks for the update! I completely forgot about this! Don't worry you will have a fair amount of time to complete your application, so that you can have it be submitted and be evaluated fairly.
