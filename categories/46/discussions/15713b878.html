Hey so i just recently got the Plantronics rig headset + mixer. &nbsp;I love the sound its giving me and its pretty comfy but I'm having a problem.<br><br>I sound really quiet on the mic, i didn't have this problem with my previous headset and i looked up how to make it louder and all the answers are the same, go to recording devices and turn up the volume. &nbsp;Well I've done that and it made no difference, I'm still quiet.<br><br>Has anybody had this problem before? If you have any suggestions, please say so.<br><br><img src="http://theleet.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/RIG-suround-sound-headset.jpg" title="Image: http://theleet.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/RIG-suround-sound-headset.jpg"><br>The Headset<br><br>Here is a link with how i sound with the new Mic:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GOMcmRg0bE" title="Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GOMcmRg0bE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GOMcmRg0bE</a><br>How i sounded with the old mic:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro9kzHSlt9I" title="Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro9kzHSlt9I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro9kzHSlt9I</a>&nbsp;<br><br>Thanks

Go to your sound settings in the control panel and mess around with it. See if that helps.

Did you make the bar at recording at 100% and add a boost as well? Mine needs a boost to make it louder

I honestly didn't see any problems. I like a mic this loud. Louder makes me want to vomit ;-;<br><br>I'm actually surprised about how good the quality of the mic is; most other headset mics are shit. Nice Plantronics .-.

I have a headset that's illegal in the U.S. and sold in the Chinese black market that I bought from Amazon.com, and the sound/mic is pretty damn good for $23, except for the fact I have to replace the headset every now and then because the cord gets screwed up ):
