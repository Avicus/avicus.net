I know that Walls is being added back but I was curious:<br><br><b>When is it being added back? (If there's not a answer at least some idea would be nice.&nbsp;<br></b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Not within the next month.<br><br><b>How close is it do done? With Skywars I know we just need more maps but Walls has maps, and if there's anything that we (community) can do to help then I know a lot of people can't wait for Walls to be back. :) <br></b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Walls has not been started on yet.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Who's in charge of adding it back? (Devs or MapDevs) This is more so that I'm not bugging the wrong people about this. lol</b><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Devs need to make modules for it, MapDevs will handle the maps and code.<br><br><b>Is there a Walls map needed or are u guys just&nbsp;using&nbsp;the old maps?</b><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">You are free to submit Walls maps if you wish. While it doesn't necessarily mean they'll be added yet, there may be changes or things that make it to where your map isn't finalized. We'll let you know of the guidelines once it's discussed, so you can use those to put in your map.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">We will try to keep record of the old maps and convert those if we need to. We'll be doing some reassessments, of course.</span><br><br><b><i>If anyone has questions please ask them. I will edit answers and more questions as it goes on.</i></b>

When is it being added back?<b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; "> Not within the next month.<br></b>How close is it do done? <b>Not yet started on Walls at all.<br></b>Who's in charge of adding it back? <b>Devs need to make modules for it, Mapdevs will handle the maps and code.<br></b><b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; "><br></b>The map developers were actually unaware that Walls was going to be coming back until Posideon said something on the forums saying the admins discussed its return, which wasn't long ago at all. We're currently fixated on Arcade, Frenzy, &amp; Sky Wars, so Walls is definitely not on our to-do list right now.<br><br>I'll suggest a meeting with this as a topic, though.
