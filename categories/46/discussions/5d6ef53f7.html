Don't get me wrong.Almost all the YTbers there have been subscribed by me cuz they are funny.But referring to them as the best minecraft players? Nep. First off minecraft isn't just pvp. It's red stone,building,PvE,mining,and so on.So in my opinion Etho is the best player that we know.But there probably is a better player than him.As for the YTers they only upload when they get a good game.The best pvper I've seen so far is Ngal/xNestorio.<br>Search him up on YTube!He is amazing at UHC and PvP!
