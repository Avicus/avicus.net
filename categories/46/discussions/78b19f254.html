Steam is down.

Considering how large steam is for Avicus, I'll sticky this thread until it's fixed. <br>Enough seems compromised: this is not the first time I've heard of security failures from Valve.

Valve seem to have fixed this issue for now... but I hope Steam compensates for this, they (to an extent) broke the law by releasing peoples account details publicly. Not to mention there was no communication between the customers.<br><br>&gt;steam<br>&gt;communication<br><br>hahah

From my understanding, it's a larger information compromise than just "to an extent" or even a might. There's definitely some consequence for Valve I foresee.

Steam forums, there are two threads about it (read comments too). Then again, Steam doesn't seem like they want to update their customers from an official point of view...

Logging out doesn't help that much. People can still see your account details if it's a cache issue :l

Can confirm - at least from what I've read on reddit. <br><br>Store.steampowered.com sessions aren't clearing their cache for the next user and just show whatever was cached from the previous user. It actually isn't nearly as big an issue as everyone is making it out to be, you can't execute any functions while logged into someone else's account, just view what they were looking at. Which in most cases isn't much more than basic stuff like an email address or less fortunately your IRL address/paypal &amp; bank details.
