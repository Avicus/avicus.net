</h1>
Hello, so since Avicus has an Youtube account and an Twitter account I thought, why not an Official Avicus Instagram Account!? Well anyways I would be managing the account but if any other staff members or fellow players would like to help with the account feel free to ask. I know there are other accounts for Avicus but I'd like to make an Official one if I can. The username name would be @TheAvicusNetwork. I'll also try to post daily.<br><u>Things I'll post</u><br>-screenshots <br>-any official news<br>-anything staff members or regular players would like me to post<br>One post I already have ready:<br><a href="http://i.imgur.com/uoWRENS.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i.imgur.com/uoWRENS.jpg</a><br>any feedback? :)<br>Edit:<br>unofficial but still follow it!<br><br><br>

Youtube is also pointless mo, twitter for small updates that don't need a huge forum post for. Instagram is photos, plus Instagram is stupid, no one needs Instagram when you can do photos in many other places besides Instagram.

this is also advertising for avicus because minecraft accounts scroll through the hashtag #minecraft and #minecraft server so they can look into our server and sometimes even on the explore page you can find photos that I post IG account-advertising :P<br>

It's really stupid that you would have access to a social media account representing Avicus Network. If funky wants to do it, let him do it.&nbsp;

Thing is, you cannot make an official account since you are one of the second lowest ranks out of all of avicus, you would need AT LEAST a manager or above to make it and take care of it, like avicore for example, if they wanted to post the exact time they would have it come out they would have to tell you first so you could announce it on instagram -1, you may do a unofficial one where you post info that has just come out to the public

I agree with both vladthegreat100 and MissCarmel. Since avicus is owned by funky, he should probably be the one to handle it if he wants to.<br>I don't really think this is necessary because there is already twitter and YouTube, and it would be pointless to have another one.<br>Sorry if I seem rude, I am not trying to.

Being a diamond and a gold doesn't make a difference. They're in the same category. Your comment could be inferred that your of a better status than she is, which isn't true. Otherwise, I think your comment was nice... though that first one should be removed, I think.

erm... how am I comparing me from diamond and gold? I said that for an official IG account for avicus it should be managed by a manager or higher since every update goes to each staff before the public, and that she should do at least a unofficial one if she liked but she could not do a official one due to getting the info before the public even if she isn't mod...
