I'm thinking of starting my own YouTube channel! Any tips like recording and/or editing software?

First off, what are your basic specs? like Hz and your version and stuff (Action works good for mostly any windows version though)

I know I might seem like a dick saying this, but before making a channel, get a better computer.<br><br>EDIT: Confused you with another guy LOL I'm retarded. Anyways, make sure to have Sony Vegas and be prepared to put tons of time into editing and rendering will take a long ass time if you don't have a good computer. If you have a Gefore GTX card try installing Gefore experience and use Shadowplau, which gives you literally no performance decrease at all.

Ok here I go:<br>1 - Have a good fps. Nobody wants to watch a video which is laggy, as they'll immediately close the video (trust me I know from experience)<br>2 - Have good funny commentary.. nobody wants to watch a boring video<br>3 - Know how to use editing software.. the more editing you put into your videos, the more people will like it. I personally use Sony Vegas Pro 12 but you can start out with windows movie maker if you aren't too familiar with editing yet<br>4 - Involve your audience in your videos in some creative way<br>5 - Don't record anything you don't enjoy.. if you don't like it, chances are the video won't be as fun to record and therefore you'll probably have not as good commentary and the video won't do well<br><br>There are TONS of other things that I could write but I'll leave you with these for now, since they're the basic essentials.<br><br>Oh and I'd recommend Camtasia Studio as a recording software. I am switching over to it and I have to say it's one of the most convenient to use.<br><br>Good luck! :)

I use OBS Studio / Fraps sometimes to record. I didn't have the best PC when I first started out but tbh it depends what your content will be. Minecraft or other games w/ commentary - your choice. Once you have that sorted get an editing software like Adobe Premiere Pro CC 2014 or Sony Vegas (the latest one). These two are the most used and pretty good editing softwares. <br><br>Remember if people enjoy YOU and your content they will enjoy anything else :)
