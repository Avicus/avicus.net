Now, as many of you have probably forgotten, I used to write a FanFic. That FanFic started "The FanFic Revolution".&nbsp;<br><br>I wrote more and more, and SO many FanFics popped up. Howsie even made a set of rules regarding FanFics. One was "Every different FanFic can have 1 topic. Post links in that topic to your FanFics, which you should write into PasteBin". I was all like "WUT. But the 30-ish episodes I've written have all been different topics". So, Howsie being a nice guy, let me continue writing individual topics for them.<br><br>In the 1st season and early 2nd, each topic got around 20 views and feedback. I was happy writing them and people enjoyed it. Soon, people stopped reading. There was about, maybe 40 characters I put in, and every single one of them was a friend of mine from the forums. But, as the 3rd season went on... Not even the people simply stopped reading. There were usually around 3 views on each.<br><br>If you don't know what "The Excalibur Saga" was, it was the FanFic I wrote.<br><br>It was set in a region, maybe similar to Middle Earth (The Hobbit/LOTR), and there were two regions. The Blues, who wanted Excalibur for safety, and mainly because to keep it from Red using it for destruction of the world. Now, how Excalibur formed was that 1000s of years before the Great War of Excalibur, Red and Blue were allies. They grew strong together and relied on each other. One day, while the two kings mined together, they found two mysterious green gems with a great aura. They could sense the power radiating from it. They both agreed to take 1 for each region, but Red grew jealous, they wanted both, blah blah blah. Anyway, between the regions was a large area, covered in wood. The leader of Red, Funky, shot their emerald at Blue hoping it was mass destruct all of the Blue region, but &nbsp;Howsie, leader of Blue, reacted and shot up their emerald. Anyway, they collided, and absorbed all of the wood in the field. Suddenly, there's this magical sword floating in the field. It couldn't budge from it's position, and scientists found that it would go to the side with more power. Well, each team had a piece of powerful obsidian. That obsidian kept the power going in the regions. So, if one team broke the other teams obsidian, they won. Then a great war went on, and thousands of years later, the story followed a boy, me, and his friends in the war.

Now I know that was a lot. My point is, does anyone still care about TES? I have all on the ones I've written save don my computer. If enough people want, I could finish. If not, I'll never finish it. Does anyone want to read the final ones? Or should I not write them.<br><br>-Zach

Well... The first issue of the new AviPost will be out soon. Maybe you could be a resident writer and have your own section? ;o

I don't exactly understand what "AviPost" is, could you elaborate on that?<br><br>And my other question is, what do I do with the other 30ish episodes. I mean, I knew that forums where getting wiped, so I saved all the episodes onto my Google Drive. Should I put them into paste bin, and make a big topic about it, or continue what I was doing, 1 topic per episode, and re-post all 30 episodes? Doing that could result in mass-spam, though, I'd be creating 30 topics, in say, 20 minutes. :/

It's a newspaper by Iron and I. It's pretty big and after the first issue we'd love to have more writers. ^_^
