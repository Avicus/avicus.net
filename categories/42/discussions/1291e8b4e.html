<u></u>Hi. For the predators clan, we are trying to find a free server to collaborate and maybe scrimmage with each other. We are on a budget so we can't pay for a server.&nbsp;<br><br>*The server will strictly be used for avicus related content.&nbsp;<br><br><b><u>Conditons<br></u></b><i>-Must be free<br>-Can upload my own map without ftp<br>-(Preferably) Multicraft control panel<br>-24/7 Server<br><b><u></u></b></i><b><u>What I Tried Already<br></u></b><i>-Triangle<br></i>-<i>Grattiserver<br>-Aternos<br></i><span><i>-The ones that need surveys....<br>-Envioushost<br><br></i>If you can help me find one that can suit the clan's needs, you will be a special guest and have full access to the server. Again, it is avicus related. Thank you for your time!<br><i><br>PokerFace_Legend<br><br></i></span>

I would recommend that you home host, hosting from a company isn't free and not many people will be willing to pay for you.

You could ask someone from your clan with a fast enough computer and a relatively quick internet speed.

To host from home, you must be able to port forward, so contact your ISP and ensure that you are capable of port forwarding.

Ok I'll see what I can do. Would they be able to upload my map and change settings like allow flight ,disable mobs, whitelist, generate structures?

Most ISPs don't block port 25565, and don't you configure port forwarding in the router settings?

A lot of ISP's pre-configure routers, therefore giving you no choice.

There are no completely free hosting services that are not scams/surveys.<br><br>It's actually quite easy to set up a home server with port forwarding, and there's plenty of step-by-step tutorials on YouTube.<br><br>There are no major limitations to a home server, except for limited server ram (since it's your own computer) and having to start your server up whenever you use it.<br><br>For a scrimmage server, home hosting should work fine.

I just would like to remember that when you port forward your router, all the devices who are connected to the network are going to be vulnerable because when you port forward the router firewall won't protect you.

Also, I forgot to add this earlier but, it would help if the server was 24/7.

It depends whether they provide the router or not. Even if the ISP does, its pretty easy to contact them, and forward the port.
