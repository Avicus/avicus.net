<p>Hey guys! Ive came here today to suggest something. I suggest that we should have /staff and&nbsp;/friends! Here are some reasons why.</p><ol><li><u>/staff Reasons</u></li><li><u></u>We can see if the staff are on.</li><li>We can see if they can help us with something like if a match stopped working.</li></ol><ul><li><u>/friends Reasons</u></li><li>Reason that we should have /friends is to play with our friends.</li><li>We can ask our friends to join TeamSpeak and we play some fun matches!</li><li>We can also do team defences!</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Thanks for your time! Took out the fourth point!</p>

You have /list if you want to see the staff in-game. Also, you shouldn't be telling a staff member to spectate a hacker through chat anyway; /report is the way to go. What exactly would /friends do? Would list your friends that are online?

I'm actually in favor of all of this. &nbsp;I think it's more efficient than staff members saying "Anyone on?" in the staff chat. &nbsp;As for the friends option, I can definitely see the usefulness. &nbsp;I've added both to my list of things to do.

Imagine a hacker with a custom client that executes /staff every ten seconds, and automatically toggles if it shows that a staff member is online.

We have /list and the /staff could be abused because if there is a hacker online then they could see if there are any staff online ;/ However there could be people like me whiling to go the extra mile and I'll speculate them because when there's no staff on sometimes people tell me to check out people if they're hacking XD

I dont think we need this. If you need to see if staff are online just go to the game tab on the website and look for staff or do /list. If you want to talk to a friend just do /msg ign or you can change your settings so you can only see friend chat in game.

People aren't going to use this command with the intention of stalking.<br>(If we are going to be stalked, we can deal with it).<br><br>/staff is helpful. It let players know where they can find a Moderator if and when they need one.<br><br>It's very user friendly and will strengthen the relationship&nbsp;between the community and the staff.<br><br><br>/friends is just generally helpful.

<b>/friends&nbsp;</b>is quite useful<br>as for <b>/staff&nbsp;</b>, I feel that it should not be implemented for some reasons : Hackers could see if a staff member is on, and would immediately turn their hacks off.&nbsp;<br><br>But <b>/friends&nbsp;</b>would be a good command to add ;)

/staff is quite essential right now. I really like the idea, so I'll talk to KyloCode about implementing it. As for /friends, it's not needed at the moment, but I can definitely see something like it in the future. :)

I like the idea of /staff. When doing a report I always do /list every minute for 5 minutes. Problem is that most of the time no staff member comes .-. And I never know if there are any staff member or not hence I don't know if I should get proof or not or if the player has stopped before I get proof. If you do get /staff you can see if staff members are online or not, if they are and no one is taking the reports you at least know that the staff members are either really busy, taking a break or ignoring your report. If not you will know that you can gain proof and do an online report.<br>On the other hand for /friends if you are like me and are trying to be really friendly you will accept all friend requests. Problem with that is when you do issue the command and you have a bunch of friends then you will get some giant list that will not only spam and maybe lag you but essentially lag the whole server, it may not be too much space with each name but there are people with hundreds/thousands of friends and then you will probably not be the only one issuing the command alone, there might be another or more than one other person with multiple friends who issue the command. Hence it will lag the server a lot more.<br>And for people who say /list is good enough, yes it is good enough if you want to know who is in the same game you are. But overall in the whole server you will never know unless you visit each server there is on avicus. So it's not the best :)
