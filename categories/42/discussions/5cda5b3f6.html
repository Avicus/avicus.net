So it's been a month now since Ironsoldier and I released the first issue of the AvPost. You can see it here if you fancy a read:&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://avicus.net/forums/144889a25">http://avicus.net/forums/144889a25</a>. It was relatively well received, but unfortunately we just haven't had the time to start on another due to other outside commitments. Well, I lie actually, I have made a first draft of my blog, but that's nowhere near to being finished.&nbsp;<br><br>My question to y'all is would you like to see another one? And what would you want to see in it.<br>There would most likely be<br>- A main story, written by me<br>- Leaderboards/teams talk, written by iron<br>- Two blogs, written by iron and I<br>- Possibly a story, written by SpicyTunaRoll (if he's still down for it)<br>- A interview, conducted and written by me<br><br>Any feedback, comments or opinions would be greatly appreciated.<br><br>Thanks

So the teams/leaderboards should be scrapped? Fair point, however some may have enjoyed reading.<br><br>I found this suggestion, lost on the old post, and quite liked it.<br><span><br>Idea: about a five scene cartoon about funny things on avicus like jokes and epic fails - Whale_warrior&nbsp;</span>
