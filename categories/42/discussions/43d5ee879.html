In the next... while, I'm gonna start uploading avicus videos... I'm definitely gonna do basic minigames, but I also had an idea to do videos of me spectating nebula matches and very sarcastically commentating the wonders that go on. You'd be surprised at how many *interesting* things could happen.&nbsp;<br><br>"<i>And there, friends, is the rare and&nbsp;spectacular flying boat! It appears to be performing its annual migration to the other hemisphere's monument. As it gracefully lands and begins to salvage a nest from the nearby material-- Oh. Nope,&nbsp;nevermind, someone just shot it. Need to work on those gun laws."&nbsp;<br><br>"Oh my! Look at that! It's the amazing and famous PeachyYas, swooping in to take down an opposing gladiator! Their swords meet with a sickening clang, and our Peachy hero uses this moment to quickly stab his opponent, knocking him to the ground! But what's this? Another person challenges our savior and Lord! YES! YES HE CAN! DOUBLE KILL! HE FLIES OFF THE EDGE AND INTO THE VOID! WTF OMG THERES ANOTHER GUY! STUPID NOOBS... OMFGGGGGG HE DIED TOO&nbsp;<b>WOMBO COMBO WOMBO COMBO!!!!!!!</b>"<br><br>"Well, what have we here? It appears a sneaky spy has crawled through the enemy patrols and made it to their most beloved possession, a perfectly&nbsp;pixelated&nbsp;cuboid obsidian rock! He slams his brightly shining diamond pickaxe to the igneous rock and creates a small hole. He continues soiling the monument that thousands and thousands of hours produced,&nbsp;oblivious&nbsp;to the work of art he is&nbsp;destroying. Finally, the deed is done, and the rock is destroyed. Well whatever back left is still&nbsp;alive"<br><br></i>Those are some of the best moments from the first video I recorded. Thoughts? Ideas? Share away, my pretties!<i><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></i><i><br></i><br><br><i><br><br><br><br><br></i><i><br></i>

I don't really mind what people do ^_^. As long as you don't make people feel awkward, you are on a good path!
