Hello everyone. I have an exelent idea to introduce to everyone.<br>So, in every comment, we should have a little comment saying ( Like ) and one saying ( dislike ).<br><br><br><ul><li></li><li><u>Why?</u></li><li>This is where my idea starts.The Like &amp; Deslike button it's a new command that will give feedback about your posts and, if possible, a table will appear in your profile saying how many Positives likes do you have.&nbsp;</li><li>Ex: 20 Likes &amp; 2 Deslikes = 18 Likes</li><li><u>Why is this useful?</u></li><li><u></u>The positive likes will decide if you can be an Member of the week.</li></ul>Useful informations for the Member of the Week.<br><br><br><ul><li>A table will appear in the initial page of the Avicus network with the Top 5 members with more positive likes and those are who can get the Member of the Week.</li></ul><ul><li>The Member of the week will be a sign in Teamspeack that allows you to join the Premium Suite [ and maybe 5k - 10k credits in the Avicus server ].</li></ul>This is an idea, not an Oficcial release. I'm saying this idea with the hope that the Devs can actually do this in the forums and in Teamspeack.<br><br>Regards<br>xToby

I would be keen just to have a like button and no dislike button.<br><br>People could just troll and bully people by spamming dislikes.

It can be easily abused.&nbsp;<br>It will become a great emotional pressure on ppl, who will get a tons of dislikes. I saw, how it works on other forums. They may just leave. We already have enough insults here without this.

I see that the dislike button is abusable. Maybe I'll just remove that idea and I'll just put the like button.
