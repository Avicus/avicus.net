Due to issues with me accessing this server, I looked up some other servers that have the mini game Destroy The Monument . I found a server that has DTM (Destroy the monument) TDM (Team Death Match) And DTB (Diffuse the Bomb)<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This mini game consists of having one TNT block on each of the teams side. The objective is to <b>not </b>let the opposing team ignite your TNT and start the timer. When the enemy ignites your TNT it will begin a count down from 200.There will be a score board on the corner showing us the countdown sequence. The winning team is the team that has more time remaining on the score board. For example if <u>Blue</u> Team has <b>132</b> seconds left, but <u>Red</u> has <b>154</b> seconds left on their TNT, Red will win the match due to the fact that they had more seconds than blue.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From the beginning of the game you will receive 2 items (The&nbsp;<b><i>Defuse Kit</i></b>, and the&nbsp;<b><i>Fuse Kit</i></b>).&nbsp;Now lets say the bomb has been ignited by the opposing team and you were there. First thing of course you'd have to do is to take down the enemy and secure the bombs perimeter, then you will have to take out the Defuse kit (a shear), right click and hold to defuse your bomb which will stop the count down.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If you're in enemy territory and decide to ignite their bomb. What you will want to do is have the fuse kit (blaze powder, blaze rod, redstone torch etc....), right click&nbsp;and hold on&nbsp;the TNT as well which will trigger the countdown. <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For example, if Red ignites Blue's TNT, but Blue didn't have enough time to defuse it, the countdown will soon reach to <b>0</b>,&nbsp;and<b>&nbsp;</b>Red team will win. But!! if Blue team have enough time and diffuse the TNT, the countdown will stop and they will be left with {<b><u>***</u></b>}&nbsp; amount of time.<br><br>Hope you guys consider implementing this mini game in because it is highly addictive, and popular :DDD.&nbsp;<br><br>Cyanide Signing Out<br><br><br>Note*** <b>There will usually be a time limit to when the match ends usually 20-30 minutes.</b>

I agree. It's mostly Youtubers who give Hypixle all the fame. But still. People join &nbsp;the majority of the time to play.
