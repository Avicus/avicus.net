Its a Streaming Hub m8 what do you expect xD sorry if I get really spammy I just want to get my channel to be a little bit more promoted so more people can learn about this server. I helped two people find out about Avicus yesterday and it really helped me know that this is my role as a livestreamer. To get people to know about Avicus. I was talking to Tynvale about it and that is why he does YouTube Videos, to promote Avicus. I'm sorry if I spam posts on here I just wanna let everyone know what I do and what I am trying to accomplish. :]
