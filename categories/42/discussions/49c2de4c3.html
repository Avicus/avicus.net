Hello, fellow Avicus forum user!<br><br>I recently had a problem with my video editor because I was using the wrong codec. I then had to use a different video editor. In the video editor I was using, I could not publish any more videos, so I had to go into the "Preview" option and record the preview I made with Bandicam. I also couldn't edit that in my normal video editor (Camtasia studios), so I looked online for a good 2 hours or so to find a video combiner. I then combined the recordings I made of the preview and got a .avi file which I finally uploaded to YouTube only to find out that there were parts of the video missing or in the wrong place. I then edited the recordings, combined them again, and watched the whole video to know that there are now no problems. I'm very sorry for having posting the bad video on the forums earlier today and I can assure you this one is the real one.&nbsp;<br>Enjoy! :D<br><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNoZfP9ueI4&amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNoZfP9ueI4&amp;feature=youtu.be</a>

&nbsp;you should just make one topic and post on that when you make a new video, it is less spammy on the forums

I would do that, but I'm scared it would qualify as a bump if I commented on it when there was a new video..<br>This is going to be the last post because of the forum spam, but thanks for the advice :3
