The media rank is NOT a youtuber rank. The media team's job is to livestream and record tournament matches.

No one knows about the famous rank...<br>It used to be 50K subs but it's been told that we no longer go by that, but there never was an actual announcement of any new requirements.

You could add a unofficial rank to your About page as snow added "Retired" to his when he was demoted. Brilliant. XD

The rank was created when we had our firsts tournaments. Players were not allowed in the server to spectate a game unless they were a Referee, Official or Media. The media would live stream games for people that had no access to the game through the server. This allowed them to watch regardless

To become a media, you have to apply when applications are open. There will be a post on the forums when applications are open so keep your eyes open.

Haha, don't you realize you are making a fool of yourself, you never retired so why would you have the rank? And why would you add a retired rank to your about page when you still were a mod? It doesn't make any sense.

Your first was on topic however you were misinformed. Snow was trying to give the correct information (maybe not in the nicest way possible) while you were calling him out so I have to ask&nbsp;<b>you</b> to get back on topic.
