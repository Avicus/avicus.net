From the title it may seem a little dramatic, but I actually just need help with some video ideas! I have no idea what to record and that means that I can't upload anything!<br><br>Any ideas would be helpful because like I said without any I can't make videos! I will look through every idea I get and will decide what I would want to do because I don't want to force myself to do anything I don't want to.

I'll tell you something important you need to know when you are doing YT, I'm not saying this to be mean towards you in anyway. It isn't easy at all to do YT, but if you don't know what you are supposed to do or what you would like to do, don't do YT, as easy as that. You need the commitment in order to get the results. Take a little break, <span>think about what you really want to do</span>, we shouldn't tell you what you should and shouldn't do. It only shows you don't know what you are getting yourself into, same when you were going to make a map, you only tried it because someone else did a map. If you want results, do something you want to do and really enjoy to do, because you want to and because you enjoy it, not because other people are telling you what to do.

Thanks for this reply, but I have a few things about it I don't agree with:<br><br>- <b>I LOVE YOUTUBE</b> and<b> MAKING VIDEOS.<br></b>- I am just <b>struggling&nbsp;</b>for some <b>ideas.</b><br>-&nbsp;<b></b>I didn't start making the map series because someone else did it! <b>It was my own idea</b> to do<b> but people didn't like the idea.</b><br>- If I had to make every decision myself (eg. video ideas) I would keep doing the same thing <b>over and over again</b> and that wouldn't be<b> enjoyable to my viewers.<br></b>- <b>I like letting my viewers have a say in some things that I do</b> because it <b>pushes me out of my comfort zone</b> and it keeps an <b>active community.<br><br></b><b><i><u>I am not trying to sound rude or mean in anyway, I am just voicing my opinions.</u></i></b><b><br></b>
