It is because it has Avicus players and teams,&nbsp; so it is Avicus related.

Ok, him not asking you was bad. But the reason is just stupid. You didn't want him to upload it because you guys did bad? It's not like anyone is going to call you weak or anything.&nbsp;<br><br>Not trying ing to offend you in anyway.

He doesn't need permission. Yes its nice if he asks the other team but he can upload it if he wants to. I don't see how it can be considered harrasment. He didn't insult you, talk trash about you or anything like that, its just a video between two teams. I honestly see that as a horrible reason and I wouldn't delete the video if I was in his place.<br><br>It also looks like it was on Overcast's practice servers and event coordinators on Overcast posted that you are allowed to post scrimmages at any time. Even if its between Avicus teams it was played on Overcasts servers so those rules apply.

Yeah, you did and were missing a key player, but we were missing a few people from our main roster as well. You did poorly and lost fair and all I'm hearing is excuses from Allah. But there's no use in getting butthurt over one scrim, to all of us.&nbsp;<br><br>1 bad scrim does not = bad team, and I'm sure we all know that.

Juano and Notal, this video is not "harassment" in any way <b><i>whatsoever</i></b>. If your team did poorly, it does not mean that legoche is not allowed to upload it. Although it would have been a better idea to ask for permission to upload, he does not need your teams' consent whatsoever. If your team lost, you lost. It's a game, and just because he uploads the video does not mean that we will think any less of you, if that is what you are worried about. I think that the term "harassment" is extremely exaggerated, and is unnecessary. Let's not start a flame war.<br><br>legoche, great video! Thumbs up from me! :D

It is hardly harassment, is it, I recorded and uploaded it, and just because you lost, doesn't mean you should come and have a go at me. I understand how you feel about being beaten by us but still... Harassment? xD I am not going to reply to your reply because I do not want to start a flame war, but its kind of like saying that SkyDoesMinecraft should be banned off you tube for harassment because he uploaded a survival games video with a guy in it who didn't want to be put on you tube.

You guys did ok, but so many things wrong. I'm going to be brutally honest here. Here's some feedback for ya.<br>1) The frontside, backside, and none of the areas of the ship were not watered aside from the 2 antennas. Also the diamonds were not watered.<br>2) NONE of the chests were watered, neither did you save diamonds.<br>3) You guys REALLY need to learn how to cannon and not build potatoes. &nbsp;<br>4) You guys need to start a skybridge and have someone shot-calling for underbridges and such.&nbsp;<br>5) You have to learn basic tourney shit. This includes how to properly water objectives including cores and antennas.&nbsp;<br>I could go on much more, but in all honesty any half-decent OCN team would have absolutely demolished you. You guys have alot to learn.<br>*Edit: Before you flip shit lashing at me for mentioning OCN, literally you guys don't play badly but you just need to learn basic stuff. Then you'll be much better.

Well you cannot expect them to be good at a game they don't regularly play. We are Avicus, not Overcast. They were playing on OCN maps with the OCN plugin, a completely different gameplay of Nebula. In my first scrim, I didn't know how to play and I have done my best to learn from that. Once we have actual scrim servers, lets see how OCN team vs OCN team goes on an Avicus server. You know what's gonna happen? We going to see them playing at a lower performance as well. This is normal and you cannot expect people to be good at something they don't practice.

If you didn't know I'm on proximity FYI, an AVICUS team.<br>Being able to strategise maps swiftly is part of a skill. 90% of Proximity was unfamiliar with RFV2 strats until Micheal managed to come up with some stuff after 2 minutes. If you can't do that you have alot to learn. Also considering team allah is like 50% OCN, it's not a fair advantage for them.&nbsp;<br>Also DTMs and CTWs are MUCH more simpler compared to DTCs, if you didn't know. No cannoning and TNT involved, etc.

I'm giving you constructive criticism. My wording is quite harsh but I'm telling you how to improve in the future. If I truly wanted to condescend you I would said something along the lines of "your team is trash kill youself"

Seeing as Avicus maps are generally less strategically complex CTW maps, I think they'd do fine.<br><br>Also Sho is giving constructive criticism, why is everyone jumping down his throat

Are you trying to make me sound like an idiot? How would I know you are in Proximity? The roster is secret. Plus, I know that most of the players on Proximity have had scrim experience so I don't believe you. I'm just trying to say that the way you worded that obviously is bad-mouthing both clans in this game. If it's just me, maybe you wouldn't believe me but, as you can see, part of the community is on my side.&nbsp;<br><br>And by the way, I do know DTC is more complex but, "if you didn't know" there are quite a few DTM maps with TnT such as Cherryland, Berryland, and other various maps.

I appreciate the criticism guys , of course this was our first scrim together as a clan , so we were quite out of practice. We will take all helpful tips &nbsp;in to consideration in future scrims .I can assure you though we won't be using nubby cannons anymore. :P

Whoa, guys chill out. Just because a couple of players are giving your contructive critism doesn't mean you lashout on them. It's their opinion, and I dislike you dissing directly at them. <br><br>@pokerface: <br><i>" If it's just me, maybe you wouldn't believe me but, as you can see, part of the community is on my side.
