I'm a god o3o<br><br>Graphics tablet. Although difficult, it's possible to use. Only problem is, I haven't found out how to scroll, so I'd have to learn how to hotkey x3

How did you get it to work? I tried my Wacom tablet, and all it did was start spinning randomly whenever I clicked.

I have an Intuos tablet. Small one. At first I just spun a lot, as you could tell by the video, but then I got used to it. x3 I can't control it though, and I don't plan on fully learning how to for a little while.<br><br>Just takes practice. In osu, it took me less than an hour to get used to the tablet, while it takes other people a lot longer. Time depends.

If you're talking about a graphics tablet, that's the only way you get it to work xDDD<br><br>If it's possible to play with any other kind of tablet, I don't know how to. Mainly because I don't have any other tablet.

I have an Intuos as well, and it's just that whenever I tap with my pen anywhere, it would just spin me in a random direction. Did you have to configure anything?
