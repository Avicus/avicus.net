As I'm sure many of you are aware, in the NBA an Eastern conference and Western conference team are formed out of the best players in each district, who then verse each other! So I thought I would toss out the Idea of having an Avicus All Star tournament were two teams are formed from the best players of Avicus and verse each other. This gives Avicus members the chance to play with players on different regular teams and should make for an exciting scrim! Keeping in mind this idea would <b>NOT</b> mean you would have to leave your regular team! Really love to hear peoples opinion on this...

sorry dont understand the point of this idea u said having players of avicus play against each other when its like 16 of the best players playing against each other which is like 5% of the total avicus community. they can just scrim why would they need this? unless ur putting in a cash prize, since the best players r on pb and allah. sorry i have no clue why this idea was introduced

Maybe we can have like 3 levels. Then we have 6 teams, so more people can play. If u win a match u go a level up and if u are in the highest level and keep winning. Then u are the champion. Teams with like 10 players and then 8v8 or 7v7 scrims

Deciding who the 'best' players are will mean a lot of subjective viewpoints and therefore it'd be difficult to get everyone to agree on players. If you can find a work-around for that (I CBA to think of one), then go for it.

what I would do is get everyone who is interested in playing to post on a thread, then have the 2 top teams' leaders choose 7 people from it (maybe with like a limit of 3 players from their own team)<br><br>the other option would be to get like a certain number of players from each of the top 4 teams to play

Great idea but its always a popularity contest tbh, I think the officials should host it[LOL] and pick people who maybe shined in the tournament?<br><br>also get the MVP thing for after matches are over<br><br><br>even better, avicus top 8 compete against stratus top 8 players

It's a great idea.I think that it may be 2 or 3 members per team selected by the team leader and then go and play the "all star"
