I'm not blaming your whole team. Don't worry I am just done with this salt between the two teams. It's annoying. I have purposely missed most of the matches against you just cause I am done with the salt.

I'm with you but to be honest there is no one player to pinpoint the salt on it's everyone but i think we should still scrim because at the moment we are the 2 most active AV teams and who else are we going to scrim and besides it's your map choice anyway next time so no more map moans.
