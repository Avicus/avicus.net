I know and I agree that "<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">&nbsp;this server is too small for something like this</span>". I really think it would be good to at least try and also it is a shot at advertisement (at least an attempt).

1. I don't particularly like TeamSpeak<br>2. I've tried recording on Avicus TeamSpeak before, but it doesn't work out without being interrupted&nbsp;all of the time with people coming in and out and getting spammed as well... I find it a problem for me.

You need a specific code to join a specific server.<br>It's kind of like an ip&nbsp;for a Minecraft server..but..it's a code for a Discord server.

I am currently trying to set up a podcast as well but they will only be 10-15 minutes of information per episode. As someone who is also going into Radio to be a news director, I can tell you that shorter episodes compacted with a lot of information is 100% better than a 60 minute video with a little more information
