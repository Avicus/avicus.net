I thought it would be fun for myself to do and for my twitch channel. This is going to be kind of like those one man sports talks shows where I will just be talking about certain things about the comp scene and how its been going.&nbsp;<br><br>I want&nbsp;<b>YOU</b> to give me suggestions on what to talk about, please leave those below along with questions/opinions/things to rant and complain about. *this is not an event to roast the&nbsp; official teams from servers, even though roasting LFT is fun, this is strictly supposed to be a funny/interesting gig to try out. If you are going to get salty if your name/team is brought up, I recommend not watching.&nbsp;<br><br><b>DATE: I am shooting for September 9th or 16th, on a Saturday.&nbsp;<br><br></b>I will be talking to the twitch chat a lot, and a facecam will be on to make it more interesting. but please fill this out as topics to talk about<br>if you want your suggestions private PM me on discord, #dev_revs#8470<br>1) Tournament team question<br>2)Tournament player question<br>3)Tournament event question<br>4) Tournament event staff question<br>5) basically ask anything that has to do with the most recent competitive scene on MC.<br><br>Hope you decide to tune in and watch, its going to be an experience you wont want to miss. Suggestions and topics to talk about can be posted below!

Srsly there is no such thing as real competitive Minecraft no matter how u look at it it is a joke lets think about it if Minecraft does become an esports and the lol and dota fans look at this shit they will laughing their dicks off and plus Microsoft will never make this into an esports because they r all money whores who would rather make Minecraft into a kid friendly game and earn more money instead of making it into an esports since it's going to do no shit other than making competitive Minecraft look like a fucking joke so if ur thinking about competitive I recommend for u to just give up
