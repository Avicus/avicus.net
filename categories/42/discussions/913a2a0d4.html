Very neat and helpful but maybe either speak louder or turn your volume up because its sometimes quite hard to hear you

1) I do all those technics on those maps.<br>2) It's Formorgar, not Unix... Unix is other made by iz and clownz. Formorgar is by Evocal and his friends.

In Formorgar, if you get on the roof of the place next to their monuments, you can just jump to the monument by clutching to the side. Then you can jump to the top of their spawn, and then to the other monument. Otherwise all the other tips are good.
