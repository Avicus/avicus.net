Yeah I should have put on music haha but whatevs! Mainly just showing people around the map :) I found that one to be a little tricky starting off, so new players can watch it to help themselves out a bit

<u></u>I haven't played Walls so I might be wrong but am I correct to say the map is identical on all four sides? If so, I would count it as teamgriefing as you prevent your own team the possibility of enchanting like the three other teams are able to do (You kept the ench-table in your inventory). :)

I believe this map is symmetrical so it should work on all four sides. However I don't play walls all that often

no, it wouldn't be. Team griefing would be something like destroying your teams base they built and stuff like that. Plus if you watched the vid Youd see that my teammate left and I did put the enchant table down.<br><br>plus from my experience on the walls if you don't take it, someone else will. The difference is that I'll share it if someone asks for it while some other people won't.<br><br>plus you find this one in a chest lol so

In this case no it isn't team griefing but if you were to take the enchant table for a malicious reason then it would be team griefing.

Yeah, like if someone had it placed down and using it and I went and took it and ran off. That would be team griefing.
