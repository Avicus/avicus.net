So its been in my mind for a while now and ive been wanting to ask everyone (i really want an honest answer, this includes myself)...<br><br>Would you rather use all your time in becoming a good minecraft pvper, to the extent of becoming one of the best in a server (Avicus mainly since most of those who will see this plays Avicus)<br><br>Or...<br><br>Focus on more of the serious matters and important things in life over a block game..., Family, Friends, School, Your Health, Going Outside, Doing Hobbies, Sports, Anything You wish to achieve as a person in the real world (not the gaming/minecraft world),&nbsp;<b><u>REAL LIFE</u></b><u></u>?!<br><br>My Answer would be the latter, especially since this is my final year in Highschool and i got college entrance exams to get ready for, friends i missed/never got to hungout/talk with throughout the whole summer, get my weight back and maintain a much healthier body, regain the trust of my family towards me, become an active person physically, doing other things i like than just fighting 1 and 0's in a online block game, wanting to get into the course i want in college and graduating with a degree and landing a job in a nice company, and much much more...<br><br>And ill be honest, i say this because my entire summer vacation was just me sitting infront of a screen, becoming something that i think i can be proud of? Maybe... but lets be real, in the end, its just a game, all it can give me is fun, satisfaction and time to burn, but nothing can be given in return in reality, like what my dad always tells me...<br><br>"That Minecraft/Laptop will always be there, hindi yan mawawala at madali naman iyan mapalit, ikaw naman at yung oras na sinasayang mo sa buhay mo at ang buhay mo mismo, hindi!"<br><br>For anyone who reads this, i want to see an&nbsp;<b><u>HONEST</u></b> answer from you to this question.<br><br>- Toby

I agree with you i gained a lot of weight this year too due to playing a lot and sitting in front of my laptop,<br>and not exercising much i am looking to lose it all this summer hopefully and become a better person.<br>You basically took the words out of my mouth, Minecraft/Games/Laptop will always be there.<br>This year is the first year in my life where i failed a class and honestly it was terrifying, so for me i would choose the second one definitely every time without even putting thoughts into it.

maybe you should just find a balance and put more effort into the things that matter to you.

I have had no problems involving gaming times, I just have a balance. Just make sure you are doing something outside of technology everyday and then you can have fun in both aspects :)
