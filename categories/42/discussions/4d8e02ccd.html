Once again, this is another thread to do with my channel. But this one is a little different...<br><br>On my channel I have a series called '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3EUEkdDGuoxZIMfuxm8F8tNNDWXiKHWT" title="Link: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3EUEkdDGuoxZIMfuxm8F8tNNDWXiKHWT">Building a Nebula Map</a>' and recently I had a little issue with it. The world save doesn't work anymore so I had to start again. While I was trying to replicate what it looked like at the end at Episode 2, I noticed that it wasn't unique or creative. So I had an idea, I am going to be holding a competition for anyone to participate. It is going to be a competition where you come up with creative and unique ideas/blueprint for a map. Some of the map devs and I will be judging this competition and judge based on creativity, gameplay, etc.<br><br>You don't need to make a whole map, all you need to do is submit your ideas through pictures or even through video. I have a prize for the winner and if you really want you can work in a group but the prize will be split between you. The winner/s will also get there ideas used in the series and will be credited in the final build of the map.<br><br>I would really appreciate anyone who participates and the competition will end in around 2 weeks, so I can go on with the series!<br><br>So there you go, there are no limitations, so think of anything you want and feel free to have multiple entries/ideas.<br><br><b>EDIT:</b> Here is the video on it -&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1L7QbdbCTI" title="Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1L7QbdbCTI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1L7QbdbCTI</a>
