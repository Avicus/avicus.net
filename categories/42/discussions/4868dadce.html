Define what you mean by constantly. You can obviously do it with s-tapping, but do you mean without stopping? I used to practice without stopping with my old DeathAdder by butterfly clicking but I was only able to do it for a short while. I believe my record is the gap between Quintus.

If you mean going up a block at every &nbsp;interval then yes this is true but if you just mean keep doing it with some mistakes and not going up a block at ever interval then youre wrong since i can do it and only click 16 cps max

Consistently means doing something in the same way for a long time. The person in the video was not s-tapping. If someone clicks at like 14 cps they can do it for a few blocks before they fall, but not consistently enough to make a staircase or something.

Sorry but i dont really understand what you wrote. What I mean is that if you are clicking pretty fast (12-15 cps) you can do it for a few blocks, maybe like ten, before you fall unless you have perfect aim, which no one does while clicking at that speed. For it to actually be useful and actually be able to go a while while doing it, you have to be clicking at a lot more than is humanly possible.

There is no doubt in my mind that you can consistently use bleeple bridging to make a staircases all the way up to height limit. But, you are absolutely autoclicking in that case and you just admitted to it.

This is just simple jitterbridging.  It is nothing too special and if you practice enough, you certainly can do about 50 blocks. Also, it is possible to keep your aim while jittering.

Also, most people think breezily is about cps. It is way easier to breezily by timing your clicks, which makes it possible to do it constantly.

I always click my DPI button to where my cursor doesn't move. Also I've been able to do it without taking intervals for around 12-15 blocks (again, the gap between both sides on Quintus).<br><br>Also, is the bridging in the video bleeple or jitter bridge. Isn't bleeple kind of like making a perfect one block staircase and jitter bridge is random?

Nah they are the same thing. It is definitely possible to no-shift staircase if you s tap or d and f tap, but bleeple/jitter bridging (just jumping and holding s while getting tons of cps) is not possible to do consistently without autoclicking. That being said, you can do it with like 12 cps and just get lucky every once in a while but you cannot do it for a long time&nbsp;<i><b>consistently</b></i> without autoclicking.<br><br>What I mean is if a hypothetical person, Jerry says he can jitter bridge consistently. He tries to do it 5 times. First time he goes 34 blocks, second time he goes 45 blocks. Third time 37 blocks. Forth time 28 blocks. Fifth time he goes 39 blocks. Jerry is probably autoclicking.<br><br>The other hypothetical person is Tom. Tom attempts to jitter bridge 5 times. One time he goes 12 blocks horizontally. The next time he goes 15, the next time he goes 31, the next time he only goes 9, and the last time he goes 14. This is possible without autoclicking.

Well, I'll record a video. I have laby mod that shows my cps. And I'll do that bridging. That bridging style isn't that hard. It's all about moving. It's possible with 10/15cps as I'm doing it.
