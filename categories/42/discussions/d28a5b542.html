Just a suggestion young one, improve the formatting and general design of it. As it is currently; I am struggling to read the text in your ABOUT tab.

A quick question...when you say this is your work, do you mean the CTRL + C part? Since, it looks alot the the code in Sessp's about page (that was made before yours). Next time you claim it's yours, think about changing it a bit more than just editing one or two things.
