Hey guys, since I haven't completely left Avicus, I've decided to start a YouTube channel :)&nbsp;<br>After 4 years of not being able to access my old YouTube account, I've managed to crack the code.<br>I'll be bumping this thread every time I post a new video (and yes, there will be Avicus videos).<br>Find my channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/minibrowndeer" rel="nofollow" title="Link: https://www.youtube.com/user/minibrowndeer">here</a>&nbsp;:D<br><b><u><br>Latest Video<br></u></b><u><a href="https://youtu.be/n3wdd70uaLg" rel="nofollow"></a></u><a href="https://youtu.be/n3wdd70uaLg" rel="nofollow" title="Link: https://youtu.be/n3wdd70uaLg">Survival Games Montage (Cold War)</a><b><u><br><br>All Videos<br></u></b><a href="https://youtu.be/HsaFn-ULD5w" rel="nofollow" title="Link: https://youtu.be/HsaFn-ULD5w">SG #1 Leave the Lights On (Render Test)</a>

The rule is mean't so random people don't come on the forums just to advertise their videos from other servers. As far as I understand, it's fine as long as you post Avicus stuff on your channel at some point. It's a video hub not a single video.

When I was 8, I started making YouTube videos with these toys called Littlest Pet Shops. After years and years of doing the vids, I got really good at what I did :P Some kids at school found out though, and I got bullied a lot, so I just abandoned my channel. I'm pretty sure the majority of my subs are inactive anyways, so xD
