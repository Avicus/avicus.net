Also I want to be 100% honest here not many people would really purchase a profile picture, even for $0.90. All we would be paying for is a c4D with a background colour. The c4d looks cool and all but in the end there is no cool background, no photoshop effects, just a raw picture.<br>all a suggestion is that you put a bit more effort in those pictures, even if your only selling them for $0.90 because those honestly can take minimum 5 minutes - 30 minutes depending how advanced you are with c4D :P
