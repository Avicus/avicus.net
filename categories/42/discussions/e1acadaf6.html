I suggest putting "unofficial" in the title.<br><br>Overall IMO its not bad but it could also be better. Some parts are just boring, the text background doesn't fit in with the rest and In the video theres no IP. People won't go through the description to find it.<br><br>Some clips are also a bit boring and clips of you falling in the void are not the most interesting.<br><br>I would also recommend using the default resource pack. Even though you can easily see what block texture is what IMO it would still be better to use default as most minecraft players used default.

Gotta say its a great trailer but heres some of its flaws.<br><br><br>Some of the text didn't match with some clips and some of the clips were usually on the same map or something. Like if you were going to show Nexus, maybe show a gameplay of it and different Nexus maps to let people know what Nexus is in Avicus. Also, some of the text had its problems and the Nebula one was a bit off. I suggest that you would show the lobby, feature more maps, and when in Spectator mode, video clip the map (like a time lapse or soemthing) to show how good are the Avicus maps on<br><br>Anyways, overall great trailer and i hope you will continue doing more of these things :)
