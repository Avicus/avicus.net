It seems you are German? I'm only guessing from the flag. Anyways, really nice! If we decide to put an Avicus UHC series on YouTube, we could use your help to make some of those, especially when we do teams instead of FFA.

No. Plain no. What is it? Cinema 4D in 1 frame only. Anyone who knows how to use Cinema 4D could do this under 15 minutes xd.<br>No offence but it's plainly way too simple to make to even&nbsp;<b>ask</b> any type of currency, hard money or no.

Did you use Cinema4D? If so, I can help you with some aesthetical improvements that need to be made, as well as tips for renders that people like and would pay for.<br><br>Its a nice render, but it's not worth money.

There is a FX option called Wind... The point is that I made the conversion from the MC word into .obj to small

A better way of importing worlds into Cinema4D is through a program called "MineWays."<br><br>Search it up and watch a few tutorials, once you understand it it's much easier to use.

Lol, didnt finish the post... well the point is (btw I used Mineways) is that as it asked me for the scala I "quick-clicked" and the result was scala 1. The recomended is scala 8...<br><br>That also affects the flag, as well I know there is that option called wind. The thing is that as being so small, the WindFX was moving constantly the flag to other directions, not making it like I wanted.<br><br>Also it was quick done, was for myself and Just a test :P<br><br>Anyway, on the big renders I put all my effort into!
