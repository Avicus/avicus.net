It only takes practice! I learned Ninja Bridging in less than 3 hours practice. Breezily bridging though, will take many years to accomplish

It took me two weeks to learn ninja bridging ;-;<br><br>Nice job though :D<br>A few tips for ninja bridging: keep your shift-unshifts at a consistent and steady tempo. Right now it looks like you're trying to time it exactly. Don't do that; instead, just shift at a constant speed and you won't fall. Try to minimize the time you hold shift down, to bridge even faster.

lol, that is not even ninja bridging. that type of bridging was originally called fast bridging, basically because it is faster than normal bridging. ninja bridging is fast staircase bridging. get ur facts straight m8

Well, according to JKAwesome, that is ninja bridging, and he is like the master of bridging, so I have no idea.

I could be wrong :P<br>@Plaza he did staircasing in the video as well, so I suppose that counts.

Nice vid!<br>Just a suggestion, but I have always found "Ninja bridging," as well as all parkour in general, to be easier at a lower POV. I personally use 90 and find myself to be a much better block placer and bridger than I was when I was using quake pro.<br>Just a suggestion though... It's more of a personal preference.

if u dont want to shift+unshift all the time though, go to a corner of the block you're on and build from there. very fast and not as tiresome.

Agreed. It's a lot easier to bridge on a low FOV. The one that you're using right now makes it really hard to perfect the bridging technique. I personally play on 80, but I know a lot of people who play on default, and they bridge extremely well.
