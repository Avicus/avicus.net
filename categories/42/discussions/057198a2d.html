Hey guys, here's the first episode of a new map review series that I decided to start. I'll be reviewing 2 maps each episode, and talking about the rushing/defending strategies on the map. So for the first episode, I'll be talking about Senex and Formorgar. Enjoy! :D<br><br><h2><a rel="nofollow" href="http://youtu.be/KRq6d5YKc6c"><b><u>http://youtu.be/KRq6d5YKc6c</u></b></a><br></h2>

Thanks! Good rusher as always x)<br>It's great hearing your reviews on these maps, since I'm making my own (you already know) and I need to know from a very opinionated person what I should work on :D

You should review other maps, not just nebula!

Can you please turn your game sounds down a bit? They were quite loud in the video.

Because that's apparently what rushers do.<br>Also, he has an enderman skin which is dark, so it could be hard to see him visibly during the night (especially in void maps.)

I might do some Nexus maps as well, but I rarely play the rest of the gamemodes and I don't know any of the maps. If the game sounds are too loud, I'll turn them down a bit.<br><br>@croc That's correct :P<br>Before, with a full black skin, I was pretty much invisible in Quintus. You'd just see a bridge building itself. Now, you'd see a pair of floating purple eyes

I used to have a black skin, and on quintus I was bridging to a full dia guy (using x-Ray TP) and he couldn't see me :Pso I broke his monument and reported him (he said he used in chat and that was proof)
