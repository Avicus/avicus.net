It's funny but the one problem is I have seen other players do this team with enemy and they both get temp banned.

There wasn't anyone else in the game, so it does not give an advantage.

Since Zeus and Buster were the last two people alive, them teaming did not affect the gameplay forr anybody else.

Yea, If you are strict, they both would get banned for teaming with the other team..<br>but there was a mod so, it's okay (or not, IDK)

I think its fine to teaming on the different teams, but if there is people waiting for them to finish the map because that happens a lot in walls well I wouldn't complain because that looked cool but, I don't think anyone deserve an ok to break the rules because there a mod, but this rule is a odd one so idc
