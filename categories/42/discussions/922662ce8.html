Hey everyone! As many of you know, Tynvale stopped doing this series because he is leaving Avicus. He passed on this series to me, so I created this thread just for this series.<br><br>I made a video explaining the series, and what you guys need to do if you want to participate.<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhUg6cJP-oQ" title="Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhUg6cJP-oQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhUg6cJP-oQ</a><br><br>I'm thinking of some type of prize for the #1 spot for each week&nbsp;to keep you guys more engaged and sending in clips, so make sure to leave any suggestions down below!<br><br>The email to send your clips to is&nbsp;<i><b>avicustopplays@gmail.com</b></i><b></b><br><br><b></b>If you have any questions, feel free to leave them down below!<br>Let the series begin! :)

Well the only way I want to download the videos is from YouTube, I don't intent to use Skype or any other website for downloading files. Like Savage said, if you want you can send the video to him and if I decide to use the clip I can give the shoutout to your ingame name, or you can wait until you make a channel if you want.<br><br>You don't really need a "channel" to upload videos, if you have a gmail account you technically already have a "channel"<br><br>If you need me to explain just ask :)

Erm, so I finished the thing, but I don't know if it's really a play baisically I was doing commentary and I know you want the raw footage. Will you be putting music in the background or keep my commentary?<br>Also the video is quite long (10-20 mins) so I'm assuming you will shorten it?

Oh I see, not allowed then xD<br>Just raw footage is allowed.<br>By the way, I'm not going to judge the video too hard if your bridging isn't as good as the actual play itself. You can be the best bridger on the server but if the actual play itself isn't that good, someone who isn't as good as bridging could get a higher place than you on the Top 5.

It can be uploaded to your channel or you can make it unlisted. It doesn't matter where or how you upload it as long as it's on YouTube.

YouTube is just the safest way to download a video. Other links could have viruses and stuff, and it's actually just easier to download it that way.<br>How were you uploading the clip though? Was there a certain website you wanted to upload it to?
