Hello!<br><br>Welcome to the unofficial walls tournament. I am seeing the loss in walls players lately and I wanted to make this.<br><br><b>Q: When is it?<br><br></b>A: It is at 7AM AEST Sunday (Saturday for some Americans)<br><br><b>Q: What is an unofficial walls tournament?<br><br></b>A: This is where you fight against other teams on the gamemode "The Walls". The walls map will be springwood (First Round) and then Pirate's Cove (2nd Round) and then finally we battle it out on the old map "The Village". This is not the official tournament so don't think you deserve a rank if you win. The winning team's prize is going to be 7000 credits shared among st how many players you have in your team.<br><br><b>Q: What are the rules?<br></b><br>Obviously, The rules are the same as avicus' rules.<br><br>Extra rules are:<br><br>1. Do not complain that the other team was cheating. We will be the judges of that!<br>2. Do not try and persuade us to change the gamemode of this tournament.<br>3. Any teams that do not show up are automatically disqualified (Being 5 mins late isn't that bad)<br>4. If stomper kit used for skybasing (more than 40% of the team) you will be automatically disqualified.<br><br><br><b>Ref application:<br></b><br>IGN:<br>Skype:<br>(You don't need to be an actual ref to ref this xD)<br><br><b>How to enter<br></b><br>Just simple list your team below and tell me if you are interested :D<br><br><b>Current Teams:<br></b><br>Monkey Mafia<br><br><b>Things you should know<br></b><br>When we are doing a 4 quadrin map we don't use 2 quadrins<br>Each team had 8 per team. (This meaning, you should choose 8 players who you think will win.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Leave any questions below :D<br><br><br><br><b><br></b><b><br></b>

I'm not sure village is the best map to have 12 players per team because there are practically no resources... Not sure if there'd be enough for pirates cove either but definitely not for village. I know even with 3-4 people per team there aren't enough for village... Idk just a thought.. Also a lot of the diamonds on village are hidden so if people that don't normally play walls participate they won't know where the diamonds are and that'll be an unfair advantage

Don't do 12 players per quad. There will either be strategy a: (All go guardian and rush middle) or strategy b: (all go stomper and skybase). As a further note, could you make a rule against stompers? A whole team of them skybasing would really suck to play against.

I think 48 players is a tad excessive but I don't play walls so not really my place to judge.<br><br>also rilo that's a tad aggressive but yeah you're right, smitdalt use skype or if you are that attention seeking become some massive twitter or Instagram star

So I'm kinda confused on how this will work out.<br><br>If the final map is village, you'll need four teams, which means 4 winners from pirates cove, which require 4 teams per match and each team in that match will have beaten another team in springwood.<br>If you add up the amount of teams needed, you get 4 x 4 x 2 = 32 teams.<br><br>Not to be discouraging but 32 teams of 12 ain't happening, or are you sending first and second place from pirates cove to the finals? &nbsp;Or are you doing something completely different? I assumed because I don't know the bracketing of this tourney. So could I get a clarification? Thanks!
