Omfg learn to speak English this had NOTHING to do with Berzerk. This was an Cacalmarin scrim where me and UltraBubbles subbed since we were past members of Cacal. The other players were just sub's from ts, we weren't even trying lol. So if you call the actual Berzerk Vs. Bxtches scrim not a real one, this is even worse. Shove this in Google translate or something so you can actually understand what I'm trying to say.

Nova I'm not complaining. I'm just saying that Yes, it was supposed to be a Cacal vs. Eternal Cross scrimmage however, we had almost no players so we just took a bunch of random people who were on TS atm.
