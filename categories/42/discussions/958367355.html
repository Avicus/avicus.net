Hi shadowolf365! I am pretty impressed about your video. This is my first post xD<br>This is just my opinion. It's your own choice to use my idea.<br><br><b></b><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; ">&lt;Do You Like it&gt;<b><br></b></span>I really like it. I felt like I'm watching a real official minecraft trailer :D<br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; "><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; ">&lt;Do you want to see more?&gt;<b><br></b></span>I definitely want to watch and see more video about introducing Avicus Server! So that other's can watch this video and be able to enjoy more than before.&nbsp;<br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; "><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; ">&lt;How Often?&gt;<b><br></b></span>I was wondering about this question. My opinion that I thought of was once a month, or sometimes where new map release. However, the best idea I thought of was once if there's really big event. Not for only Avicus, but I recommend if you could upload more videos like this when it's Halloween, Christmas and etc.&nbsp;<br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; "><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; ">&lt;What should I name these type of videos?&gt;<b><br></b>Following the answer from above, depends on the events if you are going to use my idea. I would like to name it as "Welcome to Avicus" for the video you have linked above. If it's Halloween or Christmas, I recommend naming the videos like "Happy Avicus Halloween" or "Merry Avicus Christmas".&nbsp;<br><br>This is only my Idea. Use your idea if you have some. Sorry if you didn't like my idea.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; "><b><u><br></u><br></b></span><br><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; ">

I'm pretty impressed about your first post xD<br><br>The video was pretty good, but you should do only 45 seconds for each map as it gets boring after a while.

Okay so I think I interpreted this incorrectly basically record one match on the map cinematically then from there music and the other stuff<br><br>@Shinny<br>I like the once a month idea, but I might go with 1 every week or 2 weeks because there is alot of maps to cover over all of Nebula.<br><br>@PokerFace and @DaFrozenBlaze<br>I know its too long I will probably only cut down to 5 minutes long enough for people to watch and enjoy the experience and the environment of the Avicus Network

Since you are a media, why don't you make some cinematic shots of a tournament/league match? Possibly with shaders, it'll make it way more cooler :)
