Get a good mic, because a clear recording sound really makes a difference

Good luck with your channel :)<br>I will have a look at your videos and hopefully subscribe!<br>Also, i probably don't have the credibility to tell you this, because i only have 18 subscribers, but try not to say "umm" and "uhhh" too much, like i do :S<br>Wishing you the best of luck - OPTOBAT

As you didn't tell us the name of your youtube, I searched on your username and found a couple of things. I saw plenty of videos proving you cheating on other servers, using anti-knockback as well as aimbot&nbsp;and I'm pretty sure Avicus doesn't allow that either. As you already have an infraction on this server regarding aimbot you should probably stop hacking before you try to "become big on youtube" or even here on Avicus. <br><br>I expect you to sort this out, otherwise I don't really have anything to say. I'm looking forward to your videos, if you are playing honest, without hacks.
