Vip/YouTuber Ranks

</h1>
We highly encourage advertising the server on youtube, mostly for fun though. Many people have been asking what are the requisites for such ranks.<br>VIP: Around 5,000 subscribers- this is the one that people should aim for. VIPs receive emerald donor rank things- 2.0 xp multiplier. An example is Peckett- he will be making videos soon.&nbsp;<br>Youtubers: Around 50,000 subscribers. This is for major youtubers that join the server and make videos for us. These people receive all of the kits possible. An example is Woofless.<br><br>The reasons that we have such high numbers are lengthy. The main reason is that we dont want 1,000 VIPs running around, we want to make it special, yet attainable. Trust me, if you put a solid year and a half into youtube, you can achieve the VIP rank sooner than you think.&nbsp;<br><br><span>These numbers are subject to change in the future. Also, they are rough estimates. Certain exceptions do exist.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>To apply, please Skype me at gilletteracer</span>

A year and a half for 5000 subs? I've been uploading videos for around 2 years now and have about 300 I'm pretty sure, all with decent sound quality and in 1080p. I have 140 subscribers and am lucky to get 20 views on a video. Maybe I'm just really, really unlucky, but I think it's a bit harder than that.

I don't get why a VIP would get the xp multiplier, surely all they'd need is the ability to join full games. I don't do YouTube and never will, but if I had the VIP rank I would rather not have the multiplier, its so cheap.

Since this thread is revived, I'll make a suggestion:<br><br>Why not lower the requirements for VIP and YouTuber ranks? At the moment they seem extremely high. Why not lower them to encourage more players to help promote the server? With the small player base we now have, it makes sense to do whatever we can to publicize the server.

I think that V.I.P ranks and Youtuber ranks should be given out to people that are part of the community and care about the server, not people who can get what they want because they are a big Youtuber. This is my opinion at least!

Sorry for the bump but maybe have lower ranks (eg 1000 or 500 subs) with no perks, but just with the name tag? To recognise that you are going well on YouTube but you still need to earn the perks for 5000 subs.

I don't know. I think 500 to 1000 subs is a fairly easy goal to accomplish. In my opinion, the 5000 sub count can be easy to reach, if you focus on it.

I don't know. I think 500 to 1000 subs is a fairly easy goal to accomplish. In my opinion, the 5000 sub count can be easy to reach, if you focus on it.

Maybe 2000? It's just that there is only 1 person I know that is a rank. This rank would be just to recognise the hard work and achievements and not get anything other than a name tag with it.

I agree with Midnight.<br>If the goal was 500-1000 subs then there'd be too many people on Avicus with this rank. It is suppose to represent a goal that has taken a lot of time and hard work into it.&nbsp;<br><br>50,000 is too much but 1,000 is too little.<br>5,000 is fine in my opinion.

5000 subs seems like a lot, also by then 4000 of that person's subs will come on the server. Personally i like it that avicus is a smaller community, it would suck if the server had 2000 players on at once

I wouldn't really consider 500-1000 a youtuber, it's not difficult if you make decent videos and upload frequently, and on popular content. Too many people would get it, like how MidnightBeats said. I think's it's fine at the moment.

I think 5000 is a good amount.

That is true. I have said this before, it just angers me how people get Youtuber ranks on servers because of the amount of subs and most of the time they don't even support the servers. I guess that is making a video about the server is still helping it though.<br><br>I am half and half with all this, part of me agrees and disagrees.

You are misunderstanding the purpose of the youtube rank. It is so people that have a substantial amount of subs can play in peace without getting targeted the living crap out of.

I put a lot of effort into my YT channel, and I still only have 14 subs. It's really hard to get anywhere tbh, but once you're past 100 I hear you gain subs fast, but it seems like I just cant get off the 14 sub mark. I upload decently consistently as well. I don't think anyone who was an Avicus YTer has ever got 5000 subs either. I think the goals should be lowered, as no one has the rank.

You could treat it like you are going for mod or something, If you believe that you deserve VIP or Youtuber rank you can apply for it.

Applying for mod is something completely different. The VIP and Youtuber ranks are for people with a decent amount of subcribers who make videos that bring people to Avicus. It isnt something you just apply for because you think you support the server enough and deserve it.

If someone who has 5k+ subs comes on the server and makes like 3 vids on the server, they aren't really a part of the community and stop uploading Avicus videos or upload Avi vids very rarely, they should just have the rank removed, as I feel it should be for people who actively support the server.

I would say you should give the YouTube/VIP rank to someone who is willing to spend their time alot on Avicus, and record on it. I would say a minimum requirement of 500 active subscribers is enough, and need to be active on Avicus.

You also need to record some Avicus content. There is no point of having the "YouTuber" rank if you are not a "YouTuber" on Avicus.

I think 5k subs for a server like Avicus is way too much for vip and I think 50k subs is way way way too much for youtuber.. Maybe 200 for VIP and 500 for Youtuber.. That Is reasonable.. Right? As a matter of fact I am trying to grow my channel aswell :P

500 isn't really that hard to obtain.<br>If you put a solid year into YouTube will probably get at least 1000 subscribers.<br>500 is way too little in my opinion, since quite a few people have around that many.

I would say that if we bring it down to 2000 subs for VIP and 10 000 for youtuber. 500 is plainly too easy to get, much easier as 200. VIP = very important person. You aren't that important with 200 or 500 subs. Maybe on the server you are but in the world it isn't... it isn't close to the size of most highschools usually (1.2K). 2000 IMO should be max to bring down. For youtuber giving 10 000 would be fine to bring as minimum subs, that is when youtube actually aknowledges you and will start giving your royalties without having to partner your channel with machinima, freedom, e.t.c. But I personally like how we have it now, don't think we should change it :)

Even though I originally disagreed having the VIP as the rank name, thinking about what Bau is saying makes sense to me.<br><br>The only thing is though what would happen if a Twitch streamer that had a MASSIVE following came on, would they still get a 'Youtuber' rank? or a 'Twitch' rank?

There isn't a Twitch Rank from what I know of. I would say that either it would be made or the player would stick with VIP since "Youtuber Rank" wouldn't be appropriate since they do not do youtube but Twitch.

I don't think there is VIP anymore, I just checked Minkks' profile and his rank was 'famous'. Is this recent?

It probably is recent, but the rank "famous" has probably replaced the rank "VIP" but has all the same benefits, but instead of VIP (Very Important Peron) which can cause a few questions as of why he is very important but "famous" gives out that he is famous, it does bring the question why he is famous or how, but it's not as confusing as "Why is he Important?"
