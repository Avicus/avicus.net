Is it possible to add a hotbar setting? Like you can change the item each slot example: number 1 bow number 2 sword number 3 wood or number 1 wood number 2 sword etc. So you can choose wich layout ur hotbar has when you spawn it. Just add it to setting if its possible

No it's not as every map has a different loadout so it's impossible to actually set it up unless something is added where you have the ability to edit a loadout on a single map and do that for every map until every map has the loadout you want.

If the developers could be more efficient at their work, then it would be pretty simple to code:<br><br>- Make a container (Chest) that you have the option to open.&nbsp;<br>- There will be the loadout, and you can decide on what goes where.<br>- Hit "save" or whatever, and save the players inventory into a config file.<br><br>This shouldn't be too hard. It's really just time consuming if anything.
