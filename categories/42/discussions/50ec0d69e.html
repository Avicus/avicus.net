<p>HEY YOU BEFORE YOU SAY ANYTHING PLEASE READ THE WHOLE THING xD </p><p>Hey! My name is Parker or Parkr_ in game. I'm not actually new to the Avicus. I've been playing for more than 2 years. Your now probably wondering why am I introducing myself then? Well because I want to make more friends in the Avicus community and I've never fully introduced myself. </p><p>Avicus is probably my favorite server. Even though throughout the 2 years Ive only gotten 3 days in it, I still make it my #1 server to go on when ever I play Minecraft. My favorite&nbsp;gamemode on the server is Nebula. Something about Nebula makes me happy and proud that I found this server well 2 years ago. It really gives me a rush. I guess you could say I'm <b><i><u>decen</u>t </i></b><b><i><u></u></i></b>at PvP. I don't always get the kill but sometimes I do.&nbsp;I'm going to be straight up honest with you. I do swear sometimes on Throwback (Server I ALWAYS play on IF I can get in) if I happen to do a silly decision while fighting or getting killed by a hacker. I try not to though :L. Other than swearing... I would say I'm a&nbsp;pretty nice guy.&nbsp;My previous names have been; (Over the past year) ElectroZobo, _Zobo, DeadByZombie, 14andpreg (Im sooo sorry XD) and Parkr_. I hope this helped you guys know who I am a bit more.&nbsp;<u>(Minecraft </u>wise I guess) I hope to see all your beautiful faces on the server! As I'm typing this tomorrow is Easter so.... Happy Easter! For all the people that don't celebrate it.... Happy Birthday, Happy anniversary, Happy Half Birthday or just have a Happy Day! (Which should be every day!) BTW I do have a Youtube channel! If you could please subscribe! I plan on making Nebula content soon! <a title="Link: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwckAcX0-vXDWl-e_75Dv3A" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwckAcX0-vXDWl-e_75Dv3A">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwckAcX0-vXDWl-e_75Dv3A</a>&nbsp;</p>
