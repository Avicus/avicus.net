The point is to have time to place block, when your cursor points on the side of the block, while you are walking back. You should have a very good reaction and no lags.

I do agree that he may have sounded rude but you do understand that 21 cps is like virtually not possible. If you can make a video of you clicking that fast then we'll believe you. But the only way you can ever reach 20+cps is with an autoclicker that is the only way you could do that. The highest ever a person got legit on Minecraft was 18cps so obviously getting 21 cps is just insane and without any video proof nobody is going to believe you that you can perform that legit your fingers must be a special type because it's almost impossible

Can you prove yourself clicking at 21 cps? I can click very fast (not aiming) and I can only reach about 15 cps, although some people might be able to do more. However, I've never heard someone click at 21 cps without an autoclicker which is the point myself and others are trying to explain to you.

No I haven't because I didn't need to + you still can't do that even with two fingers jitter. I won't believe you unless you send me a video of you doing it I'm sorry.

Alright, just make a video about it lol, and put your hand in it showing you can do it. If you are just gonna argue saying you can do it legit, you're getting absolutely no where.

that screenshot gives the greatest evidence ever.<br><br>alright borrah, just give us an in depth explanation of how you reach this 21 cps, other than "I CLICK WITH 2 FINGERS STOP BULLYING ME OMG"<br>Because&nbsp;<br>1: If your jittering with 2 fingers on 1 button, its really unlikely your able to perform 21 cps without doing the butterfly method, which doesen't get results<br>2: If your using both mb1 and mb2 as right click or such, thats illegal.<br><br>To avoid this argument, just explain it properly.

Look, I know it sounds as if we're bullying you but please understand NOBODY in Minecraft has managed to click 21cps LEGIT and even if they did it once they would not be able to do it constantly without the use of an autoclicker or triggerbot whatever ok that is why nobody will believe you unless you have some <b>solid</b> proof. Please understand that.
