Hey people of Avicus, some of you may know that I make YouTube videos. I have been really wanting to do a 200 sub special and I've had an idea for it but I have been struggling at getting 200 subs. I started youtube 2 years ago in December and it's been tough getting myself noticed. I look over at porky and I see he has 300 subs within a year of youtube. I'm going to be honest that makes me feel sad and I always wonder "What am I doing wrong?"<br><br>So I am asking anyone who reads this to help me, give me advice on what to do better or even subscribe and help me out. Here is my YouTube channel <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/GreenQFrogger">http://www.youtube.com/user/GreenQFrogger</a>&nbsp;Thanks for reading and I love all of you.&nbsp;<br>-QFrog &lt;3

well i have to admit; you really aren't doing much wrong!<br>Your videos look inviting and have great thumbnails, your commentary has definitely picked up from your first few videos (so does everyones), your videos are funny and good quality and you have laid out your channel really well :D<br><br>But the thing is man, sometimes it just comes down to luck and patience, I'm sure Porky must have had a solid month or two where his subscriber count came to a bit of a halt, and it probably just took a particular video or time for the subscribers to come trickling in again :)<br>BTW sorry Porky for using you as and example :)<br><br>So yeah, man i think one day, the right person will stumble across the right vidoe and a chain reaction of views and subscribers may occur, or you might upload a video that stands out in a certain way and that gets you propelling to more subscribers.<br><br>Anyway, I'm just saying, don't get down on yourself and think you're doing too much wrong, because it may simply be a matter of time :D<br><br>Stay cool! - OPTOBAT

Good luck!<br>You're lucky, I was 2 years on YT and I was only 36 subs :/.&nbsp;<br>Continuous trying and you'll have 1k subs or + in no moment! ;)<br>But I wish you more luck!
