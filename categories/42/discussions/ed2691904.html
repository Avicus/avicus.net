This is a reference to John Oliver's accusation of Donald Trump's historical name. The content of the show, regardless, contained a lot of false information about the name, and he ultimately forced an unfunny meme that has no true meaning behind it. This can be proven and ruled in favor that his original name is Trump, and not Drumpf, and to put the claims to rest.<br><br>Fredrick Trump, Donald Trump's grandfather, was the one who was accused of changing his name. This, is in fact, false. Fredrick Trump on every official document is named Trump, and not Drumpf, contrary to popular belief. <a href="http://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article145558110/Donald-Trump-King-of-Kallstadt.html" rel="nofollow" title="Link: http://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article145558110/Donald-Trump-King-of-Kallstadt.html">Here's an article in German that proves the counterclaim.</a>&nbsp;It investigates the Trump name from a German movie that aired in 2014 (Kings of Kallstad). The confusion arises with the name's background. After Kallstadt was invaded by numerous countries, a lot of names had been changed over into new ones, even including first and middle names, as they were to act as new identities.<br><br>The first mention of the last name, Trump, ultimately was on<a href="https://books.google.de/books?id=PmrwtRTQ3fMC&amp;amp;pg=PA26#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false" rel="nofollow" title="Link: https://books.google.de/books?id=PmrwtRTQ3fMC&amp;amp;pg=PA26#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false"> page 26</a>. The first mention of Trump stems from Donald Trump's great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, grandfather. His name was Hanns Trump, who once lived in 1608 as a lawyer.
