Hello, BeanFive or Myv here.<br><br>Now, as a leader of a team, you can promote other people to be leader, which is all good. But, it could get out of hand- someone may be a bell-end and kick the other leaders, meaning they have successfully made a full takeover of the team.<br><br>As much as no-one wants this to happen, it is a possibility, because some noob may want to try to be funny and sabotage a team before a tourney.<br><br><br>The idea of a Head-Leader is that they cannot be kicked, because they were the founder of the team - they can only leave of their own accord and no one can force them to leave. They can still kick or demote leaders and kick members, but the normal Leaders cannot kick him/her.<br><br>On the other hand, you could also have Co-Leaders, which can kick Members and other Co-Leaders but not the Leader, because this is unfair.<br><br>Opinions on this? It would be really helpful imo.<br><br>Myv

I would agree with Lego. The only reason, to me, for having the leader rank, is to book and access scrim servers.<br>And to be honest, you should only give the most trusted the leader rank if you're paranoid about this happening

I think that this idea is good just some things could go into it. Say a player just joined a team and was given Leader. That player can't touch other leaders who joined before them. Meaning he can't remove other leaders leader and kick them from the team. The most time spent on the team the more authority over the new players. This would not affect kicking actual players that aren't leaders.

How about 3 team ranks?<br><br><i><b>Member</b></i>: Default rank , can only join scrim servers they are invited to.<br><br><i><b>Trusted:</b></i> Has all scrim server commands ; is able to book scrim servers ; Can kick <b>members</b>. can invite people to the team.<br><br><b><i>Leader:</i></b>Has access to everything , can kick anyone in the team . Also is the only one who can change others people's trusted/member/leader ranks.<br><br>Just an idea that would most likely fix this problem.

Trusted could also be "Officer" or something like Kohi squads does. Adding a "Trusted" rank imo sounds like the rest of the team aren't trusted. Just saying, but other than that, a HUGE +1
