Hey guys!<br><br>So, I decided to make a new channel, for the sake of starting over fresh. This channel will be Avicus and 1v1s&nbsp;<b>only</b>. It's called <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=RushWithJK">RushWithJK</a>, and the videos here will be much more professional, and better quality. If you've already subscribed to my old channel, please subscribe to my new one too.<br><br>Oh, and here's my first video on the channel. It is a trailer, to give you an idea of the type of content I will be uploading:<br><h2><b><u></u></b><u><a rel="nofollow" href="http://youtu.be/Fe_TJtjug6w">http://youtu.be/Fe_TJtjug6w</a></u></h2>Enjoy! :D

tbh it would be a much greater intro with music the whole time, for some reason around 2 min in there is a giant blast of music and the intro has music as well, otherwise in between the intro and up to the 2 min there is no sound at all. Not sure if its from my problem cause it sounded like my speakers were blowing or not but yea.

Nice, but instead of making your viewers feel like they have to subscribe by you saying "Please subscribe", say "If you liked this video, thumb it up and subscribe for more!"<br>Otherwise, nice video! I subbed. :)

Sorry about the silent part, I guess I should've checked it after I uploaded. It was fine when I exported it though. Also @maddy I'll remember that next time
