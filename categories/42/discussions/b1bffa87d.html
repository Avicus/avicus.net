Hey guys,<br>So right now I am using a skin I got off The Skindex. I did not make the skin, I just typed up "flamingo skin" and used the first one that came up XD. But it is time for a change.<br><br>If anyone knows how to make a decent Minecraft skin could you please contact me and get the skin to me because I am soooo terrible at making them...<br><br>Specifications:<br><ul><li><b></b>Flamingo body with human face</li><li>I would prefer the human face looks like this:&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://imgur.com/hz8dSw1">http://imgur.com/hz8dSw1</a></li><li>If the front of the shirt said MF that would be&nbsp;</li></ul>The third one isn't essential though.<br><br>don't get me wrong,&nbsp;I am not asking you to make me a skin, I am just asking if anyone enjoys making skins I am always a great option XD

I'm terrible at making skins as well, but I know<i> Evocal</i> has made many amazing skins for Avicus members. You could try asking him...

I know this isn't what you wanted, but&nbsp;<i>making&nbsp;</i>your own skin is very rewarding! I started making skins with simple tools like Skincraft (newgrounds). Eventually I worked my way up to using paint programs to make my own skins. It's super amazing and it feels kickass to wear your own made skin while fighting monsters and players. I would strongly suggest making a skin <b><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/571250">here.</a></b>

I finally made my new skin :D<br><br>I made it so it didn't have any flamingo on the skin. I don't know if that was the right choice not to make it a flamingo but I just like the look of the human skin.
