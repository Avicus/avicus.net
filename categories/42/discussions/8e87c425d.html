So I just spent the last 45 minutes or so spectating a couple hackers and trying to record them but my recorder's quality is pretty low, I'm currently using a program called SmartPixel, anyone got any suggestions or recommendations of any screen recorder that's free and the quality's higher than 30-50 fps? <br>I'm a bit frustrated as because I couldn't get some decent proof of these players in question and my connection started derping towards the end of the recording /: <br>at least I know one of the hackers has been dealt with by now but I haven't checked on his companion, thank you Emerald for taking care of him, I understand the servers are plagued with hackers now that Nodus has updated and it's really hard to keep up with them being such a reduced number of staff on vs the constantly increasing number of hackers, should I even bother to start a thread on the player reports with the footage I got of them? it is slooooowly uploading to photobucket as I write this

Open Broadcaster Software<br>In my opinion, one of the best, free game recording software<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://obsproject.com/">http://obsproject.com/</a><br>Usually used for livestreaming but can be used for recording videos!

I got OBS and I'm testing it around, a friend helped me set it up to record only but the video quality is still pretty damn low,omg Warrior ;-; you've got no idea how much I miss my mac <br>and Panda! I seriously considered using my iTouch when I saw how crappy the footage turned out, but wouldn't that be a little rudimentary? I might end up using that as a last resource though
