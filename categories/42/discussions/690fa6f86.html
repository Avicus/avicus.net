If we keep the server outdated, soon people will give up on avicus and go on a server that is updated.

Not true, I believe more players prefer 1.7 then 1.8. Even if the server goes go a little bit out dated its not like it also wouldn't be 1.8 compatible. They would make it 1.7 and 1.8 compatible.

Whatever people try to do Avicus will not be backdating to 1.7 Avicus would like to stay up-to-date with current Minecraft Servers. All do respect, Avicus will not back date even if it's about the block hits.

Block hitting and hybrid blockhitting were different things in 1.7, now they're the same.

Personally, I would love to see 1.7 come back, at least in tournament servers, since 1.7 is the best version by far IMO. Although, it won't happen. Avicus has updated almost everything to be able to be compatible with 1.8 only, so reversing it would be a pain for the developers, so I doubt they'd do it.<br>Don't get me wrong tho, I'm glad we're still in 1.8 at least and not 1.9.

I have a question why do people say 1.7 will make the server outdated, it makes no sense.<br>Look at all the 1.7 servers like Kohi or Badlion they have about a thousand plus every day no matter what AND ITS 1.7.<br><br>And look at OCN their 1.9 now and they are losing so many players.

Ocn devs are idiots, they messed up even 1.9 pvp. Now it worse than vanilla 1.9. Their reducer is awful.
