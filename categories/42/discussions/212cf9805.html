Nice work, Random_Guy!<br>It really showcased the new walls map, Grotto Arena. It also demonstrated how on walls being a good teammate makes a difference in the outcome.<br>Also, if you want to see a player's health while you're spectating, you can check out their health along with their inventory when you right click. It should be in the upper left corner.<br>Next time, it would be fun to see a video of you in-game playing walls!
