Rollercoasters!!!!!!! I just want you guys to keep in mind that this game was on Frostbite, and everyone was sooooooo bored. So to pass the time I built a roller coaster. There was a malfunction in which one fatality occurred... But it was funny as hell. The person that died was refunded and given full diamond armor so don't call me a dick (even though I might act like one sometimes :D ). Check out the video here:<br><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwIbF9B1pEY&amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwIbF9B1pEY&amp;feature=youtu.be</a><br><br><br>The guy that died was cool about it, so please don't go temp banning me again or I'll have to make another depressing video like this one:<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghH2rKySKmU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghH2rKySKmU</a><br><br>For those of you wondering, I've got another nebula with sfkwww video on the way to be uploaded this weekend, so YES sfkwww will probably be on this Friday if you want to play with me and him. UNLESS I get temp banned for no reason, in which case we'll play something else and: no sfk fo u!<br>So that should be incentive enough to be chill about this video and take it as everyone involved in the video took it: as a harmless joke. AGAIN: please be chill about it, hope you guys enjoy!
