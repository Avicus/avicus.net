Hey All! I know it has been along time since I have posted anything, I just have so many things going on in my life atm. Anyways, Your probably all amazed that there is finally a streamer for twitch, so please keep in touch with this post for when ever I notify you that I am streaming in the comments. Also, if you do follow to my stream account, you will always be notified every time I broadcast, so you can be an early bird even before the stream starts! Btw, if you do feel like following, it helps me out a lot, and pushes me to bring better content.  Also, if you follow, you will be added to the magical "Recent Followers" bar on top, and that bar is the best bar EVER! Well, Come if you please, and if you do, you have a chance to be on the stream if you play Avicus with me! (More Info Below)       Twitch Name: EznoGaming
      How you get there: Simply sign in or sign up to twitch with email, and then click the search bar and type in EznoGaming when I am live
        What I need from you guys: Following helps a ton! I really need the motivation if you want better content
              Extra Info For Nerds: The stream runs at 60fps, But I run at 30fps in-game. I also looked at my direct internet speed and added into my encoding files, so the stream looks as best as it can!
