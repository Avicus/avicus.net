don't use windows movie maker, it's not great for this. kind of low quality. of course, last time i used it was in like 2010 so i don't remember much.<br><br>if you get a cracked version correctly, with help, it shouldn't be a problem. i'd go for that, or adobe after affects / adobe premier.

Then you promote and ban Eric.<br><br>Also, I'd want to tell you, getting a cracked version is great, but Sony Vegas is actually a professional editing program, so, if you are too much of a noob to use it, then you should switch to Windows Movie Maker. If you want to update Sony Vegas, and it's a cracked version from like 2012, don't, or there might be errors durring the update, and you'll have to download everything again.

Lightworks, Microsoft Expression Encoder 4, VSDC Video editor, or the simplest one: Virtual dub. Virtualdub is like cut &amp; copy with some filters for extra stuff like zoom or fast forward.

If you get Sony Vegas and you think that you are too "nooby" for it just record a test video and just start testing everything in Sony Vegas, it doesn't matter if the video gets messed up because it's a test video.

Ok, if you want to make a good, decent-quality video, please avoid Windows Movie Maker at all costs. Yes, I know I recommended it to you yesterday, but now I remembered the horrible video quality I had on it a few years ago. Sure, it is easy to use, but not even considered an average video editor. <br><br>I would recommend using Sony Vegas or Premier Pro, either the legit or pirated version works fine. In my opinion, both are almost as user-friendly as WMM, so no need to worry about being too "nooby" for it :P If you need help, you can always search up videos of guides and stuff; those help a lot.<br><br>"What if I get a virus?" Isn't that what antivirus programs are for? If you don't have one, you should be asking yourself why you don't have one installed. Besides, most torrents won't come with viruses, and should be safe, at least according to my previous experiences.

<b><i>NO.</i></b><i></i> Do&nbsp;<i>not</i> ever use Windows Movie Maker. If you want to make good videos, I recommend Vegas Pro. I currently use Sony Vegas Pro 12, and it's really easy to use. If you want to see the difference between Movie Maker and Sony Vegas, you can look at some of my videos. The most recent ones are edited with Sony Vegas, and my earliest ones are edited with WMM. If you're going to be taking YouTube seriously, I recommend getting a decent video editing software.<br>Just crack it or patch it, there's no point of buying a $300 software.

<b>Basic editing and small youtuber (under 500 subs):</b> Movie Maker. It works fine, and I actually get pretty good quality out of it, even though everyone says the quality is shit, you just need to change the settings, like square -&gt; widescreen.<br><b>Big youtubers and/or animation/advanced editing:</b> idk just listen to everyone else

Basic functionality is pretty basic. You can drag any any media file (sound, video, gif, ect.) onto the timeline and rearrange it however you want. Creating moving objects and<br>zoom is a little harder, but still do-able. If you ever need any help hit me up on skype.
