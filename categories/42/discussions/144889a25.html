Awesome official AV newsletter! &nbsp;<br><br>Carrie I think that would be great for you to be the photographer, taking in game pictures etc. &nbsp;<br><br>Also any scrim pictures, I think the players should take photo shots of wearing their team "outfits" during those scrims, take team pictures upload for the newletter , discuss intense battles, etc. This newletter has so many possibilities (^_^)v
