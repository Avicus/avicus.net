Clip 1: lol people trying to detect smooth aimbot on a youtube video smh<br>Not cheating.<br><br>Clip 2: You had a lag spike for like half a second on the recording. You can tell because Raging freezes for a tiny period while your crosshair also freezes.&nbsp;<br>Not cheating.<br><br>Clip 3: Your aim legit sucks in this clip. You get a lucky hit and then a flick onto him in your turn and then you miss him.<br>Not cheating.<br><br>Clip 4: Obviously it's a weird flick but it's nothing wow<br>Fishy<br><br>Clip 5: Apparently people aren't allowed to aim/ pre aim now? Most dumbest clip ever lol. Not even a fucking lock, go to 0.25, slow movement.<br>Not cheating.<br><br>Clip 6: Ok this looks kinda sketchy. 1 hit in the middle where you look like you're not in the hitbox of Maraka, but idk your ping. Then you go over the dead body a bit, a bit like how a trigger bot would glitch. but it's minute and nothing major.<br>Fishy<br><br>Clip 7: Am I being told you're being partially banned for you aiming in a different way to how you normally do? This is legit the complete opposite of what an aimbot would do, aka robotically move lol.<br>Not cheating.<br><br>Clip 8: Don't see what's wrong with this clip? Like, I don't see what they're trying to point at? Is it how your crosshair goes on to the guy falling out of the world as you've gotten knockbacked and your crosshair stays still? What kind of 'lock is this'<br>Not cheating.<br><br>Clip 9: Looks a bit like a lock, but there's nothing to lock on to,you are already on the body when the lock happens. Looks a bit like a tiny lag spike. That's not what an aimbot would do. Looks a bit weird though.<br>Weird, but not cheating.<br><br>Overall, there's a few weird/ fishy clips, but nothing that outright says 'omg ban you're cheating. There's like 3/9 clips that look somewhat fishy. lol.

Well, honestly I watched every single video but I couldn't see anything sketchy. Maybe that's because I'm noob at this job. But what I can't understand is why seniors are using a stratus montage as an evidence? I don't think he is hacking but even if he hacks it's not avicus, seniors should not be using that as an evidence. Most people here are banned on some servers. Does it mean we all hack here on avicus? I hope you get unbanned soon <img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/50a34639abb34cf1b182204756c49f49?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/cellish.html" style="color: #2980b9">cellish</a>

You got banned off that? what lol<br>EDIT: Also Im pretty sure staff can ss so why didnt&nbsp;a staff member just ss you when you were online since video evidence for ghost clients and stuff are &nbsp;always so hit and miss.

Myworld6 has brought up how screensharing could lead to legal issues really anywhere in the world.

Slightest suspicion you'll be banned - that's how Avicus works now. Couple years ago and you would be under no scrutiny.

1. Yeah this isn't remotely close to cheating, unban the guy<br><br>2. If you have screensharing predefined in the rules, then it aint illegal if they come on the server and get ss'ed

There is no need for this thread. If you want to share your ban evidence then do it someplace other than on the forums as the thread is orientated around you and only you.
