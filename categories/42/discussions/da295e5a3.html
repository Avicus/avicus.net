Instead of pressure plates use buttons on crafting tables.

In that case I wouldn't really put anything there, but if I have to, would put plates. Buttons are destroyed by water.

You wont have time to make that kind of defense on that map.<br>In my opinion, you should focus gettin a 6-8 block high wall up in this area&nbsp;<a href="http://prntscr.com/azr3cm" title="Link: http://prntscr.com/azr3cm">http://prntscr.com/azr3cm</a><br>&nbsp;<br>If you would like, you can then make a bigger wall behinde that, but I never usually have time for that, and I barley ever get rushed nowdays.

Generally, I really liked that. But the very first wall might rushers help skybridge. You can make it lower. And I think you should make the last wall higher. That will disable sky pushes better. That's all I can say. Really good defence. I'm also a defender and I do similar defenses on Wahiz, too.

Always make your walls progressively shorter, the tallest in the back, shortest in the front, or else the walls behind will be pointless.

This will not help him to make defence better. Please explain him what to change or the thing that you didn't like. This will help him better.
