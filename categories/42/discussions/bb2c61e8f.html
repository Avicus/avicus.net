Hello,<br><br>The Chthonians are looking for highly intelligent individuals. To find them, we have devised a test.<br><br>1. This sentence is false.<br>a. True<br>b. False<br>c. Indeterminate<br>d. Meaningless<br>e. Self-Reference<br>f. Loop<br>g. None<br>2. 1 = 0.9 recurring (think graphically, and not numerically)<br>a. True<br>b. False<br>c. Indeterminate<br>d. Meaningless<br>e. Self-Reference<br>f. Loop<br>g. None<br>3. People who only study material&nbsp;<i>after</i> a test do better than those who do not study at all<br>a. True<br>b. False<br>c. Indeterminate<br>d. Meaningless<br>e. Self-Reference<br>f. Loop<br>g. None&nbsp;<br>4. What does "it" refer to in this sentence? "It is raining."<br><br>We await the few.<br><br>Chthonians

1.) G, it is a paradox.<br>2.) B, it has it's own numerical value.<br>3.) B, it does not help you if you already took the test.<br>4.) The noun of the sentence.

How does this define intelligence? What forms of intelligence does this target? Many people are intelligent, but are quite bad at brain teasers. Does this make them stupid?<br><br><br>This whole post seems very odd, to say the least.<br><br>But, I'd answer all of these as meaningless. It does no good to mull over these small things in life.

This would be much easier if I knew the translation for question N2.<br>The other 3 questions seem to be decently easy..<br><br>1. G, cause of what Sulorak/Michael said.<br>2. I need a translation for that. (?)<br>3. B, you already gave away the test so no.<br>4. A expletive pronoun cause every sentence needs a verb and a subject. The verb in this case would be 'is raining' but since there's no actual subject, one's placed by syntax (Expletive pronoun).

1.loop<br>2.true<br>3.true<br>4. actually it is an expletive subject.<br>But "is raining" is condition of your surrounding. So maybe it refers to surrounding, imo.

Don't wish to apply; this simply seemed fun. c:<br>1. F, (falsehoods are falsehoods are falsehoods... are false)<br>2. B, 1/infinity&gt;0 (infinity(1/infinity)=1; infinity(0)=0)<br>3. D, what do you imply by "do better"?&nbsp;<br>4. Would "it" not refer to the weather? The sentence "it is raining" is used to inform one of weather conditions, with raining being a predicate adjective. "The weather is raining"?
