It actually happens on Nebula, too. It is very rare, but sometimes when you get hit, you get knocked like 20 blocks into the air. It happened to me and a few other people as far as I know.

Oh I see, I thought you were trying to bash me.<br><br>How did your hack work, did you edit most of the MC code, or did you implement a module system? I made a module system, then I edited the Entity Velocity packet to check if the KB modifier was enabled, and if so,I would times the x, y, and z velocities by the modifier.

That's really wrong lol.<br>This thing is called ping. Lego hits him on his screen but the guy turns red only when the server gets the information that lego hit him and till the info comes back to lego's computer.&nbsp;<br>This video is completely legit and I see nothing sketchy in that, it's avicus&nbsp;CTH lol

Oh I see, I thought you were trying to bash me.<br><br>How did your hack work, did you edit most of the MC code, or did you implement a module system?

His connection seemed fine the whole video, plus, no one's hitbox is supposed to change, even with a hit delay, plus, I'm pretty sure I've never got those kind of hits and my ping is &nbsp;like 10x higher.

I never said his hitbox changed. If you'd look in 0.25x speed before what you screenshotted you can see lego did aim at him and the sword swinged, though the guy turned red only couple of time after because of ping. The guy flew really high because of CTH's fast hit glitch, which makes one hit register wayy to many times than it needs to

Complete autism,<br><br>If you analyzed the video properly you'd know he just landed 1 hit inside the hitbox and then the rest outside of it meaning there's no delay since the only hit he landed inside of it registered inmediately while the other 3-4 were completely off target.<br><br>I'm not accusing him of hacks cause I'm aware of the issues in CTH but I'm pretty sure he's been autoclicking for sometime now.

I will not pass judgement on this since I didn't personally see it or any evidence of it but since you got banned for using an autoclicker there has been a general idea that you do indeed use one. The Spookz joke seems like a weak attempt to take the spotlight off you.

The thing I dont get is, lego hits him but managed to hit him again but he didnt even look at him then he did another swing but still he isnt even looking at him. And lego looks like he had stable ping...

Here are the two theories that actually work.<br>1. KB modifiers<br>2. TNT KB<br>I side firmly on KB modifiers as the guy changed course due to a 2nd hit from Lego. There was also no evidence of TNT or eggs being used, the vanilla video would clear this up entirely (whether an explosion is heard)

Ok so what I've heard so far is that the only thing you do is jitter and you don't sprint reset. There's no way you could've gotten that much kb without sprint resetting unless it was a glitch.
