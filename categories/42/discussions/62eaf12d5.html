Please stop advertising your YouTube channel, people already know it's there and you have made around 7 threads. Please use 1 thread and constantly update with new videos and their links so it isn't advertising but people have easy access in their vids.GL<br><br>(you will need it considering the quality of your trailer)

Ok, my main problem with your trailer is spamming the forums. I believe this is the final post (not sure though) and I have checked the comments on your video which adresses the PvP clips quality so, as long as you stop spamming the forums with more posts I'm fine with it. Hopefully you can find a better screen recorder and you might have a chance :). So GL HF (no sarcasm this time :P)

Okay. alright i think were cool now :)&nbsp;<br>And yes i have definitely stopped making more posts, I'm going to stick to just one post for updates too :)<br>And I'm DEFINITELY getting rid of the watermarks and lag.<br>So for my next video, its going to be a lot better and if i end up making an trailer related to pvp i will try to make it more fighting, then sneaking, because lets be honest, about 90% of the PVP clips weren't proper pvp...<br>So thanks for clearing things up!
