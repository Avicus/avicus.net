Hey guys! This will be an AMA, except that instead of posting my replies here, I'll be answering them with my voice, and putting them into a video! :D<br><br>All you have to do is ask me a question, and I'll mention you in my video along with your question. It should be a lot of fun!<br><br>Also, check out my new intro!&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYo7GUGkuI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuYo7GUGkuI</a>&nbsp;(You don't have to if you don't want to though ;))<br><br>Without further ado... ask away!
