This is my first scrimmage with my new Avicus team; FiberGlass!<br>Sadly due to a combination of factors I played absolutely horribly that scrim. The scrim was also quite short so the video is only four minutes long (it's a highlight video).&nbsp;<br><br>Without further ado,<a rel="nofollow" href="http://youtu.be/g-j2Mdrm6dw"> here it is</a>!<br><br>I'd also like some feedback, do you enjoy song + voices? Or would you rather one or the other :)&nbsp;<br>Any other feedback about the video is also appreciated.

Yeah, no offence but it was really obvious most of your team had no idea how to play that map. There was no organised pushes, no stairbridge attempts. When you did get a stair you forgot about it and tried to make another. That and the fact you didn't hold frontline, you took right frontline once and left twice, but just tried to sword rush and not hold it.

Nice but maybe play on a DTM map since most avicus players have little to no experience with CTW
