Alright, so to be honest, rushing, as well as Nebula in general, has started to become boring for me. I've also been a lot less active on YouTube, due to the lack of video ideas. I remember seeing a similar idea posted by someone--think it was Smitdalt--and I thought it was a good idea. <br><br>If you guys could post some Nebula challenges, preferably having to do with monuments, I'll record myself attempting them and I'll post a video for every few challenges depending on how long each one takes. Difficulty doesn't matter as long as it's possible to complete in a single video. I'll update this thread each time I upload another one of these videos, and I'll credit the author of the challenge. Thanks!<br><br><b><u>Video list:</u><br></b><b></b>Episode 1 -&nbsp;<b><a rel="nofollow" href="http://youtu.be/WVlWldLvWRM">http://youtu.be/WVlWldLvWRM</a><br></b>Episode 2 -&nbsp;<b></b><a rel="nofollow" href="http://youtu.be/PbzZSZ-yHho"><b>http://youtu.be/PbzZSZ-yHho</b></a><b><br></b>

Break a monument with your fist.&nbsp;<br>Break all the monuments in quintus without dying one time.<br>On any map that you have more than 2 monuments, spawn and have only your pick axe and blocks in your hotbar, no armor and break at least 1 or 2 monuments.

This seems like alot of fun ideas. But it would be cool if there was Weekly Nebula Challenge on Nebula, where if you do a challenge you get awarded with EXP. It would add more fun to Nebula and more challenge.

Ooh, get a monument with your Minecraft launcher at the resolution 427x240 (you can set this under 'Edit Profile' at the launcher). This means you'll have to record your whole desktop with the tiny game window to prove you did it. Good luck! ;3

1st: Rush with only a pickaxe and sword in you inventory. Nothing else, no food, blocks, e.t.c.<br><br>2nd: get you hunger bar down to the point where you can no longer sprint and break a monument. Note: Your hunger bar must be down to the three icons left when you can&nbsp;no longer spirit or it doesn't count. Everything except food for when you spawn is allowed.

Rush in F5 mode (the one we're you can see the front of yourself and what's behind you). Or in other words hit the&nbsp;f5 button twice and rush in that view.

This seems like alot of fun ideas. But it would be cool if there was Weekly Nebula Challenge on Nebula, where if you do a challenge you get awarded with EXP. It would add more fun to Nebula and more challenge.
