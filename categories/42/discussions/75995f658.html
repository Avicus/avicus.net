Yes I am leaving this server, I will still post on the forums and I will come back after ivy and his team make a tourney again.<br>Here is my last video.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eZs6NECZOQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eZs6NECZOQ</a><br>A few things that I want to clarify for the video.&nbsp;<br>I am not leaving because I got demoted.<br>I am not leaving cause I got kicked out of Apex<br>I am leaving because I am sick of Ivy doing NOTHING for the server when it could be so much better. &nbsp;I am also leaving because there is almost no reason for me to stay plus minecraft has gotten pretty boring after 3+ years.<br>I had some great times but there is no one&nbsp;I want to post about on here.<br><br>(Let's see how many people even care that I am leaving, my guess is very little)

Sad to see you go :(<br><br>But I would like to address something. We can't take Avicus for granted, whether you like it or not. We all have lives outside of minecraft. Some of us have lots of time others do not. Ivy is quite busy and needs to find free time in order to push updates. Regarding the the tourney, as. I am on the committee, I can confirm that we need to wait for a plugin. That will be all for now.
