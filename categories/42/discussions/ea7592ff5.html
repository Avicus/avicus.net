I have made a YouTube Channel called TheIngigo. Now, I am currently making a montage full of me PvPing on Avicus and different gamemodes like Survival Games. What I would like to ask is what content would you love to see on my Channel? Survival Games, Nebula, Nexus, what do you fancy? Of course, I will record with someone else but does anyone want to record with as well? This is what I wanted to ask you guys and lasses out there! Also if you haven't noticed, I got Jr. Mod on the 6th of July so yeah! Thanks for reading and please let me know if you have suggestions! -Ingiout-

I'd like to see nebula videos. I could play nebula with you but I wouldn't be able to talk in the video since I haven't got Skype or teamspeak or anything else like that.

I'd say playing some of the unpopular Avicus games so that more people will play them.

I'd say Nebula. It's Avicus' most popular minigame, and probably our most iconic. However, I'd recommend doing some lesser known minigames, like CTH and Avicade. :D

Commentaries, though if you're not comfortable/don't have the hardware or software for it, do montages.<br><br>Honestly, just go with what seems best. I record whatever I'm in the mood for, whether it be Avicus, Soup, minigames, etc. etc.<br><br>Good luck! :)
