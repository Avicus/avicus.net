I laughed a little at the accents. But, I personally don't see any way of learning from a video game such as this one, especially in higher year, such as year 7, which was the one presented.

You guys need to view Minecraft from a different angle, when looking at it for the building and living or PvP you think "How could you learn from Minecraft?" Well there are not many subject areas where Minecraft can help with education I.E Mathematics &amp; English. But when in creative and creating buildings you actually don't realize that the creativity part of your brain is really active when designing buildings which is why Minecraft can be a somewhat use for Architecture for developing the part of your brain to help you create really good buildings when entering Architecture in school.

I am British myself. Though I have never used Minecraft as an education and never will... I don't see what's wrong with it.
