<h1><center>What do you wish was in Minecraft?</center></h1>

<center>As many of you may know, I love to make graphics and designing things. I recently felt like putting my creativity to use and start coming up with ideas for items I wish were implemented into Minecraft!<br><br><b>Here's my example:</b></center><br><center><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ePPssHJ.png" title="Tynvale's Sleeping Bag Idea"></center><br><center>I would love to turn this into a community video, so if you have any ideas please let me know them! Just comment your suggestion down as followed:<br><br></center><b>Name:</b><br><b>Crafting Recipe:</b><br><b>What it looks like crafted:</b><br><b>Description of what it does and how it works:</b><br><br><center>So it should look something like this:</center><br><br>

<b>Name:</b> Sleeping Bed<br><b><br>Crafting Recipe:&nbsp;<br></b>- &nbsp; &nbsp;- &nbsp; &nbsp;-<br>- &nbsp; &nbsp;- &nbsp; &nbsp;-<b><br></b>W W W<br><br><b>- &nbsp;= Nothing/Blank Space</b><br><b>W = Any colour wool</b><br><b><br>What it looks like crafted:&nbsp;</b>Basically look exactly like a vanilla Minecraft bed but with no legs/wood<br><b><br>Description of what it does and how it works:&nbsp;</b>This item willl work very similar to the bed. The main feature is removed as the sleeping bag won’t set a new spawnpoint for the player sleeping in it, causing it to become really useful when exploring new lands. It would be placed and used the exact same as the bed but is just missing a certain feature.

They can, just change the Item charge up of the sword to the highest value in the YML or something and you can swing with no charge time :)

I understand that a lot of people don't want 1.9, but that's not what this thread is about. If you would like to talk about 1.9 please take it to another thread. And if you have an actual idea please tell me, I have 2 at the moment

I'd like for a big portion of the community to be more appreciative and less whiny...<br><br>...Or maybe some other form of non-animal transportation? I'd suggest a hang glider, but that's already in the OpenBlocks mod. Not really sure if there's much else for that field, (besides planes and helicopters, but that wouldn't really feel right...) but I really haven't done much research.
