I really enjoy playing this server and I thought I'd share it with you. (Also I would've uploaded the more quality video, but it was to high, xD)<br><br><br>Also, I'm on the hunt for some constructive&nbsp;feedback of these basic editing skills, hopefully you enjoyed!

I'll just put these suggestions as points:<br><br>- If you're going to record and use slow motion, you should seriously consider recording at a higher frame rate (60fps+)<br><br>- I'm not sure if you can record Minecraft in 1080p but if so, this would also improve the quality.<br><br>- When you're looking around there seems to be a choppy feel. If it's possible to make the movement smooth it will also improve the quality. Otherwise the mouse shouldn't be moved.<br><br>- Incorporate some actual gameplay with the video.

1st: (I was with 60fps)<br><br>2nd. The quality Originally was higher however youtube couldn't take it. I had the highest quality possible with my video editor but unfortunately youtube just increased the time to infinity<br><br>3rd: Yeah, I am going to improve that.<br><br>4th: I'll consider, it's just more laggy when I record :P<br><br>Just random piece of information:<br>It was originally 20 minutes xD

Fairly certain it was 30fps, Youtube even sees it as 30. I'm not sure what you mean by "Youtube couldn't take it," as Youtube can take 1080p videos, there are videos on youtube that are 8k. I'm assuming uploading 1080p takes a while on your internet so either go somewhere where there's faster internet or leave it uploading overnight.

Well, minecraft says 60fps but idk :P <br>2. That's the problem. I did upload it at the night....... Well, I honestly don't know to be quiet fair. It was just increasing and never stopped so.... I presume it must have been a bug (or something wrong with the video)

You'll need a screen recorder that can record in 60 fps for example Fraps. There are others but that's a fairly well known recorder.

I enjoyed it!
