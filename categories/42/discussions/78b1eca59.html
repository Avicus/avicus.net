<ul><li>Objective: The objective is to break or destroy (with TNT) a core that has lava inside of it.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>Once the lava falls under the core a certain amount the other team wins.</li></ul>only one Core<br><ul><li>This game mode will include TNT for cannons or for destroying the other teams side for more leeway in the match.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>Timer? No there will be no timer the time will run out when the other team destroys the core in any shape or form.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>Large or Small map? Large maps will manly include this game mode better smoother play in the game , but some small maps can be included or sprinkled in to the mix.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>Why I think this will benefit this community: &nbsp; This will benefit the community because I feel like the main game mode people play is destroy the monument and this would be a better and equally loved game mode to play and would be a nice change of pace. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><br>If u like my idea please feel free to toss ideas around in this thread.&nbsp;<br><br><br><br>Pictures:&nbsp;<a href="http://imgur.com/TW7M3vf" rel="nofollow">http://imgur.com/TW7M3vf</a> <br><br>\<br>&nbsp;<a href="http://imgur.com/gHXPEy7" rel="nofollow" title="Link: http://imgur.com/gHXPEy7">http://imgur.com/gHXPEy7</a> <br>/<br><a href="http://imgur.com/wRVPVY9" rel="nofollow" title="Link: http://imgur.com/wRVPVY9">http://imgur.com/wRVPVY9</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sincerely Seamoose(Humblers)

I'm going to lock this due to what everyone else has said above. (Also some of these features will be available when Atlas comes out.)
