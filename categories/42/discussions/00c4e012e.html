I found this image while looking through old MineCraft screenshots of mine that I put on imgur a long time ago, and I'm wondering if anyone could perhaps tell me the name of this map, where I could find it, and if it could perhaps be added to Avicus at some point in the near future.<br><br>(As far as I know, this is the only screenshot of the map that I have. I don't remember where or exactly when I saw this; I only saved the screenshot because, at the time, someone posted an IP address for their own MineCraft server, and I wanted to save a pic of it so that I could check it out later. That server probably doesn't exist anymore anyway, so I think having that in the image at the link below shouldn't be a problem.)<br><br><a href="http://i.imgur.com/9wuFj1G.png" title="Link: http://i.imgur.com/9wuFj1G.png">http://i.imgur.com/9wuFj1G.png</a>

You can tell it's an old Avicus map when there are 3 stacks of steak in the hot bar.&nbsp;<br>It looks TDM/Nexus type of map.

It is what Vicewaterboi said, Lights Out by Mikeg542, an old ocn map, I'd remember the clock towers with enchantment tables on the sides any day of the week.

100% it is Lights Out. Trust me, I tried to make a revamp of it before OCN shut down.
