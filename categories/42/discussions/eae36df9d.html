<b></b>Hey everyone, OPTOBAT here with some fresh, exciting news!&nbsp;<br>First off, as the title mentioned, my friend, miningflamingo and myself, OPTOBAT have decided after a few weeks of feedback from players, planning, training (editing, commentary, etc.) that we are going to have our own YouTube channels!<br><br>Now i did intact get some negative comments when i brought up the subject a week or two ago on the server, such as: "No way OPTOBAT" "No" "Not happening" "It won't work" etc. but we are going to face the wide world of YouTube and put ourselves and personalities out there along with the server!<br>My channel is still in "construction" with a required channel art and a altering profile picture, not to mention my debut (first) video is yet to be uploaded, which will be a trailer for the upcoming Nebula series, BUT miningflamingo had advanced ahead and done the hard work of editing and preparing and he has uploaded two videos which i will put below. PLEASE, please could you click real quick on the links just to give him a bit of a boost with some likes and subscriptions - which by the way could result in us playing in a game and giving a shoutout with/to YOU! so please check it out, it means so, so much not just to me, but to him... His very first series is intact Nebula on this very server! So please give us a like and some feedback and keep tuned in! - OPTOBAT<br><br>Links:&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBITlOYi93Ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBVWyY4C12s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBITlOYi93E<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBVWyY4C12s</a>
