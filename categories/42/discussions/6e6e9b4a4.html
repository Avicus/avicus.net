Hey Avicus Brethren.. lol that sounded weird.<br>Anyway, I made a Horror Story because I had nothing else to do, and I am going to let everyone read it. Hope you guys enjoy!<br><br>And it is also pretty long...<br><br><br><b>The Printer</b>

<b>&nbsp;</b>

I looked at the clock wearily on the top of the wall. I was still
typing up my report for history class, and didn’t realize that it was already
2:00 AM. I rubbed my face and tried my best to stay awake.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;Much later, I had finally
pressed the last key which meant I finished my report. A small moment of
rejoice had blossomed in my tired body. I packed up my books and printed the
history paper. 

&nbsp;

For some reason the printer wasn’t working though. I saw the wire
stuck in the small socket. I checked if the switch was on, which it was, hence
it should be working. I shook the printer and started hitting it. “Why won’t it
work, I need some sleep” I screamed in my head. It felt like the cat caught my
tongue, silence was stopping my mouth from actually speaking at all. I was just
too tired. 

&nbsp;

I quickly jumped up on my bed and buried my face into the pillow,
trying to forget about the paper. I slept for about an hour, until I heard a
disturbing glitch noise coming from the printer.

&nbsp;

I awoke shocked and fixated that the printer was making sound. I
walked over to the printer and saw that papers were printing. There was one
continuous message that kept printing out. “Check your window” it said. Even
though I was really sleepy, that specific message made me feel like I was being
watched. I quickly walked to my window to see a tall distorted brute standing
at nine feet tall, just staring at me from a certain distance. 

&nbsp;

I quickly took out my phone and called 9-1-1. They eventually came
and looked outside of the window to see if the creature was there. But as
usual, the creature disappeared, when the police came.

&nbsp;

So as always, they didn’t believe me and told me to get some rest.
Now I know what you might be thinking, why didn’t I show them the papers? 

&nbsp;

If they didn’t believe me when I told them about the creature,
they would never believe me about the message on the paper, they would
immediately mark me as crazy.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As time passed I
tried to clear my head from this madness. That’s when I remembered about my
history paper. So I went to my computer and re-printed the report, and this
time it actually worked. I tromped to the printer and was about to take the
report, until I received a sudden phone call. It was from my neighbor, he had
said that someone with a withstanding height is opening your door.&nbsp; I hung up the phone, and tried to tell myself
this was just a dream.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

At that exact moment, I heard my front door creak open, and also
heard the printer make that infuriating glitch noise. I saw that another paper
printed right after my history report.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The paper showed a
picture of a mutilated and slaughtered body lying on what appeared to be my
bed. Under the abhorrent picture, there was a message. It said in a very clear
font, “This is what you will look like when it is done with you”. Again, at
that exact moment, I heard footsteps coming up the stairs, headed for my room

Great Story! Has all the elements of a great story in it! Grammar seems good, spelling as well! Just compete the story and use some more descriptive devices and it will make the story so much better. Or you could just end it at that, the way you put that cliffhanger was superb!

I personally really like the ending because you can make up what happens next :D<br>But seriously, this story is amazing. Like, I'm actually really scared right now just from reading this. You're an amazing writer with some amazing ideas. Thanks so much for the story and good luck on the next ones I (hope) you make! :D
