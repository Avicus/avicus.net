Terrific video, watched it all! :)<br><br>However, you can see who reported who, and I'm not sure if we're allowed to see that. Other than that, it's all good!<br>Here's a tip: If you can't find anything to talk about during the video, I would have a certain topic for each video, where you talk about that. Just an idea! ^o^<br><br>Keep it up, I subscribed! ^-^

That was really great, I like how well you examined what was going on :3 Few suggestions: As porky said, the staff chat and reports. Maybe blur it out, or if possible (I wouldn't know) turn it off. Also, move your mic closer to your mouse or turn down the mic volume xD I can hear your mouse too well xD But as it is one of the better Avicus videos I've seen!
