Well you seemed to be in spectate mode BEFORE you made the shot. So my guess is you actually shot a pretty far shot, maybe around 90 blocks, did /leave and then fly away. But I dont know how you could fly 1000 blocks :P. Oh well<br>Edit: you joined back :P Maybe when you join thats when the shot was made? Since joining makes you spawn at the spawn? idk :P

If you mean the round on the map, no. Plaza left to the spectator spawn and flew to get distance just like the shot with Gapple thing with the swaps to make it weird.

Senex 3, Make a long bridge and you'll reach flatland. This shot is not legit. (They told me how to do it)<br><br><br>This post is just to get attention from something you actually didn't do legit. (''I made a random 360 shot and hit someone'') sure.

@Detonator Yes, it IS finished, I took multiple screenshots right after we did it, and after the game was done.&nbsp;<br><br>@Killerbye We told you, doesn't mean you have to tell everyone. (You didn't, but you said something bout it)<br><br>@Shadowbladz I assume you're supposed to be in the game when you go far away from the spawn platform? But that would means you would have to hit a 1706 long bow shot, which isn't very easy. Second of all, if you leave you're an observer…<br><br>@Spicy Idc if you know my name, its not even my full name :p<br><br>

My theory: You built a plattform 1706 blocks&nbsp;away from spawn&nbsp;and shot panda in to the void. While he was falling you quickly left and joined the same team again.&nbsp;

You can't run a .java file. &nbsp;A .java file is uncompiled source code and therefore cannot be excecuted. You probably mean a .jar file.

@Rot *facepalm* BIG BIG BIG FACEPALM. if you didn't know, the highest you can stack up in minecraft is 256 blocks. Or should I call it height limit?<br><br><br>@Sunrise Abusing glitches? You don't even know how we did it, its not abusing. xD please don't make judgements before you know what you're talking about.<br><br>And btw, its not a server bug or glitch, its something you could do in a survival world, so its not abuse at all..

How can one executable file format be better than the other? If I had to choose, I would in fact argue that &nbsp;the jar is better because it is JVM Bytecode and can be executed on many different platforms.
