Notch is basically registered on all server. You can protect your server from fake notches with plugin authme. If your server is cracked and you have no this plugin then everybody can log in as notch!

You must be slightly cookoo inee da head to think that minecraft was created in 1980...it was created in 1969. Jeez, come on, everyone knows that. I was playing minecraft before I was even out of...ok lets end it there...

Guys, talking seriously, minecraft is not that old. Minecraft was created by Markus Persson Also known as Notch, in 2018, after the Fifa world cup in Russia. He was inspired on how the soccer/football players seemed like cubes playing it. Deal with my reasoning.
