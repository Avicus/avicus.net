Simple ones that could be made in YML. I am up for ideas because I personally think Avicus needs more content and I want to innovate + be more creative, hopefully give the playerbase more variety and fun<br><br>Questions can be posted below about them and go in detail when explaining a gamemode. I can provide maps btw<br><br><u>Idea List:<br><br></u>Other one was <i><b>archived </b></i>and <b><i>locked</i></b> because people didn't listen. Do NOT suggest <b>Blitz, CTW, DTC, or SG</b>. I want <b><i>actual minigames</i></b>, not copies or constant repeating. Be original &gt;-&gt;

I had an <b>original</b>&nbsp;idea! It was called Hostages where there is a villager in the middle and there is two teams and there trying to keep it on their side for 3 minutes! &nbsp;I also suggested that villager could give messages to you if your close by, it could be helpful, royal-like, or sarcastic remarks. &nbsp;What ever the map maker wanted it to say!

Temple run? Like a 1v1v1v1v1v1v1v1v1 etc. and you run while there is smoke chasing you? I mean there is Jerry and Harry but.. I think it could be a great addition :P

probably not possible but im still gonna say it:<br>hide and seek, you can pick a block like you would pick a kit in walls or nexus, premium ranks get more blocks unlocked. it could be original in that we would make our own maps, but like i said i don't know if it's possible.

How about One in the chamber? that is always fun! Or infection. Infection is where one person is a zombie who has to try and infect everyone in order to win. The last survivor is the winner!
