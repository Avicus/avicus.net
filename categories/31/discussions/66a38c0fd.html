Since I'm now a staff member on OCN, I partly represent it as a server. What happened here was uncalled for, and none of the staff from it have anything to do with what has happened. I give my sincerest apologies for anyone that witnessed, and was negatively affected by it, as a representative of both Avicus, and Overcast.&nbsp;<br><br>I have to make this a little fast, since I'm pressed for time, but if it continues, you will be punished here, and it may come back to you on Overcast. I can't confirm the latter, but it's a possibility. Again, I do apologize. It was an unexpected event, that I, nor any of the other OCN staff, took part in in any way.

Player(s) from OCN started forum spamming. Lots of inappropriate posts, I think a couple screamers. Wasn't fun.

I did some research on these people and they're all quite new to OCN.<br><br>They must have just heard about the friendly rivalry between the servers and decided to make the worst of it.<br><br>It's a shame really.

Looks like these posts went downhill &nbsp;very quickly. That's a shame.<br><br>The message was sent across, no need for it to be open anyway.
