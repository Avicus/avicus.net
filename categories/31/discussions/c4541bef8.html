I have a question, IF some type of other gamemode were to replace Elimination.. would people still have their prestiges they earned? &nbsp;Because I'm prestige 3 in Elimination and i don't want to lose it and I don't think anybody else wants to either.Or will they keep Elimination?

- Survival Games: Really fun, yes it's overused and definitely not original, but still really fun and got a lot of players to join. &nbsp;<br>- Hunger Games: Elimination is dead, maybe replace it with this to get it going again.<br>- Ghost Squadron: Super fun, don't see why it was removed :C

<b><i><u>Survival Games<br></u></i></b><i><u></u></i><u></u>My Reason says that back in the days of the mighty McZone, we were huge, we used to get 2500 players each day. But we had Survival Games back then. Now we have removed it, on average we get 500 players. I think that explains a lot. Survival Games will boost up the popularity. Also don't change things in Survival Games, keep it as the original Survival Games. Most people love Survival Games and because we don't lag much (Lies :P) people would come here. I have been on a number of Survival Games servers and the reason why I die most of the time... lag. If we could make Survival Games with no lag, many players would come to the server. To alert players that we have Survival Games we can advertise on minecraftservers.org by donating to them. Speaking of the subject, I hope that the banner that we would use will be animated so it would be visually attracting.<br>I know that PotPvP is being added to!<br>Have fun reading my massive explanation!<br>¬IngiOut¬ &nbsp;<b><i><u><br></u></i></b>

SG because it is fun. Although not so original, it can be quite the attraction and we wont have all players on Nebula and Nexus. We can have them all more spread out. Oh and replace Elimination with SG because no one knows what Elimination is without trying it out (not going to happen much) or being active on the forums. Elimination is basically SG, except in survival, not adventure.

Skywars, because it's the best and most original game of the four that are on this list. Also, it is awesome. SG would be my second favorite, and never GS because it's kind of boring in my, and a lot of other's, opinion.

<b>Survival Games-</b>This is a very fun game, there are many servers that have this, but those servers usually lag, have weird things (ex: Sky's server), and some have too much players and are almost impossible to join (ex: The Nexus). I remember the old SG in MC Zone, I just loved it. It had a good amount of food in the chest, a unique sword that had fire aspect, and stuff that were not too OP (Like diamond items).<br><b>Parkour-</b>I loved to do the parkour when you wait for a mini-game to start, I don't know why, but parkour over the void is just more fun than parkour in the lobbies of games :P. I also liked how the parkour linked to other places (I think it did?), it connected to the parkour server and was able to teleport the players back to their mini-game.<br><b>Factions-</b>Dont add if it will lag the server :P. But if you can add it, dont give doners OP items, almost every factions servers have OP kits and I dont think its fun, Avicus can be different and faction lovers will chose Avicus rather than others :O.<br><b>Old Avicade Games-</b>Please! I miss OiTC, Snake, and Ghost Squadron. I cant find much good servers with these games and Avicade needs more games. They may not be unique but Avicus does not need to be 100% unique, it needs to be fun.

Ghost Squadron:&nbsp;<br><br>I did find this game in Avicade a great contribution to it. Especially now that the games in Avicade are limited to only Red Alert and Minotaur, adding another fun PVP game would definitely make more people come to Avicade and also make it much more enjoyable. Furthermore, the sheer pressure and suspicion in Ghost Squadron really makes it an extremely fun and interactive game. Designed with a dozen kits or so and some fun and unique maps, this minigame could really work out.

Hunger Games.<br>Because there 30+ players each game and many games running. It was one of the main game modes people went on. Elimination has so little players, it was one of the big factors/ problems to the loss of players over the MC Zone to Avicus change. Nexus may have come back but as you can see, the increase in players isn't terrific. Also, many people talked about it on the forums, and there were various clans around, so for the people that played, it was very fun. Also if you do bring it back, please bring back the exact same, every single feature. I don't like the new xp layout (no offence). The leader board should include kills, wins and KD. Also the xp layout isn't noob friendly, however the old one was. There was also that awesome feature, where you could click on games and see who won and who get all the kills and who got killed by who and things.

Well i honestly don't know how adding either of these &nbsp;back will really attract more people, considering sky wars wasn't very popular to begin with minus that one tournament thing I saw on the old(x2) forums and that survival games is already implemented really well in other servers which i think we would waste our time competing with. That said, I'd still like survival games back because it was really fun to play, not gonna lie, and while I can get it anywhere else i'd rather just play here with friends c:

Sky wars.<br>Every once in a while I see players join and ask where it is. I think if it is added back it will raise the player count by 50-100 players or more. It was a very fun game.

I want to go with all of them to be added. I used to play all of them and suggested Avicus/Mczone to IRL friends. They didn't like nebula or nexus but, they did like Survival games. Slayingninja and I went to sky wars all the time. I have recently obtained a desire to play Ghost Squadron. Then last night when I was in the hub party, a random player joined the same lobby and said "Where is the Skywars?" "How do I get to it?" Then Zieno said "We don't have Skywars anymore." Then I started thinking, and thought about how many regulars there were for the MCzone games that were taken out.&nbsp;<br><br>Here are my thoughts:<br>I realized there were at least 20 regulars per game listed. If all the games were added it would give the players a new game to prestige in and I've seen people get board of the games we have now. The games will attract players from other servers. They will also give the map builders a new concept to build for.<br>I also came up with... if we take out some of the servers for not so popular games but, leave about 2-3 for each game then we have more servers to test with. Then we can take those servers and make them Skaywars, Survival Games, Ghost Squadron and Hunger games. Then announce in the hub only that they are there so, players will join them. Then take a player count of each game and see which one is most popular after a month of being there. Then make the conclusion on which one should be added.

Ghost Squadron. I know it sounds crazy but this brings back so many good memories from MCZone. And this is a game mode that not as many servers have. I think Avicus should be unique from all the other servers. So many server her the other options. It's actually hard to get into one server that doesn't have these mini games. And I think it would be easier to do levels and kits. But that's just in my opinion.

<b>Survival Games and Hunger Games</b>&nbsp;<br>There is already Elimination which is like Advanced Hunger Games with levels though I think replacing Elimination with HG would bring back lots of people. Skywars is pretty fun too but back in MC Zone, Survival Games was a LOT MORE popular. Ghost Squadron was also really fun but not many people played it back on MC Zone. That is why I think Survival Games should be brought back.

Ghost Squadron and Skywars are something I personally didn't enjoy that much. (Don't judge, I accept there are people that love it but I simply didn't&nbsp; I don't know why) But When I played MCZONE I played mainly The Walls and Survival Games. I actually didn't even play Nebula much at all, it was a really rare thing. <br><br>Personally if there was one wish that I could have come true on this server would to be just to remove Avicus completely, and bring back mczone. <br><br>I know a lot of people will disagree with this and a lot of people will agree, but this is just my personal opinion.

I would love to see Skywars added back! It was always glitchy back on MC Zone and I'm pretty sure that was the sole reason why hardly anyone played it.
<br><br>
Also SG would be great to have back, many players including myself would love to see it come back!
<br><br>
HG is the same thing as elim except for the glass dome <b>&gt;_&lt;</b>
<br><br>
And we might as well add GS back to avicade seeing as there are only a few mini-games on there, plus it's really fun to play!

Just realised, I meant to also answer :P&nbsp;<br>Personally I'd be very down for the return of Survival games as a pose to elimination. SG has a more nostalgic feel to it and I think we could really do something awesome with it. Sky Wars would also be awesome to have back as it was quite a popular game mode which I thoroughly enjoyed.&nbsp;<br><br>ALSO, MOST IMPORTANTLY<br>PARKOURRRRRRR

I think SG would be a perfect addition to the server. Its one of the most popular mini-games and would be sure to get more people to join the server. I think it should replace Elimination as was already suggested as tbh I have yet to see more than 1 people in there at all.&nbsp;<br><br>Maybe try put an Avicus spin on Survival Games though as just using the default version would be unoriginal. Like how Hypixel just renamed it Blitz games and involved a blitz star. Just something small to make it more original that you couldnt get anywhere else.

Just a suggestion if Survival Games will be added back; there could still be prestiges in that gamemode, and when you kill a player you get a certain amount of XP based on your rank, and you receive a larger amount of XP for winning the game.<br><br>What I would like to see is some parkour.<br>It's really fun to do when you are bored, and it is just a really relaxing and fun thing to do.

I have said sky wars where you could craft your items and get items from secret chests, I miss the part where you could get your arrows from that little button inside the tree area. &nbsp;I also miss when we would be split between teams and the last person of one or two teams would have run out of the enderpearl and would be like hey what tree island are you at and then that one sneaky person would have their last enderpearl and use it to get close and kill you while you were trying to hide muhahahha.

Skywars, I joined this server for skywars, I remember one time when you took it off you lost like 1000000 players so I recommend getting skywars back I donated so much for the kits etc. I also Like skywars more then nebula nexus and everything, skywars like the one you guys made is amazing not the regular skywars,<br><br><br>SG, Survival games over all is a popular game, I personally do Not enjoy it as much as skywars or HG but I think it would be a Lure for new players to come and then play other minigames so over all I think it could help the server,<br><br><br>HG, Hunger games was a pvp training game pretty much, it was extremely difficult to get in a game but it was very fun with friends and skype calls which &nbsp;makes the server more popular and a bigger name which can help with advertisements and getting the server back to 2000 people !<br><br><br><br>Walls, I know we have walls but the problem is we don't have enough players to make it popular again, I recon that you also wanted walls to be famous as well as nebula, Wallsmc.com is another IP for avicus so I think you wanted it to be successful.<br><br><br><br>I personally think we need over all more players so if we do get Survival games and as well as Skywars and Hungergames back we can be famous again and then walls will benefit in this action that you might take&nbsp;<br><br><br><br><br><br>Best regards, Cezbla

All of these gamemodes are unoriginal, since most popular servers contain them. If any, I'd have to choose Sky Wars overall. Ghost Squadron is a very boring gamemode, and not many players will play it. Survival/Hunger Games are all about luck (hoping to get good stuff), while sky wars was about skill than luck. Besides, there are less skywar servers than there are SG and HG servers

The reason those servers are "popular" is because they have these gamemodes in them. These gamemodes are proven to attract people more than new gamemodes as if people saw "Elimination" which they had never heard about and "SurvivalGames" which they have then they would more likely probably go for Survival Games. People like what they know.

I believe mineplex, isn't under those games, and have completely different gamemodes, which still makes it arguably the best server (average people wise) in the minecraft community. Besides, the only reason the big servers get popular is because a famous youtuber actively goes on it, they're a staff on it, or some other reason.

NO NO NO. We shall keep elimination... The thing is most people who play aren't not he forums and are noobs who are only there for nebula. They don't even know about elimination! Once I brought somebody random there and they were in love immediately! That's all they want to play now! One, tell people about elimination. Two, being in some add ins to attract more people! Literally it's the exact same as mcPvP but they have more people because that's what's advertised a lot!

<b><i><u>Sky Wars:</u></i></b><i><u></u></i> I started playing on MC Zone when I found in a page "Sky Wars server". I thought It was going to be very boring GM, but when I entered the server my life changed. I get surprised when I saw that 1.4.2 server with no lag and with TEAMS! (Blue &amp; Red). I hope you put it back on Avicus was, SO SO SO SO SO exiting game I ever played :P.<br><br>-If you don't like Sky Wars, you don't know the life of avicus. All avicus is based on Sky Wars.

We have Ivy the developer.. and relax man. Evo and Cow literally just retired. Give it a few weeks or however long it takes until replacements are found.&nbsp;<br>We have plenty of maps in rotation anyway to keep us occupied, too much almost. Patience can go a long way.

<br><br><br><span><i><b>Skywars:</b></i> When I first joined mczone, all I played was skywars. The game was amazing and very original! The map got changed the map to a new one which was still very fun. Later it was made that the chests were not random, you could not pick up items, there were no kits and more. Skywars got extremely boring and eventually no one played it anymore. If skywars was brouight pack in it's original form it would attract a huge players and money to support the server. Avicus would be amazing if skywars was added.<br><br><i><b>Survival Games</b></i><b>:</b> After skywars had no more games going on, all I played on mczone was sg. Picture the amount of players on nebula on an average day. Now picture 3 times of that amount of players. That is how many players would play sg on mczone on a normal day. The sg on mczone attracted so many players! The sg has no crazy items or enchantments like in nexus sg or skydoesminecraft sg and the maps were great. It was just normal and fun. If sg was added avicus could probably get twice as many players on the server.</span>

How about adding soup? Or as I've said in a previous thread I made, Soup PvP w/ a twist: Full Diamond armor and Tools/Wooden Swords, no soup though -_-. Basically you'd last just as long and not have to micromanage your health bar and hotkey allowing you to focus more on your strafes and techniques. Also maybe Pot PvP to go along with that.

I would like them all back.
