In my opinion, ranks should be moved to another user if the owner of the rank wants to because it's our money and we can do whatever we want with it even though you have it now in the server's credit card. It'll be a nice gift for someone too cause this is the most expensive rank in the server and christmas is coming in 4-5 days ^-^

<span><b>&nbsp;"it's our money"<br><br></b>Actually, once you purchase a rank it is no longer your money. That's kind of how buying anything works, you give them the money... and they give you what you're buying... :P<b><br></b></span>
