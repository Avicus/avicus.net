You can /report him or her to get a mod to spectate with you to see if he/she does it again the next round. That's what I used to do before I was able to record.

It is TeamTrolling because imagine this. You get to the monument single handed but a guy was following you. You were mining the monument then he runs into you and takes it. You were a second away before getting it. Now when you mine it, he keeps blocking you. An enemy comes up from behind and kills you both right before your team was about to win.

Monument stealing is where someone blocks another person from breaking a monument by walking in front of him (if that makes any sense.) It is considered team trolling.<br><br>It can be hard to detect without video proof (even screenshots aren't that effective.)<br><br>EDIT: ninja'd :l<br>In my defense I'm in school trying not to be caught by the teachers ;D

When someone blocks you, are you allowed to block them back? Because it happened to me and I got punished.

Lol no, you are breaking the rules if you do the same thing.<br><br>I saw this happen three or four times today, same player everytime, reported and nothing done about it. Same thing yesterday and the day before.

I don't think it should be an offense, in my opinion.<br><br>It is actually quite fun to fight for a mon, and although it can waste time, I think no one should have a right to get it - they may have to fight off their teammates as well as the opposing team.<br><br>However, it is&nbsp;<b><i><u>REALLY</u></i><u></u></b><u></u> annoying xD.

Is it considered monument stealing, when you tower accross to an obby, and someone quickly runs along your path and takes the monument just before you?

No. They have to block you while you are breaking the monument for it to be considered monument stealing.

It is exceptionally difficult to spot someone monument-blocking unless you are able to super quickly file a report, the staff member is extremely quick to answer your report and see it at the exact moment where he/she punishes the player.&nbsp;<br><br>This would probably only work on maps where it takes super long to break, like Castle Adventure.&nbsp;<br>After submitting a report however, we do keep an eye on the player after a while to see if they attempt to monument-steal/block anymore.&nbsp;<br>Otherwise, it's difficult to spot it and we're just going to have to deal with it. And never monument-block the monument blocker because chances are, you are going to get punished.

I would ban someone 10-30 days for monument stealing, 10 if he tries, 30 if it will work.

We know Moderators can punish someone for "Stealing Monuments" but, you need to undersant it's hard to open a screen-recorded in 3 seconds.. not everyone in the server has a good PC and screen-shots aren't pretty useful in my opinion so, try to make something against this..

I know not many people can, but I used to do this:<br>Everymatch I'd record. If there were no rule breakers, I'd delete the video. If there was, I'd upload it and then delete the file

You could download the Gyazo GIF program and hotkey it. That way you can record instantly, and 7 seconds is enough to record monument blocking.

I agree, this needs to end.&nbsp;<br><br>It's trolling, annoying, and keeps the team from winning. I can't tell you how many times we've lost a game because someone didn't let me break the monument, so the other team had a chance to come and kill us then they'd clutch the game and we'd lose. .-.

Holy crap i know right, people keep either taking my monument while I'm building across to it, they jump ahead and break it or they jump in front of me to stop me digging it then do it themselves or get it while I'm fighting people off i hate it and i agree with you<br>+1

This is probably the most annoying shit ever. It's frustrating when you did all the work to get to the monument, someone walks in your way so they can get the credit, then someone else comes and kills you both. GHAD.
