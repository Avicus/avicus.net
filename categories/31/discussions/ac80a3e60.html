tHey everyone, this may come off as weird at first but oh well..<br>I was just watching one of sfkwww's videos on rushing and realised how fricken good he was and how much it sucks that him and lots of other significant people have left, so i thought i would make a post where you comment any memories/ funny moments/ statistics, etc. of someone who has left.<br><br>For example:<br>I remember one time, on Frostbite, like 2 months ago, where we had a perfectly shaped, see through, glass, OP defence and we were loosing 3 - 1 and just as we are working on perfecting the hull of the defence, the match ends and i found out that Sfk himself has somehow destroyed our monument and we lost :( I couldn't believe it!<br><br>Anyways share some awesome memories and comment below :)<br>V V V

Sfk is back its just he has a different timezone then Eastern, Central and Pacific. So he would be on while we're in school. You'll see him on the weekends though he chooses to stay up till like 1 am or sometimes even 3 am lol
