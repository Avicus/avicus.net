so recently i have been looking through the new jr mods list (congratz!) but to my discovery most jr mods were donors. so would i have a chance at mods or would it be based off how much i support the server?

Most likely donators who want to support the server. As far as I know, you do not have to be a donor, all you have to do is write a decent application and answer the questions to the best of your ability in the interview.

I don't think donating has anything to do with it. It's just a lot of donators spend a lot of time on the server and are more serious about being a mod than non-donators, so they spend more effort into making their application and get accepted. But yeah, pretty much all the mods are donors :P

Donating doesn't affect your application one bit.

Applications are not based on whether you're a donator or not :)
