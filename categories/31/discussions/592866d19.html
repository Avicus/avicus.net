Not sure, Ivy keeps adding new features, so the update has gone from a small revamp to a complete re-styling and lots of new features, which has pushed the release back a lot.<br><br>He did the same thing when he was making Avicore, so I would count on it being released early 2015.

I kinda hope it doesn't come up, because there will still be inconsiderate jerks who think the hub will still look like "crap"
