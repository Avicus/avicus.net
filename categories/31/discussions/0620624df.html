I think most people mentioned on this thread have just asked their friends to do it for them, in return they'd suggest their friend.<br><br>@Zed&nbsp;<br>In case you hadn't realised, it's incredibly hard to tell sarcasm from something someone has typed, so I didn't know, and to be honest I don't care either, doesn't change the fact that you're being immature

I did say "i hope this is sarcasm, cuz if not...." Because i knew it would account for both circumstances. Either way it makes you seem like a begging piece of sewage waste when you do that.<br><br>Ever heard of double sarcasm? Probably not because i just made it up, its where you say what you mean literally in a sarcastic manner because you know it will be received poorly otherwise, but really that is how you feel and you want to put it out there. <br><br>There was no reason to be sarcastic there . &nbsp;There was no irony or anything that would make that funny, so whether you were sincere or sarcastic it still was kinda lame :/

I'm only good when my FOV is at Quake Pro, but other than that I keep it on normal and I use that for rushing. I feel somewhat under-rated mainly because I rush so much my K/D suffers a great deal.
