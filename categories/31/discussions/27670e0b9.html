It's just something weird that's been on my mind. Who was the most misbehaved user that you've encountered on this server and what did that person do? <br><br><b>It doesn't have to just be from Avicus</b>; it could be from another server or even another game.<br><br><b>DON'T POINT OUT ANY NAMES</b> (that'd be rude); JUST TELL ME WHAT THAT PERSON DID. <br>I'm curious :&gt;<br><br>I once encountered a user on a TF2 server who was hacking. If you don't know, it's very difficult to ban a hacker from a TF2 server. However, we managed to ban that person, but a few minutes later he came back with an alt account with the same hacks installed. We kept banning him and he kept returning with alts with hacks on them. It was so silly because he would just keep returning to the same exact server and not join a different one, and also because he was so desperate to hack and pretend he was good. I grew so tired of him that I just quit.<br><br>Tell me your experience with a naughty user. Lemme know, lemme know.<br><br>TheBron_cool

This guy destroyed the entire spawn with TNT (a map with a non-bedrock base) and made a one-block thick glass bridge. Then, he spleefed whoever came out from spawn off...so annoying ;-;

Oh my, back in the day, I was the most misbehaved Shaiya player.. You have no idea.<br><br>+anyone that took part in the Fally Massacre of 2006 (run escape) certainly were not the most lovely players.

<i></i>Yeah but so many people have done similar things I pretty much had to say half their names for people to tell the difference.
