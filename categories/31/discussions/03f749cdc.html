<span><span><span><span>Welcome back to another Plug.DJ session.

you "plug" into the hangout (haha), create a playlist of songs by
searching up your favourites on YouTube, and then join the wait list!
Once it's your turn to DJ, everyone in the hangout can dance, listen,
and have a good time to your song!<br><br><span><b>Cool. Any rules?<br></b>Basic behavior
rules apply. Don't be rude to others in chat, try to limit the amount
of inappropriate language you use in the chat. Any person found doing
this will receive a warning.<br><br>Basic video rules apply. Please do
not play any videos that may contain
gory/sexual/racist/homophobic/violent content. Any person found
playing&nbsp;such content will receive a warning, followed by a ban.<br><br>Have fun!</span>
</span>
</span>
</span>
</span>
</span>
</span><br><br>Also any suggestion for themes would be great!

I like the idea of a Monstercat theme maybe sometime in the next few weeks. As for the time we can't really make it 4pm EST because most of Avicus players are still in school at that time.

We will be hosting more European and Australian events soon. Just most of our team members live in North American very hard with the timezone difference.
