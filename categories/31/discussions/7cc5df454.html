Ok so basically here what we do is we tell what our goals in life are like what job you want, &nbsp;where you want to live, &nbsp;places you want to visit, what shape you want to be in, &nbsp;what kind of car you want, if you want to own a business. &nbsp;I'll go first but first I'd like to say sorry about my grammar and spelling and stuff like that I have mental disabilities so please don't hate.<br><br><br><br>I want to be a welder or pro paint ball place, I want to live here in Ontario or Nova Scotia in a normal size house, I want to visit most of my good friends I meet online, I want to be in peck physical condition I'm already working at it, I want a matte black 69 or 70 ss camera and that's all for me
