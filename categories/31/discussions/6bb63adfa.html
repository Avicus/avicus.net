Hi everyone!<br><br>I want to apology to everyone I have been mean to. I know, many of you hate me for it, I can understand that, and its ok if you don't accept my apology, but I am truly sorry for it. I admit I am a bad looser, I can be really mean sometimes. I want to leave that behind and start over again. The amount of people that hates me on this server now, scares me. In every game I join, theres at least one person that dislikes me. The guys/girls (idk girls) I have been mean to know who they are. I am sorry for what I've done to you, and I wanna start over again. I'm the person thats a bad enemy and a kind friend.&nbsp;<br><br>The reason I can be mean or scary, is because people piss me off. Not piss off, but make me mad. People call me eZ, bad, "teach how to php kid", kid etc every time I kill them. Thats what makes me angry. If people kill me and call me eZ, then I kill them and say the same, the blame is on me. Its not very easy for me to enjoy this server anymore. I have made like enemies with every "popular" player on this server (not everyone but whatever) and that makes everyone else support them no matter what. I mean, in the last weeks randys suddenly starts hating me, because I call "popular" players eZ. This is getting worse and worse now, I'm afraid I'm gonna end up getting permabanned for rudeness. .-. &nbsp;<br><br>Its just, you are not making it easy for me. When many people is against you, and you catch em up one by one, you make enemies with everyone. That is starting, if it not already has started, to happen with me.&nbsp;<br><br>I have realized this server has more community and friendship. People play here to have fun and have a great time, not to be the best. I am sort of like both. I want to be good, but at the same time enjoy it. People call me a no lifer, and "its just a game, and you play it way too much". Well, I don't, I guess I could call myself a good pvp'er, thats because I'm from the competitive part of minecraft. I am from the communities that competes to be the best. Thats why I am a bit cocky. I'm not cocky in general, but when people start saying I'm trash, and I know I'm better than them, it pisses me off.<br><br>I hope you can see it a bit from my perspective now, its not very easy for me to make friends on here, because of the reputation Ive gotten. I've heard people are concerned about me, and that REALLY scares me. I don't have any mental problems or anything, and I have a life if you were wondering. If I do something wrong, everyone hates me for it. People ignore me, hate me, talk shit to me and yea, I don't feel very appreciated on this server. People tell me to go kill myself, I'm not that stupid, and I don't get offended by it, but when people start saying that I should quit Avicus and stuff, it makes me sad. People think I am a bad person because of my reputation, so they don't give me a chance to prove I am kind. Thats why I want to start over again, before I actually will quit (I'm sure you wouldn't mind ;[).&nbsp;<br><br>Its not that I only have enemies, I have a lot of good friends on this server. They are the ones that makes me want to play avicus.<br><br>Well, hope you got to see its not that easy for me either. Also, I hope you accept my apology (you know who you are).&nbsp;<br><br>&lt;3<br><br><br><br><br><br>

I don't think that you are mean. That said, if you don't want to be called EZ or whatever, don't play a game that thousands of kids in their early teens play. It's inevitable.

I think I have played with you once or twice. Also I believe you, seeing as I didn't know of your reputation and didn't think of you as "bad". I think this is really shit, seeing as I thought(and still think) of you as a nice guy.<br>

It's understandable. I remember a longg time ago when I joined the server I played a lot of Nebula. I was "okay" at pvp. Players thought otherwise. A lot of people were mean and hateful towards me because I wasn't as great at &nbsp;pvp as them. So they would say "Girls should be playing with dolls and not games." , "Princezz you suck at pvp." "Leave the sever princezz, you're not good..." and "No offense Princezz but you should go on another sever to pvp and practice." I didn't care what they said, it hurt a lot tho. I never talked back to them or anything. I was too scared they would kill me if I said anything xD I know what it's like, and everyone makes mistakes, it wasn't intentional, it was a reaction. It's what people do when/if they get offended. I know people can be disrespectful and be obnoxious about "pvp skills", but in the end they'll just be jelly of your pvp :D It's all good we all make mistakes, but we should learn from them! :D

I wouldn't accept this apology with the fact that you don't have to get mad and write something bad every time someone writes something bad about you. Second if you think people are really calling you eZ or shiz like that in a constant rate, report them for harassment, that is if you feel uncomfortable with them calling you that and you already told them to stop. Third, you can go to another game if you really don't want to report or deal with all this things. I doubt that there is at least one player in every game that 'hates' you. Fourth the jokes that you make with panda are ok when it comes to you guys, but like Obsidianfire said, for an outsider it seems very impolite and rude.<br><br>I think that is all I have to say about this apology that you wrote.

What have I done to you that you have to tell me all that you say to me? Cause Hughsie1 and I agree that you make a fool of yourself by saying everything that you say in chat, tell me. Second if it isn't directly to me then to who is it, because I am pretty sure I am not the only on that thinks that you apologized to everyone and not a certain person, and as I said to you in game, if it was for a certain person, why not talk to them more privately on Skype.

I wasn't really finding you mean. You did tell me to 'Shut the **** up", but 2 seconds later you asked me politely. I was more confused than offended, but I tried to ask you what's going on to see if I could help but you didn't respond. Well anyway, I now understand. :P

Actually gab, you stated an opinion.<br><br>Anyways Plaza, back in my early Moderator days, I did find you quite rude towards members of the community. I was about to punish you, but then I was distracted...<br><br>After hanging out with you on Skype and Teamspeak, you were a really cool guy! We need to do our Teamspeak conversation with other users, if you know what I mean ;)

Okay, everyone, especially gab, is way over reacting. First of all, I read the first two pages and they are CLEARLY joking when they type like that. Its called typing emotionally, and you do different typing styles to display jokes "u ugly ked" versus seriousness "You are ugly, I hate you, I never want to see you again" Also if it has Ked in the sentence it is a joke. Also Gab. Seriously? Seriously? You are being a dick and you should stop. Then end. &lt;/rant&gt; Goodbye

@D00z ilu beb<br><br>@belguim I admit I was rude to you, but you were even worse to me? Out hate towards each other started because I killed you. You started raging at me, and suddenly, for no reason, you said you hate me. I even have screenshots of you saying: "I HATE PLAZA!!!!!", just because I killed you. Isn't that the purpose?<br><br>@Cobalt Ty, we need to make a map soon :)<br><br>@gonz Fatty me? Fatty u<br><br>@Jozz I remember. I was very rude then, even to you. ;( Even tho I know you know I'm joking about stuff, I wanted to really apologize to you, since you never did me anything wrong, you're just a great person. :)<br>And yea, we have to do that sometime *cough* ;)<br><br>@Hakkniv You just wrote what I think. Couldn't agree more. And anyways gave, you punished me for saying "stfu" to gonzo. 1. stfu doesn't HAVE to mean "shut the **** up". 2. If you didn't know, me and gonzo joke around all the time if you haven't noticed. And 3. you keep on saying "Hughsie1 agrees with me" "Me and Hughsie1 agrees that you are making a fool of yourself" Well, from what it looks like, people actually agrees with me to. :)<br><br>@Zeus thanks:)<br><br>@Emerald Same! I remember we played tighter trying to get you to level 50&lt;3<br><br><br>

Well well, what have we here? PlaZa, if I may, you have been quite, er, exuberant towards me at times. But to be honest, I knew quite well you didn't mean it (though that one time you insulted my mother for some reason kinda hurt :P) and that you were simply reacting. Here's the thing- don't react. It doesn't help. People can suck sometimes. It's up to you to be better, eh? :D Also, getting into a fight with someone who's angry is a bad idea. People say and do things they don't mean when they're angry. Overall, you're a cool guy. I got nothing against you. Good job on the post, my friend.&nbsp;<br>Oh my gosh this is too long. Cutting it down. Sorry for lengthy post D:

I've never seen you be rude to anyone, I think you're a nice guy.&nbsp;And whenever you were, it was completely obvious to me that&nbsp;it was sarcastic. Still, it was very nice of you to apologize to people you were possibly mean to. o/
