Guys, you all seem to think that just because Dinnerbone, in an early snapshot of Minecraft 1.9 that he even said was still a working progress and still very likely to be edited that PvP is going to be ruined just like that.&nbsp;<br><br>We do not play Vanilla PVP, most large servers are loaded with plugins: anti-cheats, YML, Avicore etc... I'm sure that devs of all servers will take into account what is good and what is bad with the new updates. The thing that seems to have caused the largest disturbance is the new clicking/melee damage thing.&nbsp;<br><br>If it really is as bad as it looks in that video then I'm almost sure that a plugin can and will be made that will just remove it from the server. Before people say this ain't possible it clearly is. The best example I can think of is from OCN so I &nbsp;apologise if this offends anyone. In 1.8 water pushes lit TNT which essentially ruins any real hope of cannoning. This feature of 1.8 is written in the coding of Minecraft, but OCN devs have just changed it, making it invalid on their server. <br><br>What's not to say all servers will simply not do the same with the new hit registering. Don't overreact, there is always a way to change things and what is set in the game for vanilla singleplayer can always be edited on a multiplayer server, if the devs are willing and they work then you can pretty much change anything.&nbsp;<br><br>So stop panicking. Jesus.&nbsp;<br><br>(I apologise if there was any bad grammar or spelling mistakes or just if something is badly worded, i wrote it all on a phone :3 )

Just go on YouTube to search Minecraft 1.9 PvP and set it to the past 24hrs, that's when most of the videos regarding this topic were made.

But then if all servers do do that, then what is the point in having it on? Most people play Multiplayer, right?<br><br>I don't understand why they couldn't have just put it on for Singleplayer...

No most players play single player and their is proof of this that came from Dinnerbone<br><br>And also to anyone who is still crying they made it so it can be a choice to disable it.
