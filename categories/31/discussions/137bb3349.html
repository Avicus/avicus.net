So much&nbsp;bureaucracy for such a small server.<br>Dont overcomplicate things.&nbsp;<br><br>For example, the staff spotlight does not need to be an official managerial role.&nbsp;<br><br>The staff spotlight was created to make the community more familiar with specific staff members in a casual way.<br><br>It's definitely not important enough to be an administrative task.<br><br>Unnecessary bureaucracy will cause confusion and frustration.

Wtf are senior mods doing then? Just ditch this pink rank and split the jobs equally among the seniors. Right now I don't see the point of having two separate ranks when it doesn't look like anyone but you is doing anything. Seriously making little sub tasks are only good if they get done.<br><br>And for the love of god I see all the seniors on the forums everyday and hardly post anything (expect for Greg &amp; Seth). Don't say they are doing appeals/reports cause they don't take that long to complete just be more active engaging with discussions while your on the forums. Also for the love of god answer my report &gt;_&lt; its been over a week. I'm not hating on the staff but seriously things are being over complicated.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Like I mentioned to you in Slack, I feel you are focussing way to much on this gritty policy stuff. I understand the leadership team (my name for admins + managers) want to revamp the entire staff policy in order to have a <b>strong base</b> before they start work on more practical projects, however it's been long enough and you need to actually focus on <b>improving</b> moderators, <b>developing</b> moderation systems and <b>creating</b> a more diverse, thorough moderation team.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I don't agree with some of the jobs you've listed such as&nbsp;<i>Staff Spotlight</i>, you don't need an entire role for this. <br>Who does the appeals and reports? The seniors?<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Furthermore am I tripping or did I not see a <b>staff team</b> assignments? Or are you all sharing staff jobs? Please don't tell me the seniors are doing that, because personally I think <b>replacing</b> server development with staff team would be better, but you know a lot more than me so I'll <b>respect</b> whatever you decide.

For all Senior members to put in their input on your app, review your app, and deal with maybe at least 30 more apps, deal with their assigned duties and in game problems. I wouldn't think that they are going to respond in a week. It's a process. Wait patiently.

It takes long because almost every player that checks the forums wants to be a staff member. A good amount out of the group gets the "Reviewing" tag and it takes time for staff to go through each one and talk about that players strengths and weaknesses. Its not a thing that you can take 2 seconds on, its a process. Always expect a response after 2-3 days, never bump a post.
