gg... I could see that you are trying to be better in PvP :P... You understand me xD<br>I'm the worst at pvp, but a tip is use the brain and think quickly, a arrow can shot you faster than you can do an iron armour :P

The arrow from a bow always comes out the right side, so when shooting from behind a wall always think of that.<br><br>Be as penguinful as you can.<br><br>Strafe alot<br><br>Practice MLG block placing&nbsp;<br><br>That's about all I can thnk of at the top of my head

It takes a lot of good decision making in the moment. there's a lot of strategy involved. deciding what way to strafe, how to counter a move, how to break a combo, how you're going to get them into a combo, are you going to duel then or hold off for openings?<br><br>there's a lot of strategy and decision making it's just in the spur of the moment

Lower advantage + strafing + No lag + practice + Combo = the master

If you are not finding it hard enough then you are not being challenged. I challenge myself and I find a lot of things I can work on

ik how to dubstep combo decently it's just it doesn't work very well with my style and i don't find it reliable imo. thank you very much though, these seem quite useful :D. I use a kind of version of this mainly, I strafe and tap forward.

To be honest, no other technique matters as long as you can aim.<br><br>If your aim is crap, then don't even bother trying anything else.

Some things in real life you can do<br><br>- Stay Hydrated<br>- Stay Warm but not sweating<br>- Be relaxed (easier said than done)<br><br><br>In game:<br>- Don't overthink it<br>- Try and see if the person you are versing does uses pattern and is predictable (mainly for long and extended fights aka potpvp)

It's much better if you teach yourself. 

<br>
<br>
Practise makes perfect too. Keep playing 1v1 servers (such as Kohi).

Splade and I were 1v1ing on Kohi and we're even skill so it helps. We're working on recording a 1v1 but basically I don't use a&nbsp;mousepad and he comes over with his laptop so he switches to my PC for 1round of his PoV and then I switch but the surface is different so my aim gets thrown off and I'm not used to having 1/3 of the FPS I usually do on servers (120/130 - 40/50)...<br><br><b><u>Note:</u></b>&nbsp;I'm way better on Kohi than in Nexus for any who say I'm not difficult or of equal PvP skill to Splade.
