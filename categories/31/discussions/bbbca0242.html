Hey guys, while I know this'll probably come as a shock, but I have made the decision to retire. After being a Mod for about 9 months now, I've grown tired of the same old routine (moderate, rinse, repeat). I've also got Sophomore year coming up (grade 10) which is a very important year, and I wanna focus a lot of my time on my studies. I might pop on the forums every once in a while, but you probably won't see me on Avicus (or maybe you will, idk yet), except maybe for an occasional scrim. <br><br>I would thank everyone who's helped me out throughout this long journey, but that'd take too long and they know exactly who they are. At the same time, I want to thank those who had ever doubted me not only as a person, but as a Mod. All I wanted to do was prove you guys wrong, and I honestly think I did. Also, thank you to the community for welcoming me when I first joined, and for keeping me here all this time.<br><br>Well, I tried to keep this short and sweet, but thanks for all the memories guys, I'll never forget them. Love you all :]<br><br>-Refuse
