So recently I've been 1v1ing some pretty good pvpers, and each of them had a different strafe tactic.&nbsp;<br><br>I'm not telling you to give out what your secrets are, just a shortened up version, like a zig zag strafe then a circle strafe.<br><br>Also, how did you learn this strafe? Did you make it up yourself , or did you get some help off a YouTube channel.<br><br>if its to hard to explain, then link a video you or another person made using the same strafe :P<br><br>Birdy.

I have my own tactics that I prefer not to give away. 8-blocking I will tell some people how to do. I circle when I 8-block. But I start after I get you in the 8-block so it doesn't matter that people know that. I'll strafe hard to the right and look for openings and I will change up the strafe from there depending on what you do, into a zigzag ofc. If your aim is a bad/off I will cut inside and circle usually.<br><br>Ex:<a rel="nofollow" href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=8BcIIi4TPdw">http://youtube.com/watch?v=8BcIIi4TPdw</a>&nbsp;<br>I blockhit way more than usual because he was using macros.

Ok, No offence but when I fought you, you barely strafed. And if you did.. It was terrible, you kept making excuses for you losing... I really dont understand your logic of trying to stand out...

I dont see it.. .-.<br><br>Other-wise for me, I just learned to click fast (At least for me I think it is ;-;) and I strafe and get combos pretty eZ

Please, he no potted you. Anyways, Ik know how to 8-block and that's it. Does that not help other players and give a good example? It also helps players learn the technique if they want. The thing is I have got a lot better since then. I still complain, but my complaints are legit. Kohi was laggy af as well. I was also lagging. I mean it's Kohi .-.&nbsp;<br><br>But back to the topic, because this really isn't worth either our times.

Not really, there are actually different styles of strafing. Even though it is just moving left and right, the pattern that you move in affects your strafe drastically.<br><br>@OP I usually use the Stimpay strafe, as well as zigzag.

Usually I rotate them then just either crit them if their bad or if their good just keep strafing (keeping in mind that while strafing you also need to hit them but not jumping, jumping can make it easier to see where you are going to go). &nbsp;Hope this helps :D

I just use some knockback enhancers and strafe with those. Here is how I THINK it works: When you sprint and hit a person, sprint knockback appears. Sprint knockback lets you release more knockback than just standing. But I believe there is a gltich, when you hold your sprint key down and your w key and hit a player, only the first hit is sprint knockbacked, the other hits after just give normal standing knockback. So you got to reset your sprint after you hit. There are 3 main ways I use to reset my sprint are: w release, hybrid blocking, and hybrid sneaking. To w release you quickly release then repress w after every hit. To hybrid block/sneak you quickly right click/shift after you hit.<br><br>I use these knockback enhancers (mainly the w release) to do AMAZING circle strafes, straightline, and other random strafes.

Can't go today, but I probs can tomorrow.&nbsp;<br><br>EDIT: @ebirdy if you want to watch someone strafe, watch Dualzz (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://youtube.com/user/RedstoneDualzz">http://youtube.com/user/RedstoneDualzz</a>). And another vid is My Avi and PvP tage trailer. Yeah it's my vid and I'm not trying to advertise, but I really&nbsp;want you to see&nbsp;the very&nbsp;start when&nbsp;I fight DaGoldBrick and watch the way he strafes. (vid:&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLmj1Ot34o">http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1oLmj1Ot34o</a>)&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;No, I am not trying in any way to brag by showing this vid. I'd get destroyed if he jitterclicked.&nbsp;<br><br>Also go to famous and good PvPers channels and try to take points from them. I'd be happy to provide a list if you want :)

I strafe wherever I feels like it or I just dont I really dont make up my own strategies or drive myself nuts over this stuff. :P &lt;---real comment. No need to read on if you're here for the actual topic.<br>===============Addressing the "other" comments ==================<br>Typical post in this argument: I dont wanna start a "Flame war" but lets start a flame war. IMO U Rely bad @ games. Now I won't respond until you do or I decide I have more to say to avoid a "flame war".&nbsp;<br>If you don't want to start a flame war just stop posting (not saying you're done then coming back moments later with "where you at breh?". You guys really care way too much about this game if you're arguing about who is better at a single aspect of it. How about we just dont comment about our pot pvp skills on a strafing thread and keep the posts to what the original post was about :). If you are reading this and realize "Hey who does this scrub think he is yelling at me!" calm down and realize idc and neither should you.<br>Please dont respond to this argumentatively, thinking I will respond to you and argue, thus becoming a hypocrite.

When I have to take out people who are more decked than me, I usually go left, then instantly start going right into a circle strafe then most of the time I jump through them to confuse them and kill them.

Honestly reading this enlightened me. Like, crap there's allot of techniques.<br>As for my personal "techniques" *cough* FAILS *cough cough*... they change quite a bit and are based on reflexes and such. Or if I'm eating candy and have a sugar high. I'm trying to learn actual strats &nbsp;though :P
