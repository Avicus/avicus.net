you mean weird not wired and your voice is different that how you hear it because you hear it so close to yourself+the vibrations your voice makes.

My computer's mic makes my voice much higher than &nbsp;it actually is (not high). So yeah...

I had to take speech lessons when I was a kid. I have a speech inability... and it sucks... it's embarrassing.<br><br>If it wasn't for that, I would be perfectly fine with my voice. If you haven't heard it yet, go check out Steven's latest video. :$<br><br>Edit: video got taken down so deal with it lads xPPPPPPPP

I think I sound much different than I actually do. When I hear my voice in videos I can't believe that's how I sound and I immediately become uncomftorable with my voice :c <br><br>I used to have a really bad stutter when I was young. If you frequent on TeamSpeak, I'm sure you've heard me begin talking and then freeze up and mumble. That's my biggest problem and I've been working against it for a long time. Although it's much better now than it was, it's still a problem. So, now you'll know why :P<br>

Same. If you heard me in real life compared to how I sound on TS, you wouldn't really think it's me.

Yeah I also agree, I speak perfect in real life but once I jump into team speak I speak and sound real wired.&nbsp;

The way people think they sound when they talk can be very different when you actually listen to it. Don't worry about how your voice sounds, its just the&nbsp;self-conscious felling. And to get back on topic it could just be your mic.

Yes. Technology changes my voice when recorded into a higher Pitch.
