Can you make the map easier to get across?

You should be able to bridge on the sides of the map or swim across. If this is not the case, I will add bridges.

Okay, I have updated the map for the following:<br><br>- Added 3 bridges (middle, left, right)<br>- Added iron supply by bridges (left, right)<br>- Fixed water lining by webs<br><br>Hopefully the swim thing isn't an issue anymore.<br><br>Will be tested on Luna again.

I have a slight problem with this. It's supposed to promote defending but this is the only map people already defend on.

This is a really cool map! I like how the map is focused on teamwork, not just a map that needs a 1-man-show.

Isn't the point of Nebula to Destroy the Monument?.. If you can't build over towards the monument then how is it going to be fun with like a bizzilion defenders and yet the people can't build over... One more statement/question.. What if the defenders build right to the "build line" &nbsp;and make a gigantic wall therefore attackers will not be able to mine the monument and the game will be boring.

It's supposed to be about teamwork but it's easy to get over that wall on the build line. Just use the technique I learned.<br><br><br>This map is about defense and teamwork. If your team can have both of those you win.

What technique is that?<br>Also, PlatinumWarfare is right, if they build right on the build<i></i> line, the only way in would be to break the blocks on the line.

You can place water outside of the build areas(you can place water anywhere but it doesn't flow) so you can use 2 buckets to make a water staircase to climb up walls.<br><br><br>Note: Para said you're supposed to do that in a game when I asked him

Lol. I didn't know you could place water outside.

Man.. the whole "can't place blocks" thingy would be a bit annoying. I understand how you designed this map to be more challenging, but think about it, most people are too lazy to do teamwork, they just want to win. Honestly, if this was a CTW map, it could actually work. Consider the red stone area. It would be the only area where the <b>other&nbsp;</b>team would have full protection from the defenders.. It's your decision. I really like how you added water in between the cliffs! Hope that you understand my opinion!
