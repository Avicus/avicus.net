So I have been one year on avicus and have been playing daily but of course not in the last 2 weeks because I have been on holiday. I love this server because of its game mode and the people I know have been very nice. My clan predators are also very nice, some of them practice with me and we give each other tips and tricks. But of course not all in the clan are kind to me, there is one who likes to annoy people in the clan and create troubles, I do not want to mention him or I will get full hate from him.<br><b>MY FUTURE PLANS</b>: So maybe I will be staying on avicus recording videos on I maybe playing half the time on avicus and half on other servers because if I play full time on avicus, it makes me get pissed off if I keep getting killed by the PRO people on. I will also be trying to get my&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;10 000th kill soon.<br>i wouldn't have made it without this guys: jozzy, pokerface_legend, holden58 and many others that I can't really remember.<br>Some of my memorable experiences are breaking all the monuments with people protecting all of it. Killing pokerface_legend with my arrows(not shooting him)<br>if you guys have any suggestion, just post it down below.
