Hey Minecrafters !!!<br><br>We're currently creating a Hall Of Fame in the Atlas Hub, and we need <u><b><i>YOU<br></i></b></u><br>Currently the Hall Of Fame we have looks a bit boring, so we would like to know what the best moments are from The Omega Championship, Road To Victory, The League and Battle Of Eternity!!!<br><br>We are planning on making scenarios in the Hall Of Fame to remember these moments, so please suggest them :)<br><br><u>Examples:</u><br><ul><li>Tazz Togglesneak</li><li>ProffesorUtonium has destroyed cave<br></li></ul><br><br>This is a serious thread, anything below that is toxic and off topic will be deleted with possible consequences.

Maybe you can add the recent promotions to honor the ones on who got staff/came back and add the recent retirements to honor their work as staff.<br><br>Or even add the Top 3 players in the Learerboards in the Hall Of Fame.

I think that if we can see the rosters at the time, we should add everyone on the roster of the winning team's igns of that tm with signs, maybe off to the side to avoid clutter. That would be pretty cool imo. I guess it will sound selfish since I've won all 3 tms and blah blah blah, but I feel it gives proper recognition to the players who deserve it, and that is why I think it should be added.

Maybe have the leaders head on the front wall, but behind them in a line you have the roster, it could look a bit ugly so it'd have to back out into a cave or something.

I REMEMBER NOW. The first tournament Apollo vs Crazy Beaners where it was the quarter finals on Boundaries and Crazy Beaners didn't have enough players and AT THE LAST MINUTE Apollo got the win for crazy beaners no showing and felipu was like "no please wait we are getting our 8th - he is having trouble connecting to MC" and then the player connects JUST AS SOON AS Apollo got the win :(. I remember that so clearly

I REMEMBER NOW. The first tournament Apollo vs Crazy Beaners where it was the quarter finals on Boundaries and Crazy Beaners didn't have enough players and AT THE LAST MINUTE Apollo got the win for crazy beaners no showing and felipu was like "no please wait we are getting our 8th - he is having trouble connecting to MC" and then the player connects JUST AS SOON AS Apollo got the win :(. I remember that so clearly

Eleventh prestige was a yellow sun-like shape. Twelfth, an orange sun; thirteenth, a blue snowflake; fourteenth, a green snowflake; and fifteenth prestige, a black blob that my friends and I would say looked like a sea urchin or something.
