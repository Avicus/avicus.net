Consulting Service

</h1>
Hello everyone,<br>I just wanted to tell everyone that I have decided to make a consulting service thing through which I can still help the community. Since I have straight A's, am in National Honor Society, and am a passed Admin, I think I am qualified to consult players, and even staff on this server. I would like to cover topics of all kinds, from school (tutoring), to social (girls/boys), to even advice on how to get a mod to like you (really anything besides pvp). I have privately consulted numerous people in real life, and on this server in the past. I think that it would be a good idea to just open up to the rest of the community and offer everyone this service. Im really just looking for a way to past time when Im lonely on my computer xD, so I think this would be a great way to give back to some members of the community.<br>Please post below, or add me on Skype (gilletteracer) if you are interested.<br>Thank you for your time,<br>Maxs

Lol perhaps you didn't get my joke xD. You're already a mod so, it wouldn't make sense to ask how to get mod xD.

I can 100% confirm that if you need some help, Gill is a great person to go to. In the past he's helped me with a lot of things, and I can't thank him enough.<br><br>I appreciate what happened yesterday, by the way. ;3

+1, but only he has power to add people to the channel. I would say that not even Ivy or anyone else would be able to because private information may be said throughout the course of the talk.<br><br>Great idea though, it's always nice to be able to talk to someone you don't know irl about your problems because they'll have an unbiased opinion.
