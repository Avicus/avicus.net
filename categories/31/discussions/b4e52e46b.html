</h1>
<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Without further ado, let me introduce the 3rd community update! As you may know, the goal of these updates is to inform both the staff and the community of recent events and plans, we also would like to introduce some recent changes and distribute some information.</span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><u><i>Manager Rank Debrief!<br></i></u></b><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As you are all probably aware, the admins have decided to reinstate the Manager Rank. As there has been some confusion and uncertainty about the rank, both Michael and I are fully able and willing to listen to any questions/comments/concerns you may have.&nbsp;</span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anyways, the rank itself has been created to fill the void in which admins have been floating in. Overall, the goal of Manager is to take up some of the more community related jobs that Admins once held. We are working towards gearing Admins towards more Staff and Developmental work. As you would then guess, we would handle community work. So far I have hosted a Megascrim, co-hosting the walls tournament (thanks to Seth's amazing work!), and have given away a gold rank to the winner of a Robo UHC. Personally, I feel like with time the rank will strengthen and grow more obvious in its goal. As I know a lot of you highly doubt the efficiency of the rank, trust me. It really has improved the senior team. It has allowed us to recruit fresh mods and overall increase our work ethic, and just in general clean up our acts. So I say this, cast away your uncertainties and look ahead. As the present may seem uncertain, but the future sure is promising.</span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><u style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b><i>Recent Bugs!</i><br></b></u><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Recently, the Dev team pushed out a new update. We are ALL aware of the implications it has had and the side-effects. Many game breaking issues have been resolved, so far I am pretty sure only scrim servers are really "broken." Anyways, we appreciate your patience. The whole Staff team feels your pains and completely understands your frustrations. Alas, with time and a bit of patience we hope to work out all the kinks that might be present. In the meantime, try and report all the glitches you come across on this website.&nbsp;</span><a title="Link: http://avicus.net/issues" style="color: rgb(3, 141, 210);  font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;

 font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As you can see, we removed a few departments but also added some. Note, the department of Events is basically just a Manager duty, however we think that a department might be a bit more beneficial. Again the same applies for the Department of Policies and Rules, we feel that only Admins should be allowed to handle such official and server-wide topics.</span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">We have also introduced Manager and Admin Departments:</span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);  font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><p style="margin: 0pt 0px;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700; background-color: transparent;">1.

They will have to keep up-to-date with what the moderator, and senior moderator team is doing in order to have a strong and valid opinion, in the event that a demotion may occur. One of the higher senior staff teams points , is to be more strict with demotions and staff warns, and to ensure that the proper people are being punished.</span></p><p style="margin: 0pt 0px;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent;"><br class="kix-line-break"></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial; font-weight: 700; background-color: transparent;">2.

Then how do they tell the community that they have been demoted? o_O<br>And if they look bad it's their own fault that they didn't perform during the trial lol

I somewhat disagree. I can guarantee they tried their hardest. Just because they applied and tried to receive a rank that helps out the community and failed doesn't mean that they deserve to be publicly shamed. I do understand what you mean, though. Perhaps not the best wording.<br><br>Besides, I for one want to know who passes and who doesn't.

It's not publicly shaming if they're mentioned in a post.<br><br>It's publicly shaming if you state everything as to why they were demoted, throw all the evidence in the text, and say "there you go" to have the community go at them whenever they go onto TeamSpeak or in-game for humiliation. Stating the obvious (because it's not like they'll stay on the staff page) isn't public shaming.&nbsp;Pretty sure the intention of the thread is just to keep everything transparent, including (unfortunate) demotions, and not to just make people look bad. There's not even really a side-effect to it, it's there and it should just be acknowledged it happened. It's no different from not being on the staff page anymore.<br><br><b>EDIT:</b> Think I quoted the wrong person.

The community doesn't complain for no reason. Perhaps they could go in more depth and make it clearer but they wouldn't complain to be a nuisance.

Meh, a lot of things have reasons. Although people do complain for no reason quite a bit. Anywho, what do you need clearing up?

Do you not understand that the information that is displayed about each candidate is to update the community on what happened to them? It's NOT to shame them.

It's updating players about what happened to staff members so fifty threads don't get posted asking what happened to a certain person. So far away from public shaming...

Instead of getting tons of questions like "What happened to ****?", just put it in a post like this. They are just informing. I guess if they ever feel ashamed or anything they could request for it to be removed.
