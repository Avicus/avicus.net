Dust Devils - Really good old map I love it. However monument is a bit tricky to get might wanna move it up some other place<br><br>Halcyon - Old, classic really fun map because it's the smallest map it can get stalematey some time but keep it<br><br>Teres - Remove, it's too big 3 monuments as well, 2 of them are practically next to each other and the other one is on top of the castle. Also, you only spawn with 16 logs and 32 cobble so it's not that great.

Im just going to give you all a heads up that it is going to be really hard to make a map like teres small without it looking weird.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; Basically, &nbsp;if you want the map edited to make it smaller, &nbsp;we will simply take that as a remove, as we have other more important things to work on to improve the rotations.

You can't make a map smaller xd<br><br>If avicus had a larger player base and the map was like a 40 vs 40, then it would work. But with such a small and declining player base (HINT KYLO HINT) you can't have big maps. But Dust devils works due to the structures

Having big reassessments took all maps at once, a lot of people didn't bother to give their opinion on them. Now, we're taking it step by step, and it's working.

Editing Halcyon and Teres would be really weird..&nbsp;<br>Dust Devils: I actually don't mind the stalemate, the gameplay is usually good. Either delay the spawning or move the mon back, away from spawn. Keep<br>Honeycomb: Gameplay is just bad, I always avoid it. Remove.<br>Halcyon: I like this map, though islands could be bigger to prevent kb abuse. But like I mentioned earlier, it would make the map look really weird. Keep.<br>Teres: Huge map, Mons are easy to get, stalemates are rare, but can happen. It's the mon placement that's a problem. Remove/Edit

In my totally unbiased and very educated opinion - Teres is the greatest map of all time, don't you dare touch it.

Removing and editing throwback maps kinda defeats the point of having a throwback server, keep all &nbsp;*and add Planks back pl0x
