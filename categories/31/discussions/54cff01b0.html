Alright so I want to have bit of a discussion about the server, staff, rules, tourney, TS, etc. Just give construction criticism about the the subjects I listed no "the server is absolute shit everyone sucks!" make sure you give reasons on problems and how they can be fixed. This should help the administrators and Sr staff fix some problems and become more open about things happening on Avicus.<br><br>Ps: Don't lock this its needed as a community discussion.

There could be a guideline created towards when topics are valid to be locked/what types of topics should be locked, just like there's one for the forum rules.

Good to hear on the new server hosts :D If the hacking player comes back, that would be their last visit to Avicus if they continue to hack. Most players who hack doit because they think they can get away with it. If they get temp-banned, they'll realize they can't get away with it and will most likely stop hacking on the server that they get punished on.

Meh, generally if someone gets banned for hacking they can appeal in about 3 months or so. In that sense, it is sort of like a temp ban.

Oh and also, if the server host hasn't been decided yet, I recommend <a href="https://www.minespan.com/plans">https://www.minespan.com/plans</a> The price is pretty darn cheap ($1.50/GB) so that you can buy more RAM. I'm not sure of the hosting locations however.

Of course bias can be worked on. Please don't use the "human nature" thing as a cover up.<br><br>Regarding the staff that need to be friendlier, it's not our job to tell them. Keep an eye on your staff and tell them if they need to be friendlier or not. I'm not entirely sure staff will take what players say seriously.

Well, as a community it would be kind of nice of you guys to help out the moderators. Of course, we will tell the moderators to loosen up. However, it wouldn't hurt for you guys to give them some tips or help sometimes! :P Also bias is a very trivial topic, it is kind of hard to remove bias, also I'm not using it as a cover up! :P Im just saying it is very hard and always will be very hard to get rid of bias.

Hehe, I've tried reaching out and I'm usually brushed off.<br><br>Also, bias IS human nature, you're right, but it's severity is usually a maturity and personality thing. They're pretty hard to weed out. However, I think staff should ask for at least 3 opinions from other staff that they would not usually talk to before they do something. It can help with getting rid of bias.

I wouldn't ban someone with the name "GucciGooch."However, I see what you mean. May I suggest that next time you report that to the senior staff, also if you would like pm on skype right now about that situation. My skype is ironsoldier_2000. :)

Well as far as I know, if you ban someone for an innapropriate name it has to be directed towards another person/faction/race/culture etc.

Monsterbash and Grotto arena were removed because they wouldn't work on a 1.7/1.8 server, but yeah I'd love to see them back. Also unique maps Polar has been making tons of new maps that have neat features just wish there was more like them.

I guess I might as well voice a few of my own opinions here. I'm not trying to hate too much on the staff or anything, but there do need to be changes.&nbsp;<br><br><br>Staff need to do more outreach to regular players, ex: a small staff meeting where community members can be invited to voice their opinions. Right now a lot of players feel they can't say anything without being ignored or punished.&nbsp;<br><br>Also I'm going to say it now and here. There are several people who have complained about the amount of bias in the staff system. There will always be bias, but you are right.

The bias is going to destroy this server. The favoritism among the staff is so obvious at this point, at least to me. If there could be 10 admins (I don't know if there can be more than 2), I can pretty much predict who they would be without deserving it one bit. And no, I'm not just saying this because I agree with everyone else or because I just want to upset the staff, I have strong evidence.<br><br>Disgusting.

I wouldn't disagree with the bias, but I haven't seen a single person offer a solution to it. Putting complaints about the bias gets us nowhere. We're aware, as much as it may shock you, of the bias in the staff team. However it's not as though the solution is as simple as /ban. As a community who is witness to this, YOU need to present feedback on how we can fix it. I'm open ears and waiting for help.

That's community bias, if its what I think you're suggesting. It's a good thought, but I can't see the staff team being ran by something like strawpoll. &nbsp;Honestly bias is something we can't avoid as a whole, but I'd personally like to crack down on this a bit (if it means anything to you).

Think before you do. One time, I remember I was in a really bad mood, and kept raging. A moderator, who's name will remain unknown, verbally warned me a couple of times, and I stopped. A couple of minutes later, some people were making jokes about the vine "DEEZ NUTZ". I said "Dont make fun of nuts" "I LIKE NUTS". And apparently that's inappropriate. I got a warn for that and I was really pissed.&nbsp;<br><br>Other than that, community is fine, TeamSpeak is fine, but Tournament needs to be more organised, and the staff is extrememly biased. The block lag needs to be fixed. Ive probably played a total of 15 hours since the Omega update, due to me being busy, and the block lag is terrible. I literally cant wall walk.

Let's say an admin steps down, the staff can vote on a senior to take place of that admin as well as have the community vote. Surely there will be no bias if not a little due to the fact that the decision will be based on hundreds of people.

Just a reminder to both the staff and community, this is NOT going to turn into a flame war, alright? I can see tension coming from both ends, I advise staff and community calm down. Remember what this discussion is about.

And you can speak for the entire community on their behalf? This thread is designed for suggestions and opinions, not complaints. It's a discussion. Send your complaints elsewhere. If they're on here, then you're doing something very wrong, because, as of the 10th time, nothing will be accomplished if we take everything out in small forum posts and not request personal help. I'm not busy like 80% of the time, I play osu! for a living. Send me a complaint, I'll forward it. Send it to an admin. Regardless, you're still contributing. &nbsp;We can't hear anything if you're whispering guys.

My thread has a quote from Kylo himself about the rule ;~; Can't say I do a lot of useful things, thought I'd get at least some credit x3<br><br>Anyway..<br><br>Server:&nbsp;<br>I've been on a lot of crappy servers in my time. Avicus is not a bad server, although it could do with some more players. We're constantly working on improvements that will make Avicus a better server.&nbsp;<br><br>Staff:&nbsp;<br>All I can say is, if you every have any issues with the staff, contact a Senior staff member. If you have an issue with a Senior staff member, contact an administrator. If you have an issue with an administrator, tell the other administrator. If that doesn't work, that's where I play a decent, not quite vital role. I wouldn't bother approaching us without evidence (even if it's a little vague, although clear and valid evidence is better), because we need to be top-notch.<br>EDIT: What I meant but "All I can say is..", is that I don't feel comfortable with going into detail with the staff team itself. All I will say is that there is room for improvement, although I've seen far <i>(farfarfarfarfar)</i> worse staff teams.. I've even been part of worse staff teams, it isn't fun.<br><br>Rules:&nbsp;<br>I see no issues with them. Feel free to reply to this if you see any.<br><br>Tournament:<br>We have had one tournament, and you're already throwing knives at us. It was mainly experimental, and I can assure you that future ones will be better. We will always work on making them better.<br><br>I can't comment on TS, considering I never go in it.<br><br>I'm rather tired at the moment, so this is kind of a mediocre post, but the above points are my honest opinion. I know there's some flaws on Avicus, whether &nbsp;that's with staff, tournaments, TS, etc., but I've been on much worse servers. Avicus is not a bad server, but it's not perfect. There's always room for improvement.<br><br>EDIT: Oh, this went south quickly. Uhm oops, my bad. I've also noticed that many people complain, yet a lot of people don't privately message a staff member about the issues. I'm always happy to talk about these kinds of things, if needed. You can't expect things to get done if you don't talk to people who can help make the changes.

I never mentioned any 30 line document, what are you talking about?<br>Also, I like how you should lead this community but it seems you want to keep ranting on this discussion, which I find it useless and pointless since it's just 1 more rank a player has throughout the long list including all the people with the rank. I don't even know why did I keep arguing about this, I mean, it's true that some people might compare this with the bias there is on some members of the staff but hey, that's none of my business, so, both of us including the rest of the people involved in this discussion should shut the fuck up and stop this once and for all.

Get at least 3 devs, make them interact way more with the community (pavilion did at 1 point but never after that), the admins/staff not listening to the community was the reason mcpvp died off.<br><br>Maps: Not necessarily a problem but I can see why some players decide to leave after their first time or so (bow spamming people off of the edge into the void isn't exactly a fun pvp experience).&nbsp;<br><br>Maybe be get a few more people uploading videos? I wouldn't mind doing this but the kind of people my channel would bring (granted only about 900 subs) would be too much for the staff and they'd probably be pretty toxic towards the rules.<br><br>Some staff are still terrible at their jobs. Imo an example of a good mod is zac (idk if he got demoted as I don't really care, he and Aerosmith were the ones that stuck out to me the most).

Sorry I'm a bit late posting this, but here are some improvements that I think the staff team, including myself, could make.<br><br>First of all, lenience is important as a moderator. Though our "job" is to punish rule-breaking players, don't be biased with punishments and/or abuse the warn, kick, tempban, and ban commands. What's more, I don't think we're being nice enough to the community. The point of being a moderator is not to abuse power and be condescending towards all the other players. And we also can't be all about rules, rules, and more rules, moderators also need to be socially interactive with everyone on the server in order for them to view us as kind people. PraecanoVenen once quoted, "We are not police nor robots," so please don't act like you're a law enforcement official who is only focused on rules and nothing else.<br><br>Secondly and lastly, I'm tired of whenever a player not part of staff suggests a really good idea, but when I try to get it known to everyone else, it just goes in one ear and out the other. Guys! Get rid of this illusion that staff are the only ones that can come up with good ideas for the server! After looking on the forums, I can see some ideas suggested by non-staff members that I want to be incorporated, such as a new gamemode suggested by Thyphis and a new CTH kit suggested by goldenwalrus909. My point is just because a regular user gave us food for thought doesn't mean that it's worthless. In fact, that's not true in the slightest.<br><br>For right now, that's all I have to say on this matter. Thanks for reading! :D

No, they're out. You get disqualified if you break any serious rules such as a player on your team hacking.

Actually, I think you can really influence your audience to join Avicus, and maybe Avicus itself can revise It's rules again to make it less robotic, at the end of the day, it's just a game, it doesn't really need to be that strict. I'd be really interested to see your Avicus videos ;)

It annoys me how some staff are not listening to the community. If people are complaining like 4 months about lag why not fix it? We are not complaining because we are just trolling we complain so you know you need to fix the darn lag that kills the gameplay, I somewhat agree with aphelion that some of the staff keep hiding behind excuses and cannot take constructive criticism. Good examples for staff that take feedback in a great way and take that as feedback and a point they need to improve on: Polar_Express, zacd56, Tynvale. These are some examples. Also staff usually just copy Wong sentence in your post and fix it instead of taking the feedback seriously. 4 months of complaining IS WAYY more than enough to understand people leave and will leave if you won't listen to the community. And deal with it, not listening leading to people leaving and server dying. So please take this note seriously and start working on fixing it because you always say yeah we are fixing it and working on it but well,, 4 months and I see nothing fixed. I hope you take that as feedback and actually do something. Thanks.

-Staff needs to be more polite torwards Users.<br>When I was playing Walls there was this person who was using bad language. We asked the person to stop and they kept going on cursing. We reported that person and we were tired of it. I then did a /stafflist and found a mod. (I'm not going to say WHO it is because that rude) anyways, I said' "Hey, can you please come to Walls, we have a person using bad language." You know what they say..... "No don't ask and use /report, Bye." No lie that's what they told me.... And I msg'ed them telling them we did use /report and they kept using bad language. But they never responded and they were still online.... I think you guys should say, "Hey I'm busy I'll try to get another mod or Hey I'm busy if there is no other mod on or say I'm watching a hacker," or something. Don't get me wrong, Some of the mods are polite but some of them aren't. You guys should maybe work on that. Also The block lag. You guys have got to fix that!

Not really sure why that mod responded that way, but most mods actually do listen when people use /msg.<br><br>Anyways, if you feel a staff member is being rude or doing their job incorrectly in anyway, feel free to contact Dutchis or Newcleus VIA Skype. :)

Thats the whole point to people saying map dev don't really tell the public what they're doing.<br><br><br>That said, as your disputing your opinions remember this is all a great because everyone gets to give their feelings toward the server without feeling worried they'll be archived. &nbsp;Remember to look at the other point of view so you understand the other's reasoning. &nbsp;I think the staff is great, I feel more comfortable with them these days but it could be better. &nbsp;Like what others are saying try to familiarize yourself with everyone in Avicus. &nbsp;I'm talking about the new guy who covers up the monument thinking its a good strategy. &nbsp;I think its a problem as a whole in Avicus where its hard to get in the community because everyones so close knit. &nbsp;@Murph_the_cat does a great job in walls getting to know everyone and I think it makes the community and staff feel more close. &nbsp;I'm sure staff get annoyed when as there playing there only spammed with questions. &nbsp;Remember that's a part of the job but we as a community need to treat them as players and not constantly bother them. I suggest having more information, maybe a weekly check in to get people on the know to whats going on. &nbsp;The Map Team has improved tremendously and I never saw the last tournament but it seems there is already plans to get it fixed. &nbsp;On the plans of new game modes keep the community in check of any plans, even if your interested of any, want some advice of new ones, or if you there is actual plans in the future. &nbsp;And not to forget, <b>accept feedbacks!</b>&nbsp; I know it might be hard to bite your tongue but remember 99% of the time they just also want Avicus to get better.

Actually, not every staff member is over the age of 15 :P Also, why is &nbsp;it that the moderators can't be quiet :C They know how to conduct themselves in a meeting, it's more the combination of both moderators and community members that will create chaos. The meeting would be like 100 people. Please don't be so disrespectful.

Yes, of course — I don't think anyone on the staff team (or any respectable person in the community) is decadent enough to be legitimately racist like that... at least, I'd hope not. Still, especially when regular players see those messages out of context, it gives them a poor impression of what "really" happens between moderators. Even I felt a negative vibe from the staff chat when I was a junior moderator, because it seemed like no one took their role seriously, and that everything was one big joke.

If we have it that way, Avicus is going to be smaller than it already is. People wouldn't be able to get a chance to learn from their mistakes.

We will never get anywhere if you still hide behind excuses, as PieZ said, something is wrong and we need to solve it.

I was never trying to pin the blame on anybody, since I guess we're all contributing to the problem equally. If both the community and staff put their heads together, I believe we can achieve a whole lot.

You know, I made a great suggestion if anyone bothered to read that the staff should make a weekly newsletter on any plans, concerns, or update on all Avicus. &nbsp;I also suggested mods go out of their way to meet new players to make people feel comfortable. &nbsp;And I also suggested that the community would not constantly ask questions or bother mods while they are playing.

Honestly the staff chat, I am gonna say was a COMPLETE clusterfuck occasionally with no rules being implemented.<br>It's fine to fuck around and have all the banter but when people were actually talking about important stuff (eg: jrs were requesting a temp ban or a mod to look at a potential hacker) sometimes the chat would be filled with pointless jokes that would prattle on for a fucking eternity. It's FINE to joke around, but there is a time and place for that.&nbsp;<br>As for the racism issue, I have seen it go on, however it's a very small minority and like Tino said it's not a big deal and it's with the purpose of humor and not actual genuine racism (I'm not justifying it, just mentioning it)

I second this point. Countless times I've seen senior staff being immature on TS, the forums, or even in-game. I thought one of the requirements of being a moderator, even, was to be mature.

I personally don't think a moderator reassessment is needed, but a reassessment of the senior staff is needed. If you want to get rid of lazy mods and bias ones you need to get rid of the people promoting them.

I am going to think this post is a joke because I said this all comes with balance. &nbsp;<br><br>1.

I know they signed up for it but be considerate of other people.<br><br>I'm sure your not trying to come off cynical but dismissing any ideas someone has might be a reason there is progression with the staff/community relationship. &nbsp;I can't see why anyone would dislike the idea of meeting new Avicus players, have a balance of asking mods but don't come off annoying, and updating people on Avicus.

I understand that sometimes the staff sit up in the moderator lounges, however sometimes it is due to them being afk. (It could still be worked on a little bit though)<br><br>Personally I'd like to see a community + staff meeting. That way, both sides could talk to each other directly.

I would like to point out that most of the senior staff and a few of the moderators are in their own private circle. I suggest to be more approachable and to talk to people regardless of status.

Sometimes its jusr easier to mute your sound and go if you're in a hurry or you dont feel like switching channels.<br><br>But i see your point. I (and others) get moved to the afk channel by staff members yet they dont even bother to go the afk channels themselves, l0l.

I'm just going to re bump this. So that the discussion regarding the rules, staff, ts and future tourneys can continue.<br><br>My opinions: <br>Tourney's<br>CTW: I think that the next tourney or the one after it should be Capture The Wool. Since this gamemode couldn't be used in the Omega Championship for being too new. It would also bring a lot more teams/players from other objective servers like ocn.<br><br>Walls: I don't care when this is but it needs to happen, its not the second most played gamemode for nothing.<br><br>Staff: Make a lot of changes, full reassessment. Way too many inactive mods, biased/rude senior mods change is needed badly.<br><br>Rules: More things need to be added to the official rules set like banning for ddos threats. Also a stricker guidelines when it comes to inappropriate names, I see way too many players getting banned for non offensives/questionable names.<br><br>TeamsSpeak: For the love of good remove some of the unneeded rooms. Those could also apply as staff feedback, but rudeness on TS I hear a lot of staff members making inappropriate jokes to other players.

Agreed. Although, we may need a lot considering there's only like 5 on at a time. I'm not sure if it's inactivity or just time zones.

Yeqh, agreed. Maybe not too many staff, but there are like only double as much mods as sr mods. Unless you count admins. Then it's 14 Sr staff and 26 mods :-:

Although it may seem like there're a lot of staff members in total? <br>How many are online when you play in-game?<br>It's not like there're 30 staff members on every time you're playing.

We said too many sr staff not too many staff. I think that we have a good amount of staff, just too many seniors.
