I dislike it, I loved the walking dead series by telltale, it was by far the only game that actually made me tear up at the end and it was overall an amazing story with a serious atmosphere. I can't take this game seriously because it's Minecraft, so yeah

Watched one video by TDM and I closed the tab after 5 minutes. All you fricken do is choose what to say! I mean come on, is this the best they can do? Should add more interactive scenes, not just placing a block or looking for some object. It's a story mode, not watching people walk around and blabber on for hours.&nbsp;<br>That's called a Let's Play for crying out loud!<br><br>Not sure what all the fuss is about really :/

Not sure if you're familiar with Telltale's games but that's the style and gameplay they go for.<br>They use this "formula" for other games they make regularly, like the award-winning Walking Dead series that they produce :P

Their Walking Dead was bloody fantastic! Minecraft just isn't going to work with the 'formula'.

I see where you're coming from but I think people are too harsh on Telltale with this game.<br>Telltale is really good at taking a franchise and making it their own.<br><br>Just look at their Walking Dead game, yes, it has aspects of the TV and comic series but it doesn't blend in with those genres. Telltale did a really great job at putting their own spin on it.<br>You don't look at the game and draw immediate comparisons to the show or comic because Telltale has made it their own.<br><br>Now, with MInecraft, it's hard to make it their own because..well..Minecraft doesn't have a distinguishable storyline to compare the game with. Meaning that it's quite hard for them to put their own spin on it, because it's such a diverse game.<br><br>I mean, the game itself isn't terrible. The story's engaging, there're Minecraft aspects there and you can easily tell it's a Telltale game.<br><br>If you look at what they had to work with, I think they did a bloody good job.<br><br>Just my two cents :P

So MC story mode is just like any other game by tell-tale games? That is a disappointment!

Its their fault for taking it on though. Saying "IT WAS HARD! ID LIEK 2 C U DO BETR" isn't a good excuse. Bad idea +Mediocre execution = Bad game.
