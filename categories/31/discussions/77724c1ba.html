Whenever i use /report my game crashes and times me out. Is this just me or is this happening to everyone?<br><br>MLGPorky:&nbsp;Also, for those of you who are curious, the /report command&nbsp;<b>does</b><span>&nbsp;crash your game, but the report still goes through. However, it would be best to notify a staff member in-game so that you avoid crashing your game, as Midnight said.<br><br><br>Rileguy: Use /TELL (all caps) and message a mod in your game</span>

It's a known issue. You're not the only one who's going through this, unfortunately. :/<br><br>Just message a moderator in game if you have to report someone.

Just to expand on midnights post you can use the /TELL command. Yes it does have to be in caps in order for the msg to go through.

You're right.<br>I've notified the Sr. staff so they will lock it once they get on the forums. :)<br><br>Also, for those of you who are curious, the /report command&nbsp;<b>does</b> crash your game, but the report still goes through.

Use / TELL to tell someone even a normal player who can video record them or just tell a staff member :)
