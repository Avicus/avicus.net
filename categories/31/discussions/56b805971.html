It is a real shame they have decided to do this at such a special time of year , people put lots of hard word in to both OCN and Avicus and i would not like to see either community fighting over purely who came first;It's a poor excuse of a reason to ruin other peoples days , i'm sure these mods dealing with you would rather be enjoying their Christmas.<br><br>Merry Christmas everyone and thank you to the staff &lt;3 Here to a happy 2015

I believe he said something along the lines that it's not necessary and it'd take too much time to code, and that it doesn't happen frequently enough to warrant prevention. Think of it like this; how would you block every site ever that has malware or porn? And how would it block gifs posted straight onto the site or stop tinyurl stuff?<br><br>Figure that out.

I agree with you there, but cant they try? I do understand ivy is busy, but.. come on at least try to do something to prevent attacks that can potentially destroy the whole server... And trust me, it can happen...

You're exaggerating. What should Ivy "try"? I already explained there really IS nothing to "try". Come up with an idea first.
