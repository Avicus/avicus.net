So, I am currently building a map with Mustardman and another friend. For "creators", what should I put for my other friends' name?<br>He did not have a Minecraft account, so vladthegreat100 gave him "vladthesexy100" (which used to be vlad's alt account) but "vladthesexy100" is banned on Avicus.<br>I don't know how I should include him as a creator, because he is banned, but he wants to be known as one of the creators.<br>Thank you!<br>-Porky

have your friend come up with a cool name :) and maybe, if he wants to get minecraft, he can buy it, and have that name :)<br>

His parents don't let him buy ANYTHING on the internet.<br>Just completely forget about that option because there is NO way it can happen. :/

I'm nice :3 I give my alt account to someone and buy cork a new account :3 and why not take this option... unban him, I switched the pass for him (I promise I forgot it) (I really do not like him, porky convinced me, and I will be telling him my favore card game so he can change the skin)
