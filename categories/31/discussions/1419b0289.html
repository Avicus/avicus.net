So I've been noticing a lot of Spam/Useless/1 Answer Question Forums Threads that have been locked recently, so I'd like to help minimize these threads...<br><h1><u><b>Spam/Useless Threads&nbsp;</b></u></h1>If the topic is something that we can't discuss (because there is nothing to discuss) please don't make the thread. <u>Ex:</u>&nbsp;I just went to the mall..."&nbsp;<br>"I just went to the mall and saw someone fall into a fountain! Now I'm dying of laughter xD"<br>No one can really discuss anything other than "k." It's a personal update and it's just pretty useless. Remember, the forums is not a social networking site. They are&nbsp;a place for everyone to be able to discuss and relate.&nbsp;<br>-And if it's a message to just 1 or 2 people, don't post that either. Just use Skype, tell them in game, anything just not on the forums.&nbsp;<br><h1><b><u>1 Answer Question Threads</u></b></h1>Now these won't necessarily get locked unless the question is answered, which it usually does. If you have a question, you can ask in game or ask a staff member on Skype. Your best luck is asking a staff member on Skype if you don't trust what the people are saying in game. They're always there to help and they'll probably give you more detailed answers if you ask them on Skype, not on the forums.&nbsp;If you don't know any staff members' Skype, a lot of them have it on their profiles, so just check!&nbsp;<br><u>Ex:</u> If you recently bought a rank but didn't get it yet, ask a staff member or friendly people in game.&nbsp;Also, check under "Avicus Help" because it answers a lot if questions.&nbsp;<br><br>And for "Unban me" Topics...&nbsp;<br>support@avicus.net support@avicus.net support@avicus.net&nbsp;<br><br>2 Useful Links<br>↠<a rel="nofollow" href="http://avicus.net/forums?topic_id=34">http://avicus.net/forums?topic_id=34</a><br>↠<a rel="nofollow" href="http://avicus.net/rules">http://avicus.net/rules</a> (check under forums rules)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-"Bapirry"<br>(P.S. ik this is all staff like but i'm not applying for jr.mod anytime soon and I just felt like this was needed.... plus i was bored&nbsp;:p)

Although this is a good thread. This wont change much. <br>You'll have to accept and tolerate that some people don't quite understand how to use the forums.<br><br>That's why you helped them out on their thread.<br>"use /report" "send an email to support" etc.

@Snow&nbsp;<br>Yea, I don't expect now everyone to stop spamming the forums but I just felt like some people may just not know what they're doing. Just like any other Avicus Help forum post, it's just to help :p "I want to help&nbsp;<i>minimize&nbsp;</i>these threads."<br><br>@Eric yaaaaas xD

Isn't that true...<br><br>Good job on raising awareness towards this issue, though. I tried making a suggestion for it three months ago, but it didn't really get rolling, nor was it implemented. Jozz and Nolan liked it though, so I guess that was something... <a href="http://avicus.net/forums/716a4f95b" rel="nofollow">http://avicus.net/forums/716a4f95b</a>.

I agree with iBiZa. This thread is definitely nice, but I highly doubt this is going to solve anything. :P

It clearly States that in the rules:<br><ol><li><u>Discussions surrounding personal updates</u> is frowned upon as they are
 meant to be inclusive rather than oriented around a single person. 
Punishments for this will only be distributed in the event that a user 
continually uses the discussions for this purpose alone.</li></ol><br>So those in the forums who do that is against the rules! <br>But I would suggest a way on the forums so you can privately message someone!

Thank you for making this thread.<br><br>I know many people may not go through this thread, but it at least raises awareness to the subject. I really do prefer discussions and forum games on the forums, and these spam threads can get in the way.
