<b><u>Two Head Map Developers. </u></b><br>Recently, the Map Development team has been doing a lot of thinking, and we have decided upon having <b>2 different head map developers </b>for the team. One will focus on the staff section of the team, and the other will focus on the map part and making sure things get done. After much voting, the team has decided to<b> promote me </b>to the 2nd head map developer position. Along with this, <b>Evoclaws</b> has decided to come back to his head map developer position, and <b>Tanpiku </b>will be stepping down. <br><br><b><u>Revisions Page<br></u></b>With the new Omega Update out, Kylo has added in a <b>revisions page</b>. This page will contain all the revisions made by map developers and developers to the website, rotations, and maps. This page is located here -- <a title="Link: https://avicus.net/revisions/" href="https://avicus.net/revisions/">https://avicus.net/revisions/</a><em><br><br></em>Thanks, and have a wonderful day!<em><u></u></em>

Para is still the map god.<br>Congratz Evo, you'll do a great job, as normal xD &lt;3<br>And to you aswell skylar!<br>But I have questions:<br>Where is maps.avicus.net? I liked the page with all the yamls and stuff.<br>When do we get informations about Fish Hunt and Fish Tank? I saw that Polar added them to the DTM test list, but I can't find any thread about them.

Alright so I got a question or tip, or whatever. There are some maps, that today wouldnt be accepted if they would be submitted, like Renovuze 1 (However you spell that, im not 100% sure), why are these maps still there? Avicus got too few players to make a different servers with different maps, 1 server will literally be full and then it will take like 10 minutes for anither server ti start because we are too few. Imo you should remove maps that wouldnt live up to the limits today, and start adding maps that live up to the limits.
