I believe that maps in the&nbsp;should be open to the public as they would allow people to scrim on Avicus maps such as Senex etc. As since the server rotations are massive(thanks staff!) you only play maps like Luar and Senex once every so often.<br><br><b><u>Pros<br></u></b><ul><li><u></u>Would allow teams to prepare better for tourney's (scrimming,working out defenses etc.)</li><li>Would allow people to show slight enhancements to maps that would be otherwise previously quite difficult</li></ul><b><u>Cons</u></b><u><br><b></b></u><b></b>I can't think of any.&nbsp;<br><br>P.S I made this thread because I wanted to write XML for these maps that teams could use in conjunction to SporkPGM to scrim on thanks!<br><br>Open to discussion

Well, it would make the maps much easier to steal.

I suppose that is true, but the community is growing quite big and someone&nbsp;would eventually find the culprit

It's not about finding the culprit. It's about the ease of it happening.

Use it on their own servers. Has happened before. If the map maker wants their map publicly available, they may feel free, but it will not happen without their explicit permission.

So will you guys let us seek out the makers of the maps and then from there (if they let us) can we download?&nbsp;

Yes. If the map makers give our permission we can use it.

That would be difficult to handle having rosters to who was scrimming 
who on a scrim server. As well as white-listing them so ONLY the teams 
can join in the scrim. It is a bit too obtuse and bloated for what 
someone could set up in 10 minutes?<br><br>

I agree with jozz.<br><br>The maps aren't open to the public because the public can steel maps and post the maps on other servers. There was this one time here in Avicus that these players ( I forgot who they where) &nbsp;but they stole the old Avicus lobby and I think they also stole some maps from this server and where trying to start there own server.&nbsp;

Scrim Servers would be good for training, and even more if they have Avicus maps, you should make a server for Scrims like the one from oc.tc.. :D<br>

I've stated that most of the maps would be available on the archived forum which will be available soon. And our maps have been stolen on multiple separate occasions.

Lupus can easily build a senex for a scrim server if that's what you want :p
