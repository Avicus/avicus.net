<h3>Department Removal<br><span style=" font-weight: 300;">The senior staff team will be reverting back to using a task / assignment system, and will be scraping departments. After a recent meeting, we have decided that this method is better to use during these circumstances.&nbsp;</span></h3>

Aw...<br><br>I always thought that MapDevs should team up and do everything together, it makes everything faster.<br><br>Like I compare the mapdev responses from years ago to now... mapdevs responded to maps faster before than they did now providing feedback to maps and whatnot.<br><br>Eh, but that's just me.<br><br>I also don't really favor the "Head mapdev" system because I always felt that the mapdev team was better as a "council" of sorts than a team under a few guys with slightly higher powers.<br><br>I mean they have all those permissions but they need to report to a central dude to make sure that it's okay. I can understand the circumstance of this but even for the things that are little and won't really effect anyone all that much... you still have to report to a central dude and whatnot.
