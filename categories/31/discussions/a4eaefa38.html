Well I made a post about this a while back hoping it would get fix and I also reported it on GitHub a few months ago. I can't message most people that I have on my friends list wanted to know if there is anyway I can get this fixed. :l

For me, sometimes it decides to work and sometimes it doesn't. It's kinda unpredictable.

Hmmm, I think you can message all friends which you added in the Avicus 1.0 time.(this Avicus with the old website)<br><br>Because I once tried to message EricV4 -&gt; didn't work<br>But players I added before like sunrise728 -&gt; did work<br><br>You've maybe added all your friends in the Avicus 1.0 time...<br>(Just that what I think, I don't have official informations.)
