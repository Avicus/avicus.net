<b>Hello Guys, today I was wondering is it just me or is this new rule about your map you can't ask if it is accepted or what not?<br><br>I thought this was a foolish rule because I would like to know if my&nbsp;map&nbsp;got rejected or not, if it did&nbsp;get rejected they should just say no it was not accepted if it wasn't but maybe not in rot why can't they just say that it's confusing<br><br>I understand that map devs get spammed is my map&nbsp;accepted&nbsp;is it denied is it good is it bad, but seriously what did you expect? Avicus is a big server with a big community and you knew you were going to get spammed by this can't you just block or ignore and get back to the people later?<br><br>PS Sorry if I made it sound mean... I'll be glad with anything just this makes more sense ;P<br><br>Best regards. Cezbla</b>

This rule is not yet put into effect as we have to discuss it with the directors, however it happens a lot more than you think. We get spammed over skype, in-game, on teamspeak, even I've been confronted about maps on different servers. The thing is, it's not completely just asking whether it's accepted or denied. It's constantly pestering us to check it out and leave replies and such, which makes us detracted from it. None of the rules are set in stone, but it's like staff applications. Just don't ask so much.
