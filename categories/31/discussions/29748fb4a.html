Hey guys, earlier today I decided to do something different on Nebula. &nbsp;That was to try to make a complete platform across Rendezvous, covering all of the middle. &nbsp;The great thing about this was that eventually there were 4-5 people helping out, and there was even a couple people from the other team who decided to help the cause. &nbsp;Unfortunately, we weren't able to complete the task because someone broke the monument, but, it was a close try!<br><br>Here are some screenshots!<br><br><br><br><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/iDr1rmV.jpg"><br><br><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/1BDqLJV.jpg"><br><br><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/ASV5SHJ.jpg"><br><br><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/DbHHQvm.jpg"><br><br><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/xAXiVzZ.jpg"><br><br><img alt="" src="http://i.gyazo.com/df22d1d93ee0a2b7a7d61fbaba107a80.png">
