Sethskye has been a Jr mod for over a month now, and I heard that Jr. mod trials last 3 weeks&nbsp;<b>max</b>.<br>So... what's happening with him? Is there a reason why he isn't being promoted / demoted, or why is it taking so long with him?

He took a break during the first part for a long time, so he's serving out the trial that we all served already, just at a later time.

I've had Junior Moderator for 4 Months lmao, but that was because of the broken promotion/demotion command.

He was on vacation during the majority of his trial. His fate is currently being decided by the senior staff.<br><br>No further comment.
