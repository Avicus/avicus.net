<b>Hello,<br>Avicus and Other Players<br><br>I have just&nbsp;realized I've Playing on Avicus for 1&nbsp;&nbsp;Year!<br><br></b>Yes it's true I've been playing for 1 Year! I could not have made it this far with out my friends, EricV4, Tel6331, steven5703, MLGtino, glitchy1, fishyfacediamond, OPTOBAT, Fluenza_, SweetMango, itzdylan115, Princezz_Dubstep, FrostedCupcakez and many more. Although I am planning to leave Avicus shortly I still want to play for a little longer I know I will move on shortly<br><b><br></b>Memorable Experiences<br><b><br></b>Yes I have had many Memorable Experiences. Like when I tried breaking my own monument :/.<br>Also when I thought SweetMango was a girl and then found out he is a boy. I also remember when I killed MLGtino from just a GOLDEN APPLE :)! I think in order not to get you bored I'll stop here<br><br>My Future Plans<br><br>Unfortunately I may be leaving Avicus soon. Due to lots of reasons I won't mention until I make a future post about me leave soon. I have got 1 thing I am striving for before I leave that is Bein<br>a staff member. I feel as though this is getting really tricky to continue I'm still going on. Teamspeak has a big impact on my plans to talk to the community &nbsp;I will eventually quit that as well. Sadly that is really what is probably going to happen soon.<br><br><b>Goodbye, Tiger</b>

I admire your goal for becoming a moderator but keep in mind that being a moderator means that you are a sort of a role model.<br>You do good because you know that that is the right thing to do, not because you have a special badge on the website. <br>Even if you're not a moderator, you can still be a role model. Use your experience as an advantage when helping other players and you will be looked upon when someone needs help.<br><br>:)

Thanks for the acknowledgement Tiger :)<br>I guess congratulations and goodbye for the future at the same time, one year is an amazing contribution to the servers history, and I'm happy to see you have some nice memories to share :)<br>I hope to cya around so we can play together one or two last times if you're leaving, but otherwise, congrats :D
