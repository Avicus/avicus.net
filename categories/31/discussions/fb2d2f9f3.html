Compared to gold this gets not xp boost so it would not have a star next to name on the leaderboards.<br>who this rank is for;<br>-someone without much money to be able to donate to the server<br>-it's a great starter rank for a new player.<br>-for someone who wants a rank but wants 100% legit experience so they can join the same team as friends or other rank additions.

-1 we already have gold, even cheaper would be crazy, what would the monthly pay be 1$? Unless you could win this kit while voting for that would be cool.

That's actually a great idea I'll see what I can do also the point isn't the price it's mainly for an introductory kit or for someone who wants legit xp

Read the thread...<br>its a reward for voting so avicus gets more popular.<br>anyway if it's not a voting reward and every1 buys it then it's good for the server. Say 500 people bought a 15$ rank it would be benefitial to avicus because only 200 of them would buy gold instead also it's for the top 3 voters in the month or something like that not for everyone who votes.

I have a small feeling you are doing this so you can get free XP and a donors rank... and thing is, its not a donors rank if you get it by voting o.e

This is not why I'm doing it.<br>im doing it to help increase avicus player base by ranking it higher on the voting menu or by helping the server earn money with a new rank. Currently I do vote but I type in random names because I don't want the exp.the donor rank for voting wasn't my idea either it was ebirdy9's who is already emerald so this rank wasn't designed to being it me it was for the community.

That's a k3wl idea,<br>what I understand from it is<br>you get a one month subscription to "iron" which then expires so you get a "support rank" possible rename to "iron ore" which lasts 4 1 month. Next month you can continue voting for "iron" like smelting keeping the naming theme.
