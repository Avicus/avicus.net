Greetings!<br><br>I am making this thread to alert the community of an upcoming map testing event! A map testing event will be held on <b>Saturday 14, 2015 </b>at&nbsp;<b>1PM EST</b><b>&nbsp;</b>All players are free to hop onto <b>/server mapdev</b> and test out a whole bunch of new maps. The mapdev server will only become open at this time and date.&nbsp;<br><br><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/wZFDL1I.png"><br><b><i>This is a complete list of what will be tested during this event. If you feel the map developers have missed something, feel free to say so.</i></b>

The map list has been updated based on what you guys said, hopefully it will answer some questions<br><br><b>@Awesomerp -&nbsp;</b>It ends when we have tested each map there. You may send the YML in at the last minute, and it will appear for testing.&nbsp;<br><br><b>@Burdie -&nbsp;</b>Yes, you may.
