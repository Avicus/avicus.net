This is like "If you were king" but with Avicus, so it's "If you were the owner"! First off, these shouldn't be criticisms of Kylo or the server. It should just be fun, silly, outlandish things! You could have a dedicated server just for UHCs, or give yourself 1,000,000,00 credits. I personally, would spawn an ocelot, then write a plugin where it follows me everywhere (so cute), and it guards me while I'm breaking the monument with a one-bite-kill. :3

Probably put my full power in fixing the major gameplay ruiners such as lag and glitches.<br>Find a new way to earn money of the server, such as buying unbans. Use the money to pay developers, when the server is all good, I would pay youtubers to advertise.&nbsp;<br>I would try to invent new original gamemodes and make tournaments for 'em.<br>Demote half of the seniors back to mod (I'm not hating, we just got too many). Remake the rules and talk some things through with staff.

I would first try to restructure things internally, such as how decisions are made and stuff is handled. Then I would work on the backend so new dev stuff could be more easily added. Then I would write a better appeal system. THEN I would advertise and try to grow the community.

Well right now if you need to appeal, you mae a forum post. My idea would be that when a person was banned, they are given a direct link to a page on the website that will let them enter a message and submit an appeal. This would then alert the staff member who banned them (in game/on the forums) and would be marked as pending. A staff member would be given a page that let's them reply, deny the appeal, or appeal the ban. I think it could help to better streamline the process.

Then 3 admins and 4 Seniors. My point being that you need to have a smaller number of leaders than followers. You have 11 Seniors and 3 admins so 14 combined. There are 29 mods and 1 Jr mod. So you ratio is just about 1 senior to 2 mods. It should be somewhere around 1:4 or 1:5. Just a suggestion.<br><br>For another example, in clash of clans. You either make everyone elder in a clan, or noone elder in the clan. If you have to many in power they will abuse it.

Whoops. Didn't mean to say daily basis xD. Regarding the staff stuff, I was demoted because I didn't give out enough infractions because I gave people too many verbal warnings. On the other hand, I had solved the issues verbally using /warn and /kick as a last resort. I already explained to Newcleus about it. About the demotion of staff, I'm talking with the admins about that as well.<br><br>Regarding the leaderboard, I meant to say player stats profile. I want to see who kills you the most and who you target the most again.<br><br>Everything else that you disagreed with, I can see what you mean.

I believe the reason he says less Seniors is because if you have to many, you don't get as much done. You tend to argue more and that isn't the point. However, you are right about the time zone issue, but that would be the case of any amount of staff. In fact, the less seniors that you have, the more likely you are all able to come to a conclusion more quickly. I'm not trying to argue, I'm just trying to explain what PokerFace is trying to say.
