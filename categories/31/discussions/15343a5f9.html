Alright, my other one was taken down of a person who could of started a flame war. Please list me some PvP techniques that I could practice on so I can improve and so I can have a decent fight with Jozzeh and Theo (#TooOPForMe). Also me and Yoav are fighting each other #1vs1Buddies. Finally, elaborate on your suggestions pls, maybe link me to a video or something!

What I do is try to make the enemy follow me and then get into a confined space. Then, I block-hit and 90% of the time, win :3<br>If there's no confined area around, I just start out strafing and once they get a couple hits on me, I go to block-hitting &lt;3

The goal is to keep moving and spin around your opponent while hitting him.&nbsp; Your opponent won't be able to hit you as much because you are always behind him.&nbsp; Make sure you get the first hits off of him and keep jumping to a min because of all damage.

Actually, in my experience I got more knockback by sprinting and strafing without jumping. You can get eZ combos and make it harder to get combo'd by doing that. It takes practice, but it's worth it. (Thanks to Zieno for pointing that out to me)

@midnightbeats If your able to caculate the person's movement its actually not that hard to hit them it just takes practice :D<br><br>As for me im not the best pvper but strafing and getting behind your opponent always gives you an advantage(unless your opponent hacks) sometimes i even risk getting fall damage just to get behind your enemy and it actually sometimes works.<br>When your in a tunnel what I do i jump and sprint cause you know you go super fast if you do this then all you do is zoom behind them while hitting to get the upper advantage.<br>In archery warfare getting the upper advatage isnt always better in a sense because if you dont have a roof above your head its actually easier to hit the person above you it may not work all the time but it sometimes does... Also when your opponent is dodging your arrows wait and charge your bow up and shoot only when your enemy is charging their bow so it is easier to land a hit on him/her.<br><br>Those were some of my tips/tricks some other stuff are trade secrets :P

Lower clicking speed doesn't help you at all lol...<br><br>And Cayden's strafe can only be performed by a few people as very few know what buttons he presses and at what time or what he tries to do, so it's enough just to say that.

I wasn't directing my previous comment towards everyone. I was speaking to Ingi, stating that he should try and lower his clicking speed (He clicks waaaay to fast) to see if his aim improves.<br><br>Cayden's strafe was my attempt to joke around, and I know it's extremely hard to pull off.

People might hate me for this but try blockhitting<br>But dont just click randomly, try to guess when your opponent is going to hit you and block at the rigjt time<br>Combine that with strafing and your good<br>Ofc, thats what i do<br><br>Never jump crit unless you are in the middle of a combo, as the jump will get you knocked back more<br><br>As for bows, dont think too much about it<br>Unless there is limited arrows, aim in a general area around the player and fire (remembrr that the arrows go in an arc so aim a little high dependig on the distance)<br><br>Also, NEVER RUN HEAD ON AT A PERSON<br>They will bowspam the crap out of you :L

People are telling you to crit, but this makes you an easy target for a heavy combo wombo-ing. Don't jump too much unless cornered, if you are, jump and block hit. Sprint all the time, it gives you such an edge, learn to use the bow effectively, practice different strafe patterns or whatever in Badlion 1v1s (I'd recommend UHC, OCN Iron or OCN.

Okay,&nbsp;<br>First in Nebula, some maps have useful things like gravel for flint and also cobwebs for string. Use these to make flint and steel or fishing rods. <br>Strafing is your best friend and bows.<br><br>Try using your bow more often and use it when you have a good distance apart so around about 6 blocks. When you shoot with bows don't bow spam.. Just do double-charge, it will do a good amount of damage and also good amount of speed. When shooting at long range, always fully charge your bow to get maximum aim and power.&nbsp;<br><br>Next is strafing. There is mainly 2 types of it: circle strafing or zig zag. Circle strafing is what most people do but zig zagging it more effective where you move left and right to dodge the enemy's attacks.&nbsp;<br><br>Tips to help: Change your FOV (Field of Vision) to Quake Pro may help because you can see further around you.<br>Change your mouse sensitivity to about when you move your mouse left to right, it will do a 90-180 degrees turn. So it will be much easier to aim.&nbsp;<br><br>Thanks for for reading this! Hope it helps&nbsp;<br>Lawrence

Thanks for all your tips! I will take this all of this into my mind and I will hail the god "Cayden" The Strafing King! Also I will lower down my click speed (#WayToFastxD). I have also saw that putting your FOV on 100 improves your PvP drastically than Quake Pro. I practice the following techniques; Strafing (Lord Cayden), Blockhitting, Bow Accuracy, Vary Blockhitting Normal Hitting Critical Hitting(Jumping) and Shift Hitting for appropriate situations, Use F3+B for an appropriate manner, Practice on OCN, Badlion, Kohi, Do More Knockback and Use Sweg Hacks xD!

I can do 100 fricken clicks per second (spamming all my fingers with touchscreen to impress friends #CHEAT), but in pvp I'm more worried about how i approach them to how fast I click. About 2 clicks a second does the job for me :)
