Alrighty, this is my attempt to help Avicus.<br><br>Firstly, I wanna state the fact that people are swearing in the 'Cursing Forbidden' channel. It's also disappointing if staff members are swearing or not even doing anything about it. There are rooms for different purposes; Swearing, Non-Swearing, Staff chats etc but if we aren't gonna use the chat&nbsp;properly? Why tf do we have them?<br><br>Secondly, We need more mods from different time zones. I know it's technically not your fault if people from different timezones don't apply, but we still need to fix this. Let's use Australians for an example. The only few Australian staff are Jozz, Sessp and Mango. They are all sr staff/admins which means they can't be as active as the mods. We need to promote different time zone people so mods can be active from all sorts of times and not 1 fly hacker flying around breaking monument for 5 hours.<br><br>Thirdly, we need to import some more developers. 2 developers fixing all of the avicus' glitches isn't gonna work. More professional developers (Not saying the current ones are bad) need to come in and help us code more plugins for the network.<br><br>Lastly, The promotion system has to change. Go back to the mentor system. It was one of the best working systems avicus ever had and also works more efficient then our current state. You guys are promoting Jrs to mods when they haven't been on the server for 1-2 weeks. They should atleast be on once per 3 days to moderate.<br><br>Sorry if I sound harsh! These are just some ideas.

To your first point, I witnessed it. Also I didn't do anything against it,<b></b> my fault. I'll try to improve on that point.<br><br>Secondly I share a little part with the Australian Timezone, I meet Sess sometimes when I come from school around 2 pm. Sadly I have everyday except on the weekend a long school day until 4 pm, so I can only play in my break...<br><br>A friend of me send an Application for the Dev position to Kylo, but ye some other developers would be nize. The problem with developers is that they can do serious damage to the server/network. They could leak code or even publish it anywhere else.<br><br>The Mentor system is still in place. There were also staff training sessions for the old and new mods. And yes I agree, they should be active if they want to be a moderator, and how I see it they are all &nbsp;active.<br><br>You don't sound harsh, it's constructive criticism, I like that!

The problem I have is that he is complaining about these issues but also goes against what he is saying like cursing in the cursing forbidden channel.<br><br>Then the "<span>They should atleast be on once per 3 days to moderate." is&nbsp;outrageous. People can't play all that time when they have real life to deal with. He is hinting to himself and I know you see it aswell, I would respect his opinions if he wasn't trying to hint to his personal gain.</span>

Outrageous? What?<br><br>On the LOA thread, the guys generally make a post if they're taking 3 or more days off.<br>Most staff are able to jump online at least once every 3 days anyway.<br><br>Not quite sure how this is an "outrageous" suggestion, considering the staff team quite easily meets this standard.

1. Can be fixed easily<br>2. Can be fixed easily in time and not a huge problem<br>3. It isn't in our control and has been suggested a lot<br>4. I agree on this but this can be fixed easily if we find the hard problem that is the core. <br>Treat problems like a tree. It has little root problems that feed to a giant core problem. Cut the core problem and the roots are useless.

1. We can definitely talk about this and hopefully it will happen.<br>2. I find that Jozz is actually very active on the server. Also, not that many players come on in that time zone, so maybe 1 or 2 more staff members are good.<br>3. That is entirely up to Ivy, but a developer has serious responsibility and it takes time to find one that is trustworthy and willing to work for free.<br>4. The system is already in place and is working very well.<br><br>Thanks for the ideas, and the ones that are in our control will definitely be talked about soon.

You can back off now. I am not trying to get mod in any way here. Something that you don't understand Mr. Colecrc! I am simply telling them what Avicus is doing wrong and some suggestions.

If you didn't want Mod why do you complain about it? Also some of these suggestions aren't really going to help Avicus. Another thing is I'm not pissy I just think it's funny that you want Mod so bad and also I know I'm not staff and how am I putting my actions on you?

Why do I complain about it? That's not even what this thread is about. You can use your brain to answer that question Mr. Colecrc. Obviously, you don't even understand. <i>"I know I'm not staff" </i>woopey do, congratulations? You are getting on my nerves probably just because you don't have your little sr mod rank anymore. This ends now!
