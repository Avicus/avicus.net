Hey guys! I'm going to try this game out and see if you guys can guess which nebula map I am talking about. (ITS VERY EASY)Here it goes<br>&nbsp;<br>CLUE 1. The 2 teams are Red and Blue<br>CLUE 2. It is quite a popular map<br>CLUE 3. There are 2 monuments on each team&nbsp;<br>CLUE 4. It is not a map where you have to build over, it's a biome :D<br><br>The rules:&nbsp;<br>- I'll be checking the comments and the first person to guess it right can choose another map and give some clues!<br>- Make sure to reply to that person and not just to comment.<br>- Be free to make one of your one too<br><br>GL HF :)

Same... although, regarding "Biomes" it could be Broken Ages right?

Is It Ravaged? The old map that had a ravine in the middle?? Then it got canceled, it's the only map that I know with "biomes"

Oooo damn it I know this one. Its that map where there are horses and blocks of ores to mine. The 2 teams fight by mining through the cave to the other side. In the beginning there's that netherwart farm. It's a TDM. I forgot the name...
