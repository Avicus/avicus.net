Evening/Morning/Other everyone! <br><br>

Today I would like to open up a new discussion on some new ways and ideas to possibly alter the rules.
<br>
<b>Questions we will be discussing:</b>
<br>
<br>
What rule, specifically, do you feel could be added that can potentially help the community? 
<br>
<i> Any inappropriate/smartarse comments will not be tolerated, and will be archived. </i>
<br>
<br>
What rule, specifically, do you feel should be enforced more?

Well, most rules seem to be fine atm :P But maybe be more strict against hackers. ^-^ For most type of hacks... they've got a client, they've been caught for one hack, but most probably they used another. :c

@Roman<br>Why is it not allowed to be said in general, and the same not, allowed to be said. Of course it's not allowed to be said towards players. I mean, we say "fk" or "sht", but that's basically cussing. It never said the grammar had to be exact, no?&nbsp;<br><br>@Thread<br>Make it so we aren't allowed to make fun of people as they die, like, saying "lol, scrub" when someone is dying/dies from them.

Yes. IMO, and what alot of people I talked about this agreed, the staff take the "regular" players lightly. Like, this is just a real example that is true, and not to be meant to be dealt with by me, EmeraldSword and a few other people in the Apex team I think were "spawnkilling", and they only got 'verbally warned', when, a regular player who was doing the same thing would've gotten an infraction. Also, I see the mods CONTINUOUSLY saying something like... "Don't go on the bridge or I will tempban" and they never do it, and just keep saying that, as, to regulars I mean. I saw someone do it again, and got kicked, while the regulars were still doing it, and just kept getting "verbally warned".

I'd say that there should be a broadcast every so often that directs players to the server rules page because most, if not all players don't know about them; making general rules based off their intuition.

Creating a rule on bow spamming would be very difficult as one wouldn't know when shooting a bow turns into spamming. The line between shooting and spamming isn't very defined.&nbsp;<br><br>One rule I would implement would be no trolling. As junior mod, I'm often being trolled by players. I'm not sure if it's a rule currently, but if so, it should be more known.

Agree with ambamore...some people say "ez" or "noob" when they kill someone, and that's insulting to some people. This shouldn't be allowed. Also, there should be a filter that detects words like "hacks", "hacker", and "hax", and verbally warn the player saying it to not accuse people of hacking. Only that player would see the warning.

The rule on locking threads for bumping needs to be more clearer for all moderators.<br>I made a thread about it but considering you're asking for suggestions..<br><br>I see multiple moderators lock thread simply because people have bumped the thread.<br><br>Now at first, this is good but threads have been locked even though that he post in question was on topic.<br><br>Bumping threads are OK as long as the comment is on topic. Bumping threads aren't OK if the comment has nothing to do with the topic.<br><br>I have seen all types of mods (from Jr's to Sr's) lock threads that didn't need to be locked.<br><br>I think that all moderators and staff need to learn exactly what to look for before locking a thread.<br><br>Thanks.

Don't know if you're kidding or not.<br>If not, bow spamming Is a legitimate tatic. <br>There shouldn't be a rule against it as it's part of vanilla Minecraft and doesn't use hacks to achieve.

It's ironic how some players want rules to be more strict when it comes to saying "ez", "noob" or such things when they say it themselves. If you want the rules to be strict you shouldn't break them yourself.

<b>What rule, specifically, do you feel could be added that can potentially help the community?&nbsp;<br></b><br><ul><li>To be honest, the rules seem to cover everything. The real issue is that most of them are not even enforced. Rules can change and change is good but if no one is enforcing the rules then remove the rules otherwise the entire rule page is meaningless. For example, did you know all the Kohi videos that get posted are agaisnt the rules? Mhm oh and Caps are not actually agaisnt the rules and swearing (directed at people or not) is agaisnt the rules also.</li><li>Just thought one of: "Bitch about other players in Teamspeak is not acceptable." Now it should probably be phrased a bit better than that but the amount of bitching I hear on teamspeak is disgusting from staff AND players... Its just negativity and has no purpose other than to make the bitches feel better about themselves because they are saying stuff behind their "friends" back and they cant defend themselves.</li></ul><br><br><span><b>What rule, specifically, do you feel should be enforced more?&nbsp;<br></b>The very first rule in the official rules:</span><br><ul><li>Maintain a casual and positive atmosphere at all times. Inappropriate or aggressive language, regardless if it is directed at someone or not, will not be tolerated. Be respectful of all players. Harassment, bullying, rudeness and excessive swearing is strictly not allowed.</li></ul>Too often I see it getting ignored by staff and players alike.<br>Also this one:<br><ul><li>Ban evasion is not permitted and will result in a permanent ban on all accounts associated with the original Minecraft account.<br></li></ul>I mean this rule is basically just not implemented at all. I am not sure if it is a case that maybe Sr.Mods+ need /ipcheck or something like that.<br><br><b><br></b>

<b>What rule, specifically, do you feel could be added that can potentially help the community?&nbsp;<br></b>Make it illegal to kill-farm; please. If new players come and play and their first experience wasnt good then they will leave.<br><b></b>You may say that it is a tactic, yes it is. A very dirty one. And we all know that players that kill farm dont do it for "tactics". They do it to gloat and stroke their own pride saying "eZ" or "Wow the enemy team sucks." This "tactic" shows no sportsmanship for your opponent and shows that you use dishonorable means to gain the upper hand.<br><br>Remember when spawn blocking was considered a "tactic"? This is the same. Please enforce this rule and you will have funner games for everyone. I know that you guys know that I'm right.<br><br>Edit: And to those of you who say that it is sportful then just look at the act's name. "Kill-farm". That means you are referring the enemy to cattle or fodder and not your fellow man. This in itself is disrespectful.

I'd like to see a rule that considers "stretching words" as a form of spam. This is, essentially, when a player repeats certain letters in a word to a ridiculous extent.<br><br>Example...<br><br>Newguy18_76: Woooooooooooooooohoooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!<br><br>Now, honestly, I do think it can be used for emphasis, but only when used lightly.

Maybe, this isn't a rule, but try to make the Staff team more profesional, I mean, there's no need of saying, for example: "Roses are red, violets are blue, I will ban u :3" before banning a hacker or someone breaking the rules, this will help the server a lot, so try to talk about this.

Yes, can we please have this allowed? Or at least specify more modifications allowed to be used?

My suggestions (sorry for no format):<br><b>Perm ban hackers</b>, no matter what (unless of course they weren't hacking). They hacked. They knew it was against the rules. They don't deserve a second chance, unless it was a minor hack and/or they didn't know it wasn't allowed. People know xray, fly, speed, aimbot, ect is against the rules.<br><b>Lighten up on the advertising rule</b>: Like seriously, if they tell their friend the ip to the server, whether it be on the forums or in game, you should be allowed to say the ip, as long as you don't spam it like "EVERYONE JOIN FAKEIPTHISISJUSTANEXAMPLE.GOV". <i>Think about it</i>: say someone just told you an ip to kohi because they wanted to 1v1 you, you're only leaving avicus temp for like 5-10 minutes (you might join back a few times though), and the person who told you the ip gets banned. How many players is avicus losing? One; and that's the person who got banned.

We're working on adjusting our guidelines for advertising so that punishments aren't dealt unless the advertisement is spammy.

You're right, if someone just wants to 1v1 or something like that, they shouldn't get permanently banned just for telling someone to join it. If they are spamming, yeah, they should be punished.

Not a "rule" but it would help if there was a chart from the relation of breaking rules and their specific punishments.&nbsp;<br>Ex: hacking(fly) = ban<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lots of caps = warn<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lots of caps with 2 warns already = kick

"Hackers should be perm banned" YES YES YES. I hate hackers and they just ruin the game for everybody. It's their fault. They should never be allowed to come back if they hacked.
