<strong>Event #12: </strong>Andromeda is a new and exciting building competition put together by the official contest committee. This contest will have no limitations to which contest you can build in. In other words, you can build a map for any gamemode, whether it be Nebula, Nexus, CTH, Survival Games, or Walls. Good luck to anyone submitting! <br><br><strong><u>Who are the judges?</u><br></strong>This contest will include two individuals from our contest committee to judge and leave feedback on maps submitted. These two will be GrapeSmoothie and Jahaj.<br><br><strong><u>What are the guidelines?</u><br></strong>Maps are judged in the following aspects;<br>- <i>Gameplay</i> (How do you think the map will play on the servers?)<br>- <i>Aesthetics</i> (How pleasing to the eye does it look?)<br>- <i>Creativity </i>(Is it unique and really stands out?)<br>- <i>Size </i>(How is the size? Is it too big or too small?)<br>- <i>YAML </i>(Is the YAML done well enough?)<br><br>Again, each is rated out of 10, in each category. <br><br><strong><u>What gamemodes can I do?</u><br></strong>You can do anything possible within YAML. This contest, you will be able to make a map for any gamemode, such as Nebula, CTH, Walls, or Nexus. <br><br><strong><u>How do I submit my map?</u><br></strong>Put a [CONTEST] tag in the title. By doing so, you are entered into the contest and put into a spreadsheet. It contains the map name, authors, thread link, jurisdiction of approval/denial, and it's gamemode. You have the permission to post your thread link in the post below so I can see it easier. Feel free to post your contest map in trello or the forums, both will be viewed and entered into the contest. <br><br><strong><u>What are the rules?</u><br></strong>All Avicus rules apply, and therefore these below apply as well.<br><br>1. <strong>Do not give inconstructive feedback</strong> by knocking others down to build yourself up.<br>2. <strong>Do not steal maps; all maps are your property.</strong> Violations of this are a perma ban.<br>3. <strong>Do not ghost produce;</strong> don't have other users make a map for you and you take credit.<br>4. <strong>Do not spam judges;</strong> patience is a large key. Wait for a response on your map.<br>5. <strong>Do not ghost view;</strong> don't tally a ton of thread views in your thread for attention.<br>6. <strong>Do not make joke maps;</strong> all maps must be true submissions to the server.<br>7. <strong>Do not submit maps made prior to this;</strong> all maps must be "newly produced".<br>8. <strong>Always give credit.</strong> No matter what the case, credit everyone who authored.<br><br><strong><u>How can I create YAML?</u><br></strong>Use our documentation resource at docs.avicus.net. If you have any further problems with YAML, feel free to contest a map developer, we are always willing to help! <br><br><strong><u>Is the spreadsheet public?</u><br></strong>Yes, this contest's submissions will be found on the second page or tab called "Contests 2" &nbsp;<a title="Link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a9CYPRvSxJWrkJiugM7Hl3dlCmi6M5iwYG-xU5dhK0w/edit?pli=1#gid=0" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a9CYPRvSxJWrkJiugM7Hl3dlCmi6M5iwYG-xU5dhK0w/edit?pli=1#gid=0">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a9CYPRvSxJWrkJiugM7Hl3dlCmi6M5iwYG-xU5dhK0w/edit?pli=1#gid=0</a><br><br><strong><u>What is the prize?</u><br></strong>The prize will be&nbsp;credits, amount still needs to be discussed, and will be announced at a later time.<br><br>Start time - <b>September 5th, 2015</b><br><br>End Time -&nbsp;October<b>&nbsp;1st, 2015</b>
