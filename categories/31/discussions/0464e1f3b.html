That seems a bit extreme though. He was just defending himself and that person probably killed several teammates themselves.

You have to understand the pressure it puts on the Mods. Say a moderator gets a team-killing report from a player, they go to the game but all they see is the person who reported somebody for team-killing, killing the person that they reported. It puts the Moderator in an awkward position.

You know what else is extreme? Getting tempbanned for 5 days because of "Excessive Combat Logging" and in which all 3 of the combat log infractions I had before that weren't even on purpose. Contacting support@avicus.net doesn't work because no one checks that.

Team-killing is not allowed under ANY circumstance. If it was allowed when someone is trying to team-kill you, the mod wouldn't know who started it, and there would be loads of confusion on who to punish. The other problem is, it isn't your first offense. If someone is team-killing, you /report them, and you may not see a mod in game, because they could be spectating. You just have to be patient, and wait for assistance.

Just realized this but when I got banned at first it was 1 day... Why is it 5 now? It's not a huge deal just curious. And btw if this is the reason. The first ban for team killing was an accident.

If you break the same rule twice you will be given a more harsher punishment, this stops people from breaking the same rule over and over again.

I think you well and truly deserve an appeal, thats like in real life somebody pulls a gun on you and tries to shoot but you shoot them in self defence, but YOU get arrested, i know it's different circumstances or whatever, but you know what i mean, i think you did the right thing :)<br>IMO BTW!
