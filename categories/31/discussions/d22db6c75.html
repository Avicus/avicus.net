Looks like a graphic error, do you ever clean out your computer? Try that maybe get all the dust out, if not i would bring it into a shop it looks like your graphics card.

If that only happens when he holds tab down for a long time it probably isn't his graphics card, as that probably would also affect other programs, but I'm no expert so don't quote me on this.

This happened to me as well a while ago. What I did is changed my graphics card and it went back to being normal. I think that is the problem.

if you ever get your laptop checked out never send it to a company where they sell their own computers... they are willing to squeeze your money out by making you buy a new one for something they can fix fast..<br><br><br><br>And for this subject, try taking your texture pack off, looks like you have one
