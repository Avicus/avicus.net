Recently, in lots of people's opinions, Avicus has been going down hill.<br>I am here to list the problems in the network and how they can be fixed.<br><b><u><b>Coding/Plugin</b></u><b></b><br><b>The Problem</b><br></b>Ivy/Funky has recently been extremely inactive, leaving the coding and plugin, not being worked on. Because Avicus only has 1 coder, which is him, there has been no progress.<br><b><b>How it can be fixed</b></b><br>Go on a search for another or a few other coders<br><ul><li>If one coder goes inactive there is another one to spare.</li></ul>Have people suggest and put them into action<br><ul><li>If people like something, put it in, if people do not, take it out.</li></ul><b><u><b>Staff</b></u><b></b><br><b>The Problem</b><br><i></i></b>To be honest, the staff team has been falling a bit, leaving there to be quite a lot of problems with the rule breaker<b>s.</b><br><b><b>How it can be fixed</b></b><br>Use hand-picked staff<br><br><ul><li>The staff applications take a while, hand-picked staff can also be done in the same amount of time</li></ul><ul><li>Try not to be biased if you are going to use hand-picked staff</li></ul><ul><li>With hand-picked staff, your chances of getting a very loyal mod is increased quite a lot.</li></ul>If you remain on staff applications:<br><ul><li>Take in consideration how they sound in their interview, lots of people lie in interviews</li><li>If the applicant has a history in hacking on other servers(for immature reasons) or excessive bad behavior take it into consideration</li></ul>Do not have too many jr mods at once<br><ul><li><b></b>This leads to a battle of timezones and reports, making some Jr Mods not show what they are made out of.</li><li>15-16 is the max you should do for each batch, I recommend 9-10 for each batch however</li></ul><b><u><b>Rules</b></u><b></b></b><br><b><b>The Problem</b></b><br>The rules have been causing tons and tons of controversy and arguments, they need to be made straight.<br><b><b>How it can be fixed</b></b><br>Do not punish for too many infractions<br><ul><li>If they are doing the same thing over and over, perma ban them for it.</li></ul>Ignoring the objective just to kill farm should be illegal<br><ul><li>It's blatantly stat whoring and ruins the fun and point of the game, it makes a huge gameplay issue</li></ul>Have map rules<br><ul><li><b></b>This clarifies a lot of things, which helps new players</li></ul><b><u><b>Maps<br></b></u><b></b><b>The Problem</b></b><br>Many maps have been focused on aesthetics, destroying the gameplay from the maps<br><b><b>How it can be fixed</b></b><br>Play test multiple times<br><ul><li>Not just once, if the game keeps getting rushed it's not a good map.</li></ul>Play test in public and private<br><ul><li>The more players the worse it plays</li></ul>Do not use excessive amounts of lag items<br><ul><li>Fences are cool in all, but don't use them too much</li></ul><b><u><b>Player Count/Community</b></u></b><br><b><b>The Problem<br></b>There </b>has been an extreme decrease in the player count, if it does not raise up it hurts donations, this can make Avicus shut down<br><b><b>How they can be fixed<br></b></b>Advertise with youtubers below 400,00 subs<br><ul><li>Anymore starts to bring a very negative community</li></ul>Do not use server lists<br><ul><li>They attract a very bad chunk of the Minecraft community, and it does not bring that much players.</li></ul>If the problems do not get fixed, my prediction is that Avicus will die in Spring - Summer 2015.<br>Please take my constructive criticism and enforce or consider it.

Thanks for the feedback! I agree with you about the amount of Jr Mods that should be accepted at one point, right now everyone's fighting for reports and accidentally double warning them :L

Well I think having a lot of Mods is good, but 26 JR.Mods is a bit too much. But if people would spread out into more games.

this is awesome, these are the kind of posts we need which is what i've been talking about. posts like this that point out what is wrong and what actions should be taken are great and as long as they aren't repeating themselves too much in every post, it's super cool. posts that just say "avicus dyin :\ wat do u think boutt dis" are useless because there are so many and they all say the same thing.<br><br>basically, thanks, this is a good post<br>+111111111

Here's what I think about killfarming.<br><br>It's a strategy. Just like rushing and whatnot, people use it as a tactic to win. &nbsp;Both teams have an equal chance at the beginning to killfarm the other team, as they have the same builds and items on each side, so it's really not unfair at all, because the chances are all equal for all users at the beginning. &nbsp;If you have another opinion, I respect it, but that's just how I feel.

I was going to make a discussion of the efficiency behind staff applications. Since you did the work for me, I'll give you a "quick" inside look.<br><br>I'm not trying to be rude or anything, but staff applications should be thrown outside the trash. In this latest batch of mods, some are very rude in ways, and yet, they're mod. I think every 4-5 months, or when a large amount of mods step down, there should be a private discussion between sr. Staff about who should be a part of the next batch of mods. Staff applications are only to show who's interested or not. I tested theories like this when I myself applied to be a jr. Mod. I made a very clean and nice application (according to cels43), and got two responses. One for reviewing, and the last one for denied. Honestly, I was expecting more of a reason why I was denied, but that's beside the point. My hypothesis was that is you're known to the community, then you have a higher chance to become a mod. To testwhat I had in mind, the only real way to get myself somewhat known to the community was by posting on the forums a bunch. I did, i think getting 96 posts in August. Of course, poor cels got denied. So to my question, what is the point of a staff application and what triggers a staff member to even consider you. Popularity is very important, but I think what also triggers it is the fact that you need to have relations to the staff. I do have some relation with the staff members, but I don't talk to them frequently at all. Maybe you're wondering after this long wall of words, what is the point of an application? Well, to answer this question I'm going to refer to real life scenarios. An application is only used for people who are interested in the job. After that, you have the interview. After learning about all this job stuff, I found this very silly. I literally had this long debate about how the U.S. Job selection process for most popular companies is absolutely bizarre. Anyway, back on topic. Like I said before, applications are used if someone is interested. Interviews can be two ways. Completely legit (10-20%) of the time,or Completely fake (80-90%) of the time. Anyone can lie in their interview, the same way anyone can lie in their applications. I tried to test faking in an interview, but I didn't make it that far. Now, I'm a realist, and I'll admit, I actually did lie in my application, and got to the reviewing part. To get to the main point since I have limited time,&nbsp;<b><u>People lie in applications and interviews, it's almost impossible to tell if they're being real. Applications are an unlegit way of finding the good mods or trash mods. If you have argue about the experiment part, I will give the rest of the experiment.</u></b><br><br>So what does this have to do with removing applications, and having a new process? First of all, this post is only about why applications are poor, and why they should be removed. A new process such as hand picking is a very good idea (suggested by turtles). Another way you could pick mods is by having a quick application stating your in game name and your "1-10, how good do you think you are when it comes to being a mod?" This way, you can see who's interested in a quick way. The only problem with the second process is that people will tryhard until they get mod, and then abuse their mod powers.<br><br>If there are any spelling/grammar mistakes, I apologize for having you go through it

I agree that there are too many Junior Moderators at the moment. Being one myself, i feel like I am constantly competing with the others to get to reports. In addition to this, some of us have busy lives so it is difficult for us to show what we can really do because we are always busy; this gives the others a higher chance of being promoted.<br><br>I didn't mean to be biased in any way in this reply!

I do have some relation with the staff members, but I don't talk to them frequently at all. Maybe you're wondering after this long wall of words, what is the point of an application? Well, to answer this question I'm going to refer to real life scenarios. An application is only used for people who are interested in the job. After that, you have the interview. After learning about all this job stuff, I found this very silly. I literally had this long debate about how the U.S. Job selection process for most popular companies is absolutely bizarre. Anyway, back on topic. Like I said before, applications are used if someone is interested. Interviews can be two ways. Completely legit (10-20%) of the time,or Completely fake (80-90%) of the time. Anyone can lie in their interview, the same way anyone can lie in their applications. I tried to test faking in an interview, but I didn't make it that far. Now, I'm a realist, and I'll admit, I actually did lie in my application, and got to the reviewing part. To get to the main point since I have limited time,&nbsp;<b><u>People lie in applications and interviews, it's almost impossible to tell if they're being real. Applications are an unlegit way of finding the good mods or trash mods. If you have argue about the experiment part, I will give the rest of the experiment.</u></b><br><br>So what does this have to do with removing applications, and having a new process? First of all, this post is only about why applications are poor, and why they should be removed. A new process such as hand picking is a very good idea (suggested by turtles). Another way you could pick mods is by having a quick application stating your in game name and your "1-10, how good do you think you are when it comes to being a mod?" This way, you can see who's interested in a quick way. The only problem with the second process is that people will tryhard until they get mod, and then abuse their mod powers.<br><br>If there are any spelling/grammar mistakes, I apologize for having you go through it

YAS i agree. About the hand-picked staff, yes it is a good idea. However, there must be a specifc guideline if the admins are going to choose a mod &nbsp;to be effectivite. some say it wouldn't work out but from my experience, hand-picked staff are often the best staff i have ever seen. If Avicus still wants to do staff applications, they can do it combined with hand picked staff. what i mean is that the people that applied for staff will be "considered" to be part for the staff team. Then mods would monitor the considered people to see which one is qualified.<br><br><br>Thats just my opinion

If you hand picked people for Mod only popular people would even have a really small chance of getting it.

I think Avicus could still have applications. But since they are spaced 3-6 months in the meantime you could also hand-pick some if needed, so this kinda combines both ideas.

Actually, I have. Real life scenarios are much different than e-legos.<br><br>- IRL interviews show how good you are in greeting someone for the first time<br>- e-legos does not show any features of behavior<br>- there is a difference in how you speak to someone in person and online. This has been proven by cyber and regular bullying.<br><br>There are more reasons behind this.

"Bias" - If your staff team is smart enough to pick people that are less known towards the community correctly, then it should be all good. Communities I have seen who has used this has used it the correct way, and not some bs bias stuff that everyone says would be a problem. Besides, you're stating one problem. Everything isn't perfect, and application bias is as bad as the handpicking bias. It isn't hard to do so.<br><br>"Lying" - chat logs on servers, discussions with staff are different, and will not stress what is being offered, your valuable tag of Jr. Mod. It's how you react to normal players like new people who have joined the server etc. For example, if I had two discussions, one with bmbrocks and one with you, do you think how I act towards you and bmb be different?<br><br>"Numbers" - Now, as this doesn't go towards my argument of having handpicked mods, I'll say three words. Quality &gt; Quantity. What's better 10 almost perfect staff members? Or 30 absolute garbage staff members. Potential can't be decided here. Potential is a scale in which can decide whether someone is good or not (in my words). Let me ask you this, there are many mods you and your team have chosen. Do you think at least 1/2 will fail their Jr. Mod trial or step down?<br><br>"Player count" - Honestly, there is no way you can potentially get good quality members on a server by youtubing, or advertising. If I can think of a way, I'll mention it in this topic.

"Bias"- If you could thoroughly explain a good system for having the Sr Staff know everyone on the server, please state it and I will review it. And there is no application bias because we are just judging off of the application, then of course the interview (which is almost impossible to cheat on).&nbsp;<br><br>"Lying"- You are basically supporting my argument: It is impossible for a Sr Staff member to actually know every single player on the server and exactly what their personality is and how they would preform as a Jr Moderator.<br><br>"Numbers"- I 100% agree that Quality should be above Quantity. (My coach repeats this numerous times a day). But 10 Mods can't exactly monitor the whole server 24/7. Its just impossible... If we have 10 perfect Moderators and 20 pretty good Moderators, we have the ability to monitor the server to an extent all of the time. Also, please remember the Jr Moderator rank is a trial period, we weed out the bad staff members over a period of time.

"Lying" - How am I supporting your side? Of course it's hard for sr. Staff to know most people's personalities, but there are moderators out there. Mods can give some bits of info about the person since they help moderate the servers a lot, and most try to do their best.<br><br>"Bias" - Just remember that 10 was a number that popped into my head, and that I wanna say about 50% of servers on avicus have 0 players (according to what I have seen).<br>Also, please answer my question at the end of the numbers section. I did edit my post quite a few times so you may not have caught it.<br><br>"Bias" - I'll try my best to explain to the best of my abilities with the skype spam and phone typing.<br><br>I proposed two ideas in my first post, and I'll explain them better.<br><br>Handpicking - To do this in orderly fashion, you can't just have Sr. Mods choose who is who, you need the moderator's pitch into it. Moderators may not have the experience, but they can defininitely contribute. Over the course several months, or maybe a year, there could be a large group of people you think will have a huge impact on moderating. This group could contain 20 people. After the mod list starts to wear down with people leaving, then among that group of people, the whole entire staff (excluding any current jr. Mods if any) will have some sort of "meeting" and will discuss who would the best mod right now. Let's say I was the one who was selected after the "meeting". Remember, this won't be just one person, it will be a batch. Not a 30 person batch, but maybe a 5-6 person batch of players who are dedicated and willing to moderate. How do you find out if they're interested in moderating? You can ask them privately on teamspeak, skype, or in-game. If they deny it, you have to leave the conversation casually and calmly. Also, if they deny it, there has to be a small meeting once again some other day about choosing mods. If they accept, you talk to them privately ( preferred &nbsp;to be voice talking so you can know a little about them ) and give them guidelines, rules, and other important information. This information shouldn't be leaked to anyone, which is one rule. Now, after giving them the trial mod badge, they have to prove to the staff team that they can be mature with the Jr. Mod position. If proven not, then they should be demodded. They should have the same standards a Mod would have. The trial would take a long time depending on how many mods were included in the batch. Once they have proven they are worthy, then they would be promoted.<br><br>Things I left out<br><br>- A possible application ( my number two way ) which would include your IGN and a short 2-4 sentences about yourself, what your hobbies are outside of minecraft, etc.<br><br>- This process isn't perfect, as nothing is perfect, but can overcome applications. The process allows other staff members to show their views of other people, show how they are in a normal game, and is long term. This process will show who is crisp, and will show who has well knowledge of the rules, and who is able to stay calm playing e-legos.<br><br>- NO interviews. Interviewing on an e-legos is less nerve wrecking then sitting down with your possibly future boss. You can't shake hands with someone you're talking to through a mic and a headset ( shaking hands is a formal way of greeting someone in America in case some didn't know ), and you can't show nervousness. You can say words like you're nervous, but how you feel like during an interview in real life is much different.<br><br>Don't mind any retarded spelling mistakes or stuff like that, typing on phones can be hard.

Then it could be made so only staff could comment on it. Or just staff could talk about it privately.

I'm happy about the fact that your staff will become more strict, it has been much wussing around and giving special treatment.

Well, just to bring up info about donations. From my *bloopydoopydoop* research, I found that avicus uses 5 of "Intel Xeon E5-1650, 64GB DDR3 RAM, Unlimited @ 750Mb/s", and that with that, they use ovh.com as their dedicated server hosting. That costs over $100 monthly, so, there's already $500. After that, there's also buycraft, which is like $25 monthly, adding to $525. Then there is that Avicus donation store getting the money. Now, the EULA, Avicus is going past it, way way past it, not giving a crap about it anymore, and my guess is the server makes $100 in atleast 4 days, making it enough for the server, and Ivy would also probably need the money for his college also...<br><br><br><br>EDIT: This isn't a bump, for those thinking "Oh, don't bump an old topic". I'm trying to discuss something about this thread that is some-what important and needs to be understood.

Hmm, good research.<br><br>We're planning to fix our donor perks to comply with the EULA soon, but that will probably take a while, considering how unstable our development is.<br><br>Ivy has a real life job currently, but i'm not sure if he's using Avicus' profit to help him with college.
