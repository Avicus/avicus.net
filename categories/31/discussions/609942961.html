I would like to know about the inconsistency of punishments on the Avicus forums. Specifically, concerning Web Bans.<br><br>Recently, we've had two cases of "scamming" on the forums. In both of these cases, someone (not naming anyone) posted content and "took credit" for this. However, in one case, the result was a web ban; in the other, a verbal warn was given. Why is this? Where's the consistency of punishments?&nbsp;<br><br>Thank you.

The first web ban was because he clearly stated that he was the one who created the name checker program. I'm not sure what happened to the second one since I wasn't really following along as to what happened

You might have misinterpreted what ivit was saying because of his inability to speak fluent English.

I'm trying to say that I'm pretty sure that the only reason he got webbanned is because he hasn't learned English that much; his wording was probably off and he probably meant to say that he found rather than created.

They should still not have done what they have. I didn't follow the discussions closely but if they said they made it when they didn't its their fault even if English is not their first language.&nbsp;<br><br>English is not my main language and I don't go around telling people that I created a website that I didn't. If he used Google Translate or another translating tool then its his fault for using it as automatic translation tools like Google Translate don't always get everything right.<br><br>Found and create are words that are really different and even translation tools don't get them mixed up.<br><br>And if you think staff punished a player based on the language they speak then I highly doubt that.

@Nolan and Milk: Okay, I see what you're saying. Yes, his English wasn't perfect, but you could tell that he was claiming that he was the one who&nbsp;<b>created&nbsp;</b>it, not found it somewhere.

The original wording of the person who got webbanned was "Today I came up with."&nbsp;<br><br>Honestly, I don't believe this was intentionally meant to say "Today I made"; rather, I think that the person in question didn't speak English fluently enough and worded it in a way that turned out to do a lot of harm to him.

If he really meant to say that, he could appeal saying that his English is not perfect, and he may have been misinterpreted.

<i>"</i><span><i>worded it in a way that turned out to do a lot of harm to him"<br><br></i>Its not staffs fault as he was the person that wrote it. Its his fault.<br><i><br></i>And saying <i>"</i></span><span><i>Today I came up with"</i> is saying that he was the person that got the idea to do the thing where he actually didn't and he was also not the person that did it. If he can't speak enough English to get the difference between <i>"I came up with"</i> and <i>I found this</i> then I don't know how they were able to write the rest of the topic. The rest of the topic seemed to have a good level of English knowlage in it so I doubt he actualy got them mixed up and just wanted to take credit.<br><br>Not to forget, he could appeal it explaining the situation.</span>

This is getting off of the original topic as of now; I'm looking for an answer to the inconsistency behind these similar cases. Specifically, I'm looking for an answer from the moderators that dealt with these cases.
