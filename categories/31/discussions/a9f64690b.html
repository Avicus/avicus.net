Staff Spotlight returns once again, and today's lucky guy is none other than PieZ.<br><br><b>What is your username in Minecraft and what is your favourite game on Avicus?<br></b>My username is PieZ and my favourite gamemode on Avicus is CTW.<br><br><b>Introduce yourself in 3-4 sentences.<br></b>Hello. I am a senior in high school and into media arts. I am from the homeland of Canada. I play Hockey, Golf, and Chess. I am very interested in astronomy, history, and social sciences in school.<br><br><b>What are you the most excited/obsessed over at the moment?<br></b>Colleges. I am at the time of life to go off and start getting used to the real world and getting into a career in what I want.<br><br><b>What interests you the most in life?<br></b>Reactions. In terms that every action gets a reaction. What changes reaction, what makes them, what is the end result, how I can change them. Human behavioural reactions are the most interesting because of how unpredictable they are compared to other animals.<br><br><b>What music/art/media do you like?<br></b>For music I liked soft EDM. Usually House or Trance, sometimes Drumstep. I dropped out of my arts program as soon as I could because I was that kind that was getting a 50% in it. I have a love/hate relationship with media. As someone who is going into media as a career path, I don't like traditional Western media. I like to get my sources from media from all around the world in different opinions and such. One thing I can't stand about media is truly biased media like the Fox or the Young Turks, even if I agree with an issue.<br><br><b>Where are you from?<br></b>I live in the GTA area in Ontario, Canada.<br><br><b>What are the most common questions you get asked while moderating?<br></b>What are crates? Why are you not fixing the lag?<br><br><b>Anything else you want to mention<br></b>I dunno. I never really liked the food pie. I am mildly interesting to talk to talk to on weekends and I have never been outside of North America.
