Hello everyone, this is just a quick post that i've decided needs to be addressed to a few certain people...<br><br>To (mainly) zeus449, __skygirl__9, zedther,&nbsp;SnowSX3 and a couple of others i am genuinely sorry and remorseful for my behaviour yesterday in CTH and Walls, i got onto the server in a bad mood from reasons outside of minecraft, which is why I was being very disrespectful and just irritating to deal with. I'm sorry.<br><br>Zeus, if anything i should be thanking you for not punishing me, as you could have added an infraction for my poor behaviour if you wanted to, and to you other guys, sorry for getting angry at anything said to me and I'm adamant this will not happen again.<br><br>Anybody reading this, this is not some kind of bravery, horrific, illegal scenario, i am simply apologising for my actions to the people mentioned above.<br><br>So, basically overall, nothing really excuses my behaviour, i could have prevented all of my actions if i had learned to have better self control, and i would be infinitely grateful if we could all move past this and continue to enjoy this brilliant server :)<br><br>With apologies and respect - OPTOBAT<br><br>P.S to anyone wondering, the reason this is a post is because I do not have anybody's contact on Skype, and currently do not use ts.

The Aesthetics of your apology are amazing, however the gameplay might not play well. But i've decided to accept it :)
