Good evening/morning, all.<br><br>I've been moving maps and tweaking rotation files for the past hour in order to, hopefully, enhance our current servers and to provide our players a wider variety of maps to divert themselves on.<br><br>We've been constantly testing maps in-game for the past two weeks, gathering as much opinions as we can from players in-game, the same who seemed to be delighted by the maps we put to test, claiming they're glad to see there is a bigger diversity of maps, each with a different gameolay style than the rest.<br><br>First, we added a couple maps to the&nbsp;<b>Throwback</b> server, namely the following: Abandoned Park I, Bleened Rings, Clay Wars, Diamond Shore, Sandstorm and Wasteland. We've also kept Frostbite in rotations from our li'l festive event. We're currently working on bringing back a map that old players may recognize under the name of Ravaged.<br><br>Moving on to CTW and TDM servers, the additions weren't notoriously big, but a couple maps were dropped back to these.<br><br>As to what concerns DTM01, DTM02 and DTM03, many old maps were added back to rotations after being tested numerous times in-game. Most of them have at least minimal changes that will most likely bring good results.<br>Maps you'll find on DTM servers are 42 and they are the following: Abandoned Dam, Abandoned Park II, Alpha Complex, Bermuda, Candyland, Castle in the Rocks, Clearmont I, Clearmont II, Crescent: Chaos, Crescent: Subtle, Curabitur, Deathlands, Dry Heaven I, Dry Heaven II, Embers I, Embers II, Formorgar II, Fossil Canyon, Infernus, Justice II, Mute City I, Mute City II, Mute City III, Palm Rust I, Palm Rust II, Port Town I, Port Town II, Proelium, Rendezvous III, Rendezvous: Redux, Sector Six, Senex III, Shadow Forest, Sunbeam Temple, Temple of Green, The Hallow, Towers, Trenchy, Unix, Wonderland, Yalahar and Yellowstone.<br><br>Any suggestions you wish to share, inconveniences you experience with these changes, or anything you want to input at all, given it's of considerable importance, should ideally be forwarded to me directly or through other Map Developers. You can also make use of our Map Modifications Request thread if you don't desire to contact a Map Developer and want a map to be changed in a certain way, instead.<br><br>Apologies in advance if I have commited any errors or if I have phrased anything incorrectly as I'm typing this from my phone. That being said, hopefully you find these changes enjoyable and have a better experience in-game.<br><br>Also, Merry Christmas guys. Take this as some sort of present from me and the rest of the Map Development team, I suppose.<br><br>Sincerely,<br>- The Map Developers.
