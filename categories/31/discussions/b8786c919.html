Well it's time to say goodbye. I've really had fun on this server since i joined (the community) back at the start of Avicore. I've met some great people, made friends, made enemies, gotten staff, gotten banned, retired, was a dick to everyone which was pretty god damn fun ;) TGC was where it all kinda started for me, from then on i grew as a player and wasted way too much of my time on this game lol. But nevertheless it has been a wild ride.<br><br><div>Zeus: amazing friend, great to talk, have shits and giggles with. Lol the days where we sweated to get like 1800 elo in bl build. Such an amazing person and try not to blow any buildings up :)))) gonna miss you, stay in touch &lt;3 p.s Shantel&gt;Dytto</div><div><br></div><div>Lego: also an amazing friend. We were really close and you turned into a great player and leader early on. It was great leading the team with you, fighting side by side and just getting to know you as a person. LEGOCHE CONFIRMED &lt;333 Playing with you in tourneys and scrims was such an amazing experience. Peace &lt;3</div><div><br></div><div>Budah: lmao also a legend, our chats back in the day were so fucking hilarious. Really down to earth and just someone so easy to talk to about anything whether that be &nbsp;about some fag in minecraft or a real life issue. You were a great player aswell and spent a shit ton of time putting effort into this team like lego, myself, pizza and &nbsp;everyone else who was a part of it. Shame your computer died but at least you're outside more xd God bless you &lt;3</div><div><br></div><div>Pizza: well pizzy. Labour sux! &lt;3333 Was an absolute blast meeting you, playing with you, talking to you, and just chilling out. Im really gonna miss you man. You were &nbsp;a great staff member and finally got Sr after being a mod for like 2 years. I remember when i first met you, the same day i came onto ts it was the same day you came back from that break and we talked a bit and kill farmed on quintus (as you do). Building Scizor and Scizor two (god damnit mango) was a great experience that you, myself and buster (who i thought was a boy at the time LOL)just got to have a chat and build. You're the nicest person on here and dont have a toxic part of your body. Thank you for giving me the chance to join and co lead TGC/Apollo for as long as i did. I'll miss you, bye &lt;3</div><div><br></div><div>Apollo as a whole: thanks for being such a good bunch of friends, the two years i've been on this team has been a wonderful ride. Thanks for being there for bants and for being supportive and kind when my cats passed away so suddenly. I love you all.</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks everyone, i know there is a load of people i haven't mentioned but i tried to remember as many as i could. Thanks for this amazing experience, and to funky for choosing to make this server in the first place as its really changed me as a person. Thank you for the oppurtunities like becoming a member of the staff team and the tournaments. Until next time, peace out.&nbsp;</div>
