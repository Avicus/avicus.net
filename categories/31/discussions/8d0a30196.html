My mouse isn't necessarily a gaming mouse, but it is one of the best wireless mice out there: Logitech Marathon M705.

Although this is debatable, I have the Razer DeathAdder. Around 80$, but I got it for 50$ sale. I love it, its ergonomic for right handed players, and has enough DPI. LED looks sick, and 2 extra side buttons. I suggect it.

What type of gaming do you do the most? This factors HUGELY into a mouse.<br><br>FPS? MMO? MOBA? RTS? Or do you just do overall gaming?<br><br>Edit: If it's helpful, I right now own the Corsair M65; easily the best mouse for FPSing. AMA if you want.

Agreed; it's probably the best overall gaming mouse, goes from 200-12000 DPI, has a crapton of buttons, and the weight is tunable.<br><br>Retail price is $80, but it's currently $61 on Amazon.

I owned a deathadder, and it became shit in just 3 months...<br>I also owned the Naga, then in a couple of months as well, started to double-click when I click it once.<br><br>Now I own a SSS (SteelSeries Sensei) Pretty decent mouse, the design is simple, has an orange LED in the middle, and so far no problems whatsoever.

I've had my deathadder for about a year and it's working fine, I typically click around 13-14 cps.<br>But the software itself is so unreliable and sketchy, (also razor products being overpriced) plus I've heard so many incidents of razor products breaking in a short amount a time, so I DON'T recommend a razor product.<br>Maybe go with a steelseries rival, I heard good things about that (And people here are saying that it is.)

Lol, I can get 14 CPS, but I have to hold my mouse with my left hand and jitter with the other. I don't use it in game, my aim is terrible. That's why my mouse haven't broken, I rarely do it.

I believe the Logitech G303 comes closest in terms of specs and design to the DeathAdder.<br><br>It's also on sale right now on Amazon at $50.<br><br>IMO I'd still go with a G502 since it's definitely the best overall mouse. Unless RGB lighting is a must.

All Steelseries mice have side buttons.<br><br>In fact, the only gaming mouse I can think of that has no side buttons is the Logitech G100s, which isn't a very good mouse and is more of a low-budget mouse.<br><br>I could help you with finding a mouse you like, but you'd have to answer a few questions:<br>1. What type of games do you play the most?<br>2. What's your budget?<br>3. Any specific things you're looking for in a mouse? (for example, backlight)
