As most of you know I'm a ping god (14ms wattttt) and I don't like to show my skills through ping. So what I'm suggesting is we get a command depending on your ping to limit it. For example.<br><br>/ping-14 ms<br><br>/ping limit 100 ms<br><br>You can do /ping to yourself and to other players. To reset your true ping do /ping normal. Take note that this does NOT mean you can get 10 ms if your usual is 400 ms.<br><br>-Sevo

To everyone saying this is impossible, well... It isn't.<br>This could be achieved by denying packets with something like&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/protocollib/">ProtocolLib</a>.<br><br>So lets say you have a 10 ms ping. If you wanted an 100 ms ping then the server could deny all the packets. It would then have to remember the denied packets (In an ArrayList) to re-call them after the additional 90 ms delay so you don't lose any vital actions from the player (Like attacking, chatting etc). This would appear to everyone else that you are lagging.<br><br>It would be rather draining on the server and rather inaccurate, but it would work.

Ping is a word used for how good/bad your connection is.<br>What it does is ping comes in milliseconds (ms) and let's say your ping is 30 ms it takes 30 milliseconds to register anything you do in the server. 30 ms is 0.03 seconds so it only takes that amount of time to register let's say a hit you get on a player on nexus.

Or you can just go to your server page on your MC application and, put your mouse over the server you want to join and it will tell you right there.
