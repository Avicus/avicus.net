I'm sure you've seen that I've been demoted (and rightfully so), so here I am making a quick thank you post to all who have made my time as a staff member brilliant. (NOT A GOODBYE THREAD)<br><br><b>Midnightstorm</b> - my wheezing buddy, so much fun to play avicus and hypixel on and I wish we can still be friends even though I don't have that special rank anymore.<br><b>dev_revs</b> - the first mature team leader that I have had a chance to work with. You're a wonderful person and I can't thank you enough for giving me a chance in your team and I hope that I can continue to improve with your guidance.<br><b>Eteh</b> - so much fun to talk to and I hope we can continue talking even though I don't have that blessed rank anymore.<br><b>All Other Mods</b> - keep doing what you're doing, just remember to not take it too seriously and remember to relax every so often so that you can enjoy your position. Maybe one day I'll come back, not that some of you might care.<br><b>Seniors</b> - It's a shame that I didn't really appeal to you guys as a mod but I certainly think you guys fit your role's perfectly. I hope that one day one of you will become admin and really run and present the server well.<br><b>Admins</b> - I never really had much to do with you guys (other than Arigen demoting me and occasionally talking to posighdun), but you are truely the best admins I have ever had the opportunity to work under. Your amazing hardwork and dedication to make avicus a wonderful place to play and grow as a mineman has made me feel very appreciative of being a part of such a diverse and growing community. I wish you all the best in your future endeavors and may you be successful in running this business.<br><b>Map Devs</b> - Never had anything to do with you guys but you are a large part of the reason Avicus is so popular. Keep on producing brilliant and intuitive maps.<br><b>Devs</b> - Again, I've never had much to do with you, but I'm happy to see that all of your work has come out almost perfectly and I wish future tasks come out in the same fashion.<br><b>Other people with ranks</b> - Keep on making avicus a great place and promoting it as a casual and competitive minigame server.<br><br>I just want to thank everyone in the community who genuinely made my time as a mod memorable. I hoped one day that I could go higher than just mod, but I guess my attitude got in the way. Such is life.<br>Hopefully I'll see you all on the server and on ts.

It's sad to see you not Mod anymore :(. In my opinion, you should of gotten at least a warning to improve your behavior, so you could of had a second chance and time to improve your behavior.

No one was alarmed when you were admin, I cannot recall you ever interacting with the staff other than those in the sitahood. Also taking nearly a month to accept people or deny people via interviews wasn't exactly your best showing.<br><br>I'll have you know that even as a non staff member I have a good relationship with the admins and senior staff, more so than ever. <br><br>SO get off your high horse and get behind them please.

Genuinely this is news to me. Those guys were my best friends which is why we talked a ton but its not like I ignored people? You were actually someone I respected on the team which is why you being hostile every time we've spoken since has really confused me.<br><br>Obviously its been a while, so theres a lot I've forgotten. And its not like there wasn't plenty of people I wronged but I really don't recall ever having any problems with you.
