Hello Avicus!<br><br>Long story short I would like the creation of a basic nebula shop to put on certain maps. These maps will be mostly Throwback maps but I would it would be easier for those to add a nebula shop into their maps if they wish for it.&nbsp;<br><br>Your job is simple. Tell me what was in the nebula shop and certain details about them. What level did people get certain items at? What did items do? Any information that will be useful to get as close as we can to the old Nebula Shop. Thank you very much for any help that is provided.
