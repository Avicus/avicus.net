<h3>Tournament News</h3>

<p>Congratulations to Team Allah who won the Battle of Eternity Tournament last weekend. Congratulations to all those who were runner ups. All prizes will be distributed shortly. If you haven't done so already then I'd kindly ask that you fill out the feedback form for the Tournament, <a href="https://avicus.net/forums/discussions/50a1adbf3">https://avicus.net/forums/discussions/50a1adbf3</a> . </p>

<h3>Atlas Updates<br></h3><h3><span style=" font-weight: 300;">The maps are almost done and the Beta server was launched last week, beta.avic.us . I will be running some more testing sessions sometime this week and next week. You can look at the development tab to see our Devs hard at work trying to meet deadlines. It won't be too long now until it's release. </span></h3><ul>

</ul>

<h3>Posighdun's Address<br><span style=" font-weight: 300;"> I thought that it might be beneficial for us to add a part of the update where either Ethan or myself talk about some things. Basically what's been happening this week is quite a bit, our developers have been busy coding, our tournament staff have been busy sorting all the tournament stuff out and as usual the players have been busy playing :P I just wanted to quickly address a few small things. Firstly, the Autoclicker plugin which was a massive success during the tournament will be slightly tweaked and moved into Public servers at a random date. A bit more testing will be done to just make it more reliable. Secondly, last admin meeting I talked to Keenan and brought up the proposition of changing the Voting rewards. For those that are not aware, you can vote for us in the top tab called "Vote". Recently our votes have dropped by a lot, which I know is because of the rewards. So, I'm proposing a question to you all, <b> What kind of reward would make you vote? </b> Please comment down below. It needs to be realistic, getting admin rank for voting isn't going to happen. Thirdly, Ethan is away on camp so I'm your go to guy for any issues over this next 2 weeks. And Lastly I'd like to welcome new players and new forum members, this week alone there have been quite a few new faces from various backgrounds, so welcome :D</span></h3>



<h3>Avicus Community Slack</h3>

<p> The Administrator team is still encouraging you all to join community slack, just remember to contact an admin to be added to it! Thanks to <img title="PieZ" class="avatar" style=" width: 20px; height: 20px;" alt="PieZ" src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/PieZ?size=40"> <a title="Link: /PieZ" style="color: rgb(255, 92, 92);" href="/PieZ">PieZ</a>, we have official rules in place now that users will have to stick to, although they are quite straight forward. In addition to this Jahaj has been promoted to Community Administrator like 3 months ago!</p>

I'd like to really see some answers to my question so that I can edit the rewards. Voting is essential, and although it won't bring back 3000 players, it is one of many small paths we can take to make things better.

A Voting Reward should be keys to open crates, so we don't have to buy some of them.

I'll look into that and double check to make sure I'm not wrong. If it's broken I'll get it fixed, but I still want to know what others think about voting rewards. I personally don't vote because a) I forget xd and b) I make 3 times that amount of credits in 1 match.

Or you can have Top Voter ranks of the month, for people who earn the Top 3 slots . The rank can show up in game and on the forums. The voting can reset every month.

Yes because you were definitely addressing a mistake.... Like I said above, If your commend doesn't follow the rules it gets deleted.

so ur warning me for saying "ur spelling mistakes makes me cringe lol" ok, good job bro, very professional, instead of justifying your decision to archive my perfectly fine post, you warn me. Thousands of threads have things that are not nice not are relatable to the topic yet you tend to ignore them. Lost all respect for you Sessp, especially when I thought you were probably the better admin from the recent ones.

We can all agree voting is a great, proven method to advertise, since the more votes you have, the more inclined people are to try out the server and the higher you are on the servers list.<br><b><br></b>The "reward" for voting though is what the major issue is. There is 2 ideas that usually occur:<br><b><br></b><b>1)</b> To avoid voters becoming too "wealthy" or "overpowered" over non-voters, low rewards are placed on the voters, so that it takes more votes to actually matter and make a difference. This would cause people to not really see the point in voting, and don't vote, which is a bit of a let-down for the owner (Kylo).<br><br><b>2)</b> Or they can offer a large reward for voting, which would cause more voters, but a loss in the balance of the players. Such would give the server more votes, but would really effect the players and gameplay.&nbsp;<br><br>It is about finding the balance between what people want to receive from voting and what would not give a huge advantage and affect gameplay too much.&nbsp;<br><br>As Kylo runs the server he can decide what he wants it to do; either choice 1 or 2, possibly even find the middle ground. There is no "correct way" to do it, just opinions and ideas.<br><br>It is about the middle ground, and this where the balance of voting lies, you've just got to find it!<br><br>-<br><br>From observation I would suggest Kylo wants the server to be balanced, EULA compliant. So I have whipped up some ideas that should match his criteria, I hope they will at least be discussed. :)<br><b><br>Voting reward ideas:<br></b><ul><li><b>Crate keys -&nbsp;</b>Let's be honest, the crate concept sounded really successful on paper, but when we discovered we had to pay to open one it was completely disregarded. This seems like a huge waste to me so why not reward voters with keys to unlock their many, wasted crates? Perhaps incorporate this into the lobby?</li></ul><br><ul><li><b>Top voter leaderboard -&nbsp;</b>This would add a touch of competitiveness to voting, giving you the urge to make voting a daily habit. I haven't got an reward ideas for this at the moment, but I'm sure there are lots of possibilities. A forum badge or something would definitely be satisfactory.<br></li></ul><br><ul><li><b>Nexus/CTH kits -&nbsp;</b>Basically the concept is that you will get special kits for voting; a random one per vote which lasts 24 hours. The kits shouldn't be extremely overpowered, but should include some fancy perks that'll make others jealous. I'm sure the MapDevs can brainstorm some pretty cool kits.</li></ul><br><ul><li><b>Vote reward multiplier -&nbsp;</b>So here me out...&nbsp;<i>"[VOTE] 'Player' just voted! Vote in the next 40 seconds to receive X2 rewards!"&nbsp;</i>Not sure if that's going to attract people to vote, but who knows.</li></ul><br>-<br><br>Avicus has many unique gamemodes, there is no faction style one where you can claim your kits or whatever. It's maps constantly rotating, so common voting rewards are going to be ruled out. It's difficult to have perks/rewards on Avicus, so you must give the dev team some leeway when it comes to this.<br><br>-<br><br><b>TL;DR -&nbsp;</b>Avicus is EULA compliant, strives to have gameplay as fair as possible and has unique gamemodes meaning rewards are limited. I listed some of my ideas.
