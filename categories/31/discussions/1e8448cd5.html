5 mods....

I just checked....and there are only 5 mods left. First off, I would like to give props to whoever is left, those people are:<br>Jake<br>Peachy<br>BenDooley<br>Apricot<br>rswizzled<br>But, come on! I know that 3 mods were promoted, and if we count Sr. Mods, then we have 10, but seriously? OCN is about twice our size, yet they have 58 mods. We have 5. Now, I know there are new Jr. mods, and they look promising, but they have to be ready for mod. Let's hope that we can pull it together.<br>And Jr.Mods, you might just save the server.

Everything happens for a reason, every demotion, promotion, or retiring.<br><br>Since this Junior Mod batch was one of the best we've ever had, many will be getting promoted soon, so don't worry.

My coach has a good saying, "Quality always beats quantity." Would you like us to have 60 mods, most inactive, who are less than acceptable? Or would you prefer to have the best mods possible while weeding out the ones who still ned improvement.

I don't understand why you're so defensive, I'm helping you out if anything. Instead of spamming the forums maybe contact Nolan through skype to attempt an appeal of the punishment.<br><br>And that wasn't out of context FYI.<br>Consider revising grammar.
