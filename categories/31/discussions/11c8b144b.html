I got banned :( but also I donated. This is not fair. I paid my money to get a rank and now I'm banned. I could possibly take this to court, but I don't think I will. I was wondering if there's any way of getting a refund. Alternatively, I paid for gold and so did my brother randjminecraft, so I was wandering if I could make his rank emerald to make his life better. I don't think a refund is realistic BUT PLEASE TRANSFERE GOLD ON MY ACC TO EMERALD ON RANDJS. thanks

You can't trasnfer ranks. Like on OCN, I payed 50$ and get banned for ever, so, apologize in your head.

Honestly, your constant complaining will HIGHLY decrease your chances of getting unbanned.&nbsp;<br><br>Also, when I used my side-modification and got temp banned I didn't make a forum post about it because I took responsibility and accepted the punishment, something you seem incapable of doing.

You should know by now that advertising is against the rules on Avicus and it is an instant perm ban. Stop making posts about it and email support@avicus.net.

As a donator, you receive no special privileges when being punished. You should've thought of breaking the rules and the consequences following before doing so. Your donor rank cannot be transferred to another account or be terminated for a refund.

By buying a rank you agree that there will be no refund if you get banned.
