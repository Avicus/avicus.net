<b>Dad:</b> Has anger issues, gets steaming mad pretty much every day for the slightest thing (misplaced spoons, forks, knives, no eating utensils due to being washed or just finished being washed in the washing machine, e.t.c.). I can go on with many other examples, but eh. Otherwise I ask him to get something I need a very good point&nbsp;<b></b>or else it's a definitive no, but he does care about my sister and I&nbsp;<b>when he is not mad</b>. o xd, forgot, 2 years ago, my sister misplaced the tv remote, had a friend who came to pick me up, had him wait 10 minutes for me because me dad got really pissed at me because my sister misplaced the remote, had to find it and found it in the washroom 10 min later xd.<br><b>Mom:</b> Has a tough life with my dad, always saying that if my sister and I weren't born or we were already out of the house she would leave my dad. Staying with him for us, she says we need a dad to grow mentally healthy. I know she cares and it's nice but she can spaz out at anything little that peeves her off and starts screaming that we are going to get her killed one day from all the "stress" we are putting on her. Other from that little issue she is awesome.<br><b>Sister:</b> Little brat who will cry if she doesn't get what she wants (she is 8 years old, grade 2 or 3). She won't eat anything unless she likes it or it's sweets, has her toys laying around everywhere in the house. Worst part. I'm on me laptop when I'm not allowed because when I'm allowed it's usually at 9 when I finish everything. Even then I only get like 20 min because it's late, no matter if it's on the weekend or not... guess who isn't allowing me? my dad. But back to the point, sister always trying to get me in trouble trying to see if I'm playing. So if ya see me randomly go afk in the middle of a game it's either my mom, dad or sister who is awlking around xd. And every now and then I still wonder why I help her and care for her when she needs help or I just get her an expensive gift on her birthday heh. Guess I'm just a good brother.<br><br>Can't wait to turn 18!1!1! Gettin' myself an apartment probably :D Livin' alone :)

Yeah, well, better just lock the thread. If someone posts something weird about their family then you better believe that someone will judge it. This thread in general is just a bad idea if you don't want a flame war of people defending their family.

I have a father and a mother, a sister and two brothers.<br><br>I wouldn't say my relationship to my father is great due to our past but we are working on it, it's difficult when you have witnessed and been a victim of violence for so long.&nbsp;<br><br>I would give the world to my mother, if I could, she is the reason why I try to never threat anyone wrong and when/if I do foolish mistakes she is the reason I swallow every ounce of my pride and apologize.&nbsp;<br><br>I never meet my older brother and sister, it's mainly because we have different opinions about something and I don't want to be associated with them.&nbsp;<br><br>I try to meet and spend as much time with my younger brother as I can but I work so much so yeah.

so no reality?<br>The guy said "Has hit me" meaning it was in the past.<br>And plus, we gotta get to reality one day. There are parents who hit their kids, that's that.<br>If he doesn't want to see what is going on in other peoples lives than he doesn't have to look here.<br>Maybe the player who is saying that (forgot the name of it as I'm writing) might feel better writing that there, we might be helping go through stress.<br>We should have the freedom to say what we want, it's not hurting anyone, and if it is, a simple choice is to not look at the post.

There are children of age 12 on the forums.<br><br>I don't think that stumbling upon this topic and seeing that there is child abuse going on would be a good influence for them.

Dad- Extremely hard working and does an amazing job at his work, pushes me to be better at everything (I get my competitiveness from him).<br>Mom- Really awesome, we don't argue as much as we used to, though she gets mad and stressed very easily.&nbsp;<br>Brother #1- I'm not very close with him, he's away at college and I don't see him often. He showed me a lot of video games and let me hijack his Xbox a lot when I was younger.<br>Brother #2- I'm not really close with him, sometimes we watch Netflix together.<br>Overall I'm extremely thankful for the family I've been given. I wouldn't ask for them any other way.

Är du helt bakom flötet?&nbsp;<br><br>I don't understand why someone would be offended by reality.

I actually think that in some instances it is. If a parent is quite old, then their parents would have most likely hit them (or their grandparents hit their parents) and that action probably passed down. Even if a parent isn't that old abuse can be simply passed down. As for the offensive bit, I'm not going to go into much detail but the things some people have done to their own children... A smack is very minor to these things<br><br>But even so, some people have been uncomfortable because of my post, so I changed it-even if I didn't need to. The past is in the past. (Sorry off topic to the reply .-.)
