</h1>
So, after coming back from a Tzu Chi summer camp (for those who don't know, Tzu Chi is a foundation dedicated to helping others in need), I learned that time with our parents and relatives is precious. I finally realized that I spend way too much time on Minecraft, and 95% of the time I spend playing Minecraft is being spent on Avicus. So I'm leaving Avicus, Minecraft, and hopefully gaming, so I can spend more time with my family.&nbsp;<br><br>People in the Philippines affected by the typhoon, poorer regions in Africa, Haiti, and all those poorer countries would be happy if they get to eat even one meal a day. And yet we worry about prestiging, getting to the top of the leaderboard, and getting a good KD, but why does that stuff even matter?<br><br>After a week without video games, I realized how good it felt. I realized that video games don't help me in life in any way at all, that prestiging and KD won't get me a job later on in life. I'll still come back and rush once in a while, but very rarely. I will continue my videos, but they'll be released way farther apart. To be honest, Avicus is also starting to bore me. Rushing isn't fun anymore in Nebula. Getting kits means nothing to me in Nexus. If the old maps had all stayed, and stayed unchanged, then I might have stayed. I already uninstalled Minecraft, and I'll record on my brother's computer. I'm also trying to quit League of Legends now.<br><br>I'll definitely still be active on the forums, and on Skype. So if you want to contact me, add me on Skype.<br><br>Oh, and please don't try to convince me to stay. Don't argue with me. I already made up my mind. Nothing will convince me. I'm not trying to convince anyone to leave either.<br><br><i>-JK</i>

he's saying it correctly. they do matter cause they're alive and real but you have to choose your friends which are very true and trustworthy to you just like your real friends.
