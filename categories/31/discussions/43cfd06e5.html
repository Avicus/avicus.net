Hello everyone!<br>I made a map hoping that a 1 Team DTM is possible. Kind of like a race for the monuments against your own team. I guess you could say it is nebula mixed with minotaur. Anyways is a 1 team DTM possible? I have recieved mixed responses and the only change would be 1 team in the yml.&nbsp;<br>+I don't want my map just sitting around xD.<br><br>Conditions<br>-no pvp

If you have 1 team going to destroy the monument, people will just keep blocking each other so nobody can break the monument. The stalemate would be too real.

Well eventually, there would be an angle where the objective can be mined. Plus, I intend on a small player limit.

If there is a 1 team DTM how would the team with the monuments win?

But gameplay like that wouldn't be entirely entertaining, would it (I'd probably smash my keyboard out of frustration, but that's just me).

-1, I agree to what Tino said, this wouldn't end up being very fun and would lead to constant arguments.

So in the yml, I would have the objectives coordinates be the ones on your own teams side. Normally, you would have coords for the opposite side but, there is only 1 team and 1 side, and 5 monuments.

There'd be a ton of team killing, spawn blocking, spleefing, ect....

Yeah it's a very creative idea, no doubt, but i think the negatives outweigh the positives on this one man :/<br>But nice thinking, i think we can all agree :D

Honestly, this game would be extremely boring, and would just be block spamming, as Tino said.

I have a feeling this map would be&nbsp;<b>love&nbsp;</b>for grinders because they will just keep blocking the monuments from you breaking them !

Doesn't work, because you can't destroy your own monument.

When mining a monument I presume you know that you can be walked in front of which prevents you from mining to monument. I think this is a cool concept and an original idea, but I just don't see how people would play it without getting trolled in some way.

I still don't get how this is supposed to work. Do you race to get to the monument? Are you allowed to slow anyone's progress at all? IMO, it's impossible. Even if you do get it to work, I doubt it would play well. Again, just my opinion.

I think it would be better if it was everyone for himself (pvp enabled).
