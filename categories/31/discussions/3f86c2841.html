Yeah uh, i don't know if anyone cares, but to avoid having to say the exact same reason to people asking I'm just gonna say it here.<br>I'm stepping down as a moderator. It's only been 1-2 months but I've been given the privilege to moderate and it's been pretty cool. I know what it's like to be the building blocks of the server, and how shit gets run here. So thanks to the whole staff team, especially joel and micheal. You guys are the best.<br>Anyway, for the actual reason I have personal reasons, but I just don't see myself moderating anymore. I want to have fun in minecraft during my free time, and moderating has become a chore and a burden for me. Essentially, to re-phrase this in a more insensitive way I'm tired of babysitting. I contributed a bit to the staff team and gave what I got, but for now I'm gonna be fading away.<br>This doesn't mean I'm quitting Avicus. I'll play, but my activity will decrease.

It's not easy to moderate and it's not for everyone. But you were a good moderator and it was a pleasure to work along side you.
