In this third Staff Spotlight we're taking time to get know one of our newest Senior Moderators - <img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/7a72eafdfa6c48a0beffd9acd53edca0?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/TylerdotMichael.html" style="color: #FF9805">TylerdotMichael</a>. We're excited to have him on the team, and we look forwards to what he's going to bring to the table!<br><br><span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 700;  "><span style="font-weight:normal;"><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" background-color: transparent; font-weight: 700; ">Introduce yourself</span><span style=" background-color: transparent; "><br class="kix-line-break"></span><span style=" background-color: transparent; ">Hey everyone, many of you know me as Tyler. I’ve been playing on Avicus for over 3 years - back when it was known as MC Zone. I’ve been playing minecraft for over 7 years now. I am a student in college hoping to be finishing up here soon. I went to two different colleges at once, so I have completed my AA in Graphic Design and the second degree I am working on is a BS in Integrative Studies. For those of you that don’t know what that is, it pretty much allows me to make up my own degree with 3 interest. My areas are in Costume Design, Fine Art, and New Media Art. My goal with these degrees is to work at Disney.</span><span style=" background-color: transparent; "><br class="kix-line-break"></span><span style=" background-color: transparent; "><br class="kix-line-break"></span><span style=" background-color: transparent; font-weight: 700; ">What are your hobbies?</span><span style=" background-color: transparent; "><br class="kix-line-break"></span><span style=" background-color: transparent; ">Pretty much anything creative. Specifically costuming, rendering, video games, and getting this t-shirt business going.</span><span style=" background-color: transparent; "><br class="kix-line-break"></span><span style=" background-color: transparent; font-weight: 700; "><br class="kix-line-break"></span><span style=" background-color: transparent; font-weight: 700; ">​What are you most excited/obsessed over at the moment?</span><span style=" background-color: transparent; "><br class="kix-line-break"></span><span style=" background-color: transparent; ">Anyone that knows me well, it is League of Legends. This is the one thing that constantly helps me procrastinate from my homework. I just can’t say no to playing this game lol.</span><span style=" background-color: transparent; "><br class="kix-line-break"></span><span style=" background-color: transparent; "><br class="kix-line-break"></span><span style=" background-color: transparent; font-weight: 700; ">What interests you the most in life?</span><span style=" background-color: transparent; "><br class="kix-line-break"></span><span style=" background-color: transparent; ">It is getting to be a part of something that’s bigger than myself. All of us, individually, can only do so much on our own. But when we all come together and work towards a common goal it’s quite amazing to see what we can do. This is specifically why I have such a huge fascination with the Disney Parks. The things they are able to create and do down there is amazing.</span></p><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" background-color: transparent; "><br></span></p><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" background-color: transparent; "><b>What music/art/media do you like?</b></span><span style=" background-color: transparent; "><br class="kix-line-break"></span><span style=" background-color: transparent; ">My music taste pretty much varies. Currently obsessed over the soundtrack to the TV show Crazy Ex-Girlfriend. When it comes to art and media and I highly fascinated with how technology is being combined in the costuming world - hence why I am studying New Media Art. This can range from 3D printing, lights in clothing, projection lighting, and eInks.</span><span style=" background-color: transparent; "><br class="kix-line-break"></span><span style=" background-color: transparent; "><br class="kix-line-break"></span><span style=" background-color: transparent; font-weight: 700; ">​Where are you from?</span><span style=" background-color: transparent; "><br class="kix-line-break"></span><span style=" background-color: transparent; ">Midwest, USA. Never traveled outside of the States, really hope to someday. Also a big fan of accents so it’s great being apart of a server where I get to hear so many different ones.</span><span style=" background-color: transparent; "><br class="kix-line-break"></span><span style=" background-color: transparent; "><br class="kix-line-break"></span><span style=" background-color: transparent; font-weight: 700; ">What’s your favourite thing about being a staff member?</span><span style=" background-color: transparent; "><br class="kix-line-break"></span><span style=" background-color: transparent; ">Being a player on the server for so long and now being a part of it is great. It’s really exciting to know I can help shape and have input into where the server goes. I want to help keep it the wonderful place it is/was when I started and keep that going strong.</span></p><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" background-color: transparent; "><br></span></p><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" background-color: transparent; "><b>What excites you the most about becoming a Senior Moderator?</b></span><span style=" background-color: transparent; "><br class="kix-line-break"></span><span style=" background-color: transparent; ">For me I view it as an opportunity to have more of a voice in the staff team to hopefully help create a great place that can be passed down to our players. I want to help keep Avicus a fun and safe place that players can join when they have had a shitty day and just want to hang out and bond with other people.</span><span style=" background-color: transparent; "><br class="kix-line-break"></span><span style=" background-color: transparent; "><br class="kix-line-break"></span><span style=" background-color: transparent; font-weight: 700; ">What’s your most memorable experience as a staff member?</span><span style=" background-color: transparent; "><br class="kix-line-break"></span><span style=" background-color: transparent; ">I wouldn’t say I have an exact favorite moment. Some of the ones that come to mind that I loved would be when the server is packed full of people, not only players but staff as well. I always liked getting to see the staff team working together in taking reports and also playing with the community and doing fun goofy things. Also whenever random TNT spawns. That’s my favorite xD</span><span style=" background-color: transparent; "><br></span></p></span>
