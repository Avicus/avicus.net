They really need to fix the download terrain thingy. Whenever I log in it takes like 5 minutes to download the terrain, and then when it finally downloads it, it takes another minute or so to load. So it's getting a little old. Again if this is a spam topic, I apologize. Have a nice day :)

Holy crap i know right!!!<br>God damn i thought i was the only one with this problem, overtime you join the server or leave a game it takes ages, and when the hub actually does appear, it takes another 2 minutes to render and even move around.

I think there is a new lobby coming with the next big update so it might be fixed there.<br><br>Anyway even with my 150ms ping it still loads in a couple seconds for me. Could be something to do with your internet (not ping but speeds). Could also happen if you have a computer thats not that good as it would take more time to load all the chunks etc.
