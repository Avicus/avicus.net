Changes in Staff Demotions

<a href='/users/MidnightBeats.html' style='color: Gray'>MidnightBeats</a>
<small>January  9, 2016 at 11:01 PM UTC</small>
</h1>
Effective immediately, moderators will no longer be allowed to request evidence for their demotions. Keep in mind that this&nbsp;<b>does not&nbsp;</b>mean that we will demote moderators without reason. Recently, demoted junior moderators have been doing this, and many of them have simply denied the legitimacy of the presented evidence. This should not be happening, and we will no longer be tolerating this. However, we will still collect evidence for our records. This will also improve efficiency during staff applications.<br><br>-The Senior Staff Team

I'm pretty sure because evidence isn't needed. Like, people were asking for evidence of them 'not being active enough', which is pathetic.

Um what?<br><br>If someone gets demoted they deserve to know why they got demoted and what they did wrong and presenting evidence is a part of that.<br><br>With regards to the juniors, who are they to deny their evidence if it's concrete?&nbsp;<br><br>If you have legitimate evidence you shouldn't be having any problems.

What the fuck?<br><br>How does this solve anything? This is a cheap way of solving something that sounds more like a personal problem. This doesn't solve staff quality, nor fit any priorities. You're doing this for your own benefit to throw out some other moderators.<br><br>If you're that desperate, then time will take its course if they need to be demoted. You should also alert the community beforehand before such a big change, because I doubt many would consent to this. It's like passing a bill for a country, asking what's in it/why, and you say "You'll find out when it's passed".<br><br>Come in, it isn't logical and you know it. Please revert this, it makes it open to more bias. The community doesn't want this.

There is no logic... It was the least of my worries. Actually, I'm half considering calling the OP post a bullshit reason, because I handled a ton of interview denials, staff warnings and junior trials ending, and even feedback. How many disputes? One.

This is good gossip. I will keep it short since I could go on for hours...<br><br>What you just did, makes it more obvious that you are running away from everything. How can demoted staff feel like they have been treated fairly? How do they know if evidence IS present during senior discussions? Seriously, this is making me cringe. Just because juniors are disliking decisions, they have every right to; because if you were demoted - obviously you would want to question it... Right? Why affect mod ranks too?&nbsp;<br><br>Actually, was this discussed with the general staff body? I assure you the majority of mods dislike this change. <br><br>"Improved efficiency of staff apps"<br>LOL? How? Staff apps have nothing to do with this change; and lord help us if you reply with "so we can focus on apps"..

Surely if the evidence is already there, it can't be too hard to just copy a small paragraph and paste it? And if they want to argue/discuss, that shouldn't be a burden.

Basically you feel like this change is going to eliminate the arguing against evidence presented for a demotion, and sure, it will. But the only thing this is going to result in is far more arguing for multiple reasons. <br><br>

There'll be arguments over this change in general, claims of bias, actual bias (trust me, it'll happen), and of course, a desire for reasoning behind demotions. I really - And I mean really - Don't think this is going to resolve anything. You're pretty much asking for disapproval.

He-llooooo Drama Aleet nation, I'm your host, the Rap God. Today on Drama Alert, we'll take a look at the huge mistake the admin team has made by not allowing evidence to be seen by the demoted party.<br><br>I'm going to try and get the admins to come on and talk to me about what was going through their head as they made this decision.

If we petition and formulate strong arguments, the admins should listen. I do not believe they're that close minded: I know both dawning and midnight, they'll learn from this mistake. They know who the server is for.

You can probably bend words even more off teamspeak tbh. In word you can clearly state what needs to be stated and if someone tries bending the words because you wrote it incorrectly but its obvious what you want to say. On teamspeak if someone doesn't understand fully &amp; don't fight after can bend the words and have no clear cut evidence of what you said.<br><br>Best to write it here where everyone can see it as well so you don't get asked 100 million bajillion times ;]

This is good gossip. I will keep it short since I could go on for hours...<br><br>What you just did, makes it more obvious that you are running away from everything. How can demoted staff feel like they have been treated fairly? How do they know if evidence IS present during senior discussions? Seriously, this is making me cringe. Just because juniors are disliking decisions, they have every right to; because if you were demoted - obviously you would want to question it... Right? Why affect mod ranks too?&nbsp;<br><br>Actually, was this discussed with the general staff body? I assure you the majority of mods dislike this change. <br><br>"Improved efficiency of staff apps"<br>LOL? How?

I agree and disagree with this change since SR staff shouldn't have to chase you done just to get evidence, though not being allowed to ask for evidence is just a terrible idea and the fact people in the community or fellow staff don't know what happened which can create some flame within the staff team and the community.

If I were to be demoted, I would want to see the evidence. As stated in the other posts, if you have legitimate evidence you shouldn't have problems with demotions. I don't like this, and I think it can lead to bias.<br><br>Edit: Thanks Ethan &lt;3
