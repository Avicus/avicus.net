Ok hey guys I don't understand this...<br>Apparently " Swearing is allowed " but as long as it is not directed at anyone.<br>And staff aren't punishing Swearers.<br><br>Also it states in the rules:<br><span><br>PART A Section 1)<br>Maintain a casual and positive atmosphere at all times.<u><b> Inappropriate or
aggressive language, regardless if it is directed at someone or not,
will not be tolerated.</b></u> Be respectful of all players. Harassment,
bullying, rudeness and excessive swearing is strictly not allowed.</span><br><br>Its baffling for me? Report or no Report I don't want to get in trouble with staff

I noticed this to. Didn't want to mention it because I thought the staff member was on a undercover mission!

Always report, you don't need to be correct in reports. Also it is down to the staff members judgement.

It depends on the situation. Just report, and we will come to assess the situation.

If you're blowing up your own base, it's team grief. It doesn't matter if there are other players or their structures nearby.

Actually, it's fine to blow up bridges leading to a monument or blowing up the ground around the monument. This of course is only ok if there are no players around. It's just tactics, it takes a lot less time to blow out a monument pit with TNT that it does to mine it with a pickaxe, same goes for the bridge. This is something I feel that staff team should deffidently be aware of.

It all depends on the staff member. However yes, I do punish for swearing in the chat. Not right away, I warn them first. Then if they continue, I kick them. Etc... But you make a point, the staff should enforce this rule a little more.

You've probably been told this over a million times before, but the punishments for swearing are not set in stone. It depends on what they say, who it is saying them (not in bias), why they're saying them, and who they are saying them to.

If you have a complaint on any staff member, feel free to PM me on Skype or any other Senior Staff member. If you're talking about a Sr. Staff member, moderating the actual server is not always a priority. There's support emails to deal with, managing the Mod + Jr. Mod team, as well as planning events.

Staff aren't always there to help, that's why this happens - there could be a lack of staff on at the current time, like there is now.
