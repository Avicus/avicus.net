You are given 1 week to construct a map in Nebula, and it can be either TDM or DTM, or even your own unique concept. We are looking for a large talent and variety of maps, that have to be quality-based and not just done to look pretty. Here are some questions that you might have, answered by me;<br><br><u><b>Who are the judges?</b></u><br>As of now, the only judges announced are ParaSpider. There will be a hunt for more either scouted from the map development team, or the staff team itself. We want judging to be fair and made off a scoring system for x/10 in several categories, and the judges will be scoring maps based off that set guideline.<br><br><u><b>What are the guidelines?</b></u><br>Maps are judged in the following aspects;<br>- <i>Gameplay</i> (How do you think the map will play on the servers?)<br>- <i>Aesthetics</i> (How pleasing to the eye does it look?)<br>- <i>Creativity </i>(Is it unique and really stands out?)<br>- <i>Size </i>(How is the size? Is it too big or too small?)<br>- <i>YAML </i>(Is the YAML done well enough?)<br><br>Again, each is rated out of 10. You can have a mapdev do your YAML, but it takes off points. There are 4 key points, so it is graded as such. Maps can still be denied before the deadline, but make sure to be careful and mindful of each category. Shoot for the stars!<br><br><u><b>What gamemodes can I do?</b></u><br>You can do anything possible within YAML in Nebula, however it is reccomended to do DTM (Destroy the Monument) or TDM (Team deathmatch). OiTN is also possible, but that is a submode.<br><br><u><b>How do I submit my map?</b></u><br>Put a [CONTEST] tag in the title. By doing so, you are entered into the contest and put into a spreadsheet. It contains the map name, authors, thread link, jurisdiction of approval/denial, and it's gamemode. Only Nebula maps are eligible to be in this contest. You have the permission to post your thread link in the post below so I can see it easier.<br><br>I have been put in charge by DoctaPop to run this, so any issues that you have can be directed to me (ParaSpider) via this post or if on a more private matter, you can contact me through skype on xthemastercow.<br><br><u><b>What are the rules?</b></u><br>All Avicus rules apply, and therefore these below apply as well.<br><br>1. <b>Do not give inconstructive feedback</b> by knocking others down to build yourself up.<br>2. <b>Do not steal maps; all maps are your property.</b> Violations of this are a perma ban.<br>3. <b>Do not ghost produce;</b> don't have other users make a map for you and you take credit.<br>4. <b>Do not spam judges;</b> patience is a large key. Wait for a response on your map.<br>5. <b>Do not ghost view;</b> don't tally a ton of thread views in your thread for attention.<br>6. <b>Do not make joke maps;</b> all maps must be true submissions to the server.<br>7. <b>Do not submit maps made prior to this;</b> all maps must be "newly produced".<br>8. <b>Always give credit.</b> No matter what the case, credit everyone who authored.<br><br><u><b>How can I create YAML?</b></u><br>Use our documentation resource at docs.avicus.net.<br><br><u><b>How will it work?</b></u><br>There will be an "Event" folder in Nebula. We will put the maps in there that are accepted and publicly add them into the rotations once tested properly and feedback has been collected by the community. You have a voice, use it to give criticism. Testings will be announced later on if applicable.<br><br><u><b>Is the spreadsheet public?</b></u><br>Not yet, however all denied and accepted maps will be replied to by me.<br><br><b><u>What is the prize?</u></b><br>To be announced. Most likely an emerald rank, and if said user has a rank already they may receive pets.&nbsp;<br><br><i>Time started;</i> October 2nd, 2014<br><i>Time ending;</i> October 9th, 2014
