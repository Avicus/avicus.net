Is there any way we can check if a player has already been banned? I dont want to inconvenience the mods/staff by reporting someone who has already been banned :)

sure go under the stats of the person(<a href="http://www.avicus.net/" rel="nofollow">www.avicus.net/</a>&lt;name of the person&gt;)<br><br>then go on infractions. Also just do <a href="http://www.avicus.net/infractions" rel="nofollow">www.avicus.net/infractions</a> to see the resent punishments

Go to that particular players profile by avicus.net/playernamehere &nbsp; &nbsp;and then click the infractions tab. If they have been banned it would have come up with a ban and see whether the expires day is after the current day. If there is no expires day that means it they have been permanently banned<br><br>EDIT: ninja'd QQ

In-game, you cannot report an offline player.&nbsp;<br><br>In order to see who is banned, you can go to <a rel="nofollow">avicus.net/infractions</a>&nbsp;to check who has been recently banned.<br><br>For player-specific concerns, you can go to avicus.net/&lt;playername&gt; in order to see the person's profile. Go to the infractions tab and then see if that person has been banned or not.&nbsp;<br><br>I hope this cleared out some questions. :D

I'm confused about this?<br>How so you report banned players? They can't even log into the server...&nbsp;<br>You can only use /report on players in your game<br>Or do you mean Player Reports on the forums?

Go to the person's profile on the leaderboard and check their infractions that way :)
