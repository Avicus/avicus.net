Hi guys, I recently applied for Junior Moderator. I was wondering how long it would take to get a response. I don't want to sound pushy or in a rush but I was just checking whether it actually worked or not. Thanks a lot &lt;3

They have a lot of people applying so it may take awhile for a response, just wait a little bit and good luck! :D

When I read this post's tittle, I thought you wrote down your app in the wrong section, xD.

I'm assuming that replies to each application will begin to decrease in time amounts due to the fact that a majority of people who wanted to apply had already filed their application when they first opened/earlier this month.<br><br>Now there's only a few still wanting to apply at this stage, which means less applications, thus faster responses.

Seems like there is some sort of a gate wherein only a few people will get their results at a time due to the new batch system that's being implemented. You just have to wait.

You're guaranteed a final decision, take me for an example.<br>I applied on the first day, got denied but was given another opportunity.<br>I sent in my second application on the very last day and well, here I am! :P

The new batch system is making the whole process a lot slower than last time (which is intentional).<br><br>There're 16 people per batch.&nbsp;<br>These 16 people will get a response and their interview will be done and dusted before the next 16 people get a reply on their application.<br><br>Normally, we'd give eveyone a response and shoot through the interviews fairly quickly but we realised that it got too crowded with the sudden increase of Jr.Moderators we had.<br><br>That's why a lot of people this time around haven't got a response yet. Instead of doing eveyone at the same time, we're only getting through 16 people at a time.<br><br>Yes, it does make the whole process a lot slower but it's for the best. It makes it easier for both the Jr.Moderators and the Moderators / Sr.Staff team.<br><br>Good things come to those who wait.<br><br>Patience is key my friends.<br><br>:)
