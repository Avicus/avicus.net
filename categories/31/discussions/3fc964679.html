I would really appreciate maybe talking about my staff system idea and see if you can improve it and if you can make it work. I probably sound annoying getting people to see my idea but I really think if done correctly it can improve the staff as a whole.

I suggest an idea about having a separate tab in the forums based around hacking. So for example, if someone wanted to apply for mod and/or was a Jr Mod then they could go to this page and there would be advice on how to spot hacks such as Aimbot or Kill Aura, so that they could then notify a Mod to take evidence and to ban the player that is hacking. This would then mean that Jr Mods would be able to go over to the forums and look at what hacks they need to learn about if they are a bit sketchy on a certain hack. <br><br>On this page, there could also be videos made and posted by Mods so that people can see what a certain hack really looks like. This then also means that Mods will be able to more easily recognise hacks, therefore decreasing the chance further that someone is banned unfairly. It also keeps the mods up to scratch with spotting hacks so it could effectively make the mods better at well, being a Mod! - Not saying any of you are bad by the way!!<br><br>On the other hand, making this public would mean that people could then look at the hacks and how to spot them so that in game, they will be able to easily spot and report hackers because they will have a better idea of what the hack is, whether the user is hacking or whether they are just having bad lag (just an example). In addition to this, having this page would mean that some reports are less likely to be fake reports, therefore meaning that the report is more likely to be a hacker instead of a player reporting another player for simply just 'hacks'. - i.e they would be able to name the hack easily. <br><br>&nbsp;So yeah, I was wondering if this could be spoken about in the meeting! Hope this is helpful!

One thing I find really frustrating and I know this topic has been brought up a lot<br>but could the staff talk about not handpicking jr mods, as the process to me<br>just seems a little biased. That being said I still believe most&nbsp;<br>of the current jr mod's deserve to be jr mod's but by handpicking your<br>missing the rest of the community that wishes to become mod and are&nbsp;<br>deserving of mod.<br><br>P.S.

For your first point there already is a post about hacks that is available just to the staff for helping the mods out. As for you second one I think this would be a useful tool for some of the less experienced mods out there! Your third point however would not make much sense because the majority of the false reports come from the less experienced players who do not know how to use the forums and would not bother checking if there was a post about hacks. The majority of the players on the forums are more experienced and make less false reports.

Glad to see stuff will be brought up in the upcoming meeting regarding community suggestions.<br><br>Personally I would like to see a staff manager implemented who's job is to literally just watch over staff members and make sure they're doing their job correctly seen as there's been a lot happening regarding the staff team lately; not all of it good.<br><br>Perhaps even stricter guidelines for the staff team to follow as well, I also really like Tynvale's idea and would like like to see that be discussed.<br><br>Thanks!

I've already talked to cyanide about this, and Res, but I really think a community committee is needed. Basically this committee will consist of about 5-7 people and they will become the voice of the community. They will listen to what the community wants, and they will voice that to the staff team. The will be a part of the team, meaning that they will have access to the staff slack, &nbsp;staff private rooms, on ts, and also be a part of staff meetings.&nbsp;<br><br>This needs to happen IMO.

And maybe some of the community can also stop coming into channels and playing "John Cena" at the loudest fucking volume possible and completely disregarding any respect for the people in the channel, before leaving and doing it to another channel. TeamSpeak is a mess.

couple of things.&nbsp;<br><br>laxation of curse words - cursing rules are just as unneeded as ersb ratings. your experience on the internet is unrated, and the majority of players (when mods arent on) curse anyways. slurs of course should be moderated, but the restriction of curse words seems, simply, a waste of a mods time.&nbsp;<br><br>talking about reaching out to newer players. ive noticed pn the teamspeak, and on the forums, that the more experienced players rule and new people in the ts usually get ignored. it seems like avicus is geared toward the best players, but the ultimate goal is to become accsessible as possible. i think a more direct way to the forums and a more active social media precens can help - maybe something as simple as moderators saying hi to new players.<br><br>thanks for reading!

If an appeal is denied, leave it for further discussion between the player and the staff member. Don't just lock it after denying. There is still something called reasoning.&nbsp;<br><br>Senior staff reassessment. There are quite a few bad ones still up there.&nbsp;<br><br>The staff team should also stop being so secretive saying "oh, we did it this way, and you can't criticize us because you don't know what's happening behind the scenes" blahblah.

I would be in favor of this with a few rules in place:<br><br><ul><li>Members will cycle every few months to keep ideas fresh and prevent people from becoming too staff-like (staff-like is not necessarily a bad thing, but it will defeat the purpose of the team)</li><li>When members leave, they will be able to propose candidates from the community to take their spots. This might be a messy system, but it would be nice to allow the community to pick the next member</li><li>Any member may be on the community as long as the currently do not hold a moderator position&nbsp;</li><li>If someone on the team is not doing their job, the Sr. Mods and the team will discuss if they need to be kicked. Just as all staff know the reasoning for someone's staff demotion, the community should know the reason for any demotion of a member of this team. There may be a few downsides to this, but it protects the integrity of the system by pushing members to do their job and pushing those involved in the demotion to have a legitiment reason, along with evidence, since the entire community will see what has happened</li></ul><br>So those are my thoughts, feel free to poke some holes in them if you want.
