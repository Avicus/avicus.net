Don't do YouTube for the idea of making money. YouTube should be done just for fun, and because&nbsp;<b>you enjoy</b> it.

I will be honest even though I know people don't like it. I'm not bashing on you in anyway, I know some people will say so.&nbsp;<br><br>If you think or maybe even see a future where you will become something on YouTube, you need to be different. We have over thousands and thousands of people on YouTube who play and record minecraft videos. Think before you act, how can I be different?&nbsp;<br><br>I will advise you to only "do YouTube" because you like it and enjoy doing it. So so so many people force themselves to record and upload videos because people expect them to do it. Don't you ever let it happen.&nbsp;<br><br>Don't copy other people, we have enough of pewdiepie's, we don't need any more than that. I know people who scream and overreact get attention, but you should never look forward to that kind of attention.<br><br>Good luck &nbsp;._.

- A Name you are comfortable with by your own and when people call you<br>(it doesnt have to be your IGN or anywhere related to your IGN, it can be like<br>a nickname or based off your skin, and just a surplus dont put numbers or underscores<br>on your youtube&nbsp;name just so it looks&nbsp;professional, and as much as possible be<br>ORIGINAL and not copy or base your channel off others, and try to avoid putting<br>like [name]plays or [name]YT or [name]MC cuz you never know that you may end up<br>doing other games or like maybe a Vlog Series of some sort, etc.)<br><br>- Get decent or professional channel art/graphics, this includes<br>[ Icon/Profile Pic, Banner, Thumbnail(s), Watermark (optional), Intro, Outro ]<br>(watermark is like the little channel logo on the top right corner of your vids which are uploaded to youtube)<br>(try get in contact w/ ppl close to you whom you know does art/graphics or try to msg anyone who does the latter)<br>for example)<br><br>-- My Channel&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsuulAmxah0HkJR__aJuiMQ" title="Link: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsuulAmxah0HkJR__aJuiMQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsuulAmxah0HkJR__aJuiMQ</a><br>-- My Profile Picture was made by SantsuH whom im friends w/ on twitter<br>-- My Banner was made by MauwysWorld whom im in contact w/ on twitter<br>-- Thumbnail was made by PartyAnimalMC whom im in contact w/ on twitter and we did a trade<br>(TexturePack for a Thumbnail)&nbsp;<a href="http://prntscr.com/78d8yw" title="Link: http://prntscr.com/78d8yw">http://prntscr.com/78d8yw</a><br>-- Intro is within the works, Samsauce whom im friends w/ on twitter and I are still discussing bout it<br>-- Outro (haven't got anyone in contact w/ for it)<br><br>- For starters, start with one series which YOU ENJOY, once you reach a certain subscriber count<br>(e.g. 500 subscribers) try doing other series via what YOU think is INTERESTING, what YOU ENJOY, or<br>what YOUR VIEWERS WANTS/ WANT TO SEE.<br><br>- Do Collabs every now and then, i'd suggest do it with someone you know or close friends/ friends whom<br>you play/enjoy playing the said game/gamemode/server, also dont ask for collabs w/ youtubers with <i>HIGHER<br>subscriber count than you or atleast within the range of the sub-count,</i> (e.g. if you have 500 subs, dont ask<br>for a collab w/ someone who has 2k Subs and above, unless you are friends w/ him/her/them) try collab<br>w/ other youtubers whom have the same sub-count range as you (e.g. you have 500 subs, try collab w/<br>ppl who have around 100 to 800 or&nbsp;1k subs)<br><br>- BE YOURSELF! and a guy once said "Just do what you want to do, because no matter what the <br>consequences, people&nbsp;will still judge you, so might as well do it"<br>(and by judge, i mean its either they will like and love, or hate and shove)<br><br>Pretty much what i can think of as of now... and no i did not come up w/ some<br>of these ideas/tips, its just based of from what well-known youtubers say and<br>what my youtuber friends say, the rest are my own OPINIONS/Ideas.

I personally use Obs as a recording and live streaming software as it is free and small file sizes. <br><br>For editing windows movie maker is fine but if you want to more advanced edits buy Sony Vegas or Adobe premier pro.<br><br>intros are unessecary and can be a turn off to the person who wants to watch the video.(ie annoying loud and loud dubset, to long.)<br><br><br>outros are are good as it gives the user a call to action whether it's to watch another video or subscribe or like the video.<br><br>last but not least produce the highest quality videos every time you make one. If you upload daily but all your videos aren't great then there is no point in uploading daily. Also simply have fun, if you aren't having fun then try something else. If you aren't having fun it easily shows in your videos.

Thanks! ;D<br><br>I use Fraps, but if you're just starting out you can try to use Camtasia Studio 8 (or 9, depending on which the latest version is), since it has a free 30 day trial and you can just renew your trial once it has expired.<br><br>Fraps is a paid recording software so I wouldn't suggest you getting it unless you become bigger on YouTube and know that you'll be making videos for a while.<br><br>If you really want fraps but do not want to pay for it (although it is pretty cheap), you can just try to find a cracked version or something online, but I suggest you don't do that as it may cause problems when you're trying to record.<br><br>Hope I helped!

really depends, if you want really good motion blur, Fraps &amp; Action beats any recording software any day. And Tbh, Fraps isn't that bad... Idk what people are talking about ;-;

Thanks! ;D<br><br>I use Fraps, but if you're just starting out you can try to use Camtasia Studio 8 (or 9, depending on which the latest version is), since it has a free 30 day trial and you can just renew your trial once it has expired.<br><br>Fraps is a paid recording software so I wouldn't suggest you getting it unless you become bigger on YouTube and know that you'll be making videos for a while.<br><br>If you really want fraps but do not want to pay for it (although it is pretty cheap), you can just try to find a cracked version or something online, but I suggest you don't do that as it may cause problems when you're trying to record.<br><br>Hope I helped!

I used to use fraps, and from memory it doesn't have any overlay/watermark on the recordings. I now use Camtasia instead. What you use to record is up to and what is more useful for you and your situation.
