<i><b></b></i>Hello everyone,<br><br>Recently, the Senior Staff have completed an important meeting regarding upcoming events on the server. It has come to our attention for a long time now that we urgently need to involve the community in decisions made, as well as notify them when we finalize anything. We discussed ways of picking staff, community events, as well as new commands and broadcasts. I will list the verdicts on each of the topics listed above, as well as a few other points. Feel free to post your opinion below!<br><br><b><u>Topics:<br></u></b><i><b>Staff picking</b>:&nbsp;</i>We have come to the conclusion that it is best to hold off on handpicked staff for a little while because we had many rebuttals as to why we should not use it for now. This included the lack of an efficient way to remove bias from the system of handpicking. However, we have decided to change the format, system, and leniency in the application system. We have decided to open staff applications in approximately <u><i><b>4 weeks</b></i></u><i><b></b></i><b></b>. If you really like the idea of handpicked staff, don't worry! It is quite likely we will have it implemented in the future. We have also scheduled a staff meeting for next weekend, which will contain more details on this information, so stay tuned on the forums all week!<br><i><br><b>Community Events:</b></i>&nbsp;Thought the UHC was cancelled? Nope! It's still happening! It should occur shortly after the update (now called the "Omega" update) takes place. By popular demand, we have decided to have the first one be slave market. If all goes well, we plan to have a monthly Official Avicus UHC, possibly even bimonthly. It will be run and hosted by the Administration team, the Event Committee, as well as Cyclops and Straightened. In addition the the UHC, we are also planning to have a Plug DJ giveaway, along with many other small events leading up to the update!<br><br><i><b>The Omega Update - Beta Testing:</b>&nbsp;</i>You can probably see where I'm going with this before I even begin. This has been on my mind for many weeks now. We will host another small beta testing session for the&nbsp;<i><b>staff&nbsp;</b></i>tomorrow night, or the night after. If all goes well there, we will host a public beta testing session for the update! As this gets closer, I will release more information on it. At the moment, stay patient! :)<br><br><b><i><u>Notes:</u></i></b><br><br>There are one or two more topics we have discussed which I will not release until after the staff meeting next week. This is not for confidentiality from the community, but rather the efficiency of the event. You will probably see another one of these posts by next weekend, or maybe sooner. Have a great day/night!<br><br>That's all I have to say! What do you have to say? (:<br><br>Best regards,<br><br>- Peachy. c:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b><u><br><br></u></b><u></u><b><u><br></u></b>

A holocaust is a slaughter on a mass scale. I don't see how the generic name would offend anyone, just like "war" or "massacre". &nbsp;A specific holocaust might, but then again, this slave market isn't specific. I don't understand that racist and sexist parts because it can pertain to many groups and both sexes.

I don't see how this is sexist in anyway. The term 'slave market' isn't specific, it could be anything. A certain holocaust would be offending, but by the definition of 'holocaust' is; "destruction or slaughter on a mass scale, especially caused by fire or nuclear war."

The term 'slave market' has many meaning to many different people.&nbsp; Just
 because it's not specific doesn't mean it's not offensive.&nbsp; <br><br>The
 'slave market' has historical and current significance. I said it could
 possibly seem racist since the term has been used to oppress one group 
over another based on race.&nbsp; In the same way, it could be viewed as 
sexist since the term has been used to discriminate over gender. Some 
current examples include child soldiers, debt bondage, domestic 
servants, forced marriage, and human trafficking.<br><br>Personally, I just don't like the term being used so lightly and think some&nbsp; sensitivity should be used around it.&nbsp; When someone commented, "Yay! The slave market!," it made my stomach turn, but that's just me and the images that it brings up.

In our defense, the name "Slave Market" was not created by us, it was a preexisting gamemode of UHC. However, I see your point, I'll bring it up immediately.

I think the name suits this perfectly. For the most part Avicus isn't a racist community so it can't really be used in that context. And the same goes for people's gender.

Murph, yes, I&nbsp;<b><u>COMPLETELY</u></b><u></u> understand from where you are coming from, but it's a block game, and a joke. It's meant to be fun, not taken literally.

The word "slave" has since taken on new forms with less pejorative connotations — "slavish", extremely subservient and submissive; "to slave", to toil; "master and slave", technological configuration, used namely in computers — and is thus not nearly as derogatory as it was, say, a couple hundred years ago, when it had a discriminatory preeminent usage. As some have already pointed out, it's like the distinction between "holocaust" and "the Holocaust".<br><br>It would be unreasonable for the community to have to bend over backwards to accommodate for those who are unduly sensitive and take offense at hearing "slave market". Sure, it's an asinine name... but as previously noted, we didn't conjure it. This isn't our problem any further than deciding to use it; you seem to have more of an issue with the label itself.

There is one thing that I don't agree.&nbsp; Concerning the Hand-Picked Staff, application and hand-picked staff are still bias.&nbsp; You can't get around that.&nbsp; Think of it like this: with hand-picked staff, the Sr Staff choose who would be the best person for Staff.&nbsp; That person fits all the criteria of what a Mod should have.&nbsp; Now a player can argue that that was bias.&nbsp; Because they choose one person of the other.&nbsp; That is the same with application format.&nbsp; Anyone can apply, but only the people chosen by Sr Staff get promoted.&nbsp; Isn't that considered bias too?&nbsp; I mean, you choose one person over the other.
