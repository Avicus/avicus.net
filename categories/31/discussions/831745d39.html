<i>Hello avicus I have a scary story that just happened to me,<br><br>My mom's old 50 screen TV was broken so we had family friends come and install a new one they own a company,<br><br>The TV looked fine but when it turned on the screen was messed up so the men stayed looking calling best buy to get a new one then smoke came out of the side screen we ran and took it down and the men found out that the screen is a totally different problem then the smoke, this smoke would soon turn into fire if the screen was not messed up, I have to say I&nbsp;believe&nbsp;in god 100%, God saved my house and most&nbsp;likely&nbsp;my life....&nbsp;<br><br>If the screen wasn't bad the men would have left not noticing the smoke then would have started an electrical fire,<br><br>I am in a huge state of shock I feel light headed and I feel nousious as f_ck I&nbsp;probably&nbsp;wont play today seeing&nbsp;that I almost died&nbsp;</i>

I highly doubt it was any "God" that saved your stuff, it was the men who did it.<br>And what do you mean by a "messed up screen"? Kinda hard to follow.

Please don't turn this into a religious debate thread, do it separately and make your own. People are free to believe what they want to, and to follow what they want to. Don't try to tell them they can't or that there's a "rainbow iguana with a hitler mustache ruling the world" as a comparison to what they believe is real. I'm going to clean up this thread a bit, and we can start over again. Now, back on topic.
