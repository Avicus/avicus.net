So overall everyone likes these ideas? Do you guyss think that there should be a module for a region selection to depict what the monument should be?<br><br>If so, I'll add to OP.

I know, the mob disguises, the attributes, and the region selected spawn suggestions would work greatly with CTH, Nexus, and Walls!

The first is possible I believe. Just name a region rather than coordinates.

I like them but complex YML making brings on some weird problems that not even the Map Developers can fix at times (For instance,&nbsp;<b>Dark Trot, Dark Trot 2, War Never Changes 2, VTOL, TNT Warz, Tenacity and according to Cows, Ka-Boom! are broken</b>, and we don't really know what's up with those YMLs, I personally have been trying to fix them a hundred times, same with Cows, but the result is the same, it ends up crashing the dev server and not working at all.&nbsp;<b>War Never Changes</b> is the only fully-working map we have from you...<br><br>I think region spawns are already possible, but it currently remains as unknown for me.<br>Mob disguises sound cool but I'm not really a fan of that idea...<br>Maximum health, movement speed and attack power are already possible by giving custom status effects on Loadout section in YML (check docs.avicus.net for more info).<br>The villager and mob system sounds really interesting, however I'm leaning more towards the village idea.

It's likely just formatting issues. I'll take a look at them when I have time. The next update to the Avicore plugin gives more insight into possible YAML errors.

First: Ilove ya &lt;3 *-*<br>Second is it possible to have a region, where you go in and you'll be equiped? Like you go in room 1 and you'll recieve kit &nbsp;1 or so, if you go after this in room 2, the items of room 1 will deleted and you'll become kit 2? Would be cool for Nebula...<br>Third: When you'll be back from vacation? And how is/was it? Where are/were you?<br>(Well I know it's not an AMA, but plz answer :D)
