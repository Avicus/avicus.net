Hi, I have been playing on your servers and I have grown fond of all of the mini games I like Destroy the monument the best. I thought to my self that I would love to help out as a staff member on the server And I was curious with how this server picks staff thanks for reading.

Staff Applications are opening extremely soon, but you'll probably have to get some more time in-game and on the forums in general. I'd also recommend becoming active in the community, and encourage using TeamSpeak.<br><br>If you have any questions, message any of the staff on Skype which you can find on our profiles, or email us at support@avicus.net<br><br>Good luck!

Try coming on TeamSpeak it's really helpful to communicate with other Avicus players and to make new friends im always active on there so come and talk to me sometime. Also I would say try playing Avicus for longer because you only joined 7days ago, but not to worry you still have a good chance here is IP:<br><br><b>ts.avicus.net</b> or to find out how to get it&nbsp;<b><a href="https://avicus.net/ts">https://avicus.net/ts</a>&nbsp;.</b>
