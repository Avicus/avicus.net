Public Beta Testing - Feedback?

</h1>
Hello all!<br><br>As you may have known, the Sr. Staff team has been organizing a public beta testing for the update. It was originally planned for 7 PM EST, but there were many complaints regarding EU players being unable to attend. We've concluded that we'll have a small testing tonight, after we finish our staff meeting, and we'll hold a large one tomorrow (March 29th) at around 1-2 PM EST. The IP for the beta server, as well as the time will be posted shortly. The main reason I've informed you so late is to prevent an overload of players, upon request from Ivy.&nbsp;<br><br><i><b><u>Looking forward:</u></b></i><br><br>After the end of the staff meeting, I will make another thread regarding exactly what we've discussed and concluded on during the meeting.<br><br><b><i><u>UPDATE:<br><br></u></i></b><i><u></u></i><u></u>Testing has ended for tonight. Feedback would be nice! Don't worry, there'll be a larger one tomorrow c:<b><i><u><br></u></i></b>

If you mean the one for tomorrow, it'll be about 3-4 AM, so I'd really suggest that you attend the one for tonight.

Idk what you mean by "tomorrow" and "tonight" If you could give a specific time and date with a comparative timezone, that will help. Tomorrow for others could mean today fors others.

A 10~20 second grace period will only allow players to get barely one extra chest, and slow down the game. There really is no need for it, you just gotta play strategic at the start of the game.

Yes, yesterday there was a small one, and this one was meant to include Europeans.<br><br>@heatless I personally prefer a grace period, but we all have our own opinion. Also, I would make it like 90 seconds, not 10 or 20.
