How can I improve as a moderator?

Ok, I'm ready to face the facts: I'm probably not viewed in anyone's book as an amazing moderator. So, in what ways can I improve myself, both as a moderator and/or as a person?<br><br>Anything helps, but don't say anything antagonistic or hateful, because if there's one thing I do NOT want coming out of this, it's a flame war. I see that went pretty smoothly on Tynvale's and Snow's threads, so let's repeat history in this case, shall we?<br><br>So, without further ado, go ahead! :)

you're good in general, one thing, you have to have confidence in yourself and get a recording software (Camtasia has a trial)

There is literally three threads in the recent discussions right now that ask this.....<br><br>But back to the question. Be better by being active, always respecting others (even if they eZ pinger) and say hello to randies once in a while (it helps)

Guys, Cynder and I are the only Mods that have done this. <br>It's unrealistic to assume that every staff member is going to create a similar thread.<br>The only reason why I created mine was because I've noticed I haven't got a lot of feedback from the community about my Moderating and wanted your opinions.<br><br>Instead of complaining, you guys should appreciate that Cynder is asking for help and opinions on his work.<br><br>There's absolutely no need to shoot this thread down.&nbsp;<br><br>Chill.

Nobody is shooting it down. It's just that if every mod will do this, that would be great, but it should be kept in 1 post. It would become spam as there would be multiple posts of the same thing.

Please don't start an argument out of this. Maybe we should create a subforum for "Staff Improvements/Feedback," but the final decision about that isn't up to me. I will run this idea by the developers, though.

If you have problems concerning on considering what certain hacks are and stuff like that, take a look on my stickied topic in staff discussion (if it still exists, but I don't know if it does or not)

It still does. Some are still kinda hard to find to me, so usually I like to see in action a few times instead of just reading about it.

Try to watch what you say on the forums, you have to remember that you represent Avicus; try to keep it professional and if possible, leave no room to misinterpret.

Exactly what Ques said, watch what you say on the forums. Some of your posts can be read differently and make you sound like a complete asshole. One other thing you could improve on is your knowledge of punishment guidelines and being a bit more latent. The whole spleefing thing was incorrect, if you are unsure of rules/guides do what I used to do, keep asking Peachy until he actually responds.

I admit, I screwed up on that; one thing about me is that I probably jump to conclusions way too quickly. Despite that, I'm not entirely sure what you mean by "latent," though I've got a pretty good idea.<br><br>And yeah, in my "About" on my profile page, I do say that I have a very sarcastic humor, but I've been meaning to try to stop that. Insofar, it doesn't seem to be going too well.

Whoops, autocorrect I meant to say you need to be more lenient when punishing players.
