You may want to relog when that happens, apparently it happens to people some times, I'm guessing they are connected to the staff chat that the staff uses which breaks often.<br>If I'm correct all you have to do is relog, I would recommend checking the server you are in before relogging by doing /server :) If you really want to report the player and not make an online report just keep on relogging until its fixed, use /report to check if it works :)<br><br>If not you can make an online report with proof of the player breaking the rules here ^-^: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://avicus.net/forums?topic_id=47">http://avicus.net/forums?topic_id=47</a>
