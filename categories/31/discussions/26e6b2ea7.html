Prestiges are gone, but your Kills, Deaths, Objectives, etc. will be saved and moved over. &nbsp;<br><br>So the way it works in the new update is that you can buy badges with credits that you earn, as opposed to just leveling up over and over and continuing to prestige. &nbsp;Also, you can customize your badges, so that's cool too.<br>I personally like the idea better, but we'll have to see in the update c:

Think about it logically :P If we transfer XP into credits you'll all have hundreds of thousands of credits. You'd be able to buy any item in the shop for the rest of your life. This would force us to make prices higher and consequently unattainable for new users.<br><br>What we're doing is saving everyone's progress in the form of kills, deaths and objectives. The leaderboards will be sorted by a combination of these statistics per gamemode. Badges are similar to prestiges, in that they grant you an icon next to your name, but prestiges ranked players and were in a sequential order. Badges, on the other hand, are just another shop item. You can pick your badge, customize it, remove it, change it up later.

I'd like there to be some kind of aesthetic compensation for the experienced avicus player such as a badge that indicates if you reached a certain amount of kills, objectives or levels. Other than that I'd like a complete stat reset. I believe that this would make it interesting for new and old players alike while still paying respect to the big time players who put days into avicus.

It's not an unfair advantage, seeing that they spent all that time getting those stats. If they had cheated or donated to get those stats, then that would be unfair. How do you think people with 100k kills are going to feel?

I kinda dislike the whole prestige thing actually. I appreciate the whole badge development, because it will give players a fresh start, with new challenges! May be make the badges earn-able at a little less than 50, like prestiges were... But otherwise, great addition to avicus!

You don't understand. You don't get prestiges from levels anymore. Levels are gone so there is no more level "50". You buy badges from the shop by getting credits. You can customize them and it really doesn't change much. It's just becoming a shop system which doesn't show any new challenges. You just kill, and win to get credits. Mineplex shop v2 -_-
