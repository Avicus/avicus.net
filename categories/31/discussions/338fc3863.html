Dear Avicadians,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;recently, an issue was brought up to me which put me in alarm. It seems a few people are trash talking about the interviewees by stating things like "he/she will be a bad mod if he/she gets it"<br>Or things like "he/she doesnt deserve it".<br>I will not name anypony, but If I hear of anyone doing this again, action will be taken against you.<br>Think about it, what if someone told you that you would never be in a special position only because of how you seem to others. Thats irrational.<br>From now on, we will notify the interviewees to tell us if anyone does this again.<br><br>-note- Ill be away in cambodia for 6 days, have fun my children.

I'll add something else here:<br><br>When Jr. Mod promotions/demotions comes around, don't harass the Sr. Staff if you disagree with them. The staff can have completely different point of views on a Jr. Mod based on many factors, although you may disagree with that, don't harass them.

Thanks Yoav! Really nice to know that you're helping us interviewees.<br><br>Um... But one thing/question,&nbsp;<br>Is it possible for you guys to add me to the interviewees chat on skype?&nbsp;<br>Because I know you guys added revilation, but that got broken... So I made a new account and my name is&nbsp;<br>"Alpha Deltoid" &nbsp;<br>I'm really confused on how to use skype, so I apologize for the technological issues.

@Psychostoner, I already talked to Cow, you dont know ANYTHING about what happened. If you think you do im very happy for you, but this isnt the place to say it.<br>I would much appreciate it if you were to create a separate post complaining about why I did this and why I did that. Of course if you want to know what happened you can always add me on skype.<br>From now on anything mentioned like this and im going to have to do something about it ;).

I shall explain the situation in the slightest to show you what I mean.<br>Glitchy is one of the interviewees correct? Well due to him being quite immature in the past, many people were saying he wouldnt be suitable for the job even now after his major improvements.<br>People are saying the same things about some of the other interviewees.<br>And I feel everyone deserves their chance to shine, that includes Cow, but he is already part of the staff, and im HAPPY about that.<br>Glitchy and all the rest deserve the same.

(You ready for this? (dun dun dun))<br><br>You, my good sir, are an asshole. It is not your place to tell a senior mod that they are being hypocritical when they tell someone to stop being assholes. That is yoav's JOB. Paraspider has moved past all of that, and will probably get junior mod again this time around, and id be willing to bet that yoav voted yes on his application, because of how maturely everything was dealt with by paraspider. You arethe hypocrite &nbsp; here, calling shit out on him, when he and para (the only ones who's business it actually is) have both responded maturely, accepted the results, and most importantly: moved the hell along. Whereas you, the nosy, gossiping, preppy-lady slim, can not get over something that didnt involve you in the first place. You are nothing but a damned parasite, no, a sewer rat or a racoon, freeloading off of somebody else's trash because, like the tick you are, you just cling on to past events, refusing to let go and act as social convention requires: &nbsp;getting over the damn thing. Are you perfect? Have you never, ever made a mistake? No. Noone is.

I would hate to hear this happening, if they find out what they said it could lower their enthusiasm making them think they won't get it and will result them not getting the rank. It's a form a bullying in a way.

@HakkBitch<br><br>Yes, I might be an asshole and no i'm not perfect and yeah I make mistakes just like you from time to time and get told his mistakes . Yes I do know yoav and para are very active and am happy for para for maybe getting Jr.Mod rank back he deserves it but yoav is being hypocritical. And if don't like my the way I am then too f*cking bad that's the way I am. &nbsp;:D<br><br>#Goplayyourbarbie'snow &nbsp;#..i.. #bye :D<br><br>Ps: I found your rant funny :D XD<br><br><img alt="" src="http://i978.photobucket.com/albums/ae267/psychostoner96/Capture_zps5a9ffc29.png">

I never said i didnt like the way you were, i never made any personal attack on you, i simply called you a hypocrit for callin out yoav on hypocrisy over an issue that had long passed. &lt;accent&gt; I also did not have relations with that women! &lt;/accent&gt; - kudos if you get the joke. &nbsp;I am currently having much fun playing with my barbies as you suggested, and if you bought me an alt called hakkbitch i would happily play on it as long as the mods didnt object to the name. Yes it seems hypocritical that yoav says this, but if a theif cleans up their act and becomes a cop, other theives cant call hypocrisy on the cop. They are still theives, and they still go to jail. Also i dont know if you were trying to insult me saying my rant was funny, and i hope not because if you were you are far less intelligent than i thought. The whole rant was obviously meant to be funny. I had serious points in it, yes, but i mixed that with both satire and flat out joke, for example the quote from a song : &nbsp; "You ready for this (dun dun dun). So if you were not, which i truely hope for humanities future, trying to insult me, then yes, thank you. Actually thank you either way i guess. Please try to think over a post next time before you post it, and maybe actually read the post you are responding to twice so that you actually understand whats being said, since you apparently need to, and before you post read your own writing out loud to yourself to keep yourself from sounding stupid. Just some writing tips i got one time from a new york times best selling author, which clearly apply to you here as well. Oh, and the rant is right on the thread, we can all see it, you dont need to take a screenshot, only you are too lazy to just click the little arrow that says what you are replying to, or navigate through the little arrows.<br><br>I do apologize because i have to cut this short, or i would edit it and all. Im busy because i have to go bathe in the blood of tortured virgins before going hunting in he nearby slums. For sustainance not sport dont worry :) gotta eat something right?<br><br>Yours truly -Hakkbitch

Not going to waste my time reading the post so quote if you want. I never tried to scare you either. Stop wasting my time and delaying my bath and take your &nbsp;concerns to Player Reports if you have an issue. Or make it public. I dont care, but its wasting space on this topic. Maybe stop breathing? Every time you breathe you take away the earths precious oxygen and emit dangerous CO2 gases, carbon dioxide. And people leeching off of air that rightfully belongs to the elite is practically stealing. You, along with many other crap-quality foods and meat cattle, take up air that the elite, the purebred, such as myself, rightfully own. I mean, you dont have to, but if you keep stealing air like this then a swift death probably wouldnt be good enough, and dragging it out is already so enticing, you know? And dont try to poison yourself so that i get poisoned as well, because i have Immunity. (Haha, get it?... Okay nevermind that was pretty bad hehe)<br><br>just a side not so i dont get in trouble: im not telling you to kill yourself, im making (dun dun dun) a joke. Keeps the thing all light and humorous. I also probably called you things in the first post that im not lookin at but that was also all a (dun dun dun) jokes. So yeah, about that bath.
