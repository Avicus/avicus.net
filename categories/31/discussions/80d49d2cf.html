Shene is fucking untouchable, I've fought him. You get within 4 blocks of him ur 5 blocks in the air flying another 5+ backwards, considering I can reduce kb greatly.<br><br>@OP: Best PvPer was Oculism before he quit, Drummer was the best before he quit. Stimpy is ofc good, but his kb is low compared to other pvpers. Grimmjow is also really good.<br><br>Rn its honestly Shene for me, could go almost even with Oculism at his (Oculism's) best and beat ImHacking with a hotbar left. Tbh the best rn could easily be Grimmjow as well.
