<div class="converted post-content">
<p>"Even if these things are seemed to be ridiculous, they are still 
vanilla, and the game changes from time to time. OCN (Project Ares?) is 
pretty keen on keeping stuff as close as vanilla as possible. If the 
game changes, we change. Not saying we should do this or that, just 
giving some food for thought I guess.</p>
<p>As long as you have high saturation you will keep regenning, right? 
But that saturation will go down even if you can't eat yet, so is it as 
bad as you say?</p>
<p>I don't think personally that we should stick to the "old game" 
constantly. As soon as a new update comes out, people want to stick with
 the older version. We might aswell had stopped updating (or removed 
features) after 1.6, right?"</p><p>-Brottweiler</p><p>It's happening <br></p></div>

The change from 1.7 to 1.8 is smaller compared to the change from 1.8 to 1.9 is. Play styles are more affected when updating to 1.9 compared to 1.8.

And why is that bad? It's a change in how we play, but we can still play and get good at the game.<br><br>To add to this, currently pvp is basically just who can spam click the fastest.

<p>"Even if these things are seemed to be ridiculous, they are still

pretty keen on keeping stuff as close as vanilla as possible. If the 
game changes, we change. Not saying we should do this or that, just 
giving some food for thought I guess.</p>
<p>As long as you have high saturation you will keep regenning, right? 
But that saturation will go down even if you can't eat yet, so is it as 
bad as you say?</p>
<p>I don't think personally that we should stick to the "old game" 
constantly. As soon as a new update comes out, people want to stick with
 the older version. We might aswell had stopped updating (or removed 
features) after 1.6, right?"</p><p>-Brottweiler</p><p>It's happening <br></p></div>

They will fix the hit before they update. Almost any server can.

What PieZ said. Devs will be able to code something to get rid of the 1.9 hitting timing bullcrap. Not saying that it's wise updating and/or we're going to, but there's almost always a solution.&nbsp;<br><br>OCN made something that fixed 1.8 cannons, anyone can fix 1.9 hits

Whoever develops a plugin that removes all 1.9 pvp mechanics such as hit speed and increased attack damage (revert them back to normal 1.8) will become famous.

Didn't you see XsumiaVoid's first or second 1.9 showcase vid? :p<br>Probably won't become that famous, maybe only in the server developer community

Hi guys. Back after a break from Avicus that really wasn't long enough. I'll probably only be here for like five seconds anyways.<br><br>Haven't played around with 1.9 all that much, but I'm pretty sure that you could just give everyone Haste 100 or something. Higher levels of the Haste effect make the attack cooldown timer shorter, so Haste 100 would probably be a temp. way of removing it.<br><br>Of course, you've still got shields, tipped arrows, and the special effects from swords and axes. Have fun getting rid of those.

The best thing mojang has done in the last few days is that they've eliminated 99% of hackers who just go on MCleaks and get alts. I believe you now have to buy a new account if you want an alt Cx
