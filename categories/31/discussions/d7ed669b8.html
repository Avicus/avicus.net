Ok, I can't stand this. The lag is INSANE. I can't rush, I can't even kill people without dieing by the lag. I just wish that somebody would do SOMETHING about it ._.

yeah.. the best thing to do would be to give the server more gb but that may not be an option.<br><br>i would get optifine and set everything to as fast as you can, that's what i do pretty much and it usually works great unless there's a ton of lag and even then it only lags a bit for me.

Its not fps lag... its server lag... optifine won't do anything to help with it. The Server is probably going to its limit of ram and needs to get its plan upgraded.

Even though I hate block lag, it can still be used as an advantage though. If you bridge fast enough and get lucky, you can bridge to a monument if it's not too far, then watch the bridge disappear and wait for people to call you a fly hacker.
