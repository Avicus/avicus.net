<div>I was network banned earlier this week for “ Constant ban evasion on ts over the last few months + complete disregard for our rules “.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Yes, I probably could argue and bitch my way out of it as I usually do in all situations, as that is what I am best at, but I no longer have the motivation, energy, and time nor a reason to do so as I’ve stopped caring about this game / server / community for quite some time now. ( I’ve also already requested for evidence which simply resulted in the following response "I don't have to and I'm not going to waste my time. “ ) I’ve meant to create an official “goodbye” / “leaving” post ( whatever you’d like to call it ) quite some time ago but oh well.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>here we go lol</div><div><br></div><div>( dearest apologies if there are typos / grammatical errors along the way as i’m not paying much attention whilst writing this )&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/1dd062836602402fab30ad2f10a5ea1f?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/Out2Kill.html" style="color: none">Out2Kill</a> / {tag=Bakerie} : Hi Daniel.
