Hello, fellow Avicus member!<br><br>Amount of times I've killed myself: 922<br><br>After lots of failures, I think I got it! Any testers? :o<br><br>What you do is you make your PvP KD 100% &nbsp;and then make your KD a percentage relevant to that (Say your PvP KD is 4 and your KD is 3. 4=100% and 3=75%) in order to find the difference between the two KD's (amount of suicides). You will then subtract the KD from your PvP KD and the percentage you get is the percentage of your deaths that are suicides.&nbsp;<br>Kills: 60<br>Deaths: 20<br>PvP KD: 4<br>KD: 3<br>Suicides: 5<br><br>4-3 (100%-75%)= 25%<br>.25*20= 5 suicides<br>Since you're taking your PvP KD KD without suicides and subtracting your KD KD with suicides, you're taking out both KD's and just leaving the suicides.<br>Say x= KD, and y=suicides&nbsp;<br>(x-y)-x= suicides.<br>I think I got it? Anyone agree?&nbsp;<br>Thanks for all the feedback, too, this is helping my math skills :D<br>-Love, Goldie

Sorry, in step 2, I made a mistake. Instead of multiplying it by your PvP KD, just multiply it by your KD.&nbsp;<br>Proof: PvP KD is your KD without suicides.&nbsp;<br>When I was looking at Notalgicular, I did this. I took the percentage difference from the KDs and divided it by his KD. I then took that number and multiplied it by his deaths to find the total amount of deaths. To check my work, I subtracted his total amount of suicides from his total amount of deaths because I wanted to see if I multiplied that number by his kills, it would equal his PvP KD. Indeed, it did. This is proof becuase once I subtracted his total amount of siucides from his deaths, and turned it into KD form by dividing it by the kills, it &nbsp;equaled the PvP KD which is the amount of deaths minus suicides (what I did). Sorry for the trouble :c<br>Thanks for pointing that out Notalgicular, your total amount of suicides is 104
