This hopefully is a really simple problem and i'm just a nub but I put in my correct username and password, hit 'Log In' and bam! Error.<br><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/krZDohj.png"><br>I did the usual stuff including: re-installing Java, re-installing&nbsp;Minecraft &amp; punching my computer rather rapidly and still got the same error. Simple fix anyone? I can't play Minecraft until this is fixed :/

Did you check you wifi? Cuz in the error it clearly says that they couldn't connect to the servers, which you need wifi for.

Your parents probably did something to your wifi like parental controls n stuff? It has to be something with wifi

If your account is migrated, try using the e-mail to login.<br>If it isn't that, then I really don't know your problem :(

Send an email to support@mojang.net and tell them your account conformation code. Then tell them to reset your password.

Captain, are you certain you used your email? the right email? Because from the screenie you provided... it seems it expired, probably from the migration, and you stated in your 1st post, that you put in the user, not the email.<br>Also, to add to dodger's post, since you have already tried resetting your password, and if what I said above fails... submit an email to support@mojang.net about this. (not resetting, since u already have)<br>
