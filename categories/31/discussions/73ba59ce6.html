My friends want to ban appeal but they need to register an account first. Once they reach Step 2 in registering, they put in the code for the server, get authenticated, but it continues to say "Waiting..." on the Step 2 page. They waited for hours and it still didn't work. Is the problem because they have been banned? It would be good if someone could answer as quick as possible. Thank you. :)

No it's not because they're banned (experience). I personally don't know the reason, maybe your friend can make an appeal at support@avicus.net (email it)

No it's not! I have registered a banned alt here a few weeks ago (That alt is banned for the same reason as my main account was banned, actually it has to be unbanned but I don't play with it anyways so not going to annoy any Sr Mods.)
