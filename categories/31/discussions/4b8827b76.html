If you are bumping a topic and saying something that&nbsp;<b>contributes</b> to the topic, will it be locked? Because sometimes I want to make a new topic about the same thing as an old topic but I am not sure whether to just bump the old topic.

Technically you can, but there is a small minority of people who get heated about it.<br><br>Dont worry about it. It won't be locked as long as you contribute.

It shouldn't be locked, but it also depends on the situation and how long ago the thread was created.

If your post actually contributes to the original topic, it should be fine, even if it so would be a "huge" bump. As this is a <u>forum</u>, the <u>only purpose</u> is to <u>discuss</u>, what are you otherwise supposed to do here?

As long as you contribute to the topic, bumping should not be a problem.

Yes, it should contribute to the topic, but you shouldn't post a question on someone's AMA thread if it was made a year ago. If it was made a few months ago, you can still ask a question or talking about what was said in the OP, but not something silly like a small question on someone's year-old AMA.

There is no time limit.<br>You can bump very old topics as long as you're contributing to said topic.
