Scrim servers annoy some players out. Imagine having 10 players online at 4:00 PST PM and everyone wants to practice. Guess what. Can't get a scrim server until an hour has passed. Now what if the scrim servers were more flexible with time? Maybe every scrim server should be one hour long each? Then before it runs out, you get the one for the next hour.

As much as I'd like to host 100 more scrim servers, that's just not plausible. Even hosting for the active teams is too much. And if we restrict it to only current tournament teams, well that's not fun for the others that would like to use a private server.<br><br>We're always open to suggestions on this, I haven't gotten much feedback at all.

I'm pretty much fine with how it is now but the one thing I would like to see is mid-server reserving. (Ex. The next reservation starts at 10am, you forget to reserve the server and it's 10:01am. With how it is now, you would have to wait until 12 noon.

I don't understand why it must be reserved at a specific time slot, or you have to wait 2 hours.<br>Seems more beneficial to allow reservations at any given time, with a 2 hour closing time.

I understand the issue about adding more servers, but what about converting servers that are not used, into scrim servers. For example, we only need 2 walls servers maximum. How about converting the rest into private team scrim servers. Also, the sg servers are too many compared to the amount of people that play the game. How about converting all of those apart from 2. Infact, every game mode apart from nebula could still cope with 2 servers. And some nebula servers could still be converted.

I've actually seen 4 walls games going a few times this past week, but for the most part, I agree with the conversion of servers. Maybe if there are more, the servers cloud be reservable from &nbsp;1:00-3:00, 3-5, 5-7, ect and the other half from 2:00-4:00, 4-6, 6-8, ect.
