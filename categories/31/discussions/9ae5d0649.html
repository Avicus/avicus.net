Hey guys,<br>I know in the update that we are bringing back survival games, which consequently means Elimination is going out the door. &nbsp;So that leads up to this question: what happens to the xp we earned in elimination? Is it removed?&nbsp;<br>Thanks,&nbsp;<br>Random_Guy

Survival Games and Elimination are two completely different things.<br>Survival Games: 24 or 48 players fight where they can only get their items from chests and can only break leaves.<br>Elimination: Pretty much Hunger Games, where multiple people have a grace period, during the grace period you can break any block to get you resources, after time is up players fight, last one standing wins.

I'm assuming it will stay, but I'm not sure.

Thinking logically, you would have to transfer all of the individual players' XP from Elimination to SG, so I assume that the XP will not be saved / transferred.

Yeah I know what the difference is, I've played on different servers with survival games, I'm asking about the people who lose their 4 time prestige on elimination because its being replaced for Survival games, I would be disappointed if I lost something like that

It wouldn't make sense for your 4th prestige on Elim to get transferred to SG. It&nbsp;<b>would&nbsp;</b>make sense for you to keep the experience you gained. As in your overall level will stay the same, but you will lose your prestige.

I'm not saying put the xp on SG, just do not get rid of the xp in general, even if there is not an elimination, it still affects your overall ranking

Yes, I agree with that. They should keep the Elim exp that's already been added to your overall level.

Elimination is not being removed. Therefore the XP collected per individual will remain the same.

Is there a reason for Elim not being removed... it's pretty much dead and broken last time I checked. Even if you do fix it, it will remain dead due to the adding of SG. So what's the motive behind keeping it?

There are plenty that enjoy Elimination/HG, it's just that there have been issues that took a toll on its success. For that reason, and that HG was what fundamentally started Avicus, we'll be keeping it on at least 1 server, adding more if necessary.

Are you going to fix the game mode? If you aren't then it's pointless keeping it there. These "issues" are the thing keeping these "plenty" away from actually playing the game.

Agreed. Hopefully in the winter/spring <br>update it will have its many bugs fixed. Even then, I am still doubting that people will play it.

Well considering that Elimination is broken at the moment with things such as: All ocean worlds, void maps, XP bugs, and extreme lag.

I think it should just be removed in general. It would save something time and energy not focusing on keeping more lobbies up. Or something like that , I hope somone knows where I'm going with this.

Keep a few Elimination servers but, for all those empty servers whether it is nexus, control the hill, elimination, or avicade, you should use the memory from those empty servers and transfer them to the nebula servers so we experience less lag as it is the most populated game.
