Hello everyone! In this thread, I will be talking about some different hacks, and how you can tell if somebody is using one of them. In-game, I get called a hacker plenty of times (as a lot of you do as well), and this will hopefully show you how you can tell if somebody is using a hacked client.<br><br><b>1 - Aimbot / Killaura<br></b><b></b>The player never stops swinging their sword. They keep hitting other players nonstop, which inflicts damage upon multiple players at the same time. Their head sometimes will swing in the direction that they are hitting, which could be easily recognized. Also, they will be hitting you from a few more blocks away than they are supposed to, which makes it very easily recognized.&nbsp;<i>*Report anyone using this hack.*</i><br><br><b>2 - Forcefield<br></b><b></b>This hack is probably the easiest one to catch. The player using this hack will be hitting others from many directions, even if the players are behind the hacker. This hack is very similar to&nbsp;<b>aimbot</b>, but the difference is that their armour can sometimes look quite glitchy, and they do not let players get within 1-2 blocks close to them. This hack acts as a type of circular "wall" between the hacker and the other players, which is what the main feature of this hack is.&nbsp;<b></b><i>*Report anyone using this hack.*<br></i><br><i><b></b></i><b>3 - NoFall<br></b><b></b>The player using this hack will not take fall damage from any height. You are able to catch a player using this hack if you knock them off a high place (for example), and they do not die, nor do they take any fall damage. The easiest way to tell if someone is using this hack is if you knock them into the void, and they keep glitching back up to the point where you knocked them off. They will continually glitch vertically, which is clear cut evidence that they are using this hack. The easiest way to catch these hackers is if you record them.&nbsp;<i>*Report anyone using this hack.*</i><br><br><b>4 - Fly / Antiknockback<br></b>If a player is floating in the air, moving around, that is because they are using a fly hack. This is the easiest hack to catch, and the way to report them is to catch them on video, or /report them, as a moderator will come. Regarding the Antiknockback, if you hit a player with an arrow / melee attack and they remain in the spot where they are, they are either using the Antiknockback hack, or they are lagging. This hack is not easy to catch, because some players could simply be lagging, and not using the hack. However, if a player is moving around, constructing a bridge (for example), and they get shot by an arrow, and take no knockback, that is how you can tell that they are using this hack.&nbsp;<i>*Report anyone using this hack.*<br></i><br><b>5 -&nbsp;</b><b>Regen Hacks<i><br></i></b>If a player is constantly being hit by multiple players, is not block hitting, and is barely moving, they are most likely using regen hacks (unless it's pot pvp). Sometimes a player will be lagging and will avoid being hit.&nbsp;<i>*Report anyone using this hack.*<br></i><br><b>6 - Spider<br></b>If a player climbs a wall up without any ladders or blocks. It's really simple to catch.<br>You can see the hack also, if a player jumps on a wall and they are hanging there or it's looks like they are flying on the wall.&nbsp;<i>*Report anyone using this hack.</i><br><b><br></b>In reality, there are some people who are very good at PvP, and they might get accused of using aimbot/killaura, but please read this thread before accusing anyone of hacking.<br>An example of this is glitchy1. He is very fast at clicking, and PvP in general. It may appear to some people that he is hacking, but he is a perfect example of someone who is just talented at PvP.<br><b><br>Please think before you accuse someone of hacking.&nbsp;</b>For those of you who did not know, it clearly states in Section B, Number 4 of the rules that you must&nbsp;<b>not&nbsp;</b>publicly accuse others of hacking. That is against the rules, so before you accuse someone of hacking, think again.<br><br>1 - Spectate the player to confirm that they are hacking.<br>2 - Use /report (player name) (reason) to report the player.<br>3 - If a moderator does not come, record the player and post the report on the forums, under the section "Player Reports".<br><br>If you want me to add any more hacks to the list, provide me with a definition and I will add it!<br><br>Hopefully this helped a lot of you.<br>Happy Hunting Hackers!<br><br>-Porky.

Aimbot is opposed to more head swinging, and players can hotkey hacks, they don't always constantly swing. Kill Aura is usually 1 frame head turns in minecraft time, or known as&nbsp;1 tick. No fall can look like NCP constantly, but no fall can be really obvious at times

"aimbot" isn't self explanatory, and people need to know how they work in order to detect if someone is using hacks or not. This thread was made to describe them, and teach people how to detect them.

If you use common logic, aimbot is extremely logical.<br><br>Aimbot is a&nbsp;<b>bot&nbsp;</b>that auto&nbsp;<b>aims</b> to lock on a target.<br><br>So if that's the point of this thread, there alot more types of hacks out there, and people use them.

That is very incorrect and worrying that you think this.<br><br>Forcefield, in my experience, are hacks that basically give you a Forcefield which means you basically can't die. No matter how many hits people hit you with, your health just doesn't go down.<br><br>KillAura is basically how he described it in the OP. A good tip to catch KillAura is to listen to the hits. If KillAura is being used you can hear like a machine gun sound of hits when the hacker gets near a player. It is offensive hacks and Forcefield is defensive. No similarities at all.

No it is not "false".<br>People obviously must just use different names for them. Or the hackers who make the hacks jumble up the names. What you call "Forcefield" I call "KillAura" and so on.

No offence, but I have a LOT of experience with hacks and trust me, I've never seen unlimited regen in any forcefield mod.<br>Just because you said that, doesn't mean it isn't false. I have to admit hacks differ a lot from client to client, so I'll go in depth here:<br><br><b>Forcefield</b> -<b></b> As you said, it creates a forcefield around you, and it follows you wherever you go, however, what it does is it hits people around you. Doesn't matter if there's 2 or 5 around you, it will hit them all at the same time. Forcefield AKA FF is blocked in most servers.<br><br><b>KillAura</b> - This hack may differ a lot from client to client I have to admit, but tl;dr, it basically hits people for you. In the most popular recent hacked clients (1.7+), it focuses on one enemy, once he/she's done, it finds another one in your range. If it's a teammate (you can't kill teammates), it finds another enemy in your range (The range can vary from 2 blocks to 6, so technically reach hacks exist :P)

And if you did a survey in my old community, they would agree with me since I learned it all from them. It doesn't matter that much as if I ban someone using "KillAura" it would basically be the same as banning them for your "Forcefield" so it isn't that big of a deal.

No offence, but I have a LOT of experience with hacks and trust me, I've never seen unlimited regen in any forcefield mod.<br>Just because you said that, doesn't mean it isn't false. I have to admit hacks differ a lot from client to client, so I'll go in depth here:<br><br><b>Forcefield</b> -<b></b> As you said, it creates a forcefield around you, and it follows you wherever you go, however, what it does is it hits people around you. Doesn't matter if there's 2 or 5 around you, it will hit them all at the same time. Forcefield AKA FF is blocked in most servers.<br><br><b>KillAura</b> - This hack may differ a lot from client to client I have to admit, but tl;dr, it basically hits people for you. In the most popular recent hacked clients (1.7+), it focuses on one enemy, once he/she's done, it finds another one in your range. If it's a teammate (you can't kill teammates), it finds another enemy in your range (The range can vary from 2 blocks to 6, so technically reach hacks exist :P)

And if you did a survey in my old community, they would agree with me since I learned it all from them. It doesn't matter that much as if I ban someone using "KillAura" it would basically be the same as banning them for your "Forcefield" so it isn't that big of a deal.

Asking me a question and then saying you are stopping the argument is hypocritical because obviously I am going to answer the question because not answering it would be kind of rude.<br><br>It was the Hypixel Network which I found and think has the best staffing team in any server. We were like a well oiled machine working together and considering they literally ban hackers everyone 10-15 minutes I think they know their shit. Not to mention KevinKool makes it his job (literally he gets paid) to make sure his Staff are up to date. As I said previously to your post, "Best just to leave this I think" as I know when to stop.

Sorry to break it to you, but servers like Hypixel &amp; Mineplex don't exactly have the best staff teams. A lot of the staff members in these servers are unexperienced, I've been there.

Sherlock cels and his common logic :'D. But anyway this should probably just be archived, there are already a few of these that are more accurate than this one so as not to confuse younger more gullible players i would just archive it.

It was fixed, but it still isn't good enough for some people that places blocks really fast. The point still holds for the regen hacks though.

I've been false banned nearly 50 times for hacks on avicus. Yep, quality staff there!<br>Meanwhile I've played on bigger servers like shotbow, they get about 3 false bans per week from what i've seen, same with servers like badlion and kohi (even less for badlion and kohi).

Nuker destroys a lot of blocks around the block you break. So &nbsp;it basicly makes a bunch of craters.

Actually there are a few forms of it. While NC+ may have blocked it! I'm not so sure about anti-cheat.

X-ray hackers will always find diamonds or people, and they will dig only the blocks necessary to find those items/people.

Another hack, simply to catch:<br><b>6 - Spider<br></b>If a player climbs a wall up without any ladders or blocks. It's really simple to catch.<br>You can see the hack also, if a player jumps on a wall and they are hanging there or it's looks like they are flying on the wall.&nbsp;<i>*Report anyone using this hack.*</i>

You can actually walk run, and jump from wall to wall by just placing blocks beneath you as you go
