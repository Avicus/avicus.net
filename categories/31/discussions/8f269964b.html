So I got this question in my mind..<br>Will the referee rank and the developer rank be included in the avicus.net/staff page?<br>I don't see why not and we'll have an idea of who are getting accepted for the ref position.<br>Also, I feel like some people don't know we have 2 developers, probably, you already know Ivy/Kylo but Pavilion is a developer too, he became 1 like 3 months ago.<br>That's it for this post!<br>Regards, Juan.

The referees will be announced after all the replies have been sent out. Pelpelajax will take care of it.

I'm pretty sure that we'll have a developer rank in the Omega update.

The developer rank will be visible on the forums and staff page in the update, according to a post by Para or Kylo (can't remember who). Not sure about referee ranks.

This is a good idea it might come out in the 'nise' update ! Like OCN. (Never played on it really just seen their website).

I don't like the ideas of referees showing up on the staff page.<br><br>They just aren't staff. Simple as that.
