No boot device found means the computer can't find the place where Windows is supposed to start from so your hard drive is most likely dead. Sadly, I don't know how to fix it or if there is even a fix.

What you gotta do is open up your computer box and make sure the proper cables are connected to the hard drive, something may have come loose. If not, then you need a replacement.

The hard drive might be damaged. It's not very likely for one of the cables to disconnect, unless you shake your computer fairly hard.

It is a laptop, and we're pretty sure its a busted hard drive. We looked at it, and there are no cables to connect it, and we put it in so it wasn't loose.<br>Porky was right again<br>wait did i say again<br>i meant porky was finally right

Prett much your internal harddrive isn't connect up properly. Did you drop it or put any kind of preasure on it? My suggestion is you should get an expert to fix it DO NOT attempt to fix it, trust me i know my computers.<br><br>Ok i just read all the other posts. Disregard this.

Am always right. ;)<br><br>Anyways, you'll probably need a replacement hard drive, since it would be much better than taking it to a technician, taking into consideration both the price and the durability.

Not sure how it works for laptops, but you can probably easily get a new HDD (Small one) and just plug in the SATA and power cables in...<br>Or an SSD (120 - 250GB) would be a good choice too, if you aren't going to download and record a lot...
