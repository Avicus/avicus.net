Hello everyone,<br>So I disappear for two days and things get chaotic. I would like formally apologise in behalf of the Administrative team, senior moderator team and the moderator team for the amount of misunderstanding on the Forums lately.&nbsp;<br><br>No rule of fake hacking will be implemented, but depending on the intention of course. None of the moderators should have responded to that matter since they have no official say in what is implemented. Therefore I would like to apologise to anyone who has been falsely banned and kept mature about it.&nbsp;<br>However I don't understand why there is so much hate/disrespect towards the staff when all we are doing is trying to do our job. Sure, we all make mistakes but you know, we can't fix it if you are being immature about it. Cooperate with us instead, please.<br>That aside, I had many plans. I want to remove the ability for mods to lock public posts and keep it for senior moderators and above... staff training, making sure staff don't ban someone off first impression etc.<br><br>I hope you stop doubting the staff, and stop disrespecting us since it's voluntry work.<br>Coming back from a short holiday to this definetly pissed me off! haha<br><br>Edit: it's sad that I have to apologise about this because it should never have happened.

Lol, I made a post about that before :P<br>I completely agree with you and I don't think players have to act so immature about false bans, they should just appeal and be patient or contact a sr staff member via Skype..<br>Thanks for making this post!

We usually do! There was no administrator approval for this and it is therefor an invalid punishment for the recent fake hacking punishes.

I didn't participated in this whole conversation/argument because I didn't really understood why everyone is biching out about the rule. I understand the waterfall rule and I would be glad if that would be implemented. It really makes the servers lagging if you build a 100 block long skybridge and then you put 100 water source blocks on the whole length, and 150 blocks above the ground. I would say that's no longer a tactic. Sure you can use 1 water source from that height to go down, that doesn't matter, but if there are more than 10 water sources and the water falls down, then it's creating lag.<br>I dont thinkYOU should apologise for that. It would be better if the staff members that were involved in the falme wars are going to apologise.<br>And maybe staff members have to record hackers before they ban them to have evidence if the player says he got falsely banned.

I'd say this incident <span>clearly shows us that the person concerned is not capable of being part of your staff, you should do something about it, he should be apologizing, not you. It wouldn't surprise me either if it's the same person who's removing all my posts, I also hope you </span>remove the ability for your moderators to lock/remove posts.

So here is what I think about this situation.<br><br>I don't understand why the players had to smash the Staff team. I didn't enter the discussion due to it being pretty extreme. There were people who were using certain Staff members to talk about how "shitty" the Staff team is. I'm just glad it's all over.

When that rule got implemented it put fear into the community. For a normal pvper the rule would of sounded "stupid". Reasons are is because twitching happens to get better kd or in my case to check the environment before pvping. It was a rule that the community didn't like so of course you would of gotten some people over reacting because...humans.

Thank you for not implementing the rule and apologizing to all. And not to be a whiner, but the staff team still hasn't admitted that there's a hell of a lot of false bans and that the standards do need to be upped. That's my issue, it feels like the staff never assume responsibility, and it gets rather annoying. I have not heard one staff member say anything along the lines of "Yeah there's a lot of false bans, we should fix that". I only hear "We're only human" over and over as if to cover yourselves.&nbsp;<br><br>The first step to getting better is admitting there's a problem.&nbsp;<br><br>Not that I don't appreciate the staff team, but It's annoying when&nbsp;<u><i>no-one</i></u><i></i> admits there are a lot of false bans, takes ownership, and has the guts to say they screwed up.&nbsp;<br><br>All the staff are really nice and friendly, which is amazing (this is less common than you'd think).

That's not an excuse, if you're a moderator in any server you should have at least a little idea of what hacks look like, you can't base a ban on how a person twitches his head.

Yeah people make mistakes, I make mistakes too.<br><br>The difference is that I can accept I made a mistake and don't have to make up some fake rule like a four year old to cover my pride.<br><br>The reason a lot of people are annoyed about this isn't that it's a bad rule (even though it was), it's the fact that the staff who were easily in the wrong didn't apologise or admit they were in the wrong.

If you're not a machine maybe getting a GCheat plugin or code one would be good so the bans are accurate and the community doesn't complain again :)<br>This goes to Ivy, please, get or code a GCheat for hackers just so everyone stops this trouble.

You can't expect the community to not retaliate with the amount of shit we've had to put up with in the last 4 months. It will eventually happen.

@Juano Those plugins aren't perfectly accurate.

However..<br><br>@Shadow Brings up an excellent point. I'm also guilty of it. Many of us try to twist the facts around to make something seem perfectly valid. This "rule" is a prime example of this. The moderators twisted facts to make the rule seem like an acceptable addition, when the truth is, it wasn't good at all. Along with the fact that many people believe staff to be above regular players, those people would start supporting the mods regardless of whether or not it was a good addition or not, which would put the staff in a higher position, giving an even bigger opportunity to cover our pride as best as we can.<br><br>For staff, it's much easier to cover our mistakes, but it's also very difficult in other cases. We are only human, though. However, we shouldn't have gone that far, that mistake was way too big. Little ones are fine, I make a little one at least once a day, but something like that needs a LOT of consideration from SEVERAL moderators, experienced and not-so-experienced. Aka, you should've gotten the opinions from somebody who's been here for a while. I even would've been fine to talk to.

Make sure the ban says GCheat - Hacked Client, because otherwise, it was a Mod that banned him.
