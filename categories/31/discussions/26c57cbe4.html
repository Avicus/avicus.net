Recently, I have seen a growing, worrying trend of people throwing around insults (or supposed insults) at each other like it is nothing. In particular what I see is people using words such as "<b>autistic</b>", "<b>down syndrome</b>" and "<b>gay</b>" as insults. I am here now informing you all that these words are <b>not</b> insulting at all, and if you use them as insults or find them insulting then you need to take a deep look at yourself and re-evaluate your sense of morality. So what do these words really mean?:<br><br><b><u>Autistic:</u></b> A word used to describe people who fall on the Autism spectrum. Autism is in a group of problems that people can have (adults and children), including Asperger syndrome and others. These issues happen when the&nbsp;brain&nbsp;develops differently and has trouble with an important job: making sense of the world. While this can make hard for anyone who has autism, it is not necessarily a bad thing. It makes you that extra bit unique than everyone else and allows you to see the world a bit different which should be celebrated yet instead, it is viewed as a hindrance or negative thing.&nbsp;<br><br><b><u>Down Syndrome:</u> </b>My best friend's little 7 year old brother has down syndrome and let me tell you right now. That little boy is the most loving child I have ever met in my life and I know both his parents and sister would not want him to not have down syndrome as he perfect in his "faults". Down Syndrome is essentially an extra chromosome that these people have (normally humans have 46 but they have 47) and it results in short statue, slightly slanted upwards eyes, and learning difficulties. Again these people have something extra in them that makes them more unique and as with Autism allows them to see the world from a different perspective. Again, nothing wrong with having Down Syndrome. They didn't choose to have it, it just happened!<br><br><b><u>Gay:</u></b>&nbsp;This word has recently become globally known with the big move for equal rights for gay or homosexual people to be able to marry their lovers legally. Yet still, people think just as with Down Syndrome and Autism that being gay is a bad thing and therefore is a good insult. As with the previous, people are born Homosexual. They did not choose it and lord knows with the amount of shit they get, why would anyone willingly go choose to go through that? They are literally no different to "straight" people bar the fact that they have different sexual preferences. You may as well use "human" as an insult.&nbsp;<br><br>So, maybe that opened your eyes a little or maybe it didn't and that's okay. All I ask is that you think before you type. There is nothing wrong with being different and rather than put it down we should raise it up! That's it really...

gay Is not insulting. If someone calls you gay, just counterattack with saying<br>"Gay is not a insult at all, it just means someone's attracted to the same gender. It's not weird" And you can just own them.

<span><i>"As with the previous, people are born Homosexual".<br></i><br><i></i>A little while ago on the forums, there was a huge debate over gay rights, and really, it's a matter of opinion.<br><br>Also, people aren't just born gay, they could be affected by others.<br><br>Here are some stats from 2007 about why people are gay:<br></span><ul><li>early homosexual experience(s) with adults and/or peers - 22%</li><li>homosexual friends/ around homosexuals a lot - 16%</li><li>poor relationship with mother - 15%</li><li>unusual development (was a sissy, artistic, couldn't get along with own sex, tom-boy, et cetera) - 15%</li><li>poor relationship with father - 14%</li><li>heterosexual partners unavailable - 12%</li><li>social ineptitude - 9%</li><li>born that way - 9%</li></ul><br>Now please do not take this the wrong way, I am not against gays, but I'm just pointing out that only&nbsp;<b><i>9%</i></b><i></i> of all people in 2007 were born gay. However, being gay is not something that you should use as an insult, I'm just try to show that a very small percentage of gays are born that way. Being influenced by others is the main reason why.

He was ban evading. Ban evading is not allowed.&nbsp;<br>By allowing him to be unbanned and run free with not just his one account but DaGold also unbanned, it is double standards.

He was already punished for his behavior but those were appealed as well. Again, it's none of my business and while it doesn't make it right, his alibi was probably because he was falsely banned 62 times.

Go ask blackhawk6alpha how many people he calls autistic a day lol (he has autism himself). Based of of my autistic friend, he copes with the struggle quite nicely and isn't afraid to do anything irl anymore (by that I mean about 90% of the time).

I just want to say that it might seem like I am the only person that has a problem with 1gg being allowed do and say what we wants but it isn't. Literally every single person that I'm around and his name gets mentioned, the general concensus is one of fustration, disappointment and annoyance that he is not being dealt with. I just seem to be the only on that has enough balls to say like what's up? So I assure you it isn't just my issue. That's it really. I might ask senior members of staff what the deal but in the meantime, lock this thread or leave it open I don't mind.

I am both autistic and homosexual you ignorant boy. I said it before and I'll say it again. I pity you.

So when you come along and spew nasty vile derogatory terms at me, it upsets me. It upsets me because they are rude and mean things to say but mainly because you feel in order to get attention you must be negative and edgy and contraversial even though you seem to be unaware that there are much more postivies ways of getting attention.<br><br>All in all, I feel sorry for you and I hope when you grow up, you will look back on this and realise what a tool you were.

How do you think they started? Oh yeah, him being an idiot and calling me scum over skype in a chat where I can't even respond. Him being an idiot and provoking me before hand on the forums too. Him beint a complete hypocrite in some of the things he says. Anyone from avicus who talks to me on teamspeak know that I don't get angry easily at all (especially since it's only ever happened once in my life where I literally rage quit something). Point is, no one has seen me raging even when provoked. It's idiots like arachna who continue provoking me even when I've stopped in stuff like skype chats they think I can't see.

They joke about my condition too, none of us talk shit behind each others backs and we're always in a good mood. They say things like 'Jeff don't eat that cheeseburger or you'll get double diabetes!' Do you expect me to care? No, I take it as a joke as I've known some of them for 7 years.

I'm not bisexual or homosexual, but I think that you should have the sexuality that you chose.

There is the key here. You know your friends for 7 years which naturally means yous know each other's limits in terms of what is offensive and what isn't.

Guys, we all have our own conditions and gender orientations. It's only human, for most of you.<br><br>I have a confession. I am asexual. That means that I am not attracted to any sex and can reproduce by myself. Why, you may ask. Well, it's simple - I'm not human. I was born in a pot, filled to the brim with compost that had been decomposing for about 4 months. My mother had placed 2 strawberry runners into the pot. One of them became me and the other my brother. It's tough online having people call me an apple and sometimes even a grape because I'm not. I'm special in my own way.

That means that I am not attracted to any sex and can reproduce by myself. Why, you may ask. Well, it's simple - I'm not human. I was born in a pot, filled to the brim with compost that had been decomposing for about 4 months. My mother had placed 2 strawberry runners into the pot. One of them became me and the other my brother. It's tough online having people call me an apple and sometimes even a grape because I'm not. I'm special in my own way. Thank you.<br><br>edit: for any of you who are now hating on me for being "a cyborg", at least I have a heart.

I love this post, it shows exactly how people judge each other based on no actual facts at all. &lt;3

I am going to be locking this thread, not because of the message it holds, but because of how the thread has progressed. It has gotten rather off topic.&nbsp;<br>Please understand my reasons for locking this thread before everyone flips on me, I 100% for the meaning of this post, and I will make sure staff enforce the rules tighter than before. <br>The primary reason I am locking this is because of the small flame war that has erupted here. I am sorry for not keeping it in check before, I have been gone for a few days. For all of you that were getting off topic and being rude, please don't do this again. I have written down all of your IGNs to make sure you don't do this again in the future.
