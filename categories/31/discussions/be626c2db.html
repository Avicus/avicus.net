Michael's Return as Senior Mod

<a href='/users/gobernment.html' style='color: none'>gobernment</a>
<small>November 15, 2015 at  8:11 PM UTC</small>
</h1>
Hello,<br><br>Michael has been reassessed by the administrators, senior moderators, moderators, and junior moderators alike to be promoted to senior moderator. Michael, known as Newcleus, will be taking charge to help repair the staff team's problems and to improve how TeamSpeak currently runs. His goals are clear to provide a better server, and we trust him to also perform well in both aspects of staff and community: Being active on TeamSpeak, and working closely with the staff, while contributing to documents and giving feedback, we have assumed his return as a 2 week senior moderator trial.<br><br>As what with the reaction that may ensue, I request that all of you not assemble in hate to disrespect the staff further. We hope that this takes a step in the right direction. As well as this, I'd like to also mention the community slack so you can talk more about his position.<br><br>Well wishes to him and his position.

I'm pretty sure the community would also like it, if maybe the person who threatens staff, community members and has had atrocious behaviour since as long as many a person can remember, wasn't promoted to senior mod.

Your reply is quite biased.<br><br>1) SnowSX3 was given Moderator back just yesterday, when he retired as Mod.<br>2) You're saying a user that retired as Admin should go to Junior mod, Senior mod is quite fair in my opinion.<br><br>wew lad.

He's saying it was a bad decision because of what Michael did after his retirement, which was a lot worse than what the other 2 did. (No offense to him, I think he has a small, but good change of becoming a good staff member again)

Ok let's stop this before it becomes a big issue. There are 2 groups so this will be easy to solve.<br>Group A who is upset with Micheal. Just see how this goes and if you have any complaints remember that he isn't the highest group of staff. The admins are not blinded so if you have anything that proves Micheal to not be in the actions of a Sr Mod or what it should be, you can talk to the admins about this and they will look into it.&nbsp;<br>Group B who dafuq you are. People have the right not to be amazed with Micheal. I myself am not but I talked to Micheal about this. You "defending" him is doing more harm then anything. He can talk to the people that don't trust him and he can deal with them. You are putting more problems then there should be.<br>Both groups become adults and work something out. Stupid flame wars do nothing if you haven't noticed.

It is clear that a lot of the community are not happy with the decision and, me being honest, neither am I. However, we should maybe give Michael another chance to see how it goes, but it should come down to what the community say and how staff feel in my opinion.<br><br>Not sure whether I can quite forgive Michael yet but we will have to see how he does, welcome back.

Okay,<br><br>I completely see where you are all coming from, when you are saying that you don't want Michael as senior moderator. I myself didn't agree with it at the beginning, alright? I talked to him through teamspeak along with other moderators, and he cleared up questions that we had, and in the end we ALL agreed that a second chance giving a second chance to Michael could provide benefit to the staff team and the community.<br><br>As Javi stated, this is a congratulations thread to Michael, if you feel you don't agree with this promotion, feel free to go and chat with him, thanks.

Time for my opinion.<br><br>Yes, I was in the meeting in which we voted for the promotion of Michael.<br>I voted yes because he had good points but under the condition which I did say when we voted "Yes, as long as he gets a 2 week moderator trial first".<br><br>This didn't happen, which is why I disagree with the promotion.<br><br>2 weeks ago he made Pel retire, now he is back and a senior....<br><br>Anyway, no hate to anybody, this is my opinion.

I'd like to post something.<br><br>This thread which what i think was just an announcement thread, it ended up being full with people who are flaming, almost ''crying'' that one person that got ''re-added'' to the staff team. I think Michael himself had a happy feeling about all this and now probably his feeling are doing really bad because all of this flaming towards Michael. If it should have been any ''flame war'' (which it shouldn't, just an example) it should have been towards the guy(s) whom threatened Pel so bad that he decided to immediately step down from Administrator.&nbsp;<br><br>It can't go on like this..

I'd like to post something.<br><br>This thread which what i think was just an announcement thread, it ended up being full with people who are flaming, almost ''crying'' that one person that got ''re-added'' to the staff team. I think Michael himself had a happy feeling about all this and now probably his feeling are doing really bad because all of this flaming towards Michael. If it should have been any ''flame war'' (which it shouldn't, just an example) it should have been towards the guy(s) whom threatened Pel so bad that he decided to immediately step down from Administrator.&nbsp;<br><br>It can't go on like this..

The amount of inaccurate information and banter in this thread is immeasurable. I'm going to politely ask once and finally that if you have an issue with this promotion, either schedule a talk with Michael or talk to me. Carrying out drama and putting each other down isn't going to fix anything.

If you're directing it to Michael, he's in TeamSpeak a lot to where it'd be quite easy.<br>If you're directing it to me, you can talk to me via the community slack, and we'll go from there.<br><br><b>EDIT:</b> You're banned in-game. <a href="https://avicus.net/forums/5edc7dcc9" rel="nofollow">Community slack is best course of action.</a>
