Currently, staff apps are closed. They are trying out hand picked staff starting in March. If that doesn't work, staff apps will open up again. :)

No offense, but I'd say Avicus will be going downhill if they don't think before they pick random players.<br><br><a href="http://i.imgur.com/r2luwOV.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i.imgur.com/r2luwOV.jpg</a>

What is it suppose to mean? That this kick isn't good or that kick was good? Either way it was harassing a player/staff which isn't allowed! And no offense taken!

As stated above, in mid-March, we will be trying out the hand-picked staff system.<br>But for staff applications, there is no set time limit between application periods.<br><br>They'll open when we need more staff. Not every 3 or so months.
