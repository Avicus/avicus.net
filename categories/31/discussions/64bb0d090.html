This is a good build, however you put a 250 GB SSD in there and forgot a 1TB HDD. I also recommend only 8 GBs of RAM and a better looking case.

I agree with you on the HDD and RAM thingy since MC is not a RAM based game, however, expensive cases are worthless unless you're looking for your PC to look fancy, plus the CPU is more than enough to record and render at high settings (Even an i3 was ok considering I get around 120fps whilst recording on 1.8 with one).

Hyper threading is worth it if you can fit in in his budget. Trust me, it will make editing, rendering and recording a WHOLE lot faster. Plus for the case, I kind of put something random in there because it was like 11 PM and I was tired as f*ck. So I agree on the case thing, but anything which is big will do, for airflow.

This will probably run at 800 FPS, OptiFine, max settings at a 64x pack. It's around 2 times better than my PC, and I never go below 200 FPS in 1.7.<br><br>Never go below 100 in 1.8, and this is worst case scenario.

I still think the 4790K would be a better choice, but I can agree on the PSU. As for the mobo, you don't really need much on it, he can deal with an okay but cheap one. &nbsp;As for the graphics card, the only reason I don't go with AMD is because there are a lot of people saying they overheat, A LOT.&nbsp;<br><br>@Sheamus Ill see if it meets the PCs requirements.

For Gaming, 8GB in 2015-16 is more than enough. If you're doing heavy editing in After Effects or other programs that are really CPU intensive, and have to have information stored as fast as possible (if this makes sense) then yes, 16 will make a difference. I know there is a certain workload where a computer has to compress spreadsheets and even 32GB of memory isn't enough. If you want to make videos for youtube and editing in a program like Premiere Pro 8GB of memory is totally enough.<br><br>Water Cooling vs. Air Cooling? Well it's an obvious fact that water cooling will give you more overclocking headroom and keep your components cool. If you want to, going for a custom loop and cool your GPU, CPU, Motherboard, Ram, whatever, will be more effective than getting an all in one, say the Corsair H110i. But, if you don't need to cool your cards, or anything of that sort, only your CPU... an AIO (All In One) Water Cooler is fine. If you're getting an i7 3rd - 6th Gen, i definitely recommend a water cooling solution. Really easy to install and it will again, give you overclocking headroom. I don't recommend a custom loop for starters. It's just going to be frustrating, and it will cost a lot more than an AIO. But what about air cooling? It's slightly easier to install compared to a Corsair, Coolermaster, etc. cooler. But once again, I wouldn't cheap out on the cooling system if you're going to be recording, editing, overclocking, etc. with an i7. I made that mistake once, the CPU was fine, but the temperatures were to the point of me not needing to turn my heater on in the winter.&nbsp;<br>However, Air Cooling is still not a bad option. If you don't plan on editing, compressing, recording, overclocking, it will do just fine (I recommend the Hyper 212 Evo).<br><br>Just for a quick fact ; all you need in your case is one fan in the front (intake) and one at the back (exhaust) for the best airflow. You can put more, but that will barely make a dent in performance. I can give a little more information if you need it, but here is the video on the fans:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OmkmluAYAQ" title="Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OmkmluAYAQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OmkmluAYAQ</a>

Your build is fine, I agree with the 390, but a Xeon? This is a gaming / editing PC, I understand that the 1241 is basically a 4790K, but you're losing the overclocking ability, and the clock speed is slower by 15% per core.

You have an extra $100, replace the 390 with either a 390X or move somethings around to replace it with a 980.

in gaming in most game you would not see alot of difference between a 500mhz difference.<br>the 12ghz single core is actually faster in total cause of the latency between each core, and each core having to put their result in the cache.

A single core (doesn't matter which speed) will most likely not be able to run most games, as most games require at least 2 cores... (correct me if I'm wrong). But for the most part I agree with you.

I still think the 4790K would be a better choice, but I can agree on the PSU. As for the mobo, you don't really need much on it, he can deal with an okay but cheap one. &nbsp;As for the graphics card, the only reason I don't go with AMD is because there are a lot of people saying they overheat, A LOT.&nbsp;<br><br>@Sheamus Ill see if it meets the PCs requirements.
</blockquote>
</div>
Yes, the 4790k will perform better but you added so much worthless cost, roughly $300 AUD for an extra 500MHz.<br><br>Almost all GPUs don't overheat to the point of thermal throttling. The reference card can get loud but the aftermarket cooler I picked should stay just as quiet as the twinfrozr 970. AMDs GPUs are a little less power efficient but it's really not a big deal, they don't get too hot. The main reason I prefer AMD over nVidea is because I dislike nVidea, they are an anti-consumer company. Guess why you didn't pick a AMD card, nVidea has done an excellent job at subliminal advertising, every tech YouTuber will use nVidea cards.<br>No-one has done new benchmarks after AMDs new drivers that make the 390x (a $600 AUD card) better than the 980 (an $800 AUD card) or the fact that two fury X's is superior to two Titan X's because crossfire scales better than SLI. NVidea dominates the market and are able to pull of tricks to keep them in the lead and don't have to make the best GPU for the money. there is also the case of the 3.5GBS of usable VRAM on the 970 instead of it's advertised 4. Although it was just a miscommunication they never mentioned the fact that the last 512mb was very slow and basically useless until it was discovered and made a big deal. AMD is better in both performance and morale, just a little less efficient (that was a lot longer than planned)

Didn't really consider the lack of raid on the motherboard,I guess it could just be replaced with a 240gb SSD or a single 120. I'd say you are right about the raid idea, it was 2am and it always seemed like a good idea to get almost double the performance for almost the same price.<br><br>the point about the CPU was to save a couple of hundred, if he wants all the budget to be used the 4790k is definitely better although upgrading to a 390x would have more of a performance gain, not worth it IMO especially as he couldn't overclock in Sevo's build anyway but was about a $300 premium.

Still don't think pairing an $160 AUD cooler with a h97 motherboard is a good idea, personally I would get a good air cooler like the dark rock pro 3, saving about $60 AUD and gaining about 5c on the CPU and upgrading the motherboard to a basic z97 board to hopefully get it to 4.5/4.6.

That's fine, it's not a waste of money but you may be better build an $800 AUD PC now that would do everything you need well then upgrade later when you want to play more demanding games, like some of the newer AAA titles. You should still see a big increase in performance and I fear spending $1200 USD would be a bit of a waste as you wouldn't need all the power you can get from the rig from the tasks you listed but 2-3years later your $1200 USD PC would be equivalent to a $800 PC built from new parts.<br><br>basically what I'm saying is technology will lose value, if you aren't going to use it now no point in buying it, just wait intil you need extra power. For an upgrade from an old laptop to a MC/COD computer $1200 isn't necessary and I think you'd be better investing in a $600 USD PC now and saving the extra money for upgrades later when you need the power.
