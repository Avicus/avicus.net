Swords now have attack strength. This way if you swing your sword fast and repeatedly, the attack damage will go down alot. So if you want to maximize your attack damage it would be in you best interest to swing slow with the highest damage.

honestly yall need to chil...... for one its just a game, it's not like mojang is now going to take over the world or somethin. but more importantly, this makes pvp about skill. say you have a shield in your off hand and a sword in your main: you attack with the sword, then in the tiny, tiny amount of time it takes for it to cooldown you can block their attacks. minecraft fighting has always been about just spamming the left click button until the person with better ping or better gear wins. now you can have different strategies, and fighting mobs and players will become much more interesting, not just a shitty boring left click fight. now you can actually block attacks well, and get tons of strength from waiting and being more skillful. honestly it seems like you guys are just afraid of getting beat in pvp now that it takes actual skill.

This is essentially what I was getting at. Although it would be a bit silly to PVP with the current cooldown simply because of how PVP was originally constructed, if it were reduced, it could lead to some much more interesting fights.

I've come back here for the first time in like two months, just so I could see how freaked out people would be over this. It's pretty hilarious.<br><br>In my opinion, I like the feature, but the attack cooldown needs to be reduced by about 25 - 50%. They could also add a gamerule to change the cooldown time as well.

I have already posted my thoughts on the video but I'm posting it here because you guys are panicking way too damn much! <br><br><i>To be honest I am actually looking forward to this as strange as it 
sounds. Battles would be more endurance of backing off and attacking 
again, and strafing would be just dodging and confusing to be able to 
wait to charge up and attack. Much more realistic which I do not mind at
 all. This would also mean a group of people against one would be more 
devastating with the full attack, but if you're able to tank it or they 
make it so each swing takes it up or allows for smaller attacks like 
stabbing then you can just dodge then attack. <br><br></i>And by tanking it, I mean by using a shield. To addon, this would also mean you have to be aware AF when fighting. Anxiety for the win!<i><br></i>

I have to agree with trib, you guys act like pvp is dead once it happens. &nbsp;Its almost like a restart button. &nbsp;Getting to learn new ways I guess. &nbsp;I've never tried learning tips or practicing to get better at hitting my trackpad so oh well, but I see pvp means a lot to you guys. &nbsp;By the time you know it you'll be making up some dumb how to's on using the shield or swamping out different arrows

I have to disagree with you. Minecraft PvP already takes skill, you have to learn how to strafe and aim for the most part. It's not all about "spamming the left click", you can have a click speed of 5 and still be a good player.&nbsp;<br><br>The casual player who just plays on various mini-game servers with friends think this is a cool feature that should be added, but there's a PvP community out there that knows that this will not help PvP, because it doesn't need to be changed, it's perfectly fine the way it is.<br><br>Let's say for example you have a full diamond guy with a diamond sword fighting against a full iron guy with a diamond sword. The way it is now I can easily combo a full diamond guy in this situation, but now with this new concept you can't do that, it doesn't take skill, it takes timing, a fight with someone is basically hit trading going back in forth. This is A:Boring, and B:The iron doesn't even have chance, if the hits are being traded and there's a diamond guy against an iron guy, the diamond guy wins without the iron guy even having a chance.<br><br>You should also consider thinking about HCF, UHC, MCSG, and a lot of of things like that and think about how this new concept would effect those areas of PvP as well.

PvP was hardly even a thing when sprinting was added and rapid fire bow spamming was removed. I didn't even see that many complaints with enchanting.<br><br>I'm hoping Dinnerbone ends up removing this, or as somebody else said, adding a /gamerule to toggle it.

McPvP existed before beta 1.8 so obviously there was a concrete pvp community, and I can tell that they mightve been mad about sprinting or instaspams

I have to disagree with you. Minecraft PvP already takes skill, you have to learn how to strafe and aim for the most part. It's not all about "spamming the left click", you can have a click speed of 5 and still be a good player.&nbsp;<br><br>The casual player who just plays on various mini-game servers with friends think this is a cool feature that should be added, but there's a PvP community out there that knows that this will not help PvP, because it doesn't need to be changed, it's perfectly fine the way it is.<br><br>Let's say for example you have a full diamond guy with a diamond sword fighting against a full iron guy with a diamond sword. The way it is now I can easily combo a full diamond guy in this situation, but now with this new concept you can't do that, it doesn't take skill, it takes timing, a fight with someone is basically hit trading going back in forth. This is A:Boring, and B:The iron doesn't even have chance, if the hits are being traded and there's a diamond guy against an iron guy, the diamond guy wins without the iron guy even having a chance.<br><br>You should also consider thinking about HCF, UHC, MCSG, and a lot of of things like that and think about how this new concept would effect those areas of PvP as well.
</blockquote>
</div>
And your point brings up some more booty bothering opinions.<br><br>1 : Timing is not in the slightest skill, The way PvP is now makes it so.. yes, ping makes things botched, but some people can combo with 300ms, but thats beside the point. Currently, PvP is about strafing and aim at its core.<br><br>2 : You know in games, the "quicktime" events? Press a button at a certain point and you win. THATS WHAT 1.9 IS, People can set up an autoclicker to click at the right frame where damage is the absolute highest. If you're doing it legit? It's going to get really fucking boring clicking very slowly and kind of waiting eachother out for each and every hit.<br><br>3 : The only PvP activity that COULD be benefitted or be more skill based is MCSG. But thats very slim, as with HCF and UHC, fast paced fights are frequent and are pretty much needed. But with MCSG, its different. a player with low armor can avoid hits and hit at max damage against a player that has iron armor while he might be trying to hit you at lowest damage.<br><br>[removed]

no, there is an item attribute to control the speed of the cooldown. you can set it so that there is no cooldown. it's pretty easy. and also, even if you do need a plugin it's probably worth it to avoid the shitstorm of people complaining about how avicus sucks cause of 1.9
