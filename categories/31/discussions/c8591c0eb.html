I've seen many users with alts and never fully understood why people buy them. It seems like a big waste of money to me, unless there is a valid reason to actually buy one.&nbsp;<br><br>What's your reason for an alt?

I have many alts and I can say you many points why alts are great/bad if you abuse them:<br><br><ol><li>To be well-known c:</li><li>To Ban Evade (I don't suggest this point, trust me.)</li><li>To avoid being targetted (Ask DaGoldBrick...)</li><li>To start a new account with new stats</li><li>To abuse it, ex. to start a game faster if there aren't enough players (I don't suggest this point too, I got banned for my stupid alts so yeah xd)</li><li>There are more reasons</li></ol><img alt="" src="http://i.gyazo.com/69c572df5a4403b924a3e04df055a39a.png"><br>hehehehe

Funny you ask.. Right now I'm AFK'ing at a gold farm in factions. I really want to PVP on Kohi right now, but since I have a lack of god apples, I feel as if the gold is more important. I then strongly consider buying an alt, so I can AFK and PVP at the same time. Then, I go to the forums, reload the page, and see this topic.&nbsp;<br>Hope that answered your question xD

For me, I go on alts to see if the staff are actually doing their job if I'm not online, besides, it's relaxing when I can play and not having to "spam" greet everyone.

(You can get alts for free if you just go on images by the way) People get alts so they can boost and troll and be on without people hating them, or to ban evade.
