School will be starting up soon and this is an important year for him. In addition, he's spent pretty much 2-3 years on here, and has been staff for almost 2 of them. Through thick and thin, he's tried to stay close to the server. However, recently he has felt no motivation to fix anything on the server, and his time is now up. Additionally, he has some things he needs to get done other than school in his life and not having the burden of being Administrator will be a start. No, he is not leaving. He'll still be pretty active, just not as staff. It’s really been a pleasure working with everyone for such a long time.<br><br></span><span style="color: rgb(61, 60, 64); font-family: Lato, appleLogo, sans-serif;  ">&nbsp;</span>

Even though I gave you stick, and been a fucking bitch to you two lately. I still remember the golden days, Peachy, you're the person who granted me my second chance and trust in me.

You guys were amazing admins and you've done your best for the server and that's all we can ask of you. I'm sorry things had to come to a sticky ending, I truly am. :(<br>&nbsp;<b><br>Peachy</b><br>You've been over 2 years and through thick and thin and yet still stayed loyal to Avicus/McZone and that is true commitment. The senior mod rank expectations were set by you: Amount of appeals, online reports, staff apps, support emails, in game questions, in game reports... the list goes on and that list was made by you! Your hard work towards Avicus, and if things were... different, I'll say, you would be sprinkling your magic pixie dust all over Avicus every day like bloody peter pan!&nbsp;<br><br><b>Zeus<br></b>... you're a fucking legend.<br><br>rip the dream

Avicus is not "dying". We've chosen two great Senior Moderators whom proved themselves worthy of the rank a long time ago. This is just a simple change, nothing lasts forever, expect more to come from the new admins.
