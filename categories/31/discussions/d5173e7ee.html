We all know monument stealing is forbidden in this server and has happen to many people so I was wondering.. how are we gonna catch those kind of people? I need help because it happens to me a lot of times during the day and it's annoying.<br>I don't think recording would work because it takes a lot of time for some people to open their recording software and reporting the person won't work aswell because Mods don't come in 10 seconds.<br><br>Please, I need an answer.

Recording is the best solution.<br><br>Although it may not be practical for some people, if you catch them on tape then you will definitely have conclusive evidence that they did it.<br><br>I can see how /report wouldn't always work.<br>Considering a Moderator needs definitive proof before dealing out punishments it could be hard if you're not recording.<br><br>Unfortunately, recording is the most reliable answer in this case.

I'll give you a hint ;) <br><br>It's always the same people who do it, if you are smart enough, leave the game and spectate instead, you will sure be able to record this/these player/s.

Use a recorder like fraps or bandicam. You can hotkey the recording button, &nbsp;and begin recording instantly.

I'm starting to record every match I join so I can catch people, and just shorten it when I report
