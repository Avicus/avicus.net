Are you saying that you may have already gotten an email somewhere in your inbox? If so, most email services have a search feature that you can use. Otherwise, wait a bit. You will be replied to at some point. I'm sure that everyone handling the support email has probably been quite busy. Also, creating a forum topic isn't likely to speed up the response to your email. They will go through support emails in sequential order.&nbsp;

Up until Sunday, we had 2 staff members handling the support email, one of those is currently away, so we had one handling them for about a week. Currently, with the new managers, two of them have exams this week. This leaves 2 of the total 5 people that can do it, doing it. Emails should be caught up on by the end of the weeks.&nbsp;
