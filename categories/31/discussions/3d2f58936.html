Apollo's F/A difference is higher than Ethernal Cross, which means that they are above them. Then with TCB and JardinerosTeam, we are still working on that because we believe there is an error there. However, One of those teams are top, the other of those two are second, and then Apollo are third with Ethernal Cross fourth and Bad Company fifth.

That looks really fucking cool ngl. I think it would be even cooler if you made this as an option on the nav bar to click on, and every time someone updates whatever you want to call this, there's an "!" by the side of it.

</div>
Why not? The community always makes threads about demotions which end in flame wars, so it seems right to go ahead and do that. If the people being demoted get hurt by a simple message saying they have been demoted, then they're overreacting. The staff aren't showing the reasons for the demotions, luckily, since that can be somewhat personal. :)
