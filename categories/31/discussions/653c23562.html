Staff Policy Revision & Information

</h1>
<p>Hi Community,<br><br>The administrators and senior moderators have not ignored your forum requests and criticism, which was expressed on forum threads by community members. I can say right now, that there are currently various plans in place already addressing the many issues the community wants us, the staff team, to improve on. I can say right now there is TeamSpeak giveaways in place, further improvement on the many aspects of Avicus, future internal staff revamping, and further strengthening of the staff to community bond.<br><br>I can also say right now, that the administration team, the senior moderators team, the moderators team, and both developer teams are striving towards improving Avicus based off of criticism and feedback given to us, along with other ideas that we had in mind that we strongly believe would help Avicus greatly.<br><br>One of the main components concentrated on over the last while was a revised Staff Policy, to fit certain circumstances today. The Department of Policies and Rules have worked on this thoroughly, and believe that having these policies in place will strongly impact the staff team in a positive way. This revised Staff Policy will be followed as closely as possible by all staff members, and will enforced by the Administrators and Senior Moderators. Some notable revised points of this policy are;<br><br><b><i>- If a retired staff member wishes to return, and their previous rank was Senior Moderator or Administrator, they may return as moderator, and nothing higher. If a staff member wishes to return, and their previous rank was Moderator, they may return in a junior moderator trial rank, nothing higher. </i></b><br><br><b><i>- If an Administrator is deemed to not following policies and rules, and isn’t a suitable leader, their possible demotion will be discussed by the entire senior staff team (including funkystudios), and the mentor / moderator team may be included to gather more opinions on the particular issue. If deemed to not be deserving of their rank, they can only be demoted to senior moderator. Community feedback and opinions will be a component taken into account when regarding this administrators demotion. </i></b><br><br><b><i>- Junior moderator trials are going to be kept to 3 weeks, and they will be promoted / demoted in batches. </i></b><br><br><b><i>- A TeamSpeak policy will be made shortly, to provide policies for the composure of staff members on TeamSpeak, as this is something that has to be regarded strongly. The old policy is in place for this currently, but expect new ones soon.</i></b><br><br>Expect many new things upcoming, and the staff team apologizes for previous inconsistency&nbsp;of the staff team.&nbsp;We hope you bare with us, and understand that&nbsp;EVERY branch of the staff team is working hard everyday for Avicus.<br><br><i>Regards,</i><br><i>The Avicus Staff Team. </i></p><b style="font-weight: normal;"><p><br></p><p><br></p></b>

I don't agree with the fact that you must be a staff member for 5 months, that's a little much. It's not like this is real life, things are short-term here, a lot can happen within 5 months, and who knows, avicus might not even be a thing in 5 months. 5 months is almost half a year... I think that 3 months was fine, nothing was wrong with it being 3 months.
