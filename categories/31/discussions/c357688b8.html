We should have a rubric for people who want to make maps. Sometimes, they spend 3 months on maps, only for them to be denied! Please create a thing that tells us what our map needs and ways to make it look good! This would help many creators build beautiful maps!<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -NuclearDucky

This sounds like a great idea! Perhaps the categories could be like... Detail, Playability, Originality, and whatnot?<br>

:L<br><br>Generally any map really works unless it looks like it was made in an hour. I don't really see a need for this because I feel like the community, like the other threads, would never follow it. I mean, maybe in my free time me and the dev team can work out a little rubric, but the main elements are gameplay, aesthetics, originality, and concept. We want players to be creative, that's really it.&nbsp;<br><br>

Actually, can I see the thread that took 3 months to make just be denied? I mean.. there's a difference if it was made 3 months ago but just not replied to.

Welp, I remember when I was just a regular, my first map was Justice.<br>I didn't take too much time on it, cause my friends UniqueAir and Meowfrees helped me making it, and we were so happy to see it got accepted!<br>I tried making a map of my own, named Evocus. It got denied by no reason whatsoever (not specified in the post, however I could tell it was bad haha, that was back in my nubby days) and it did take some time to be made.<br>Later on I spend a whole night (I didn't sleep) making Svargrond, a 4 teamed Nebula map but the comments weren't that good...<br>What am I trying to tell you with this?<br>Never give up.<br>Your map got denied?<br>Keep trying.<br>Denied again?<br>Try again. Never give up.<br>I never gave up, stood strong, looked for building tips, trained myself.<br>Look at me now, I've become a Map Developer.<br>I never thought I'd make it this far!<br>Maps need to be original, take your time on team, image the gameplay it would have, think twice before releasing it, add more things, add detail, shape, structures.<br>There's over 100 blocks, I'm pretty sure you guys know what to do with them. Just use your creativity and impress us :)<br><br><br>
