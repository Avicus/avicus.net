Here are some.<br><a href="http://avicus.net" title="Link: http://avicus.net">http://avicus.net</a><br><a href="https://avicus.net">https://avicus.net</a><br><a href="http://mczone.co">http://mczone.co</a><br><a href="https://mczone.co">https://mczone.co</a><br><br>Also, I realized you can connect to the avicus website with all those nebula rotations and, possibly for other gamemodes as well. For example <a href="http://nebula01.avic.us">http://nebula01.avic.us</a> takes you to the avicus website.

Sort of although I heard that there were some more obscure ones as none of these worked for my friend

The reason they didn't work is because the master DNS system resolves all of these domains to the same IP address. If one of these didn't work, none will.

Fari enough but can you explain to me why some people's internet doesn't recognise Avicus as a website?

It really shouldn't work that way...I couldn't explain that to you. &nbsp;There isn't a good reason, but there are several possible (albeit improbable) causes.

It might not do anything but I would suggest that they change their DNS servers to OpenDNS. &nbsp;It's not an easy process but it's worth it. &nbsp;It speeds up your internet, too.
