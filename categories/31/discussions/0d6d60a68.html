Gonna give some feedback;<br><br>There are a ton of grammar errors, formatting errors, and spelling errors, as well as it seems a bit sloppy with bolded + underlined text. There's also it seems personal opinions including this (which is complaining about how walls, nebula, and nexus need more maps when in fact it's CTH and avicade that need more maps overall) which isn't quite news. While it's nice you include your friends, it doesn't exactly correlate to news unless you name other players who get prestige. As for the gossip, it's actually wrong and isn't really gossip. The new "gamemodes" which are in heavily development are in fact for Avicade, and will not be on the main slots of the lobby. When you asked for gamemode ideas to drop below, that generally would be buried in here and should be carried out into it's own thread. You also when giving news reports don't use the word "think". It isn't news, it seems like guessing.<br><br>Also, it's "ParaSpider" not para speder ;p but with some improvements and a good format, this might be good.

I'm aware, and wanted to give feedback for improvement. I don't know how long it took to make, but I used to write newsletters for OCN and it was 4x this size and didn't really take that long.
