<h1>
Map Dev's?
by
<a href='/users/IcyCode.html' style='color: none'>IcyCode</a>
<small>August 29, 2014 at 11:08 AM UTC</small>
</h1>
Ok I understand that there is now only one remaining Map Dev. IvyCode (funkystudios)<br>Now IvyCode is extremely inactive these days also doing many other duties. I will like to suggest that other map dev's are elected ASAP. Ivy is not capable with dealing with so many new map's each day and working out which ones should be accepted denied etc. I have heard that this should be a punishment for the community not having anyone to accept map's (from Evo/Para's leaving post). That would be a great shame as think about the amount of people who have tried to make map's for us and can no longer as there aren't any map dev's to review them. &nbsp;If we want Avicus to advance we need map dev's there as pioneers. Expanding the map collection. Modifying it. Tweaking it. etc etc. If Avicus were to make it to December without losing more and more players we need more Map Dev's. I hope that Sr. staff will &nbsp;elect new map dev's soon to help us guide avicus further onwards and upwards.<br><br>Thanks, subzero<br><br>PS I have decided to make a housekeeping rulesto stop flame wars in this topic. Do not post about the previous map dev's as there is another topic for that. I have expressed my thoughts and views to that myself in that topic.

Its not only about being a good builder. Its also about knowing how to make good YML with no or as few mistakes as possible and being able to use github to push maps to the repositories so they are actually loaded (You use Github right?)

In my opinion someone who can use github. Someone who is organised. Can make YAML. Is good at providing constructive criticism and finally is a good builder will be a good map dev. I'm sure someone can fill all if not most criteria within the Avicus community.

While Ivy will most likely manage maps until we have a new map dev, he isn't an official map dev.<br><br>One person needs to have map dev, or the staff page breaks, that's why he has it.<br><br>There is one issue with picking a map dev, and that's the amount of trust that you have to have in a person.<br><br>Map Dev's get access to the map&nbsp;repository, get /op on the MapDev server (which gives them some commands they're not supposed to have). &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br><br><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The potential for abuse that a Map Dev has is equal to that of Senior mods, except for getting Senior Mod takes a load of time and trust between you and the higher staff. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Getting Map Dev, is just about being picked, there's no months of trust building needed, and no interview.

Well yes I completely agree. There are some really good builders on Avicus sadly I doubt you could trust these. I will like to suggest an application process for becoming Map Dev. however there is alot tighter criteria involved with it. Just a thought to make it easier as it will be difficult for someone like Howsie or Ivy just to find a Map Dev based on projects and there personality as Evo and Para got to no people better and probably found whether they would be suitable or not.

We need more than 2 or 3 ppl. Since the MapDev role is considered difficult we could have a quintet of MapDevs. The MapDevs could test the map out and vote whether the map gets accepted or not.<br><br>The odd number will be able to pick out the final judgment of the map.<br><br>Here are my suggestions for MapDev:&nbsp;<span><b>AwarriorVenom, Crazy_Clownz, izjust4fun,</b> <b>Matic0bastile</b> (Very good builder and knows both XML and YML) and potentially <b>me</b> (Heh, voting for myself eh? Well I'll tell you why. I am a very good &nbsp;builder but I take gameplay into heavy consideration. And I can do YML and XML.)<br><br>Anyway, what do you guys think?</span>

Only one MapDev will be horrible... The stress of many ppl arguing with him will be catastrophic.&nbsp;<br><br>That's why I suggest that there be 5 MapDevs.

I would suggest matic, he is a good map builder as he has build maps for others servers(I checked his website). He has the rough skin that is needed for it and he is a great map builder altogether, he might need to learn YML or what ever it is called if he hasn't already

The thing is, being Map Developer; you have the power to ruin Avicus. The amount of power that can be abused is too much, therefore the Directors and former Map Developers are very picky when it comes to Map Developer recruitment

I might of caught Awarrior on 2 bad days but he is a little touchy on gameplay talk. I criticized a map for its gameplay and he says STFU and then we had a conversation and said he didn't want to start a gameplay argument again after the good look&gt;gameplay thread that spicy made. I am sorry but that attitude he presented there isn't wanting me to support him.
