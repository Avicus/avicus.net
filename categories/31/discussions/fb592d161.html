I keep on timing out regularly today. When I'm playing a Walls match, everything just stops and then I time out.<br>Is there a reason for this?

My connection is good. And I'm not sure about my JAVA, I find the versions very confusing because minecraft runs on an old version of JAva.

I get scared when I spawn in the survival world. IDK why, I just do. Getting taunted by the messages in chat when yours can't be sent.<br>It's annoying when you're full diamond, killfarming, and then you get killed by a no-armor stone sword person. ;_;

There has been numerous threads about this yet still it is a new day and the problem is still there. Are staff seeing these threads or what? I gave it a day to give yous a chance to fix it but come on... At least tell us you are aware of the problem!I can't play on the server at this stage.

+1<br>We know it's not a client problem because <i>everyone</i> is timing out. If it was just a few people, it might be a coincidence, but it's highly unlikely considering there are tons of people timing out and the server has crashed like Roman said.
