yes but my main point was that people were posting multiple ama's solely for the purpose of attention, have you not noticed at least 5 AMAs a day? Avicus barely gets 10 people on the forums at time because its boring with all the AMA's

If you don't like them, ignore them. Don't tell others what they should and shouldn't do and how it can be annoying. It allows players to introduce themselves as well as get to know more players and maybe make new friends.

There isn't really anything wrong with the AMAs. With them, you are able to know people better, get different opinions and ask interesting questions. I think they're more of a good thing than bad thing, however you may disagree and interpret it differently.

AMAs are terrible. Let me just list the reasons real quick.<br>1) You only need one but people create plenty more on these "special occasions". I mean come on I'm sure not much has changed since the last time you answered the same generic questions asked each time.<br>2) I don't even have to look at a single AMA topic to tell that people don't even post questions that allow them to "get to know each other better". Like you have to be joking. Asking "Am I sexy" or "what's the circumference of the sun" does not contribute to this whatsoever. I know it's an ask me everything but I just proved the above arguments completely invalid. So live with it.&nbsp;<br>3) They take up space on the forums that could be used for other things such as helpful suggestions which this server DESPERATELY needs. If I have to open up the website and see some kids fifth AMA which he's making because he got banned from the server and wants as much attention as he could possibly digest at once then what's the point. We outlaw leaving posts for the same reason. So why should we even bother. I know it's for fun. I have more than one brain cell ladies and gentlemen. But just put it somewhere else.&nbsp;<br><br>But in reality nobody would bat an eye at this post. Nothing will change. That's just the way it is. These posts are harmless but they're terrible in their own unique way. So for those of you who wish to argue with me, go right ahead. There is practically little to no benefit in AMAs. Keep in mind it's an opinion and I'm simply stating what's on my mind. I have no intent to be salty here, but truthfully I think that AMAs are a disease infesting the forums and have formed this opinion but have been hesitant to share for a while.<br><br>Now I can.<br>Rekt.<br>Had to edit these since phone grammar is aids.

They were OK when there was maybe 1 at a time on the front page, but Christ, it gets completely stale when there are FOUR FUCKING AMA's on the front page now. And hell, with another being a leaving post, one being an LFT thread, and 2 others being "I need help" ones, it literally makes me not give a flying fuck about what's going on at Avicus due to this infestation (and I know what you're thinking: "But Cynthesis, you made at least 3 in your time here! You're such a hypocrite!" And while I was an "attention-seeking prick" as Howsie described and just a giant fucking idiot in general about a year ago, the last one I made was 3 months ago since it was my birthday, and I'll be waiting for at least another 3 before I make one again.)<br><br>However, AMA's aren't inherently bad nor attention-seeking, as everyone seems to think, but we definitely need to decrease the rate at which they're being made before the entire front page is AMA this and AMA that.

Nothing behind it? Are you not reading the opposing posts on this thread saying the exact same thing I am?

Tino's right. Learn how to argue before diving headlong into a debate. "That's your opinion" is literally the worst argument anyone can offer, and just because it worked in The Big Lebowski doesn't mean it works here.
