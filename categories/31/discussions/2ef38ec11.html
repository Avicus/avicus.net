Hi I have a quick question.<br><br>So recently, i have left the server, overall, Mine craft. However, I feel that in time, like when summer time comes around, I will be returning to Mine craft. Here is where my question will be implemented; When I do return, do I make a return post? Like just to say that I'm back? Or should I just return to game play without pre-notice?&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Best regards,<br><br>&nbsp;Sombrero_<br><br><b>If needed, lock..&nbsp;<br></b><br>&lt;3

We discourage leaving and return threads. If you do, it'll most likely be locked.<br>Users will recognise that you have returned, once you become active on the forums again!

He didn't stop being active on the forums when he left I believe. However imo the answer is equally simple, people will see you on the server and there you will be able to explain to them that you are back.

Permanent leaving posts are allowed; temporary ones aren't.

IIRC, permanent leaving threads are still illegal. Statistically speaking, I guarantee majority of users who publicly announce that they will not return to Avicus again, end up making a reappearance two weeks later (E.G. due to seasonal factors). Therefore it adjusts the supposedly permanent leaving thread, to a temporary one.

If they announce that they were planning to leave, then make a reappearance within a short amount of time, that would make it a fake leaving thread, which would lead to it being locked, wouldn't it? Also, weren't some players banned for having a fake leaving thread?

<i>"If they announce that they were planning to leave, then make a

Therefore I believe we stopped punishing for it.

In my opinion if someone becomes bored of Avicus and is taking a break from anywhere to a month to a year I believe that a post wouldn't hurt and should be allowed.
