i think when it is like you really mean it in a very bad way, it is punishable but if it is like you just accidentally say it when you're joking, you cursed yourself or talking about something like "oh f**k this", i don't think it is punishable but it depends.

No.<br>I'd recommend strongly against doing it though. Nothing good will come from it :P

You can't get punished on Avicus for it, but you certainly won't make any friends.

No, if people are swearing at us or being rude we cannot punish them on the server however we can block them.

If its a staff member and the chat comes back to a senior staff member they could get in trouble. If its a player, no they can not. Skype is not an avicus service.
