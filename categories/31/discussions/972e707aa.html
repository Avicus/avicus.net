<div class="de1">Welcome back to another Plug.DJ session. This week's theme will be <b>70's</b> any music from this time.</div>
<div class="de2">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="de1">When is it?</div>
<div class="de2">EST: 6:00 PM (Friday)<br></div>
<div class="de1">PST: 3:00 PM (Friday)<br></div>
<div class="de2">GMT: 1:00 AM (Saturday) <br></div>
<div class="de1">AEST: 9:00 AM (Saturday) <br></div>
<div class="de2">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="de1">There is no specific end time.</div>
<div class="de2">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="de1">I have a profile. Now what?</div>
<div class="de2">You can start a pre-party, maybe tell a few friends to come along and have a good time!</div>
<div class="de1">Remember that the link is:</div>
<div class="de2"><a href="https://plug.dj/avicus">https://plug.dj/avicus</a></div>
<div class="de1">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="de2">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="de1">I don't have an account :c</div>
<div class="de2">If this is your first time ever using plug.dj, you will need to sign up. Go to their page here:</div>
<div class="de1">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="de2"><a href="https://plug.dj/dashboard">https://plug.dj/dashboard</a> you also can register at <a href="https://plug.dj/avicus">https://plug.dj/avicus</a></div>
<div class="de1">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="de2">Follow the instructions to create a profile.</div>
<div class="de1">Keep in mind that once you create a username, you cannot change it in the future, so do not impersonate others.</div>
<div class="de2">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="de1"><a title="Link: https://plug.dj/avicus" href="https://plug.dj/avicus">https://plug.dj/avicus</a></div>
<div class="de2">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="de1">Once you "plug" into the hangout (haha), create a 
playlist of songs by searching up your favourites on YouTube or use 
Soundcloud playlists, and then join the wait list! Once it's your turn 
to DJ, everyone in the hangout can dance, listen, and have a good time 
to your song!</div>
<div class="de2">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="de1">Cool. Any rules?</div>
<div class="de2">Basic behavior rules apply. Don't be rude to others in 
chat, try to limit the amount of inappropriate language you use in the 
chat. Any person found doing this will receive a warning.</div>
<div class="de1">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="de2">Basic video rules apply. Don't down vote (meh) every 
song, max video time 10 minutes, do not play anything in the recent 
history.Please do not play any videos that may contain 
gory/sexual/racist/homophobic/violent content. Any person found playing 
such content will receive a warning, followed by a ban.</div>
<div class="de1">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="de2">Have fun!</div>
<div class="de1">&nbsp;</div>
Also any suggestion for themes would be great!

Most people in EST are not out of school until 3 ;/ I'll try to make more GMT friendly events once the "leaders" become active. ;-;

Nah, that's way to late.&nbsp;<br>Why can't the events be in the middle of the day on the weekend? Then most people would be satisfied (I think).

Hey 99!<br>Thanks for being able to make the plug dj parties for the last week (this week is 2 I believe) But the plug dj team will be going active again and we will be working on new ways of choosing the theme of the night to maybe have the community involved in the choosing!<br>Thanks again!
