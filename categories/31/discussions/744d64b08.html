&nbsp; &nbsp;I tried have a thread on this a few mins ago but it was locked by a staff member who said there was already another post on this same topic. Unfortunately I couldn't find said post so I would like to ask everyone WHEN the huge surge of players stopped returning to the server and WHY this had happened. <br><br><br><br>Thank you,<br>OIette

The players didn't exactly leave. When we updated to Avicus, from Mczone, the hosts weren't migrated and well, we lost about 800 players in the space of a few hours because they didn't know the updated ip. That's from what Keenan (the owner) told me at least. Then after that, it was just some stupid decisions that slowly chipped away at the declining player count. There is no one reason nor one person to blame. Most people just moved on to servers like Hypixel and Mineplex but most of the veterans have still stayed. And even if they don't play on the server, they still participate actively on the forums.

Again, the staff team downgraded a lot. The community is worse, 1.8 and 1.9 took place of 1.7.

For me, the reason I only play maybe once every week or two is honestly because of prestiges.<br>The only reason I played was because there was some type of goal to reach and now that's gone.<br><br>Yeah there are credits, but it's not the same.<br><br>Either way, the only time I get on the server nowadays is when I record.

Bro, none of the staff members ya'll currently have started out as mod before I did. Them veterans ain't exactly veterans, it's just this server's been round for a while they seem to be veterans now. I mean, there is people like zedther, for example, who been playing for a while but there's still very few people that I would recognise back from MCZone.

Basically the server updated on its own.<br><br>By that I mean when the server updated the owner didn't look at opinions of the people I know when we did testing for the update ALOT of people hated it.<br><br>And I'm pretty sure if they looked at what the community had to say for once this server would still be thriving in player count.<br><br>But they just decided to what they thought was best for the server, not what the people thought for the server.<br><br>Keep this in mind this is what I think happened, something completely different could've happened I'm just saying this!

There are still a lot of people from Mczone that still play today, like myself. They may not have been staff when you were or staff at all but that doesn't mean they aren't veterans, or at least in my book. I'm not necessarily refering to Staff Members, because your right, we don't have any veterans still with us in the Moderating Staff Team, except Peachy. I'm referring to the community and the players who have been here since mczone and have stuck around.

It's hard to understand things from a staff point of view and want to stick up for the staff unless you were staff and left on a good note.

But regarding McZone players, &gt;90% of the McZone veterans are gone. Where are people like mrmarksman55, vlushy11, Obsidianfire99, and ViolentBoo? People like Minecraft_Zack, MLGTino (wait a second...), FightToWin, Blueberrywaffle7. They all left, and in some ways, I really can't fault them. There are some people who have stuck around, yes, but they can all testify about everyone who hasn't.

Well, quite a bit of the current people that play have played for a good long while, but I mean there were very many popular and active players back from the MCZone days who have all gone and left. That's why I said very few, because compared to all the regulars from the past very few remain. That's why I figured you meant veterans as in people around the beginnings of avicus, because there are a lot more of those.&nbsp;<br>Also, how does one go from nuclearducky to dabader? I recognised the former but not the latter :3

This is the present, as of now they are focusing on making a good future for us. All those things were updates that they might of made a mistake in the past, but I am positively sure they won't be making the same mistakes. They are listening to us more now, than they did in the past. We just have to wait for what the future has in mind for us. They most likely won't be going back to the past since things are settled now and we don't want to reset everything again like the Avicore update.

things are settled because its left down because 90% of the server population is gone, like i said they are looking at adding more features instead of fixing features right now. Nebula is getting boring, Survival Games has shit features, havnt really played walls but i rarely see anyone on it and Nexus and CTH are broken with bugs and kits. i think they should sack they other gamemodes if only 6 people play on it on a lucky day. the staff may be listen to the community but i dont see it besides the mods on server ideas and feedback and admin on some threads.

However, they could be fixing some features in the future. When I'm online, there's an aversge of 40-60 players online. Maybe you are in a timezone where majority of the players are in bed? Rn it's currently 2:40am, so there's probably not that many on. Before you call me a person with no life; I'm up this late because my leg hurts so bad after my dog pushed me off the patio steps by accident when I went to go feed him.

The players didn't exactly leave. When we updated to Avicus, from Mczone, the hosts weren't migrated and well, we lost about 800 players in the space of a few hours because they didn't know the updated ip. That's from what Keenan (the owner) told me at least. Then after that, it was just some stupid decisions that slowly chipped away at the declining player count. There is no one reason nor one person to blame. Most people just moved on to servers like Hypixel and Mineplex but most of the veterans have still stayed. And even if they don't play on the server, they still participate actively on the forums.

I just wish people stopped hating on the staff.<br>Sure, they may have done a thing that completely changed the server without letting many people know, but that doesn't shouldn't mean you unload all of your hate onto them.<br>Imagine that in Maths class, you were learning about trigonometry, then you were suddenly learning about matrices and vectors. You can't blame the teacher for changing the subject. They would have chosen to change it as they would have thought it would have been better for you all to learn.<br>I don't know if anyone would understand my analogy, but it makes sense to me as to why you should be fair to the staff and not give them shit for their own decisions.<br>kthnx

if they listened to us we wouldnt have credits, we wouldnt have shitty kits for gamemodes, we wouldnt have major bugs that ruin gamemodes such as CTH and Nexus, we wouldnt have a declined server population because of a lot of things that staff have done in the past. Instead of fixing these features they decide to add more features (not really good or bad), i hope this update isnt shit because i havnt seen much progress since the Alpha Update.<br><br><br>Avicus Pls Fix - 3Kliksphilip

I joined in late 2013 as PrincessLuna1211. I believe I left Avicus when the Avicore update was released, due to me getting a prestige that same morning before the update came out. I was fairly angry that prestiges were removed, since I had recently leveled up, and there wasn't really a goal anymore to keep me going. I ended up not even playing Minecraft after that. I came back later on because I wanted to see how the server was going, and I ended up staying for a little while. Buuuuuuut I left again in April 2015, then came back in September of 2015 and here I am now :).

I used skywars IP even into avicus from Mczone :^)<br><br>Whoever said the staff team was bad obviously didn't play a lot back then.. Considering player count was near the thousands when I was staff we managed pretty well, but the administration was poor..<br><br>Many avicus players me included found Overcast and other servers and realised whay we missed out on.<br><br>Also players like myself. FTW, Shiro, Kb (hey on this thread) blueberry, tortoise, nesa etc etc grew older! It becomes unfashionable to play minecraft at our age and the whole community I would guess experienced that. If we were all 13-14yrs old when starting to play Mczone. Now being 17-18, we grow out of it. Maybe this is a small percentage of the whole community but represents the whole community back then?

im kinda new but avicus is kinda special, in some ways is really bad but in others really good, its true people get bored of doing the same thing all the time, i mean when i start i only rush, with time i start knowing the maps and how to rush in every map , but now sometimes is bored, i also like defending and with time you get also bored of it , now i sometimes rush , defend or even build houses just to have some fun. its true that credits don't have any purpose &nbsp;for &nbsp;the players , you are not getting nothing special from them

In my opinion, it's not really the staff or community's fault. It's simply because Minecraft is a game that has a large amount of young players. Young people generally don't like pvp so they go play on the servers with minigames i.e Mineplex, Hypixel etc. Avicus is a pvp based server so a lot of the young players don't come here and instead teenagers / young adults come. I'm not saying that there aren't a lot of those groups, just not as much as the young player base.
