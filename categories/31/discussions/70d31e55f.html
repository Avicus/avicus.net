So most of you won't actually care but basically I've given my account away to my sister since it's come to the point were I'm playing too much video games (it's bound to happen) and it's exams week plus new year next year and I wanna make it a completely new one, so I'm leaving minecraft and you might see my sister on yet she only plays single player most of the time, if you see her, don't think it's me, she's very noobish. Anyway I just wanna highlight some people that made my avicus journey worth it: JKawesome (of course) and Da_baus and miguel. I also am quiting youtube, which I did awhile ago but you can contact me on skype: awwgaming.<br><br>Thanks guys, and have fun c; goodbye :( &lt;3
