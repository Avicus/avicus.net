Hey everyone o/<br>I was playing CTW this morning and noticed devs didn't put a lot of effort in the wool rooms. They're just open spaces in the map with 1 or 2 chests (Just the wools in them) and that's it so, I was thinking about: Why don't you add more stuff in them? It would be really cool + it would make the game harder to defend making the match more competitive.<br>I'm not saying there isn't any stuff in every map but the majority of them doesn't have anything apart from the wool. Try adding some good bows, chestplates, potions, etc.<br>Opinions? and thanks for reading! c:

I pointed this out a long time ago, apparently it's meant to be like that. Although, I agree with you 100%.

And we also need woool rooms where players can't shoot you.

We need some wool rooms with multiple levels and protection against bow spammers on the other team.

If they are meant like that they either have to make it like traditional CTW system, or make safeties able to be picked up and getting rid of the op items in chests because of how abused it can be
