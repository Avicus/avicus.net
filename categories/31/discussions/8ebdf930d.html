I have seen this suggested in the forums before but i wanted to suggest my own version now that a tournament is being planned.<br><br>This is a suggestion for another tournament at a later date.<br><br><b><u>The Avicus Cup<br><br></u><i>A Competition of Avicus players trying to prove they can compete in any gamemode!<br></i><u><br></u></b><u></u>So basically it is a rotation of each gamemode, Nebula, CTW, SG, the walls, Nexus, CTH, HG.<br><b><u><br></u></b>When you are eliminated, you are allowed to spectate the rest of the tourney.<br><b><u><br></u></b>Does not require a team, or sign up, you just show up at the time it starts.<br><b><u><br>The rotations:<br><br></u></b>Destroy the Monument:<br>Teams selected randomly.<br>Losing team is eliminated.<br><br>Team Deathmatch:<br>Same as DTM<br><br>CTW:<br>Same as DTM and TDM<br><br>Nexus:<br>Lowest scoring team is eliminated*.<br>Winning team gets a bye, meaning they do not participate in the next rotation, but they pass.<br><br>The Walls:<br>Same as Nexus<br><br>Control the Hill:<br>Same as Nexus and Walls.<br><br>Hardcore Games:<br>Eliminate enough players in order to leave 24 players left** (Counting the bye team).<br>The Winner(s) gets a free set of leather armor for the<br><br>Survival Games:<br>Last man standing is the winner of the Tournament.<br><br>And there you have it, maps are randomly chosen for each rotation. &nbsp;The winner is declared the Avicus Champ.<br><br>how do you guys feel about this?<br><br>*=If a tie for lowest score, both teams are not eliminated.<br>**=If more than 24 players are still alive by the time the HG is next, multiple games will be held, then have the last 24 survivors overall progress. &nbsp;(Example: 32 players are left, two games holding 17 people each, the last 12 from each round pass, the first 5 to lose would be eliminated. The winner from both rounds earns the prize). &nbsp;If less then 24 players by the time HG is next, then the half of the players pass, rounded down (Example: 15 players are left, the last 7 will pass.)

There isn't teams, this is more of a single person wins, for the first 6 gamemodes, players are randomly selected to each team.

It's simple, gamemodes like CTH wouldn't provide good gameplay and regarding SG, you can even kill your teammates. Common.. ._.

HG would turn into people running and hiding since you just need to make it far. The way this could be done is play all these gamemodes (no elimination) with point values assigned to certain objectives associates with the game like kills, winning and capping a wool.

Tourneys consist on teams, not FFAs and if not then why did Kylo implement the team section then?<br><br>Now, CTH won't provide good gameplay for the simple fact that tourneys consist on teams as stated above and you can't just organize a team or make strategies during a match which's objective is getting points by getting to the middle of the map in time, I mean, some teams would just camp and drop to the middle in the last 10 seconds, where I don't see the quality a TDM tourney would give us instead + CTH includes kits which break the tourney's objectives which are having fun and making players show their skills. Kits don't follow the 2nd objective because some of them are broken and we don't want broken stuff in an official event right? + We want to see regular PvP, you can go to Hypixel for kits.<br><br>Don't compare CTH with OCN's KOTH because they're completely different, KOTH at least gives you the chance to organize pushes and more stuff that follows the objectives we want.

Of course most Tourneys consist of teams, but this tourney is for individuals, i am not saying that i do not like the tourneys based off teams, it is really cool. &nbsp;But there are tourneys for individuals, team tourneys are not the only kind. &nbsp;<br><br>I see your point, originally i did not have a solution for that, but in this discussion, we decided that killing gives you points, people can get a better chance of winning it all if they go in and kill. &nbsp;<br><br>I'll be honest with you, ive only played on OCN once or twice, i do not know what KOTH is, im guessing King of the HIll?

1. Yeah you're right, there are tourneys for individuals as well but the team section that was recently implemented is based off, teams! If not then I would just solo and wait for the tourney you're looking for.<br>2. If you want points for kills then why don't you just ask for a TDM tourney instead? That would be better.<br>3. Yes.

1. i would think every tourney would be teams, just have this one every now and then, the majority should definitely be Team tourneys.<br>2. I just think it would be cool to do a around Avicus tourney, that was one of the main things i thought would be cool about it.<br>3. Ok thanks XP
