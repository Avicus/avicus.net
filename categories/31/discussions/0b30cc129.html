I thought that I had everybody by my side, but I went and blew it all sky high. And now the mods wont even spare a passing glance, all just because I mic spammed on ts.<br><br>When big larry came round just to put him down<br>Steven turned into a clown, and no one ever wants to play with a fool who went and screamed on teamspeak.<br><br>I know I shouldn't mope around I shouldn't curse, but the pain feels so much worse. But windin up with no one is a lot less fun, than a ban for hacks, or spamming the fitness gram pacer test...<br>Now I learned a lesson I won't soon forget, listen and you won't regret, be true to yourself don't scream on ts, and you won't end up like the fool who spammed teamspeak.

I do not understand why this thread was locked in the first place, where the previous apology threads were not?<br><br>I spoke to the author of this thread and he actually means it, therefore all unnecessary posts have been deleted. Please stay on topic, or the thread will be locked upon request from steven, or it gets out of hand again.

Well, I'm uncertain whether you actually mean it... but I'm gonna give you another chance because I don't believe that you're a mean person, just that you don't know when to <i>stop</i>.<br><br>The spammy posts got a bit annoying and when it was done to your topic, it didn't really feel good. I understand that you want to be funny, but sometimes there isn't a time to be funny.<br><br>And there are other times where comedy goes a bit too far or gets a bit too annoying.<br><br>Steven5703 got:&nbsp;<b>Another Chance!<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Use it wisely, my friend." - Zintenka</b>

Steven, I've known you for a while now and I know you are a good guy. You never have negative intentions in anything you do and I admire you for that. Your memes can get out of hand sometimes, but I'm ok with that. Maybe other people since they hear it more often don't like it, but that's just them.&nbsp;<br><br>I remember over a year ago when you were Map Dev. I really admired your work and your commitment to the job. When I made a post about pictures for the map page, you were the one who was going to take the initiative of adding them when your GitHub was fixed. You also volunteered to do media coverage for The Omega Championship. Maybe it wasn't the best quality, but the fact that you volunteered yourself even though you didn't have to is what counts.&nbsp;<br><br>Not only that, but you surprise me. When there's something about Avicus nobody knows about, you know about it and help everyone out.&nbsp;<br><br>All in all, I accept your apology even if it hasn't directly affected me yet. Keep on being you Steven.

tbh i think you're like a different person when you're around michael zac or merlin and you try to suck up to them no offense but when you're not with them you're actually pretty cool and you're funny as well.
