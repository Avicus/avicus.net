<b>Forcefield</b><br>.When someone is forcefield hacking, they are hitting everyone nearby them very fast.&nbsp; You can easily tell if someone is hacking when they are hitting many people in an area rapidly.&nbsp; Kill Aura is another hack similiar to forcefield, but it hits all entities, such as mobs and even xp orbs.<br><i>example:&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4m3iiC_a6s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4m3iiC_a6s</a></i><br><br><b>X-ray<br></b>X ray enables a player to see players and ores underground easily.&nbsp; It essentially removes the texture of stone and other blocks such as sandstone, and you can use it to find chests<b>&nbsp;</b>and players.&nbsp; On the Overcast Network, you can find a X-ray hacker if they dig straight to a tunneler on the opposing team.&nbsp; However, this is not definite.&nbsp; Players can sometimes hear other players tunneling and find them that way.<br><br><b>Wall Hack</b><br>It is kind of like x-ray in use, the easiest way to describe it is that it makes players, mobs and items appear through blocks without removing any blocks. Very hard to detect like xray. So with this hack I could see someone shifting underground while still seeing the ground.<br><br><b>Tracers</b><br>They draw a line from your curser to every player within your radius. Pretty much impossible to detect. However if you are hiding and someone turns from a completely different direction towards you,&nbsp;<u>may&nbsp;</u>be a sign.<br><br><b>ESP</b><br>Makes a shiny box around every player within range, helps see tunnelers/people shifting. Pretty much impossible to detect. However if you are hiding and someone turns from a completely different direction towards you,&nbsp;<u>may</u>&nbsp;be a sign.<br><br><b>Fast Break</b><br>Increases how fast you can break a block. NoCheat probably has this sorted. The block may replace itself after being broken. Pretty hard to catch unless you time them, or they can break wood for example, insanely fast.<br><br><b>Sneak</b><br>Allows players to move at normal speeds while sneaking. If you cannot see someones name while they are running/sprinting, this may indicate a hack.<br><br><span><b>Spider Hacks</b><br>Spider makes all vertical block faces act like ladders, allowing you to climb walls or catch yourself from a fall easily.<br><br></span><b>Click Aimbot<br></b>Click aimbots allow you to automatically hit the nearest entity within range of you every time you left-click with 100% accuracy. This gives the hacking player a major advantage as in normal combat both players miss a lot of the time when they swing their weapon. Forcefield is superior in every way, but people often use this weaker hack instead because it's harder to spot and prove. The best way to tell if someone is using this hack or not is to see if they're hitting you while angled away from you or straight up facing another direction. You also get hit slightly faster than normally possible&nbsp;by people using this hack. Note that click aimbots do not affect bow accuracy.<br><i>example:&nbsp;</i><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReAUacYF2-A"><i>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReAUacYF2-A</i></a><br><br><b>Bow Aimbot<br></b>Bow aimbots are&nbsp;<i>very&nbsp;</i>rare, so it's unlikely you'll run into someone using this hack. What it does is change the direction of the arrow as soon as it leaves your bow to hit the closest player or mob, allowing for impossible accuracy at long range. This hack is very hard&nbsp;to prove, as some players are simply good shots or they get lucky. The only way to tell is if you see someone shooting an arrow sideways or even backwards. Sometimes you can catch them if their accuracy at a&nbsp;very long range is simply inhuman, but it's unlikely that you will be able to do so.<br><i>example:&nbsp;</i><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDvRMIGaFqg"><i>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDvRMIGaFqg</i></a><br><i>example 2:&nbsp;</i><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMAFgY1E9RQ"><i>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMAFgY1E9RQ</i></a><br><br><b>Speedhacks<br></b>Speed hacks make a player able to move extremely fast, giving them an unfair advantage over other players.&nbsp; If a player if moving monstrously fast, report them for speed hacking<br><i>example:</i><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_15cTphMsw"><i>&nbsp;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_15cTphMsw</i></a><i>&nbsp;</i><br><br><b>Sprint Hacks<br></b>Sprint Hacks allows players to always be sprinting, regardless of if they are shifting, blocking with a sword, shooting a bow, or running into a block.&nbsp; You can spot players with autosprint if they have sprint particles coming off while standing still.<br><i>ex</i><i>ample:&nbsp;</i><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0va1FLzvKME&amp;feature=youtu.be"><i>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0va1FLzvKME</i></a><br><b><br>Click Macro<br></b>This hack allows players to put on all their armor at the same team, easily and fast.&nbsp; It is used most in pot pvp, but players use it on Project Ares too.&nbsp; You can tell if someone is using this hack if they put on 2 or more pieces of armor at the same time.&nbsp; This hack can be used to do other things too<b><br><br>Fly-Hack<br></b>Fly hacking makes players fly as though they are in creative mode.&nbsp; nocheat+ makes it harder to flyhack, but players can still do it.&nbsp; If you see a player as though they are in creative mode flying that isn't observer, report them immeditaley.&nbsp;<i>(use /toggle obs to get rid of observers)</i><br><i>example:&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv4Q4NjEhAw">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv4Q4NjEhAw</a></i><br><br><b>Derp Hacks</b><br>Derp Mode is a hack that makes players movement completely flip out. There are a few types of Derp Mode. There is<i>Hump</i>, which makes the player look like they are pressing and releasing the sneak key over and over again. There is&nbsp;<i>Spin</i>, which makes the player appear to rotate around the center of the space the player occupies. This will not affect their movement. There is<i>&nbsp;</i><i>Head</i>, which turns the player's head upside-down inside their body, looking almost headless. The last is<i>&nbsp;</i><i>Normal</i><i>,&nbsp;</i>in which a player's head and limbs just completely flip out and go all over the place, rotating and spinning wildly.<b><br></b><i>example:&nbsp;</i><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4mEGBk7IxM"><i>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4mEGBk7IxM</i></a><b><br></b><i>example 2:&nbsp;</i><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsuIFgK9L10"><i>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsuIFgK9L10</i></a><br><br><b>Regeneration Hacks</b><br>A player using regeneration hacks will always be regaining health fast, faster than a opple.&nbsp; The way to find a player like this is that they never get killed by anyone or anything, because they heal before the damage can kill them.<br><i>example:&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dld9Xo8m2fY">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dld9Xo8m2fY</a></i><br><b></b><br><b>NoFall</b><br>NoFall is a simple hack, but easy to spot if you're looking for it. NoFall prevents the user from taking any fall damage, and can be recognized when a person either falls from a monstrous height and lives without feather falling boots or if they fall from a height greater than 3 blocks and do not flash red.&nbsp; NoFall is achievable legit without hacks using a cobweb or a water bucket, so look carefully before reporting.<br><i>example:&nbsp;</i><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3ssG03M1sY"><i>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3ssG03M1sY</i></a><br><br><b>NoPush<br></b>NoPush is a hack commonly used in many clients in order to prevent bow or enchantment knockback off a melee weapon. It is commonly used while in use of another hack, and you can tell if they don't move and there isn't a block behind them. Sometimes this is hard to prove if they are lagging, but you can check if they can hit you and move freely. If they do, it's most likely NoPush and you can get a permanent sentence of ban for it. This is a hack not found in most clients, and it helps have a big advantage over the enemy.<br><i>example:&nbsp;</i><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33nQWIDXk2c"><i>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33nQWIDXk2c</i></a><br><br><b>Step</b><br>Step makes you move like an Enderman! Meaning that you don't have to jump to go up one-block high increments, making your client register them as stairs.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Nuker</b><br>Nuker has nothing to do with explosions, though the name may suggest otherwise. Nuker makes the user&nbsp;automatically break blocks around them, provided they&nbsp;have the right tool. Each block will cost a durability point from said tool. With&nbsp;<i>Smasher</i>, one of the Nuker settings, it automatically destroys only insta-break items.<br><br><b>Build</b><br>Build allows the user&nbsp;to create some structures almost instantly. It will consume blocks from the stack held.&nbsp;There's&nbsp;<i>Wall</i>, which creates a wall in front of the player at a size they choose. There is&nbsp;<i>Floor</i>, which is similar to wall. Lastly, there is&nbsp;<i>Swastika</i>, which creates what the name suggests.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Criticals</b><br>This hack does exactly what one would think it does. It turns every hit critical for the user. From the perspective of the user, they will appear to micro-jump when they hit, almost as though they are constantly in a two-block-high space. It can be spotted by watching to see if the person jumps or not to get criticals, however can be&nbsp;hard to spot, because many players use legitimate techniques to get critical hits when needed during combat.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Water Walking<br></b>This hack is pretty straight forward.&nbsp; It allows you to walk on water without falling into it.<br><i>example:&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH6BhgdbLHs&amp;feature=youtu.be">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH6BhgdbLHs&amp;feature=youtu.be</a></i><br><br><b>NoSwing</b><br>NoSwing is a hack that disables the user's arm swinging animation, such as hitting other players without the appearance of doing so. Or spleefing them, also without the appearance of doing such.<br><br><b>AutoTool</b><br>AutoTool selects the appropriate tool from the user's&nbsp;hotbar for any purpose. If the user&nbsp;attempts&nbsp;to hit a player with their hoe, it will automatically switch to their&nbsp;sword. This function has been known to work with forcefield. This also applies to a player's clicking stone and being switched to their pickaxe, or anything similar.&nbsp;<br><b></b><br><b>SpamBot<br></b>SpamBot allows a user to send a message in the chat extremely fast over and over again.&nbsp; Usually servers make it so you can't send duplicate messages or not say things except every X seconds.&nbsp; If you see someone spamming screenshot it and report on the AVICUS NETWORK<br><b>Reach&nbsp;<br></b>This Hack doesn't really exist anymore. &nbsp;Reach was popular back in the summer of 2011, but was patched by the time Minecraft left Beta and went into the full version. &nbsp;Some variations can be used in private clients, however, they aren't anywhere near as useful, and are outclassed by Kill Aura/Forcefield.&nbsp;<br><br><br><br><br>Remember to Report if you see any of this<br><br><i>As I said</i>&nbsp;<i>above, please tell me if you want more hacks mentioned in this thread, or if my facts are wrong.<br>Reference =: <u>Redacted</u><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></i>

You forgot killaura....or am I stupid. Also, bow aimbot does not guarantee a hit. I seen it and the arrows ten to curve towards the nearest person, but don't always hit.&nbsp;<br><br>Honestly, most of these are "disabled" by Anti-cheat or NCP, and the others, are common knowledge. To bad we can't show this the the noobs in game.

Actually reach hacks still exist. They are possible to do on pretty much any server without NCP and on single player but I would imagine NCP stops it from happening.<br><br>Same for regen hacks. I'd imagine NCP stops it.
