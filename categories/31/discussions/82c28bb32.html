Is reach a real hack? Because lots of players and staff say there is no such thing.

As far as I know there are Reach Hacks but it's not the way most people think.<br><br>The reach hacks just make you able to reach the max block distance and make it adjustable in some Kill Aura's.<br><br>According to most the block limit for hitting entities cannot be breached; I have however seen a block reach hack. This guy could break the monument from spawn by typing in co-ordinates but that was in 1.6

"Reach hacks" are something that does (by name) exist in hacking clients. However, most any half-way decent anti-cheat plugin (such as NCP or Anti-Cheat itself) should counter any extended distance these clients are able to add.

He would never snap at me though, he always had a legit aim too. The only thing was the reach.

I'm not able to view the video currently but things like latency and perspective can alter what something looks like, I really doubt that any client would include (actual working) "reach hacks" that didn't accompany something else such as Killaura. Generally speaking some Aimbots (including FF/Killaura) are supposed to have extended reach but as said earlier, any half-decent anti-cheat plugin should prevent these from working.

Because you have not viewed the video, let me tell you that it wasn't on avicus.<br>It was on another server that i'm pretty sure doesn't have any cheat prevention program.
