so my brother is going to start playing avicus again (not dabadermc)<br>my other brother is going to play. The reason why I'm sad is because well he's bad at pvp, and sometimes he gets into bad situations so if you see me on it might not be me.......yeah.

Surprisingly enough, at a time my younger sister used to play on my account, before I came to Avicus. Didn't give me the best reputation. :3

nise men, but be careful of what your sibling does while using YOUR account :P I'd recommend keeping a close eye on him if you wanna stay out of trouble as you say he gets in problems quite frequently :)

Same thing with my friend Zombiesblood12. His little brother would log on his account and get a ton of infractions. Do what I did and get him/her an account of their own.

If possible buy a new account or borrow your friends (if you have one that plays minecraft) that doesn't play on Avicus if he/she allows it.<br>C: Goodluck keeping your brother in control, I remember when I let my cousin play on a server, nothing went right so I bought him an account.

I have siblings too.&nbsp; Occasionally they play on Tarheelkiwi, but most times they play on TOG_Matt.&nbsp; When they play on my account I allow them to play on any server but Avicus, and the other server I work on (no advertise).

If your sibling gets you in trouble, whether you did it or not, your account will be on the receiving end of an infraction.<br><br>Be careful but tell your brother to have some fun!
