I think MLGPorky does not deserve Moderator. Look at his infractions, most of them are bans and he was hacking before. Although you may tell me people change their ways, and you think his nice to you, he may be nice on the outside but bad on the inside. He may have plans. And lastly, the Enforcing Punishment, do you think his gonna abuse anytime soon?

Talk to a senior staff member directly if you have a problem with a moderator. Also, you should probably provide some evidence for his "plans" to "abuse".

Do you have to say this on the forums? If you have any problems with any moderator, Contact a Sr.Mod+ on skype.

Why are you trying to publicly shame someone? As a matter of fact, you don't deserve to be on the server. The last thing you want to do is bash one of our most outstanding moderators. If you have a problem with our staff members, you can email support as stated by a couple of people above.
