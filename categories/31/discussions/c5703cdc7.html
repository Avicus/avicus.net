Everybody hates unfair banning. It happened to my friend during a skype call. My friend was banned for flying, criticals, anti knockback, aimbot, bow aimbot, step, and auto respawn. At least 2 of these don't exist.&nbsp;<br><br>1. Criticals are not hacking. You can do that by simply jump hitting someone.&nbsp;<br>2. Doesn't know what step even is.<br>3. Auto respawn: Server does that for eveyone.<br>4. My friend died from knockback at least twice during the game we were in.<br>5. My friend only got one bow kill during the game.<br><br>I don't know why or how the ban was executed. There were no warnings and no complaints in chat. I think my friend was reported because of a troll, which is why this server's anti hack system is flawed. You simply cannot rely on players to be fair. All I know is that my friend shot a guy off once, got reported by him, and got banned by javipepe. My friend apparently gives up on the server so I made this appeal. I am aiming to lift the ban or at least reduce it to a temp ban. I hope this message reaches staff.<br><br>-Nightmarethe5th

When you use criticals, what it does is it makes every single one of your hits criticals. You don't even have to jump.<br><br>Your friend can appeal his ban in the "Appeal an Infraction tab."<br><br><b>Locking...</b>
