Hey guys! It's been awhile, and I meant to do one of these while I was still mod, then I got demoted, but my reassessment went in my favor with evidence I provided, and now I'm back as a Junior, hopefully to become a mod again! So, ask me anything! :D

@xIsak:<br><i>If you could only eat one food, what would it be? </i>Pasta! I love noooooodles.<i><br>Favourite moment on Avicus? </i>My first Junior Mod trial.<i><br>The Best thing about Avicus? </i>Being staff, and helping people.<i><br>The worst thing about Avicus? </i>There are some issues with Avicus that would be hard to fix. Let's leave it at that ;)<i><br>If you had a month to live, what would you do?</i> Quit school, steal a car, go on an epic road trip, and visit Alaska.<br><br>@resepignev:<br><i>Reason for ya name? </i>Spartemex: I was looking for a Terraria name (my first video game) and combined my favorite sports team at the time, the Spartans, with the brand of watch watch I was wearing just then, a Timex. Combine them and you get Spartimex, but I thought Spartemex looked cooler. JustALittleMagic: I laying in bed one night thinking of possible new usernames (I had been doing this for weeks as I drifted off to sleep), and I though of ItsMagicM8, then HaveALittleMagic, so I liked the Magic theme, and HaveALittleMagic was taken, so JustALittleMagic was born.<br><i>Reason for your avatar picture? </i>I thought the art of Evo's profile picture was cool, asked who made it, asked agian 2 months later, asked again another two months later, then found the one that I most like, and also looked kind of like me.<br><i>Would you show your face to the world?</i><br><i>If yes, when?</i> A few years.<br><i>If no why?&nbsp;
</i>The world is not ready for this face. (Jk, I just want to keep my privacy.)<br><i></i>
