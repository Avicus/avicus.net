In a game off Nebula there was a hacker so I reported as I am suppose to about 10 mins no staff. I went a checked the staff page and saw none were online and some haven't been online for days/weeks. We need active staff .-.<br>ps lock this if you want to.

Honestly, saying "+1 more staff" is doing nothing. The apps will not instantly open after a certain amount of +1s. Everybody is just gonna have to be patient and wait for the apps to open.

(I know I'm not on the staff team anymore) but yeah the staff team is always looking for new staff members but we want to make sure we do have quality staff members. I'd rather have 25 give or take quality staff members than 40 of them who are all pretty bad. The staff applications should be open soon as I hope so we will be getting more staff.

Even tho they are, there will always be players who deservs it that can be on. And this guy is right, we do need more staff.

Your report will be looked into and will be dealt with whenever staff can get on to check the person that you are reporting, considering if he or she will be on at same time as staff member, or be like other people and record and post video here (^_^) &nbsp;If staff were getting paid in real life I am pretty sure every staff member would be on but considering this is a volunteer server, then what exactly do you expect o_O?

This server also needs more people, because you can't get all these famous people to do everything. What this server needs to get even more famous people, and then maybe it can advance a lot more.

I agree the mod to player ratio is severely lacking.<br>We only have 27 staff. 20 are moderators.<br><br>Lets say Avicus has around 600 players on average on the servers.

Some stay could be busy with school, others could still be on holiday. Staff are there to 'Moderate' the server, but they have a life outside of minecraft as well. What you can also do is the record the hacker and online report. It might take longer but the player will still get punished. If you do nothing, he or she wont.

I few of the high staff seem kind of inactive too.. I looked at their times they were last on and a good few of them had not been on for days, one even 8 days which without a valid excuse like a holiday is not good. One of my pet hates is when the people in charge never play on the server but that said a good few do play ingame and are active so that is good to see. Regardless I think it needs to be addressed.. There is one Sr.Mod in particular who is ne'er ingame (was the 8 day person) and never ever really seems to get involved with players and discussions on the forum.

I disagree.

You say you know they do more stuff behind the scenes yet you really don't know.

There's truth to what you're saying. Personally, I don't really know what splits a Manager and a Sr.Mod but I was just assuming they did more because if there was no difference between the two ranks why would there be a Manager rank in the first place?

You say you know they do more stuff behind the scenes yet you really don't know. You are just assuming they do more since they are the higher rank, yet Sr.Mods seem to be running the support email and they often post much more frequently than the Managers and I personally see then ingame a lot more (no disrespect intended, just something I have noticed)&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;So some clarity on what the difference is between Managers and Sr.Mods would be great.

We have no extra physical power in the way of commands and actual control over the server over senior mods. We do however as stated do a lot more of the behind the scenes work and making important decisions.
