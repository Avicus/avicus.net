Woo hoo!<br><br>It's that time again for another edition of discussion starters!! Today, I just wanted to ask you all if any have created a new skin! I made a few skins earlier in 2014, and this year switched to a wolf hunter skin. However, I'm changing back to my original scientist looking skin. Anyways... Has anyone on avicus created a new skin for themselves? Another question I have for you guys is if anyone has a new nickname for themselves. This could be relating to your name or something that you are good at, retaining to avicus topic. For example my nickname(s) include: Canuck, Pro, socks. Yes socks. I used to be called socks for some reason back when I played sports. Don't ask why. Oh and sorry if this seems a bit late for a "new year" post, but whatever! Hope you all enjoy!!<br><br>-Peace<br><br>CP

I might change some details that are on my current skin, but I probably won't change the skin as a whole :)

<a href="https://iaero.me/mcchecker" rel="nofollow">https://iaero.me/mcchecker</a><br>If it says Premium next to the name, that means it's taken. If it says available or non-premium, that means it is not taken :)<br><span>P.S. If you're wondering why it would say <b>non</b>-premium, it's because the name was taken back when Minecraft was free (alpha?) but hasn't been paid for. This means that the username is still available to buy, or change your name to in the 1.8 name change update.</span>

I changed my skin from Earth to Mars, if anyone was wondering. It fits the new moderator tag pretty nicely ;)<br><br><img alt="" src="http://i.gyazo.com/07632da715ae431083587e3cbae06be2.png">
