<b><i>Suggestion!!!</i></b><br><br>A teamspeak event hosted by the staff. There will be a section in teamspeak called "War" and there are 2 groups; you can choose in the waiting lobby, but I will get to the channels later. You will have 6 members of your teamspeak channel and 6 members in the other teamspeak. All together, 12. You have to declare "war" on them and they are password protected. The passwords will be fairly easy, such as player names, then once a person from the other chat they will plant a bomb, which means they move to the "cover" chat. After 5 seconds of a player moving in, the teamspeak chat explodes/is deleted/locked. The player who moved in is paired up with a member of who they invaded on server mapdev, and have to 1v1 them. Whoever wins, they get a medal rank on teamspeak. If the person who was invaded loses, they are banned from the teamspeak for 1 hour. If the person who lost wins, you are given your channel back. It is an elimination styled thing and whoever is the final winner receives an emerald rank and their own custom channel in teamspeak for a day. Here are the channels;<br><br>---------------<br>[] War<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;[] Preparation Room (You will be able to discuss here and organize teams.)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;[] Cover (Go here after bomb is planted.)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;[] Base #1 (The first team of 6 players goes here.)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;[] Base #2 (The second team of 6 players goes here.)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;[] Battle Room (When 1v1ing, you move into this channel.)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;[] &lt;custom channel&gt; (Whoever wins this tournament, their channel will be theirs.)<br><br>----------------<br>Once the password is cracked, a new one is assigned named after a player. Rinse and repeat until there's only 1 player left. If something occurs and there's only 1 member on your team, you go into "Betrayal Mode" and fight your teammate by moving into the battle room.<br><br><b>Rules:</b><br>- You cannot poke the enemy team with the password.<br>- You cannot speak during preparation room. You type in chat.<br>- You may only have a custom channel for a day.<br>- Once the battle ends, the medal ranks are revoked.&nbsp;<br>- You cannot use hacks during 1v1s, or you will be perma'd on ts and avicus.<br>- You cannot move to another channel when in your base or battle room without first poking staff.<br>- If staff, do not abuse move perms or kick perms or ban perms.<br><br>Thoughts?

+1<br><br>This seems like a fun idea and not to complicated, and it also seems like Avicus TS will be more fun for the players.
