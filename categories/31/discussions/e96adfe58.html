bump, I really think he should be unbanned for some reasons:<br>1- I don't know how jozz tracked he's ip, If there is a program to do that, then I need it, actually everyone in all pvp games needs it<br>2- I personally know him and I know that he is not that smart to learn how to DDos <br>3- Did you check the ip again? if so tell me so I can block him on skype, since he is in my team, I don't want to be DDosed<br><br>Also, he already appealed but got no response so don't just say "this is not the place to do the appeal thingy" because it's annoying

Let me give a real explanation for this. DDoS, is a Distributive Denial of Service attack. One computer will send a signal to a collection of computers called a bot-net.
