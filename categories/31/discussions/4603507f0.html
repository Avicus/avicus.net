Wasting time on walls is the problem. Your theory is not going to work. People actually play the gamemodes that need to update, People do not think walls is bad, its worthless at this point.

It's hard to get more Walls players as people just prefer other game modes on this server. Also why would players be attracted to avicus' Walls when you can play walls on other bigger servers with more players? Most of the people who use to play walls left/moved on when they removed it and it's hard to get people to play it again

Maybe. Either way it will help, even if it's a little bit. Plus, I was promoted to Builder for the purpose of helping to fix Walls. I was planning to try to fix it anyway, but now I can work closer with the Map Devs and have access to things that help. This also allows the Map Devs and other Builders to work on other gamemodes, like DTM, DTC, CTW, etc.&nbsp;<br><br>Plus if nothing else I'm enjoying building maps and fixing maps that need it. That's the whole point of playing anyway, right? To have fun? Let's say this does go absolutely no where, which I don't think it will, the worst that's happened is a small waste of time, that wouldn't have been used doing anything better for the server, at least building-wise. You act like it has a major effect on other things.

I don't know how its going to work or if its even possible but maybe change "ore patterns" every time a walls game is played, Like how you don't have the same UHC map every single time, Idk how that will work but its not's fair dat u remember where teh diams are located&nbsp;(ಥ﹏ಥ), But yeah, I was also recommend maybe a tutorial for Walls, like how theirs one for Nebula ?<br><br>Anyways, I hope Walls doesn't die, sure you dont automatically get placed with a match about to start, but I hope it doesn't just disappear , Hopefully you fix it !

But I can't focus on that. That's a whole different department of staff that I'm not involved in. The best I can do is prepare Walls for the new players that will hopefully come from advertising.

I like this. I know players who played walls when it was brought back, but after a while stopped since the kits weren't up to par and the best maps weren't even brought back. Hopefully this will bring those players back into playing. Thanks for putting this effort in even when other players shoot down walls constantly.

How so? This is the first time Walls has been re-added. All this post is doing is making the updates for Walls more known and the updates giving people a reason to play Walls.

Thank you. :) It's good to know that some people still enjoy Walls. Now that kits are updated you can play! :D New maps and updated maps will be coming out in the next few days. Updates will keep coming after that as well. :)

He is right in every single point he made and you are just disagreeing with him cause youre a dedicated builder for this gamemode and you cant accept the fact that its dead and it should not come back

What? You should have mobs enabled on Walls. It's survival too, some maps at least should have spawners designated for mobs (like clearing dungeons within Walls for extra loot). I also don't agree with raising height limits so much, that destroys gameplay with shitty sky bases, hiding, and unbalanced bowing.

+1 I like the idea. The reason it was removed, for now, is because monsters were spawning very erratically. Every time that either Mt. Blizzard or The Village would be played there would be 10+ monsters on one side, and none on others. I like the idea, but they would have to be put there.&nbsp;<br><br>I have to disagree on height limits. Skybases were a huge part of Walls back before it started dying. I think when the height limits were lowered it caused a lot of people to lose interest in Walls. The skybases give Walls more options and allows people do have fun building skybases, or rushing. Personally, some of my favorite memories from Walls are from buidling skybases. They are fun to build, and they just overall add another layer to the game.
