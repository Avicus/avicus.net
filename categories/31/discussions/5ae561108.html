This topic was inspired by <b>Y0urm0m1's</b> post on the OCN forums&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://oc.tc/forums/topics/533f491512ca95c2b10003fb">https://oc.tc/forums/topics/533f491512ca95c2b10003fb</a>&nbsp;(sorry if thats advertising!)<br>**If you would like for me to archive this topic, Yourmom, I will do it.**<br><br><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This is a topic for anyone who is new to the Avicus server. This topic will tell you all about the slang words, some important rules, how to have fun, and much more! Let's get started!<br><br><b>Slang Words Used On Avicus</b><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There are many different types of "slang" words used on this server. Some are meant to be funny, some are very rude. Here is an extremely long list of slang words and definitions that you will probably get bored of reading.<br><br><br>1.&nbsp;<b>Lol<i></i></b><i></i> -<i> Translates to "Laugh out loud"<br></i>2.&nbsp;<b>Lmao/Lmfao&nbsp;</b>-&nbsp;<i>Translates to "Laughed my ass off" or "Laughed my f*****g ass off"<br></i>3.&nbsp;<b>Nvm&nbsp;<i></i></b><i><b></b></i>-&nbsp;<i>Translates to "Never mind"<br></i>4.&nbsp;<i></i><b>Rofl&nbsp;</b><b></b><b></b>-&nbsp;<i>Translates to "Rolls on floor laughing"<br></i>5.&nbsp;<b>GG&nbsp;</b>-&nbsp;<i>Translates to "Good game"<br></i>6.&nbsp;<b>eZ&nbsp;</b>-&nbsp;<i>Translates to "Easy" usually used to say someone is bad at pvp<br></i>7.&nbsp;<i><b>BG&nbsp;</b>-&nbsp;</i><i>Translates to "Bad game" usually used by bad sports.<br></i><i></i>8.&nbsp;<b>Bae&nbsp;</b>-&nbsp;<i>Usually means something like best friend<br></i>9.<i>&nbsp;<b></b></i><b>Bb&nbsp;</b>- <i>Baby, Best buddy, etc.<br></i>10.&nbsp;<i><b></b></i><b>Iloominatey&nbsp;</b>-&nbsp;<i></i><a rel="nofollow" href="http://imgur.com/gallery/xhkQm"><i>http://imgur.com/gallery/xhkQm</i></a><i><br></i>11.&nbsp;<b>Gtfo&nbsp;</b>-&nbsp;<i>Translates to "Get the f**k out!"<br></i>12.&nbsp;<b>Ur&nbsp;</b><i>- Means "your" or "you're"&nbsp;<br></i>13.&nbsp;<b>K/Kk/Ok&nbsp;</b>-<i> These all translate to "Okay"<br></i>14.&nbsp;<b>FTW&nbsp;</b>-&nbsp;<i>Translates to "F**k the world" or "For the win/world"<br></i>15.&nbsp;<b>Brb&nbsp;<i></i></b><i>- Translates to "be right back"</i><i><br></i>16.&nbsp;<b>Tbh&nbsp;<i></i></b><i>- Translates to "To be honest"<br></i>17.&nbsp;<b>Gtg&nbsp;<i></i></b><i>- Translates to "Got to go"<br></i>18.&nbsp;<b>M8&nbsp;</b><i>- Exactly what it sounds like, mate&nbsp;<br></i>19.&nbsp;<b>ATM&nbsp;<i></i></b><i>- "At the moment" or "At this moment"<br></i>20.&nbsp;<b>OMG/OMFG&nbsp;</b>-&nbsp;<i>"Oh my god/gosh" or "Oh my f******g god/gosh!"<br></i>21.&nbsp;<b>TDM&nbsp;</b>-&nbsp;<i>Stands for "Team deathmatch"&nbsp;<br></i>22.&nbsp;<b>DTM&nbsp;</b>-&nbsp;<i>Stands for "Destroy the Monument"<br></i>23<i>.&nbsp;</i><b>CTH&nbsp;</b>-&nbsp;<i>Stands for "Control the Hill"<br></i>24.&nbsp;<b>SG&nbsp;</b>-&nbsp;<i>Stands for "Survival Games"<br></i>25.&nbsp;<b>HG&nbsp;</b>-&nbsp;<i>Stands for "Hunger Games"<br></i>26.&nbsp;<b>CTW&nbsp;</b>-&nbsp;<i>Stands for "Capture the Wool"</i><br><br><b>Rules for Avicus<br></b><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Avicus is a server with many simple rules. Following these guidelines will give you a clean infractions list. I will only be sharing a few rules, the ones that I think are the most important.<br><br><u>Bullying<br></u><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Bullying is perhaps the worst way to break a rule. This is harassing, abusing, and being rude to other players. This can result in many different punishments depending on the severity. Don't do it. It will build a very bad reputation.<br><br><u>Hacking</u><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, never ever&nbsp;ever&nbsp;ever&nbsp;ever accuse another player of hacking in chat. Many do not know this, but it is against the rules. It gives the hacker a chance to turn off his hacks when a Staff member join the game to spectate them, letting them roam free. If you believe a player is hacking always use /report (player) (hacker).<br><br><u>Advertising<br></u><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Posting another server's IP ingame, on the forums, or anything like that is strictly prohibited. Advertisers are people who don't care for the server, they just want more players on other servers. Nothing else to say.<br><br>The rest are available at <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.avicus.net/rules">www.avicus.net/rules</a><br><br><b>Having Fun<br></b><b><br></b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Always have a clean atmosphere. Be nice to players. One thing you shouldn't do is "mini-mod'. This is when a player acts like a moderator and sometimes even impersonate as one. But, this does not mean players can help enforce the rules. Make sure that other players are having as much as fun as you are.<br><br><b>Ranks<br></b><br><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b>Have you ever wondered why there are people with the tags Gold, Diamond, or Emerald? Well, those are Avicus' donation ranks. In order to find out what each rank does, go here&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://avicus.net/shop">http://avicus.net/shop</a><br><br>Anyways, Gold is the cheapest, Emerald is the second cheapest, and Diamond is the most expensive.<br><br>Gold - 25 USD<br>Emerald - 50 USD<br>Diamond - 100 USD<br><br><br>I will continue to update this topic, but please leave suggestions down below. Thanks for reading!<br><br>Some Stuff:<br>ts.avicus.net = TeamSpeak IP, come join the fun!<br>TerraScape and MCZone = Old server names<br>Staff = To apply for staff, you must wait for apps to open. When they do, you must write a detailed application explaining why you deserve mod. If the app is good enough, you will be interviewed. If you pass the interview, you will receive Junior Moderator for a month. If you are good enough, you will receive moderator.<i><br></i>

It would be nice if new players were linked to this thread.<br>Also, you may want to change the "Staff" part, as it is different on the Avicus Network.<br><br>EDIT: Never mind, you changed it. :)

I assume this is just the beginning cause there is much more you can touch.<ul><li>Gamemodes</li><li>Ranks</li><li>How to edit your Profile</li><li>Commands</li><li>Punishments</li></ul><span>Just to name a few.<span>Also it isn't the wisest idea to have negative slang words such as <b>eZ</b>, <b>bg </b>in the OP in my opinion. Also you could add forum slang such as inb4, OP and imo&nbsp;etc.</span><span>Also I feel you need to use the <b>bolding, </b><i>italics </i>and headings more and properly format the post to be more professional (as this is used by <b>new players</b> you want it to be <b>easily navigated </b>and <b>read</b>). Also I would the change the thread name to something like "<i>New Player's Guide to Avicus</i>" or something&nbsp;&nbsp;similiar&nbsp;as this is more informative then "<i>For new players</i>."</span></span><br>All in all it's a nice start but you still got a long way to go. :)

I love how all of us long time players (or popular ones, whochever) are commenting on a thread for the new players. xD Great work though!

Thanks for the feedback, Luxe! This is a topic I only started last night, so I will definitely add on.

Believe me, people say NASA more than CTW or SG. It's quite hilarious, but sadly it's truth.

How do you know that if you barely play Avicus.<br>You're more like a TS and forum user and trust me, no one says NASA because people come to&nbsp;<b>play</b><b>&nbsp;</b>here, not to talk about planets and missions, etc.

not bad dude. I totally accept this an dont archive this thread because i like what your doing to new players. IT really helps then :D<br><br><br>Be sure to cover all the basics to know in Avicus like profile editing, registering, gamemodes, in game commands, etc... and make it organized and try to make it short. I tried to make mines short but i couldnt D:
