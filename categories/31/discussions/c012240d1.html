Hello there, Pelp here.<br><br>Recently, Fluenza brought up a topic in one of the group chats that hand pick staff may have its return. I offered to make a discussion thread, and here I am making it...!<br><br>So what is your opinion on this topic? Should we have hand picked staff as our primary recruitment system, and why? Or should we keep it as it is, and why?<br><br>Thanks, <br>Pelpel

I personally agree with 'Hand-Picked' staff as people can lie and be secretive in their apps, however when their being watched in-game it shows their true personality. But it does require more time and effort that way, but the advantages are worth it, I think.

In my opinion, I believe that we should keep the system we have, but if the Sr+ believes that a person could suit the staff team, they would invite him for an interview. This way it's balanced and gives <b>everyone</b>&nbsp;a fair chance.

I agree, &nbsp;Though all staff acceptances should be handled the same way, as in, take Map Developers - they are hand picked, whilst applications are held for junior Moderators. It should all be the same :o

I think a mix, because you should get a chance to really show off in your staff app, and if you get accepted, you need to be true to yourself in the interview. I think it would be good if moderators observed interviewee's in-game to see how they really act/behave.

Keep in mind, the applications process is a lengthy and stressful period for the senior staff. Sure, applications gives everyone a fair chance, but with a<b> mixture </b><i>(as ambi suggested)</i><b>,</b> it definitely gives a variety within the staff recruitment process. Besides, we commonly mistake terrible grammar with foreign players trying their best to write a detailed application in english. This gives players from all different types of countries to really show themselves to the senior staff that they can help others by taking action instead of writing an application.<br><br>Opinions?

If I understand this thread correctly I disagree, I probably would never even get the chance to become staff becuase Im not known. There is probably a lot of players who would be 100 times better then the ones you pick.

I think that it is either one, or the other. It would get confusing if we have both, but it is an interesting concept. I just don't think it would quite work. The problem with applications is that, this is the only time we look for potential staff members, without them, it would be a constant job, something I would very much like.

Also I think a lot of people would take mod way more serious if the actually got a chance. But ok, sometimes you need to try new things to see how it works out. Hopefully the staff team will choose&nbsp;wisely and do their best. As I am sure they will.

Doesn't matter, it's all about making the staff team <i>efficient. </i>In my opinion, I would put 110% effort in making the staff team efficient, this method would work both ways - 1 being fair and giving every single person a chance.

I disagree. The system we have currently is very good, because there is a little bit of hand-picking from the Sr Staff, but 3 have to agree, so that there is less of a chance of bias. &nbsp;Also, this system allows lesser known members to become staff. If 3 Sr. Staff like their application, then they are on the road to staff. But say they aren't that popular, but they would make great staff. They would never get picked!

I was about to say this. The hand picked staff system can breed a lot of issues surrounding being biased. If a person who is aspiring to be mod befriends a senior mod, the senior mod may put him first over the others in terms of a priority list.

The process isn't 1,2,3 weeks.. It takes time, the player has to have a good enough reputation to represent the server. The person who is a essentially going to be hand picked must grab the attention of the senior staff before the senior staff even begin looking at him/her.

Hold the usual apps and interviews. BUt if the staff see one person who shows the highest (and I mean THE highest) devotion to the server and its safety, then pick that person to be a mod. Hold no special announcements for their promotion until after. Furthermore, have the admins, and only the admins, choose that person. Therefore you'll get a high quality moderator chosen by the admins.<br><br>EDIT:&nbsp;They should also take into account one's infractions they have received. If you make someone with like 2 pages of infractions, it would just add to the suspicion of biaism

The mods aren't going to try hard the procces. In addition, it's a rare situation where a person denies the opportunaty to become a staff member. The senior staff aren't going to spectate the guy like how you would do it if it was a hacker, they will just moniter him. Plus, their is no such thing as "wasting their time", they are just doing their job.

Hand picked always works better. It means you're picking a truly good member who won't disappoint. Though, they might not be good with speaking to those older etc. so that could bring up a problem but the choice is there for them, not everyone wants staff (Though I'm not one those people as I like to help and keep order :P).

I think that this is quite a good idea. If the Sr. Staff notices that a certain player has been very helpful, friendly, and active with the community for a long period of time, that player should deserve a chance at becoming moderator, if they wish.<br>I really like Ambi's idea, with having both systems (Hand-picked and applications).<br>However, a problem with this idea is that the application requires that you must have&nbsp;<b>"</b><span><b>Excellent punctuation and grammar.

After thinking about this for a while, I agree with mooch. A lot of players would probably just try to seem very mature when they are in the presence of a staff member, and I think that the application process means that you actually decide to take the time out of your day to write up a solid application. It just seems like writing an application would show that you really care about being a moderator. Also, writing the application is an important part, since it shows that your application can be written fluently, and you have no problem writing in English (which shows that you are able to communicate with others in-game and on the forums).

Personally, I don't agree with this idea. I feel like the members closest to the staff are most likely to get staff, and like with what mooch said. Only well known members are going to get it, while a lot of not well known people are amazing and would serve as excellent staff members.<br><br>Take pel for example; not very well known at all, and not extremely close to any staff if I'm correct. He would never get hand picked, because he's not well known. He's one of the best staff members here in my opinion, and with hand picked he most likely wouldn't get chosen.

In my opinion I really think it should be a mixture of both.<br><br>Of course, it varies. With hand picked staff, it may be bias in a situation or people may be a stuck up to Mods to get a Interview. It happens enough as it is when staff apps open, with some people being try hards. If it did happen, it should be probably below 5 hand picked staff so it doesn't effect so much. People can still apply for Moderator, and&nbsp; the Staff team doesn't have to be all well known players before they become Staff Members.

For people saying that unpopular players wont get picked for staff, the Overcast Network currently has this hand-picked system and it works quite well.<br><br>I always see a mixture of popular and unpopular players get chosen. I remember a staff responding to a question like, "Why'd you pick them, I barely know them?" They said something along the lines of "We don't pick the most popular, we pick those who we believe are ready to become a staff member"<br><br>So I don't believe only popular players would benefit from a hand-picked system, because it clearly works on other servers.

We had a hand picked system in MCZone, and... hornetjumper :p<br><br>But nah, I think it'll work, what you're proposing, but I think it'd be nice if you incorporate a system where someone proposes a player, two other people have to recommend that player, and then the rest vote on whether or not he approves. Not saying that's the whole process, but it could/would reduce a decent amount of bias.

I am personnaly from OCN and I found this server thanks to pelpel (thanks buddY :P ) and I really reccomend the hand picked staff.&nbsp;<br><br>1. power Hungry Proof: People that want to have a staff position can be realy good at applying without accually being good.&nbsp;<br><br>2. People that are a little known will be picked, the staff knows these people from reports and that shows that they are dedicated enough to do reports and help the server<br><br>3. Constant flow of new staff members. Since you pick your staff yourself you can pick as many as you want, you can pick one at the time and since you are going to look for good staff constantly you don't have to worry about deadlines<br><br>4. Staff won't be elitist since also no very popular people get chosen so you represent the community more with your staff team<br><br>~stormer1267

I am in favour of combining staff applications and handpicked staff. Constantly having the hand picked staff as well as having staff applications open ever once in a while sounds like a pretty good way to get staff.

But will you still be looking for hand-picked staff after there are 40 interviewees from the application process?<br><br>It would make more sense to just make it harder to be accepted through the application and interview process and then open apps more frequently.

how will you know the difference between a tryhard and legit good person? If someone becomes mod and is trying their hardest aren't they in that case a good person to be mod? Won't your negative bias get in the way?

tryhards usually want it because of their own selfish reasons.

Yes I am talking about the last part, and how bias would get in the way of perceiving them.&nbsp;<br>He explicitly says he hates people who tryhard, so wouldn't that affect his perception of that type of people who are doing it purely for a good intent? If hand picking is supposed to lead to better mods then this wouldn't exactly support that idea...

I agree with the former. The players should be able to report to the staff about the jr. mod's "functionality." This gives the mods a bunch more "eyes in the sky."<br><br>If a jr. mod were to fail on say, attending to a report and not upholding his/her responsibility without any staff seeing, they could easily, no offense, lie about their qualities. (Just like in their app, if they ever did.) If a player were to report that, then yeah, it would injure the jr.'s rep.

I want to add one more thing. If OCN can make this work, so can Avicus. Avicus has more potential because of its staff apps and if we combine it, the results theoratically should turn out pretty well.<br><br>Tryhards and kiss-ups do not neccsarly mean they have a higher chance of being a mod. Even though your "trying hard" just to make yourself look good to the staff, it wont be entirely based off of that. <i>The staff could secretly be watching you to see how these "tryhards" or "kiss-ups" really act in game when the staff is not around.&nbsp;</i>The staff can check your post, your chat logs, etc.. to see how they really act. Now if the staff sees a person tryharding but they are doing it not because for themselves but due to the fact they want to help the server, and this person does this continously and constantly throughout, he would most likely get choosen to be mod. I saw this in a thread and i sorta remebered what helps you and what does not help people get mod<br><br>Things that help but not limited to:<br><br>1. Filing in reports and using /report in game<br>2. Helping other players in the game and community<br>3. Following the rules and not breaking them<br>4. Be nice in game, and maintain a calm and causual atmosphere<br>5. Be mature<br>6. Have common sense<br>7. being active to help and support<br><br>Things that do not help you getting a mod<br><br>1. Bragging on what good you do in this server<br>2. Purposely breaking the rules, even though you clearly know them<br>3. Not being matture and not maintaining a calm and casual atmosphere.<br>4. Asking for mod<br>5.Telling the staff that if you were a mod, you would do great things.<br><br>These are some pretty basic standards though. Please read my post a couple pages back. ITs the lonng one. The main purpose of this process is : Wheather the person is a famous person, or some regular on Avicus, the procces will see what they do in game when the staff are not watching. That way, it shows their true identity.&nbsp;<br><br>Once their choosen to be staff, they will be invited to a chat room (skype or something) and there will begin a stage or training to prove them selves. Probably a month period long and if they dont cut out, they wont get it.<br><br><br><b>The Mod Selection process according how i would see it.<br></b><br>If however is combined with the staff apps, what Avicus can do is people will apply for staff that want to be. The people who sent applications will only be&nbsp;<b>CONSIDERED</b> to be mods. This does not guaratee that they are already a mod. Now this is where the Hand-picking comes in where they look at the people who applied and see how they act in game. The hand picking process can also pick other players who did not apply but they are worthy to be mod. There will be a majority vote from the staff that do not know this person and have not befriended. This would reduce bias from the staff and the staff can have a seprate subforum on deciding whos staff (this if they do not have a secret forum. Players cannot look at the subforum except staff) This process can filiter out the good applicants and the bad applicants because it shows who they really are w/o mods patroling in game and it brings out the quality of the player. Then comes jr.mod training and a month trial to see if there worthy or not.<br><br>We want quantity&lt;quality<br><br>When staff are watching in the sidelines, they can probobly just vanish from regualr players but they cannot deal punishments, for they have to be not vanished. Just a suggestion. The only flaws to this system is hat the proccess is lengthy and there is some bias but i said a few words few pages back about that. Take a look

The hell? You want them to learn from observation? Not everyone learns that way man! If you want a good example you could pick any moderator, couldn't you? Why would you keep mods that aren't good examples?

I will not state my reason on why sr. mods shouldn't teach directly, but I will say that because there are more moderators, the possibilities of having a good "example-setter" would be higher than in sr. staff.

What are the sr. staff's responsibilities relating to the server that prevent them from being active? I thought they were also in charge of dealing with reports and attained that rank b/c they were proficient in doing so?

So you want them to make mistakes? You know how hard it is to be comfortable making mistakes if you're under training? It's no fun at all, and I don't think it'll be a very good idea unless you get them under a program where they're comfortable making mistakes.

No of course not! Haha, of course we'll wait until the interviews are all over and everyone has been given their results. It'll take a couple of weeks to implement too, so maybe we'll start sometime mid March? Depends how much we need staff! :P
