Hello everyone,<br><br>Recently the <a href="https://mcresourcepile.github.io/staff/" rel="nofollow" title="Link: https://mcresourcepile.github.io/staff/">ResourcePile team</a> has been working to add more content and create more for the community. So we are introducing LeagueRec.<br><br>LeagueRec is a collection of information about competitive events that have been hosted by various networks. We aim to archive information about these events because some networks remove access to the information after a tournament has finished.<br><br>With the start of the project, we have added information about all events ran by the Avicus Network which you can view by clicking on the link below.<br><br><a href="https://mcresourcepile.github.io/leaguerec/avicus/" rel="nofollow" title="Link: https://mcresourcepile.github.io/leaguerec/avicus/">Avicus Network - League Rec</a><br><br>If there are any issues you can create an issue or pull-request on our <a href="https://github.com/MCResourcePile/MCResourcePile.github.io" rel="nofollow" title="Link: https://github.com/MCResourcePile/MCResourcePile.github.io">Github repository</a> (please read our <a href="https://mcresourcepile.github.io/admin/docs/league" rel="nofollow">documentation</a>).&nbsp;<br><br>Hopefully we can add more content from other networks in the future.&nbsp;<br><br><span style="color: rgb(192, 152, 83); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(252, 248, 227);"><i>This is not associated with any official Avicus services.</i></span>

</div>
Its a community project with which we (ResourcePile team) wish to improve the experience of users that play on Minecraft networks and help them by providing useful resources. It includes StatTrack (tracking stats like bow shot records), MapStack (collection of publicly available maps), toolrack (collection of helpful tools which is at the moment WIP) and leaguerec.

If you go Competitive, then tournaments and scroll all the way down, you can see that it's Berzerk

I remember Berzerk left for a while and came back to become Bezerkv2 for this tournament and won so I believe that is right.

It's entirely possible I ended up recording the wrong team. I found 2 different documents, one showing Berserk and the other showing BerserkV2.<br><br>I just kinda assumed that since it was the same team as V2, someone just put the short form on that one doc, but honestly, you'd know who won better than me.

I remember them leaving before the first tournament and made a huge deal about coming back and won the tournament. Then they tried to become BezerkV3 after most of their teammates left and they couldn't make the tournament;
