hi,<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am here to give a massive thank you to the whole staff team who have almost completely stopped team killing .Due to the amount of moderators now running the server no one dares to team kill and this makes the server epic and very fun to play.In old avicus( avicus 0.1)people would be team killing left right and center and when you use the /report there was no staff to be seen,now there is multiple staff who come!Anyway,a big thank you to the whole staff team for making Avicus the best it could be:)<br><br>regards,<br>endergodx

Of course it will still happen. We cannot watch every single player at the same time. What he is saying is that it is happening way less often than before the new staff members were promoted.
