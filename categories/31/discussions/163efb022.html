I am no longer going to be playing Avicus or being involved with it by anyway,<br>At the moment I have gone through this hard time being banned.<br>At the moment I am trying to recieve support but my teamspeak is dieing all of the time so I can't seem to receive it.<br><br>I used to be friendly, fun and I hope enjoyable to play with.<br><br>I would like to thank these people:<br><br>SnowSX3 - Being a great friend to me and supporting me all of the way and correcting me so I don't do wrong and receive 8 pages of infractions<br><br>Straightened - I am thanking this person for 2 reasons... 1. when I need support I know I can always look up to this person. 2. I just love his sense of humor<br><br>OPTOBAT - Always encouraging me to never give up and always giving helpful information.<br><br>Jkawesome - He is awesome. And Always supports me and being friendly to me I think this is the best friend I have ever encountered on Avicus <br><br>Harryrules2002 - Knowing him well I played many jokes and fun time with him. Until a little bit at the end!<br><br>finally this will be the FINAL thread I will ever make on Avicus if events don't turn. So I guess I have to say good bye Avicus. I will miss you. I will miss Nebula, Nexus &amp; Avicade. I will miss all of the players on Avicus and will never be let down. I will only post for the next 12 days. So if you want to ask me something please ask it.<br><br><b><b>Edit: </b><i></i></b><i>I will still post on the forums but not often</i>
