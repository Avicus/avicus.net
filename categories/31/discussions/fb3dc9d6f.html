Hello guys,<br><br>As you might have seen on the tittle, I want&nbsp; to know
 if Livestreamers and Refs are going to be part of the avicus.net/staff&nbsp;
 page, when the In game ranks are created. It´s just a silly question, 
but it´s interesting to know. If any Mod or Staff member can Answer I 
would be grateful.<br><br>See you

Don't think there will be from what I understand. I understand the teamspeak rank as there will be special channels but why in game and on the forums? Your not going to be livestreaming or reffing tournaments every day. And I'm guessing they would add you to the Avicus Staff Team Slack (which no one who isn't unless they are mapdev or jr mod +). So you wouldn't really be considered a "Staff Member" if you aren't even in the staff teams slack chat :P<br><br>Not trying to offend anybody but you have to admit it's true.<br>But don't quote me 100% as I said above, <i>"from what I understand"</i>

We were not added to Avicus Staff Team Slack. We have a separate one.

They're staff of tournament, and we need livestream / ref ranks in-game so they have access to ref/ls chat and can do commands like readying teams and other technical things, so yes.<br><br>The only dispute is whether or not the rank will either be displayed publicly or if it'll be an 'invisible rank'.
