This would be nice to hear about and I have a idea what the staff team can do. Because we have news that Avicus is opening up for new staff I wanted to know if you can release the format which the applications should be made like for example&nbsp;<br><br>What time zone:<br>Your IGN<br><br>Hopefully you understand what I mean so some of us could start our applications to make them as good as can be and which would make my day and make me really happy is if you could let us send them in and approve of them but that's only in January or February ! Please can you thanks , Element please contact me if you want to tell me anything else .

That's why I wanted to know now because I really want to be a staff member and if I start it now I can make it very good to give me a high chance of becoming a staff member.

The reason we make you wait so long is because, well.. Just think. Think how many staff applications we receive in the time period they're open. With that amount of applications and so few Senior Staff members, (Moderators can't manage the applications) it makes sense for it to take that long. On top of that, after we place an application under review, we still have to make the decision to accept or deny it. It's a long process.
