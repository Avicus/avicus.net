I've been hyped for the tourney since this idea was mentioned so my question is simple..<br>How will the teams communicate during a match? Will they use Mumble, TS, etc? If so..<br>- Are you going to make a room for each team? (I don't recommend this as we don't want TS spammed with TS rooms for teams).<br>- Who will have access to them? (Mods, livestreamers, refs?)<br>P.S: Try making more questions below so we don't make more posts regarding this.<br>Regards, Juan.

I'm pretty sure most, if not all teams have a Skype chat.

Personal private room. If it was skype, how would a ref know if someone is giving them tactical info?

Maybe setting up a white-list?<br>Mods should just let the main roster play and make the subs wait outside the server.

Probably on TS like the OCN tournaments work. Each team has their own "private" room.

Having multiple Teamspeak rooms would be the most convenient. It would make it easy for Refs and Officials to jump between the teams, making their job a lot easier. &nbsp;<br><br>Considering the tournament isn't going to last forever, I don't think that adding a few more rooms would be detrimental to Teamspeak.

To add on to your second question, referees will be assigned to certain teams. Livestreamers will have the ability to switch between teams within their assigned match for no longer than 3 minutes. Non-participating Moderators/regulars are not permitted however.
