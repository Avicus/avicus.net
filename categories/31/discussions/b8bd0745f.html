It is in my opinion that staff should be forced to show evidence to the forums, here are a couple of reasons:<br>1. Why not?<br>2. It puts the community to rest.<br>3. Why not?<br>4. We know that the "hacker" is actually hacking.<br>5. Why not?<br>6. The banned player wants to see proof because he might be confused.<br>7. Why not?<br>8. It prevents flame wars from starting.<br>9. Why not?<br>10.&nbsp;It makes the community question if the staff are abusing their power.<br>11. Why not?<br>12. There will be no more posts like this<br>13. Why not?

As a start. Very few people that are banned actually ask for evidence, more just flame on and on about how they are innocent. And uploading videos for every hacker you ban really slows down your internet.

Mods are not more "important" than the rest of the community. Everyone is equal, and all mods make mistakes, I'm sure that dozens of players have been falsely banned by mods, and I am not saying that the mods are not doing a good job, but like I said, mods can make mistakes, and if the banned player will look at the evidence, he can see once and for all what he did (If he did it) which will stop the player from continuing his rant on the forums.

Not the entire community has to see it... just the banned player.<br>And there is this amazing website called "Youtube to mp4" which let's you take youtube videos and turn them into mp4 files, which can be re-uploaded to youtube on a anonymous account, which keeps the reputation of the player who recorded safe.

&nbsp;The Staff are trained to detect hackers, if they let the community see the video, everyone will have a rant saying they don't see hacking, and take your side. You're right we do make mistakes, we're only human.<br>&nbsp; It's keep confidential, I'm sure more than one Staff Member would look at the evidence. It's not all based on one Staff Members opinion whether they hack or not. They compromise all together.

Also, another thing.<br>Every time someone who PvP's very well, he/she get's called a hacker, which eventually leads to a ban.<br>Instead of instantly banning said player, wait another day or so to see if the player is just great at PvP or is truly using hacking.<br>This gives the player a better chance to not get banned, if he/she is truly not using hacks.

I don't understand why you need to see it... All It's going to do is lead to the video becoming viral among the community and everyone will end up seeing it from players leaking it to one another.

More than one Staff Member(s) saw the evidence, they're trained, they know what to do. They wouldn't just ban you for no reason, I'm sure that more than one Staff Member(s) wouldn't make a mistake together, if they compromised.

I have an idea for this actually. Tell the "hacker" to take a screenshot of this, and then ban them. You should also take a screenshot, just to make sure when they "appeal" with their screenshot, it isn't faulty. This may not be possible with custom/non-gui hacked clients though. :L

That's quite blunt...

tbh, this post makes a point. sometimes some mods are only saying you "hack" without showing the video to you without anyone calling players that you hack. what if a famous or a player with so many friends got banned for "hacking" that you don't want to show it to everyone and you just only show it to your fellow staff? just like what steven said, it is like a person who was arrested not going to the court.&nbsp; also what happened to one player before which is theodore showed the video to him here that didn't cause any troubles at all. oh another thing, i think they should exempt people who got their accounts being used by another person. one does not simply say that "your account, your responsibility" cause no matter how responsible you are, people can hack or hi jack your account anytime.

I made a post, but then my browser crashed (it was so long I actually cried when it got deleted) .<br><br>The point I was making in that was that moderators don't have the time to record hackers. They want to play the game. The amount of moderators and the number of hackers would look really scary as a ratio. Recording hackers will not be happy adding time into the equation.&nbsp;<br><br>Well that's all I rememeber ._.

There is no type of hack at current which can get someone's password. There are similar ones that go through a dictionary of words and common password, in which case your password was too insecure and your responsibility.

You know what I love. Is that you said "Oh I wasn't hacking, Its because the TS thought I hacked because I was pwning them". Then you come up with this BS "oh my account got hacked that's why". Well then you should get better protection. I really don't believe that someone in idk Russia hacked your account and download and played with hacks on Avicus, when they could of played on another server oh but he plays Avicus knows the commands etc.

@BOSS_turtle - That was a possibility that we came up with.<br>Since nobody that I know could have used hacks, me getting hacked was a possibility. Remember, it happened to Howsie.

Nolan wouldn't be doing his job incorrectly, but I would just question why he wouldn't show it if this was dealt with privately.

I know another reason why the staff doesn't show proof to outsiders.<br><br>Back at the other network I play on, they used to have their forum set up so that everyone could see Player Reports.<br>This was a bad thing, because most people would attack innocent players for things they didn't do, protect their friends, even though they were in the wrong, and target players in-game for things that they have been disciplined for.<br><br>I personally think it is better that the community does NOT get involved with proof and such, not as to say "F*** YOU" to anyone who has been falsely banned (or anyone who was banned for good reason), but because it's not our job to watch over these things and not our jobs to get in the way of network justice.<br><br>./endrant

"<b>Cause i know there's nothing wrong if too many people wants to see it then let them</b>"<br><br>What you are suggesting is ludicrous. So basically what you are suggesting is that if enough players wish to see a video of a player hacking they should ust be able too? Have you ever thought about how embarassing that is to the player?

Before you make a suggestion like that think about other people besides yourself.

For the fourth time. People can give the YT link and post on the forums. So no don't post it on YT. Horrible idea.

Explain about what happened to the player named "thekeycrafter"? He was been banned by theo and he didn't know if whether he's hacking or not and theo just showed it and everyone can see it. So how could that embarrass a person if he/she knows that he/she's not hacking? It will be embarrassing if that player is being a fraud.

I'm saying it is embarassing if they are. <br><br>Also, "<b>He was been banned by theo and he didn't know if whether he's hacking or not and theo just showed it and everyone can see it." <br><br></b>Can you rephase that in a more... readable format.

What I would recommend is that proof must taken I.E Screenshot or video but it doesn't need to be posted on the forums, just held in a folder. Doesn't take as much time as waiting for it to be loaded onto youtube or other places like that and if players question the moderator, proof is there.
