I like to think not, I mean, I don't have very good ELO or stats on really any server, but my main focus is pretty much exclusively tournaments nowadays so make of that what you will.

I've always had an interest in making some maps for both OCN and Avicus, but recently I've had more of an interest in making tournament maps because of the incredible depth in strategy you need to build into them for them to actually be fun and interesting to play/strat for in tournies. Right now I'm still trying to get Injustice into the map pool for next tournie assuming its a TDM which might take a while, but after that I might pick up another project by myself or with a friend who knows.

Next tourney is (probably) a TDM, but there's always a chance that there's a change in procedure. I like your mindset though, you're good with managing projects and gameplay it seems.

I applied pretty much the first few days&nbsp;I was on the server. I first came to the server&nbsp;because I heard of the shocking resemblance&nbsp;to OCN, and after that I said to myself "Hey, look, there are mod apps, I think it would be pretty fun to be mod here", and so I did. I'd say it is a pretty fun experience being mod here overall and not something I regret doing by any means. Favorite team I've been on&nbsp;on Avicus would probably be PPB considering PB on Avicus is essentially just an extension of the regular PB. Favorite team on RMCT would definitely be Dixin Cider considering its the only team I've been on in RMCT :P. OCN teams is a trickier matter. I definitely have the most history overall with PureBlox, but Eclipse is just so delightful, and I'm gay for like half of the dudes on that team. I mean, I wouldn't really&nbsp;leave Eclipse for PureBlox given the choice&nbsp;so I guess you could say I like that one the most currently, but I do owe a ton to PureBlox considering they let me play my very first tournament and gave&nbsp;me the chance to play competitively for the first time.&nbsp;Although, I can say with certainty&nbsp;my <b>least </b>favorite team was Airborn.

I haven't really known you until recently during ToC when I saw that you played for BC against us. Although I've never had the chance (that I can remember) to meet you, I've respected you as an Avicus player ever since&nbsp;for decimating us in the Sunbeam match, so it was disappointing when your team got DQ'd last tournie. You definitely deserved the win and I think your a good offender overall.
