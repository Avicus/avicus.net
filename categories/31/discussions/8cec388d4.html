Hello, if you read my earlier post you will see that I am working on a Avicus Nebula Map. I have the basic shell created, but as I was creating it I had a question that I just couldn't let go.<br><br><b>Question</b>: What would you say is the "Preferred" &nbsp;length &amp; width for a nebula map?<br><br>&nbsp;I know I asked this before, however I didn't get a specific answer and I just want to make sure that I for sure don't make it too small.<br><br>Thanks so much guys! Bye Bye for now!

I'd go big or go home.<br><br>Dont make the map to small, because there are limits. But really you can expand the map so a size ranging from maybe 200x100 to 500x500.<br><br>Thats just what I think will make the best map and still give you working room.

Okay thank so much! My map currently is 250x150. I will expand this more knowing the information I do know.

Look at my nebula map post, and see what maps the people love. Take account of those map sizes and game-play - It may help you make the best map yet, the only thing that post can do is lead you in the correct direction. :)

Well, any size is good! It depends in what you're going to build anyways.<br>As long as the map isn't excessively big or excessively small, it's fine :)
