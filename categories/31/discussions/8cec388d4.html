Hello, if you read my earlier post you will see that I am working on a Avicus Nebula Map. I have the basic shell created, but as I was creating it I had a question that I just couldn't let go.<br><br><b>Question</b>: What would you say is the "Preferred" &nbsp;length &amp; width for a nebula map?<br><br>&nbsp;I know I asked this before, however I didn't get a specific answer and I just want to make sure that I for sure don't make it too small.<br><br>Thanks so much guys! Bye Bye for now!

I'd go big or go home.<br><br>Dont make the map to small, because there are limits. But really you can expand the map so a size ranging from maybe 200x100 to 500x500.<br><br>Thats just what I think will make the best map and still give you working room.

Look at my nebula map post, and see what maps the people love. Take account of those map sizes and game-play - It may help you make the best map yet, the only thing that post can do is lead you in the correct direction. :)

Well, any size is good! It depends in what you're going to build anyways.<br>As long as the map isn't excessively big or excessively small, it's fine :)
