I see a lot of Avicus teams picking up OCN players who never play with them. It does not make you better in any way - you will not get carried by a few OCN players who don't play together. It gives a negative impact on the team because they expect to be carried, but the chemistry is terrible. There's a difference between an OCN player who will play with you and then who will never EVER play with you except on a tourney date.&nbsp;<br><br>Please stop, it DOES not help your team in anyway.

Yes, it's all about the chemistry of the team, adding random god OCNers won't improve the team, it will just make it more confusing, strats will be harder to achieve, and there will hardly no chemistry within the team. This is why old teams such as Bad Company, Apollo, PPB have been surviving and is being placed as some of the top tier teams. Due to their chemistry together, knowing each others strengths and weaknesses, they can work on it, figure out the players best position e.g I am Frontliner, Tazz is Rusher, Robin is Defender etc. etc. If one team has decent players, with superb chemistry and then the other team has random gods who don't know each other, I would place my bet on the team with superb chemistry.
