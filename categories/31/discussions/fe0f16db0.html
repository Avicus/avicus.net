Survival games used to be one of my favorites when this was MCZone as well as Skywars; I'd play these two with friends A LOT when they were around. I kinda miss them on here and would like to see them make a return. These two may attract a lot of people and may also offer more options for what to play than what we already have.<br><br>Aside from bringing back games, I have a suggestion for something new-ish: Blitzkrieg. It's basically a quick deathmatch with teams. I know there's Nebula/Nexus/CTH and all but this is a little different. Players could start on a small map and would battle to the death until there is only one team standing. Surely players will take a liking to it because it's intense to play/watch and it's also quick, so players won't get bored and leave instantly and can just wait a minute or two until the next round starts. <br><br>This could be its own thing or it could be implemented with Nexus in map rotations to change it up a little.&nbsp;<br><br>It's fun, it's fast-paced, the games are quick; I think this could work.&nbsp;<br><br>Let me know your opinions.

I'm pretty sure that Survival Games are coming back in the next update. To be honest though, I don't really like the other idea, no offense. It just doesn't seem like it would fit along with the other gamemodes, because as far as I know, most of the other popular gamemodes besides Walls have instant respawn, allowing players to continue to participate instead of leaving after one match. Avicade and Elimination don't have instant respawn, and instead, forces you to wait, and I think that's one of the reasons why they are so unpopular.

Slow down!<br>It is hard to comprehend all these gamemodes.<br><br>Anyway I don't think these gamemodes are a good fit for&nbsp;Avicus.

Sky Wars? Possibly in the future for arcade.<br>Blitzkrieg? Too many servers have coined blitz by now, it's not worth it.

Like JK said, Survival Games is being implemented back on the server in the Avicus Winter/3.0 Update. That's a extra gamemode being added to the server, but the other gamemodes currently like CTH, Elimination have a much lower popularity then gamemodes like Nebula or Nexus. And im pretty sure CTW (Capture The Wool) is being implemented back as well.<br><br>An extra gamemode added to the current gamemodes plus the new ones coming in the new update would be too much.<br><br>Your idea isn't bad, but it's kinda like Nexus with only one death. My personal selection from Nexus and Blitzkrieg would be Nexus. The gamemode you came up with is basically Nexus matches restarting every game. I would rather stay in a game that goes on for a while with kills being counted.
