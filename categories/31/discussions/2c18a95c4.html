How much people are on this empty server? 1-2 people a day?<br>This server haven't seen Mineplex or HighPixel...&nbsp;<br><br>Yet I was banned, I submitted an appeal begging for forgiveness, and It was denied.&nbsp;<br>I don't think this server's goal is to let people enjoy the server. Half the people who play on&nbsp;<br>this server are admins and all they do is ban and ban.&nbsp;<br><br>Then why do these admins spend way too much time designing the website and not to<br>increase the amount of people who play here? Cause their stupid. Plain stupid.<br><br>The Senior Moderator, the most idiot guy, says "You havent been banned long enough.<br>I'll unban you in like... 10 years? " Right below this it says 'You cannot reply...'<br><br>I've been waiting now for like 2 months. And thats not long enough? I think this Mental Moderator is<br>seriously gonna unban me in 10 years, or maybe he won't cause he'll be dead.<br><br>I'm done with this server, Stupid admins Stupid Moderators, Minecraft never wan't you<br>as a server. I want play.mczone.co Back. AVICUS SUCKS!

1. Calm down<br>2. You got banned, stop whining about it<br>3. Our moderators and admins are fine.<br>4. Try harder on your appeal<br>5. This is mczone ._.<br>6.Mods arent mental, when i was banned it took a year for an accepted appeal<br>7. You need to accept your ban, unless it was false<br>8. Our admins are not stupid, they try to make it a good server, if you dont like it then just leave<br>9.we actually try really hard to get more players, it is people like you who ruin the server.<br>10. Somebody please lock this, it serves no purpose.

The staff member never said anything about 10 years. Also, this server tries it's best to keep the community clean from hackers, bullies, etc. if you don't like it, then leave.<br><br>EDIT: And don't even think about calling someone mental.

Maybe you can show some decency instead of blatantly hacking and whining because you couldn't get away with it. The least you could do is be respectful.
