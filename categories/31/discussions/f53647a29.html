&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Im RexNicky and I believe I was wrong fully banned. &nbsp;It was for fly-hacking. &nbsp;I don't own a hacked client or would ever use one on here. &nbsp;This was the first server Ive played on...I join over 2 years ago. &nbsp;During the time I was in a call and was watching a YT video. &nbsp;That made me lag really bad. &nbsp;During the game my account would lock up. &nbsp;That is where I think it was from. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If I am mistaken and you are right I would do anything to get unbanned. &nbsp;I have no proof against it. &nbsp;This server is so much fun and I would hate to leave it. &nbsp;I would do anything at all. &nbsp;I could help catch people or spectate games. &nbsp;Anything!!!! &nbsp;I think you get the point. &nbsp;Thanks for your time. &nbsp;Hope to be able to play Nebula again!<br><br><br>~RexNicky
