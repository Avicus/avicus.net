Ok, so basically, I'm not allowed to tell the truth. Snow locks the topic and doesn't even know that is happening. He doesn't know anything and assumes to know shit. I wanted to tell the community what happened. The reason why Impact didn't show up is because they got ddoesd. They got dddoesd &nbsp;because Michael asked Lance to ddos impact. The reason my topic got archived is because or boy Snow can't face the problems, he makes assumptions and acts up them. My topic didn't need to be archived, it just seems like the staff team are running away from the situation.&nbsp;<ol style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Roboto-Regular, HelveticaNeue, Arial, sans-serif;"><li class="mod" style="margin: 0px; padding: 12px 16px 0px;   "><br></li></ol>

This is why I retired.<br>Sr staff, instead of hiding somewhere, take action and don't let the moderators take care of this. I have seen so many arguments, but the only time you actually respond you got "banter" and "jokes". Like wtf.<br>Close this topic, or atleast lock it. Get together on slack, listen to the players who actually know what they are doing such as jozz, mango and a few others. Take a fucking decision and either demote micheal or do nothing.

They won't, they're just going to pretend nothing is happening and eventually wait until some try hard mod looks this topic and make everyone forget about it. Majority of the seniors are involved in this and they don't want to admit it.

I'd like to agree with the fact that Michael is acting irresponsibly; unfortunately, I can't.<br><br>The evidence is inconclusive; we don't know who said it in the picture, and moreover more of the conversation will probably be needed to actually reach a conclusion.<br><br>@Ambi Can you provide a picture of the chat, with the name of the person clearly shown, along with more of the chat? The more you give, the faster this will go, for sure.
