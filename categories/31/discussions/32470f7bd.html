Just stop throwing staff under the bus. It is annoying me you do not understand how much time they are taking for us. You are taking this for granted, we are lucky to have such honest staff members so be thankful, stop being so&nbsp;stubborn.&nbsp;Realize&nbsp;how much we have compared to some bad&nbsp;server's and be happy for the staff members point out the staffs pro's not only con's.<br><br><br>Best regards, Cezbla<br><br><br>This needs to stop I am feeling like crap not doing something about it, so I made this.<br><br>Please Don't spam about complaints just Skype message the staff member, it spams forums and it personally annoys me a lot.

Sorry for the off topic-ness but why do you always type your posts in italics and bold? It's sort of annoying tbh. On topic, I haven't really seen any disrespect against staff recently, but I haven't been very active on the forums either.

I kinda wouldn't really count that as throwing us under. Annoying to have tons of topics on map selection and how walls is ignored -- yes. But is it disrespectful and throwing the staff under? Not really. Just is feedback.

There are buttons on the top of the box where you make your post that say bold and italic. You can press them to toggle it. If that doesn't work idk :P

I have seen staff disrespect but not in these posts. Like at one point people were all mad at Ivy, back when he was funky, about being gone for a while, and when he got back I made a welcome back post and a bunch of people posted hate on it about how terrible he was and such. I was pissed.

You should know the difference between constructive criticism&nbsp;and "throwing staff under the bus". I don't see anything&nbsp;wrong with that post.

A lot of staff members get hate but I don't think any of them will retire because of it. If you're being rude the staff wont care too much its just making you look bad
