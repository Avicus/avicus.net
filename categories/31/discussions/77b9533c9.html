If you see an infraction that's colored green, that means it is appealed. In your case, it has not been appealed. You're still banned from the server.

damn man, shame to hear this, but yeah answer your question you have not been appealed, because the column in which your infraction has taken place is shaded (slightly) but not green, thus you're screwed...<br>Hopefully ill cya round one day :O

Try using actual grammar.. Its not going to get you unbanned by say "pls" and other unformal abbreviations. Just a tip..

Try not to make too many threads about this, please.<br><br>It'll be <b><u><i>green</i></u></b> if/when you are unbanned. You'll also know if you are unbanned if you are able to get onto the server when you join it. If you can't join, you're still banned. Be patient, you'll be told via the email whether or not you've been unbanned or not.<br><br>Now, you already have another thread, so direct any further questions involving this there, if needed.
