Now don't get me wrong, I am grateful that teams actually have somewhere to play against others, but IMO, reserving scrimmage servers doesn't seem correct to my eyes.<br>With my experience, teams aren't even able to organize a scrimmage outside of the server, and I bet they wont be able to here.<br>I feel like teams should get their own server, at least during tournaments, but that's just me.<br>Discuss or whatever.<br>mfw "dont copy ocn!!!".

Went with this method for a number of reasons:<br><ul><li>Fair and balanced method to get access to a private server. If you're in a tournament or not, you can still rent them out.</li><li>It's centralized. I have a feeling teams will be able to organize because all the info they need is on one page and every player is notified through alerts.</li><li>Maximum efficiency. Teams will only utilize the server for the time that they need. We will be using less server resources by having them occupied by teams when they are needed.</li></ul>

Now, advertise the server so we can actually scrim, we're going through a lack of players as mentioned several times in other posts.

If a team can't organize something as simple as a scrimmage in the frame of 2 hours, then they are going to have some troubles getting to a tournament match...<br><br>We'll be sticking with this method and only making it more open and available in the future. Slot durations will likely increase.

Can you make it so you can book a &nbsp;server which is 12 hours after your last one, not wait 12 hours?

I think 3 reservations every 12 hours fits right now, not a lot of demand. You can reserve three in a row for instance.

There isn't a lot of demand for these scrimmages at the moment, however I am interested in them.<br><br>It's a fine idea, imo.
