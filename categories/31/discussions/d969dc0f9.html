I understand wanting a break totally.<br><br>SUGGESTION: I feel like there should be official announcements on the forums about staff members taking breaks or leaving to clear up some of the confusion that happens when these things occur so everyone is informed quicker and so we know whether it's a temporary or permanent leave.

Please don't make posts like this, if he didn't make a post about him being "demoted", then it's cause he doesn't want to be noticed so, please, try not to make this kind of posts.
