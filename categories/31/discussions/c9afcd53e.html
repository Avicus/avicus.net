Alright, so welcome back to the Staff Spotlights. This time, we've asked&nbsp;<img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/5b700f637ff4400689b73fc21f61239c?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/LFT.html" style="color: #009396">LFT</a> to tell us a bit about himself. He's a long time staff member, and is involved in many different parts of the staff team.<br><br><p class="MsoNormal"><b>Introduce yourself (4
or more sentences)</b> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hey everyone, some of you know me as Robert, but some know
me as LFT. I've played Avicus for almost 4 years now, and originally joined
back when it was known as MC Zone. I've been playing Minecraft for a little
over 5 years now. I am a junior in high school and I plan to be a Marine
Biologist when I am older.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>What are your
hobbies?</b> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My hobbies included, sports (basketball, baseball and football)
&amp; playing video games. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">​<b>What are you most
excited/obsessed over at the moment?</b> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Counter Strike Global Offensive, been playing it almost every
day this past week or so. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>What interests you
the most in life? </b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This might sound dark, but the whole 'death' thing. I've
always wondered how it feels, what happens, where the spirit goes and all of
that. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>What music/art/media
do you like?</b> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Honestly, it depends on the beat that the music is played
on. I usually listen to artists like, 21 savage, lil uzi vert, playboy carti,
xxxtentacion and other artists in the rap genre. ​</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Where are you from?</b>
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Orlando, FL. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>What’s your favourite
thing about moderating?</b> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">For me, its interacting with the community (whether that is
through teamspeak, discord, in-game or the forums) and the ability to joke
around with my fellow staff members. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>What’s your most
memorable experience as a moderator?</b> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I don't think I can pin-point a memorable experience, but I
would say the day I was promoted to Moderator. Also probably the day I was
promoted to Mentor.</p>
