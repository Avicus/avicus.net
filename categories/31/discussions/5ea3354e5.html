Mods encourage ban appeals?

Hello, fellow Avicus forum user!<br>I was thinking of yet another way to stop the spam topics about wanting to be unbanned, even though they've been quite minimal lately, and I came up with this. I didn't have enough characters to fit the whole idea in the title (Ivy really needs to work on that..), so it might be a little misleading.<br>Pretty much, the idea is before mods ban someone, they say "*player name*" "email support@avicus.net to appeal your ban." This will not be on all bans, only bans the mods find necessary to include this in (long temp-bans or permanent bans). This will stop a lot of confusion and make the player feel more comforted due to it coming from an experienced moderator instead of having to search through the forums to try and find how to appeal.&nbsp;<br>I know this may decrease efficiency a tad, but I feel like it would comfort worried players.<br>If you have any ideas, criticism, or approval, please comment below!

Yes. The appeal system is illogical and overcomplicated.

After you are banned it says:<br><br>Appeal your ban and support@avicus.net<br>You have been banned by [Mod]<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Reason:<br>[reason]<br><br>Or something like that

It would be much easier if they had all of that set up online, similar to the way OCN does.

On Avicus when you are banned it sends to the email.<br>On OCN when you are banned you are linked to a page on the website, from there you can choose which punishments you would like to appeal (Warns, kicks or bans) And it allows you to give a reason as to why you are appealing, from there the moderator who punished you will respond.<br><br>From what I've heard warns and kicks cannot be appealed on Avicus, this needs to be changed.

Honestly, do you really want a warn appealed? Sounds like kind of a waste of time.

I would, I'd rather appeal a false punishment than be banned for, say, spawnkilling three times. It's worth it, and I know people who've been warned for the stupidest of things, and they can't do anything about it.

I would understand if you would want Nolan's sweating kick removed, but what are the chances of being kicked 3 times for spawnkilling falsely.

I am trying to get kicks and warns appealable.<br><br>Having an online appeal system would require us to change our authentication system, since you have to be able to go on in-game to register, which you can't if you're banned.<br><br>'E-mail support@avicus.net to appeal' needs to be in the ban message, like on old Avicus.

It's all about that one time. Once is a warn, twice is a kick, the third time would be another kick or ban. If you appeal that first warn, you've managed to stop yourself getting banned.

You can appeal the temp bans and bans, though.

What if you don't need to deal with it? The chances of being falsely kicked/warned enough to get you tempbanned is very unlikely.

Warns can definitely affect a players reputation, and can land them a tempban if excessive enough.<br><br>We're planning on adding appealing for kicks and warns, so this should be solved.

You sign in with your ocn account if you've made one, or if you haven't you just type your username and if the IP your browser is using matches the IP you're account is/was(?) using, it lets you appeal like that.<br><br>Once you do that you that you check your punishment you want to appeal and dd a comment.<br><img alt="" src="http://i.gyazo.com/a5c7ba7905e4a7a698420300e2f48642.png"><br>Then you can comment, escalate(dunno what dis does), and the mod that punished you can close the appeal, comment, and unban/lower your ban time.
