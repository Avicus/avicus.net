Hey Guys! Today I made this post to ask you guys know how to cool off a laptops fan? Whenever I'm playing games (Sometimes I don't even play the games) My laptop gets REALLY hot...<br>By hot I mean you can stand 4-5 feet away and feel the heat... Only on the left side where the cooler is.<br>I have had this problem for a bit but I'm getting more and more peeved everyday (1 of my USB's are broken, another one of my USB's work only 1/4 of the time and my third USB works 24/7), so an external keyboard is possible but really hard to get it to work... <br>So if you guys have any knowledge please tell me down below how to fix this :) A replacement of my fan might not be appropriate since I'm sure my parents won't send it out for repair and I don't really have the money to do that or the knowledge to replace a laptop fan (only know for desktops).<br>Any help will probably be good help, please don't give false info that will screw my computer up unless I want to replace my components after...<br><br>I have an Acer Aspire v3.<br><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/58HOssT.jpg"><br>Thanks guys! Have a nice day! :)

Elevation, cooling mats, try to not block the fan, you could try changing the power setting, maybe compressed air to get out dust? No clue, :P. Good luck.

Well I don't know how well they work but in Ontario Dollar Store sells cooling mats. Worth a try. :P

This is why you never go to with AMD stock coolers... Ever.

Cooling pads do work but they are hardly ever truly necessary. Usually its people getting distracted and not positioning their laptop in a way that gives their laptop enough air. If you used to do this but no longer do so you may have damaged your laptop in a way that you would certainly need a cooling station. I played games on a laptop throughout highschool before I got my first true gaming computer. Good maintenance and awareness from the user make your laptops outlive their expected lives. If the heat is as dramatic as you say I'd follow up with Tarheelkiwi's logic :)

If you can somehow afford it, upgrade you're laptop to liquid cooling. Good luck! :]

The fan may be very dusty. I would ge a can of compressed air (they are quite cheap) and blow into the fan. Make sure to do it outside though.

Buy some dust spray, (Compressed air in a can) and spray it in the fan. That helped my brother out a load. Also, take out the fan and dust it.
