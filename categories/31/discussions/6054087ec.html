There is a hack called "No Down Slown" what it does is that when you take the bow tensioning can run normally, as happens when you're eating, etc. .. I was wondering if permitted

Translating is okay guys, That trick and what I'm seeing in Nebula, and Much, ES trick UN That Makes No Detengas te, is say, if you bow taut, you CAN run average, same if you put the sword when you're protecting, ASI Even CAN run.<br><br>Translating is good guys? This trick is what I'm seeing in Nebula and a lot of ES trick and UN. That makes no difference I say. If you hold your bow you can run normally and the same if you left click with your sword to protect. ASI even can run.&nbsp;<br><br>UN=??<br>ES=??<br>ASI=??<br><br>Enjoy the translation :D<br><br>I think he says he wants the mod to be allowed because it makes no difference?

Is that Mexican?Anyway I will reply this in Spanish,it seems like Spanish to me...<br>Si esto es un truco, no será tolerado en este servidor y recibirá una prohibición, si se trata de un problema técnico, no abusar de ella, ya sea o se le prohibió también.

Translate is well guys, this trick already what I am seeing in nebulo, 
and much, UN IS trick that does not stop the tea, that is to say, if you
 have the arc tension, you can run your normal, just like if you put the
 sword When You'RE Protecting , run YOU CAN yet.<br><br>thats what babylon came up with...

Its a hack that doesn't give you any slowdown.<br>For Example: Eating food in minecraft while running. The running keeps going.<br>For Example: Shooting bows while running. Still running.

Don't use google translate. I was talking to BlueBerryWaffle7 (remember him?) on another server in French (He speaks French) and Google Translate messed up and said something like "A beaver smoothie would aim" or something

Blueberry speaks french? I didn't hear anything from him that he spoke french... Cool xD<br><br>Now back on topic, yes, Google Translate does suck if you're trying to translate a whole paragraph. The translations almost always not make sense.

I understand the benefits, but that almost seems bad to me..<br>If you're having a sniper war and you're right near a cliff, you might press forward to adjust your shot and fall off.. It would also be really hard to get used to because you're used to adjusting your shot while slowly moving.&nbsp;<br>That's one derpy hack, my friend xD
