You were swearing, and the staff member who dealt the punishment was correct.&nbsp;<br><br>Breaking the rules will cause unwanted infractions.

You making spammy threads on the forums doesn't make me side with you, so I don't really care wether you're going to pretend you didn't swear or not, it doesn't make a difference.

If you're not pleased with your infraction, you can email support@avicus.net to try to appeal it.

A warning isn't really a big deal. It's a small infraction and will hardly affect anything. You can email support@avicus.net with an appeal to attempt to remove it.

I don't think warns should show up on infraction lists, just saying.

I highly doubt you're receiving warnings for no reason. As long as you abide by the rules, you'll be fine :D
