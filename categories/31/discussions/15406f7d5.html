In light of recently being promoted to Administrator, we felt that giving&nbsp;<img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/31f2ccc2c0779b0e5e2c4d8cd7cc3701?s=20&amp;default=mm" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/Camemes.html" style="color: none">Camemes</a> this staff spotlight was a a pretty cool idea. With that being said, I'll allow him to introduce himself.<br><br><div><b>Introduce yourself (4 or more sentences)</b></div><div>Heyo, I'm Cammy, I'm 14, 15 in August, and I'm also admin now so that's cool. I'm currently in year 9 in high school so that's cool. I've been apart of the staff team for about 18-19 months now. Apart from that idk what to put here lol.</div><div><br></div><div><b>What are your hobbies?</b></div><div>I'm really passionate about volleyball, I've been playing for about 2 years now and I really enjoy the sport. Any spare time I have outside of school or studying is spent practicing/training. For anyone who knows volleyball terminology, I play back court but can also play opposite if needed.</div><div><br></div><div><b>​What are you most excited/obsessed over at the moment?</b></div><div>I'm really excited for the volleyball state trials soon. I've been working towards trying to make the state team recently. That's pretty much it lol</div><div><br></div><div><b>What interests you the most in life?</b></div><div>I've always been interested in biology. Human anatomy and the way the human body works is truly fascinating and just adds to the complexity that is human life.</div><div><br></div><div><b>What music/art/media do you like?</b></div><div>It depends on what I'm doing or my mood. If I'm studying or just need quiet, I put on some classical music. Recently I've been getting into nightcore music so send help xd</div><div><br></div><div><b>​Where are you from?</b></div><div>Like I said earlier, I'm from Australia. If you really care, south east Queensland.</div><div><br></div><div><b>What’s your favourite thing about being a staff member?</b></div><div>Being able to work with a bunch of different people from different places. It's one of the main reasons I'm still here is the diversity in our community.</div><div><br></div><div><b>What excites you the most about becoming an Administrator?</b></div><div>Being able to do more for the server. The ability to work with more people and do more to help out.</div><div><br></div><div><b>What’s your most memorable experience as a staff member?</b></div><div>Too many to count. There aren't really any standout memories that I can think of. If you're ever interested in hearing my stories of wisdom, pm me and we can have story time with papa camemes. xd</div>
