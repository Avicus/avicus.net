So basically I'm making this post in frustration - every time we reserve a scrim server to play on we have to wait between 10 - 30 minutes before it opens.&nbsp;<img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/7105f76bb4b94fe4bbdb980962d4b7a9?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/Patrikano.html" style="color: none">Patrikano</a> today asked 2 devs for answer for why this happens, but he didn't get any good information at all.&nbsp;<br><br>If avicus somehow decide to shut down the scrim servers in the following months, I guarantee that half of the players will quit, me included.

I've had the same problem, I've asked and asked developers what's wrong, haven't gotten anything..&nbsp;<br>I don't think they are planning on shutting them down, but some issues are definitely &nbsp;definitely happening atm.

Ugh I know right, spoke with a Dev today. I got the reply 'It will open soon'<br><br>It opened at 6:30pm GMT when the scrim server was reserved from 6pm GMT - 8pm GMT.

In the past, the scrim servers have always opened 5-10 mins after the written opening time. However, no matter how long its been going on, its an issue and it needs to be addressed.

I believe this problem is more recent, I've never had a scrim server open late before, so it hasn't been going on for that long
