With this feature, public players will not have to worry about who's inactive and who's on leave because there's an actual thread for it. Make it so&nbsp;<b>they do not have a reason &nbsp;to take an LOA</b>, therefore the privacy is containable. If seniors need to know what the LOA is for, they can just PM the certain staff member through a private platform. This will really help show the players who's on leave!<br><br><br><i>Discuss</i>

I think he meant users not staff members. Or, if we don't have to provide a reason for leaving, we might abuse that.

When admins decided to do this last time, players would type up messages and responses on the thread, which would be pretty annoying. I'll only agree with this if it's made so only staff members can type on it.

There is no reason to attempt to argue this point. We tried doing this once before and the community showed that they can't handle the privilege of it so it got taken away. Point blank period.

oh i think i've misunderstood the situation just a bit. i was under the impression that they would make a thread and tell people who's gone, but now i realize that the staff actually have a super secret thread where they post about those leaves of absence and discuss them or whatever. i really don't care about whatever dumb staff banter is going on there, so it can stay private for all i care. what i just want is a place (possibly a thread) where they can tell us who is on """"leave""""" so i don't have to go around accusing staff members of being """"inactive""""" only to find out they're on """"leave"""""""".

No, the technology and code isn't there but if you would like to learn to code and put yourself in the dev shoes and try to figure it out go right ahead. I mean, since you know so much about the staff team.

I don't see the point in this. It seems like unnecessary work for the seniors to maintain a leave-of-absence thread, since it's not exactly vital for the community to know who's on break and who isn't.

So... How would knowing whether or not they are on leave help anybody? Having inactive moderators would not prevent more moderators from being promoted.

What would even change? If you are currently able to ask a moderator whether or not somebody is on leave, that gives you the same level of information that a public leave thread would. I still don't see a good reason to have a public thread.

You cannot base activity information on punishments. It happens quite often that there are multiple staff members online, and either some of them take most of the punishments, or there are simply barely any rule-breakers during the staff member's online time.

I'll be honest, I'm probably one of the least active moderators on the team, but think of it this way, the staff team is already low and would be even lower with demotions. <br><br>Would it be better that I retire and punish 0 <br>players a week, or stay in the team and take care of 5 a week? Some is better than none. That's why I hate to see fellow moderators retire due to inactivity, it they still hop on 2x a week, it won't negate the staff team, all it can do is put a small positive effect.&nbsp;<br><br>In fact, for any retired staff members reading this, I encourage you to talk to a senior about returning to the staff team, even if you can only come on 2x a week.

it's not like they're putting a gps on the mods and having their location publically available on the forums, it's just "oh so-and-so is on leave for the next two weeks". not sure how you'd exploit that but if you can come up with a way feel free to share it instead of just saying that people will exploot it.

So and so's personal reasons are funny, HAHAHAHA!&nbsp;<br><br>As a former staff member, I can say that most people that post their LOA's wouldn't want them public. Most of them are relatively private matters. Moreover, if you wanna make them public you'd have to get every staff to agree. I certainly wouldn't have wanted people reading about things that I LOA'd for seeing as that some were pretty personal.<br><br>"but if you can come up with a way feel free to share it instead of just saying that people will exploot it." First of all spell exploit right, then I have the right to make whatever point I fucking want. I have been staff for almost 2 years, I have seen literally everything. This has happened in the past for this specific reason. You know what happened? It got abused and taken down after 2 weeks or so.

gee whiz you seem to have totally missed the part where i never said that there had to be reasons along with the leave of absence. the ONLY information that should be provided in the public thread should be the staff member's name and the duration of the leave, which negates basically all you said. here's an example of the info that i want provided in a public LOA thread:<br>staff dude: that guy<br>leave duration: 2/17/17-2/17/18<br><br>i would love to see how you think this can be exploited, since you've seen """""everything"""", but yet again you dodged the question. are you at a loss? is it impossible to exploit?<br><br>also good job attacking my spelling instead of my arguments, sadly i had to turn off autocorrect because it would always make everything all caps for some reason

1) Thats not how staff LOA's work. You list what parts of the server you cant access, the duration of your leave, and then&nbsp;<b>the reason.&nbsp;</b>Giving reason as to why you cant come on is the most important part of the process. By making a public LOA thread you get rid of the private one. Hence, why removing the reasoning wont work. Having&nbsp;<i>two</i> documents is counter productive and would get very cluttered very fast.<br><br>2) First off, you can fuck right off. &nbsp;Read my response "They will always use things to their own benefit.

i still don't think you understand. there's a private LOA thread where the staff post about their leaves and absences and whatnot, and then there's a public thread (locked and stickied) that'll have a big 'ol table with staff names and the durations of their leaves which'll be edited as the need be by whoever maintains the thread (and that snow guy already volunteered)<br>so to summarize:<br>*two threads<br>*one has staff posting their leaves and reasons (staff only)<br>*one just has a list of who's on leave (maintained by one or more staff members)<br><br>as to your answer to the "exploits" question only addresses a situation with one public leave of absence thread,&nbsp;<i>not</i> the LOA thread solution i'm trying to advocate<br><br>also, would it be possible to be more condescending lol

Adding onto this, there really isn't any reason not to have a public LOA thread, and Posighdun even agreed that it was a decent idea. The idea will certainly be forwarded to the senior staff if it hasn't been already so that we can get a final verdict.<br><br><br>@OP: In the past, one of the reasons as to why having the LOA thread went public then was private again is because non-staff kept posting their LOAs onto the thread. Of course, some of the LOAs were jokes, but plenty of people took it as a public LOA for all players rather than staff. This can easily be avoided by simply locking the thread then allowing staff to edit in their LOAs into the OP so that all of the information is compiled into one post rather than several posts/pages. <a href="https://avicus.net/forums/discussions/636b98fcb?page=3#reply357965" rel="nofollow" title="Link: https://avicus.net/forums/discussions/636b98fcb?page=3#reply357965">Aphelion had the same idea</a>, and I don't see any problems with that whatsoever. Some people do believe that the information can be used by players with malicious intent to do various things (what those things are is unknown to me), but that is something that can be sorted out behind-the-scenes. At the very least, the pros definitely outweigh the cons.

you are wayyyyy exaggerating how difficult it would be to make one extra thread and keep it updated. other than like 10 minutes to first set up the formatting and whatnot it'll take like 5 seconds to update it every time someone new goes on leave. unless there's like a billion staff going on leave every week the time commitment is extremely negligible. plus i don't see why the ever-busy seniors need to maintain the thread if there's plenty of kisass mods like snow willing to do the """"heavy"""" work. it's not as if it's so difficult and such a huge responsibility to maintain that only seniors can do it

It isn't rocket science. Just make a post, only staff can edit and update it whenever, it can't be easier. That post where you congratulate new staff is just obnoxiously messy.

The last time the admins did something like this some random started posting onto it and it was annoying to deal with. If we are doing something, (I believe the admins are/might do something) we are not doing what happened last time and actually having a full plan on it.
