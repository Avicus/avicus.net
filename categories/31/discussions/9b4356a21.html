Hi guys,<br><br>I've been noticing cth <b>(Control the Hill)</b> has been becoming<br>more popular ever since the update. If you haven't tried<br>he game out, I recommend you do, since it is a very fun<br>game. I am not trying to advertise, but I want to encourage<br>everyone to try it out because I feel like not many people&nbsp;<br>have played it before.<br><br>Thanks xx<br><br>Let me know what you think about <b>CTH</b>, I really would<br>like to know<br><br>sorry if this is a weird post xD

This game used to be pretty popular a while ago, so it's pretty good to see it slowly reviving. I'm also amongst that small group of people that'll play CTH whenever possible. +1

Kinda sad that it took until now for people to play CTH. It was one of the only gamemodes I played since I joined the server.&nbsp; Glad people have finally started to enjoy it.

Yeah, it's nice to have a match open most of the time. It's a year overdue for a map update, so we should get to that =P

I'm glad CTH (I said TS on accident -_-) started to get more people. Some of the regular CTH players have started playing again

I believe I preferred it with the good old fashioned unlocks, but It's still great fun &amp; I'm really glad to see It's rise to popularity again :D

Control the Hill and Capture the Wool are the best gamemodes IMO. I'm glad that it is gaining more attention.

I believe CTH has the flat hit glitch.<br>Also with Demo in it can you get tnt and a grenade whenever you kill someone?

Demo would then be way too OP. It'd just be continuously blowing up low health players from the side line.

That's a good point, but demo does not have enough tnt/grenades IMO.

It's borderline OP as it is. And that's saying a lot because it was recently nerfed.

DTM was just such a good game for me, I never really wanted to switch to other games, but when I tried it this update, I don't know why I wasn't hooked on it a year ago when I first tried it. Love this game!

I like CTH because you can kill 75% on those maps and not 50% like nexus
