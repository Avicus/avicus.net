<div>I'm confused, why is it offensive/bad?<br></div><div><br></div><div>People get offended when you say "black" as in the color... Or when an African American person attacks a police officer and gets up being shot. The n-word is different, because it was a term used by whites to describe slaves, and can be legitimately very offensive. "Beaner" is just a term for people with OP ping, I see nothing wrong with it. I'm not voting just yet, because I'm curious, but I see no reason for it to be a rule. It seems like a stretch to make it against the rules. It's not said to be offensive or mean in any way. It's just a term.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Edit:</b> Just to add to this. If anything beaner is a good thing. It means you're good at PVP and bridging, and have OP ping. I don't see how it's offensive, but if someone could explain it that'd be great.<br></div>

It really depends on the context...<br><br>I can call my homeboy Sayah a beaner and he won't wet himself crying over it cause he knows I'm not using it to be racist towards him and mock his ethnicity.<br><br>Then there's when it is used to describe&nbsp;Sagrevyum or the old Ethernal Cross - "Hacking beans" (Oh did I say that out loud) and yes, after about a dozen of their members <b>FROM EACH TEAM</b>&nbsp;getting banned for cheating, I feel that calling them "Hacking beans" is pretty fucking appropriate.<br><br>As for anyone else who's just being racist for no reason (And you can easily distinguish this) can just get punished, it's a form of bullying. This form here should be punishable.<br><br>Don't ban everyone for saying "Bean" or "Beaner" - look at its context first plz

An opinion is more important in this case, but like everyone else said it depends on the context. 99% of the time it's fine, and there's no racism or offensiveness. The times that it's not, aren't even that bad. On Avicus the term "beaner" has another meaning then on Google. I see what you're saying but the context on Avicus vs. in the real world is very different. On Avicus the ping on beaners is OP, so we call them that. There's no racism involved, it's like a joke that's true, but still a joke. A good example of this is the Trump jokes. We all know they are true but they're still jokes. It's not offensive in any way.

So if the majority of the server were to be fine to use the term nigger, would we allow to call everyone niggers because the majority of the server is in favor?

It's definition is "a Mexican or a person of Mexican descent". How is this a fact of it being rude? It's a Mexican, its not offensive in any way in my opinion. Your post basically is saying it is no different then calling them a Mexican.

If you also look, it states right after "informal" it says "Offensive".<br>The definition states it's an informal offensive noun.<br>The definition of it may seem nice and clean, but the word itself is an offensive noun.<br><br>If you don't know what a noun is:<br><img src="https://i.gyazo.com/07b2d65865aecd1abe819ea746b963dd.png" title="Image: https://i.gyazo.com/07b2d65865aecd1abe819ea746b963dd.png">

True, it's still not nearly as bad as saying the n-word. The n-word doesn't have a good meaning, where beaner does, comparing those two words doesn't really work. I understand that it could be offensive if used in certain context, but it's not always offensive. <br><br>Also it seems like people are arguing about whether the word is offensive or not, instead of it being allowed. As far as the rules go, I don't think it should be a rule, unless in certain contexts made to be offensive or racist.

Okay. You don't understand my point. The n-word is not allowed because it's original meaning was a African American slave. Not just a African American person. There's a huge difference between the two.

Beaner is a term for Latinos. It has almost nothing to do with Minecraft, it's just a general term people use and since the Lantino community is so big in MC it's used a lot.<br><br>@OP Beaner isn't an offensive term. Some people might suggest it's a translation to the n word just for Latinos but I don't think there is an offensive reason people call Latinos beaner. The n word is totally different though, since there is an offensive reason.<br><br>EDIT: Beaner comes from the food beans.

Compliment or not I don't think it should be allowed to be said. If you want to compliment someone on their pvp skills, there are other words to use instead of an offensive term like beaner. Calling someone smart because they are asian, or calling a smart person an asian is a compliment too, but some people still take offense to it. Just an opinion :}

<div>I'm confused, why is it offensive/bad?<br></div><div><br></div><div>People get offended when you say "black" as in the color... Or when an African American person attacks a police officer and gets up being shot. The n-word is different, because it was a term used by whites to describe slaves, and can be legitimately very offensive. "Beaner" is just a term for people with OP ping, I see nothing wrong with it. I'm not voting just yet, because I'm curious, but I see no reason for it to be a rule. It seems like a stretch to make it against the rules. It's not said to be offensive or mean in any way. It's just a term.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Edit:</b> Just to add to this. If anything beaner is a good thing. It means you're good at PVP and bridging, and have OP ping. I don't see how it's offensive, but if someone could explain it that'd be great.<br></div>

I'm a beaner and I don't have OP ping, I think beaners are just Spanish speakers.

The term "beaner" or "bean" is pretty huge in MC. Unless you're calling someone a "dumb bean" or something, there's really no issue imo. I don't really see the point in caring about people insulting you over a game made for 10-year-olds in the first place, but yeah. It's the internet, not everywhere can be a safe space quite honestly. It's about how the Latino community feels about it though. As much as I don't think people should care all that much, it's also about trying to be welcoming to different communities at this point to get players on Avicus. It's also easy to just not say it, though it may suck or whatever.<br><br>EDIT: Just trying to add general discussion, take this however you want.
