Due to the changes in enforcement of Mojang's EULA, as an operating Minecraft server we must provide purchase history for each user. In order to do this I wrote a script that runs through all the purchases and logs information regarding each one.&nbsp;<b>If you had purchased a rank on MC Zone and upgraded on Avicus to a higher rank your rank may be missing&nbsp;</b>as the script does not know of any purchases prior to Avicus. Please contact support@avicus.net with evidence of your purchases if you are missing your rank. There are other situations where you may be missing a rank as well, so don't hesitate to contact support if you are unsure.<br><br>The purchase history page will be added in the next website update.

@IvyCode Thank you for the reply, just a quick question, I really liked that video of the avicore video on the Avicus channel, I think if you guys posted some more videos, we would get some more people just by YouTube, I think a video series could be a minigame then like what its about or something, just a suggestion bye!

This post is in the "Admin Blog", it's fine to bump as long as it's not spam, as it appears this issue is still going on.<br><br>@borgoyne<br>You will need to contact a Manager or Director with proof of your rank purchase from your PayPal account.
