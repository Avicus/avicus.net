Hey guys Canuck here! As some of you know, I will be off of avicus for a while.. sadly. But, my forums activities will remain frequent. Today I'm giving out another discussion starter! Today's topic is about American football, and your preferences about the game. Personally I'm a Packers and a 49ers fan. Yes I enjoy to watch&nbsp;<b>both</b> teams. The reason that I decided to bring this topic up is because I have been analyzing many of the games and watching them if I get the time. Todays question is, What is your opinion on American football?<br><br>Also include:<br><ul><li>If you do, what is your favorite team/player</li><li>Do you think college football is cool?</li><li>Do you know what the NFL is?</li></ul>I hope this creates a lot of fun! Can't wait to hear your responses!<br><br>&nbsp;Happy Holidays!

I do know what the NFL is, however I'm not too interested in college football. My favorite team is the Pittsburgh Steelers, always has and always will. My favorite player has to be Cam Newton, he's my inspiration.

American Football isn't popular in New Zealand at all.<br>I have no idea what the rules are or what team to root for.

Can you please stop putting random things on the forums that are irrelevant to what people write? No offense, some of your past comments on my posts have been pretty rude/annoying, and have made the conversation turn around into something other than what it was supposed to be.
