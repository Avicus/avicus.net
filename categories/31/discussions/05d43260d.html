I submit online reports quite alot, and more often than not, It gets locked with "This would only warrant a warn."<br>I then feel really bad and as if I'm wasting moderators time<br><br>Question: Should me/the community not report people if they'd only get a warn/kick or should we still do it?

You're not wasting our time, firstly.<br><br>To answer the question; I would report them anyway.<br>How would you know what is a warn, kick, tempban or a ban (unless you're a staff member).<br><br>We look (Well, I do); look at the previous infractions on the player. If we find that they were breaking the rules on numerous occasions, they would be given a lengthy punishment. If I were you, report them anyway :)

I'd go to&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://avicus.net/[Person]?tab=infractions">http://avicus.net/[Person]?tab=infractions</a>&nbsp;<br>If it was chat related and they already had a kick or a warn, I'd report it.
