I'd like to start this update by wishing you all a very Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays. I hope the best for your families and that you enjoy this season. This update, keep in mind, is a personal one, created without the aid of Para, meaning every opinion expressed in this thread is my own.&nbsp;<br><br>I'd like to apologize for my (ahem) somewhat extended leave of absence. This time of year has always been the busiest for me, and I understand that the community has not been happy with my activity. For the last few days, I was on vacation, meaning I had no access to any of Avicus' services, and although the staff team was made aware of my imminent leave, the community was not.&nbsp;<br><br>I am sure that most of you are aware of the situation that occurred a day or so ago. As an Administrator, I'm proud that most of you were able to handle this situation with some form of maturity, but aside from this, I'm generally unhappy about this situation. I believe this whole situation was unneeded and shouldn't have happened at all, but it no longer matters now.<br><br>Also, if you haven't noticed, Evo was promoted to senior moderator. Congrats to him!<br><br>Have a Merry Christmas.
