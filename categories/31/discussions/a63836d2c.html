this may be just Minecraft but recently i was just playing and grabbing the monument, as i did i covered myself up. Then The thing that was covering me despawned then i died.... Id like a solution for this annoying glitch, if you cant fix it, its ok i guess me and others have to deal with it.

Pretty sure it's just blocklag. It could also possibly be a huge lag spike where you were able to place blocks, then your client refreshes and it shows that you were killed during the lag spike.
