So today I was going to log onto Avicus, then it said "You have been banned for hack evading" -_- ??<br>So uhh.. Yeah, I guess this is 'goodbye' for now until something happens where you can buy a unban. (which probably wont happen.) So.. Yeah. I guess its goodbye for now :) If there is anyway I can get unbanned, Please notify me.

Nvm scratch the post above me.<br><br>99250 recorded a guy named (idefk what it is too complicated ._.) for hacking.<br><br>APPARENTLY they did an IP check or something and found that account linked to yours. Idk if it's true but according to the magical IP checker it is.<br><br>So you went on the account and hacked, only to come back to your legit account and play 4 realz.<br><br>Im really lost.

This is clearly discussion over whether you should have been banned or not rather than a goodbye post. Please email support@avicus.net to appeal.
