Ok so basically have media actually considered that it can be distracting to join a team channel halfway through a game? like if it was me it would piss me off especially if something is intense is happening and you need to be able to hear eachother. Maybe you could just have another identity in each team channel and mute and unmute it instead of constantly joining and leaving. would be alot better<br><br><br><br>oh and i didnt have permission to post in server feedback idk why

Don't really see it as 'distracting' as no one has ever complained about it before until just now.

Because Media has never joined team channels midway through a match.<br>I know this because I was on the media team before.

Wrong. The last tourney I was switching through team channels. But I think you should have 2 TeamSpeaks open 1 for commentating in media streaming room and another and just choose 1 team room.

The past two tournaments I have streamed I've switched through channels. I can understand it being 'distracting' if more than 2 people join but its unlikely for it to be more than that.

<div>Looks like another thing to complain about that isn't needed. I heard "User entered your channel" a bunch of times during my matches and we ignored it.</div>

On the ocn mumble, there's the team channel a<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Slate Pro';  ">nd there's also a "listen in" channel if you want to listen to the players. When joining that listen in channel, the players don't get any notifications nor do they get distracted‎</span>
