No, it's an unofficial rank. Means no ingame or forums rank. It's just like people that want to write articles for the facebook page and/or the twitter account.<br><br>EDIT: Ty xD

I would just like to add on to what res said. While this is not an official rank, this is part of the official social media of Avicus. We would like some more content on our Social Media, so what you would do as a community writer would be basically publish a column as frequently as you want about stuff going on on Avicus.

The media rank is for players that stream the tournament and from what I know it's an tourney only rank.<br>Additional it's just a group of people managing the facebook page and twitter account.

Not sure if Avicus owns an Instagram account. I'll ask Kylo.<br><b>EDIT:&nbsp;</b>There are some instagram accounts around, but no official one.<br>For now we'll focus on Twitter and Facebook.

Honestly,<div>Instagram would be a much better route to take than Twitter or Facebook. Instagram, Snapchat, and Pinterest are the most marketable social media platforms (just my opinion) because you can get a MUCH bigger fan base, plus there are easily hundreds of thousands of MC players on those. I believe you should really be focusing on a platform like Instagram, where you could post pictures of sales, videos of cool things to do on Avi, merch, and other cool gaming stuff in general.&nbsp;</div><div>On Instagram it's about... 100x easier (not even exaggerating, lol) to gain followers too. You can follow 50 people every 15 minutes, at a limit of about a thousand a day. If you follow from other big Minecraft server account's "Followers" section, you can gain about 500 followers from every thousand followed (I'm not making this up, I've run two Instagram accounts just like this, along with a Twitter and Facebook account) which means in a week you could easily have 3500 followers. If 3500 people were seeing how cool Avicus was, there'd be at LEAST 2000 people playing Avicus in one week.&nbsp;<br>On Twitter, you can follow as many people you like at a time as long as it's less than a thousand a day. But out of those thousand, about 5 percent notice you. It's INCREDIBLY hard to grow. There's also far less REAL accounts on Twitter, and people care so much more about Instagram. On twitter it would just be like "Oh yay another MC server following me" (again, same with Facebook) because, I don't know about you guys, but I don't CARE nearly as much about my Twitter or Facebook as I do Instagram, and Instagram's content is SO EASY TO MAKE.</div><div>And that's my rant. :)<br><br>EDIT:&nbsp;</div><div>There is a following limit of 7000 people on Instagram, and you can only unfollow 50 per 15 minutes too. Still, I followed 7000 people on twitter/facebook and got about 300 followers back. None of them were actually interested. Look at my work on Instagram for yourself:</div><div><a href="https://instagram.com/pip.gaming/" title="Link: https://instagram.com/pip.gaming/">https://instagram.com/pip.gaming/</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; (Stopped because I quit working for the company)<br><a href="https://instagram.com/stuffonmycatshead/">https://instagram.com/stuffonmycatshead/</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;(Took me one week, I'm planning on starting this up again soon)<br>This was my Twitter one&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/pipgaming">https://twitter.com/pipgaming</a>&nbsp;(Please note the "2 likes" :)<br><br></div>
