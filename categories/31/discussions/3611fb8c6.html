I see this affecting a lot of the big servers because most of them sell pets which would cause them to be reselling the game.

If Mojang does go through with this I suppose it might end up with mass refunds. 
Or if the servers take Mojang to court they might be given some lee way to the fact that the rule wasn't enforced/well known.

I personally don't think it will be taken to court but the rule is clearly stated in the terms of service.

There's a gray area in law (can't remember the name for it). If a rule isn't enforced it can be overlooked and such. So if this was going on openly, by many servers for months. In court Mojang could be overruled seeing as they never enforced their rule.

I wouldn't think so because they are not selling any part of the game.

Donations aren't really sales,they are just donations that just keeps the server running,and in return,the donator gets extra perks as a thanks for donating and helping to keep the server up and running,it benefits the entire community for that matter,it's not really considered a sale in my perspective.

Aye, the person who came up with 'donations' for servers, probably made them 'donations' because they already knew about mojang's rule.... its just donate... and if you do... you get a gift!<br>

They describe saying that they cannot sell something like diamonds on a server which was created by Mojang however most things servers sell are not minecraft items rather than custom commands created by the server owner.

Almost every server I've been on has rank sales, item sales, and all of that good stuff. &nbsp;If Mojang enforces this they're going to go downhill because almost every server does it. &nbsp;It seems like they get greedier as time flies. And I'm 100% sure Mojang has known that this has been happening. Why haven't they already stopped it?&nbsp;

But like, would it apply to us then? Technically they're donating this money in exchange for unlocking certain things, which can kinda be considered selling?

As the people said in the video, Mojang would most likely only target larger servers who are actually making a profit and are using this as a source of revenue (Mineplex, Hive, TheNexus, etc). At the moment, they would have no reason to come after us because of the fact that we are measly paying off how much the server cost. I understand where they are going with this. It makes sense that they don't want people making an additional profit off of their game.

originally this is an issue because imagine it yourself the commands avicus or other servers are selling are the property of mojang, Also these commands were by default available for the people who purchase Minecraft at first .. Sure bukkit commands were added that's considered a tool and also &nbsp;note that bukkit to is free.. so there would be violation of the copyright issued by mojang.. but still I don't think it would raise such a high intensity problem.. Also someone said that making an Un official DLC's&nbsp;were permitted, belive me its not I have worked with&nbsp;COD project like alterrev and 4D1 and in the end activision shut us down .. therefore the decision renderd by the mojang network would be lawfull and would be quite precise and I am sure hoping they do not destroy this fine community,

It's&nbsp;<b>like</b> an unofficial DLC because it's not originally apart of the game, therefore, not falling directly underneath the terms of service.<br>If Avicus were buying plugins made by other people and selling the commands it might be a problem, but since Avicus have coded their own stuff and it's theirs by right. They have the right to sell it.
