Allot of Nebula maps are in Latin or have some Latin/Greek origin(ex: Proelium,Ternio ect.). Even 3 servers names apply:<br>&nbsp;Luna (moon) Cronus(Father of Zeus, king titan, his name is Greek for time), and Icarus, who was the name of the son of Daedalus the inventor.<br>So who started &nbsp;this? Where did this tradition began? (not that i have anything against this i think its cool)

Ooh! A question I can answer!<br><br>It started with Haribo98/ParaPenguin with Ternio. Ternio is Latin for the number three, which is the number of monuments.<br><br>Was continued by G_SKIPPY with Quintus, which by the way was initially called Ternio 2, until ParaPenguin informed him that Ternio was Latin for three, so G_SKIPPY called it Quintus, which is Latin for five.

Latin names just sound more fascinating than normal English names, which is why most players give their maps such names.

Senex as well: (Old man) I was thinking of asking permission from the senex builders if I could make a map called iuvenis (young man) and make it maybe smaller or something.EDIT: If I got permission, I would probably just refresh it and make it newer

There are very few english words that sound cool :P<br>Ice vs. Glaciem<br>Fire vs. Huo (Chinese)<br><br>I remember many of these maps (senex, rigor mortis, quintus, rendezvous, even though that's french I think) Have foreign names. It just adds this uniqueness to the map.
