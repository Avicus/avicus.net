Just make LFTs, LFMs, LFSs and Introduce Yourself hidden from the front page, I do not &nbsp;care about this stuff and it's boring and spammy.<br><br>TBH this &nbsp;would be a step in the right direction.

I agree with this. These threads are spamming the forums, so hide them in the sub forum stated by Lego. Also, these TBHs are great because people get to know each other better and know what people think about them.

Ever since LFT and LFM threads showed in&nbsp;<i>Recent Discussions</i> there has been and increase in responses to the threads, as unless you're a team leader or actively check the non-displayed subforums, those threads will get little attention.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>This new revival of the TBH trend will die down in a couple of weeks, but for a new visiter of the forums if they check&nbsp;<i>Recent Discussions&nbsp;</i>and see this:<br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/sZymkbF.png" title="Image: http://i.imgur.com/sZymkbF.png"><br><br><b>Credit to Crimson_Aught</b><br><br>What do you think they'll do? What kind of impression will they get?<br><br>It's not just new comers either, some active visitors are getting sick of it, however they'll just have to put up with it.<br>However in my opinion I believe they should be kept out of&nbsp;<i>Recent Discussions</i>.

How hard can it be to just hide this shit? We've been asking for this stuff for a while after, what I see as, popular demand regarding AMAs. This new trend is just as bad and will stick around for a good while, I promise. Numerous players have even offered the ability to toggle certain types of threads on the forums so some show and some are hidden. Regardless of how you choose to do it, please just find a solution.

The TBH threads are just fads. They'll die out in a week or so. It's literally only been one day, give it a second..<br>Although there are times where AMAs are quite spammy, it's not a huge problem.

Not the Introduce Yourself section.<br>It's meant to have new players on the forums introduce themselves.<br>Taking that out pretty much isolates them, and I'm sure most people wouldn't check that forums section unless they're looking to make an AMA.<br>ANd like others said, TBH threads will die down in a few days like it has for forum games, giveaways, e.t.c.

Funny. He's been demoted already in the past, and if its a good enough reason, they'll demote him. You can't demote a very good and talented Developer because his&nbsp;arbitrariness.

Someone's triggered Ey?<br><br>For the millionth time, just because to say "demote ALM" doesn't mean they will. I'm sure ALM is triggered and everything, but he won't be demoted because a random member said so.
