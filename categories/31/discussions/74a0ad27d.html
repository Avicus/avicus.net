Evening/Morning/Other ya'll!<br>Today, I'd like to put out three questions primarily centred on the topic of the game modes. We are always looking for better ways to improve the gameplay experience and I'd like to put out there a few question for you all to answer and discuss.&nbsp;<br><br><span>Today's Topics:-<br></span><br><b>What do you find fun and interesting about the Avicus Network&nbsp;game modes?&nbsp;<br></b><br><b>What improvements would you like to see from existing&nbsp;game modes?&nbsp;<br></b><br><b>Is there any&nbsp;game modes you'd like replaced/removed? If so, why?<br></b>

Hey! You really need to make your points more specific. Saying add new features without specifying new features doesn't help much. :P

<b>What do you find fun and interesting about the Avicus Network&nbsp;game modes?&nbsp;<br></b>-Nebula: Due it's the most played Gamemode, there are always nice and funny people on.

<br><b>What do you find fun and interesting about the Avicus Network&nbsp;game modes?<br></b>I think the main selling point that got me into Avicus when I first got here was the whole prestige and leveling up system which is not that common so that was cool. <br><br>Currently I love <b>Nebula </b>and think it is fine as it is, however maybe it could do with a few less maps.<b> <br><br>Nexus</b> is my favourite game though as I just love all the maps and the kits and just everything really.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Walls </b>would be my 3rd favourite and is decent (I was never a big fan of walls anyway) but I like some of the more original themed maps. <br><b><br>CaptureTheHill</b> I really like this mode but hardly anyone plays it which is very disappointing. I feel like CTH should be added into Nexus just like how Nebula has TDM the odd time to break up the constant DTM. <br><b><br>Avicade</b> I think should just be removed.<b> </b>At most times I might see 5 people on it which is just rare in itself so I think should just be removed.<b> <br><br>Elimination</b> as with Avicade should be removed too and &nbsp;I think changed to Survival Games, which players are more comfortable with and lets be real it is really fun and will attract more people to the server.<br><b><br>What improvements would you like to see from existing&nbsp;game modes?&nbsp;<br></b>Oh I answered that basically up above...<br><br><b>Is there any&nbsp;game modes you'd like replaced/removed?

I think it's fine as it is expect for one thing: Fix the NCP, I'm not saying it's easy, but can't you at least restore the old one? It's really frustrating and annoying ._.

Ah.<br>That's gonna be my opinion, Maybe some peole won't like it D: -<br><b>Nebula-</b> Best Gamemode on avicus, Really unique, Really fun. No improvements.<br><b>Walls-</b> Good game, Very fun, I don't care it's not unique. It's walls with kits doe. No improvements needed.<br><b>Nexus-</b> PvP team Deathmatch, awesome game. One improvement. Some kits are too OP and that's not fair. By the way, The OP Kits like 'Barbarian' Needs to be unlocked in level 43, Not 'Freezer', It's too weak.<br><b>Control the hill-</b> &nbsp;Nice gamemode. 1 Problem, this gamemode being played once a day. Means people prefer Play other games in the playtime. Means, we need to add more features, Improvements, Don't know exactly what, But for this game will play more.<br><b>Elimination- </b>Good gamemode. My opinion, is good game, I don't care it\s not unique, But other people do.<br>Add some features like new kits.<br><b>Avicade-&nbsp;</b>Awesome gamemode! Super unique, Very fun! Add more mini-games to there.<br>Another thing. The biggest wanted feature.<br>Add more prestiges. In all the games. It will make bored people who reached prestige 5 and level 50, and left avicus, make them back! It will make the gameplay More interesting. As i already made a post about that.<br>So, Howsie.

<b>What do you find fun and interesting about the Avicus Network&nbsp;game modes?&nbsp;</b>Although not really unique, there's a goal to them. I personally can't enjoy playing a game without a goal in mind. Setting personal goals is alright, but I just reallly can't get into it. With the ability to level up I can push myself through each prestige and be rewarded with a star :D<b><br></b><br><b>What improvements would you like to see from existing&nbsp;game modes?&nbsp;</b>CTH has to have some improvements. The kill streak rewards need to be stronger and possibly add in a few more? It can get quite bland seeing the same 5 items appear over and over.<br>Elimination could use some help. There definitely has to be a way to bring it some more traffic. Possibly merge it with SG? I'm not the best with ideas for these kinds of things :c&nbsp;<b><br></b><br><b>Is there any&nbsp;game modes you'd like replaced/removed? If so, why? </b>Possibly combine CTH with Nexus. Not too sure if people would like that.<b>&nbsp;</b>

<b>I'm just going to list each gamemode and put my opinions on it.<br><br>Nebula:</b> Obviously an amazing game. &nbsp;The only criteria I have for it is to have more gameplay inducing maps, add some more gamemodes as opposed to strictly DTM and occasionally TDM, but I'm not creative so I have absolutely no ideas as far as that goes.<br><b>Nexus</b><b>:</b> A basic Kit TDM, but it draws in a lot of fun, it's personally my favorite. &nbsp;Nexus simply needs bug fixes all over the place, and maybe some new kits here and there to spice it up.<br><b>Avicade:</b> A fun idea, but nobody plays it because there's only two gamemodes for it. &nbsp;Just some creative ideas are needed.<br><b>CTH:</b> CTH is a phenomenal game, it just needs attention. &nbsp;Events could be scheduled centered around CTH to get more players to consistantly play on it.<br><b>Walls:</b> Personally, I don't see any changes needed for walls.<br><b>Elimination:</b> Like CTH, it needs events scheduled around it. &nbsp;Also, it needs more RAM, because out of the three or so games I've played of it, two of them crashed before the game ended.

<b>Nebula-</b> Ofc, amazing gamemode. I'm not going to list everything about why its amazing. Let's just jump into the stuff I think you should improve on.<br>-CTW: Please make it come back.

<b>What do you find fun and interesting about the Avicus Network gamemodes?<br></b>Nebula: I really love this game. Like I am talking about DTM.

I think OiTN-TDM should be added to Nexus.<br>The Walls: I always play walls with my friends and when I play, it gets really addicting but while I play I don't see anything wrong with the gamemode because I like every map and everything.<br>Elimination: As everyone knows this is the least popular gamemode and when I play it doesn't feel thrilling or exciting.

We don't have many gamemodes because we only want original gamemodes but to be honest it doesn't matter if its been used a billion times. &nbsp;It only matters if the gamemode being played well and it works. &nbsp;Instead of SG we have Elimination and no one seems to play it. &nbsp;No one should really care for the originality of gamemodes because what you do with it is what makes it unique.

<b>Nebula</b> is my favorite gamemode, and 95% of my time on Avicus is spent on it. However, I am starting to play less than I used to, mainly because of the Avicore update. A lot of my favorite maps were either changed or removed completely, and I don't even bother playing on the new maps. I would suggest adding building blocks such as wood in the points shop, as well as adding the regeneration potions back. Maybe add some more items in the points shop, since if I join a game, after 3-5 matches I have around 40-50 points. If it's full of OitN maps, then I'll have 80-100 points. The only useful items I can really buy are golden apples and spanky spades.<br><br>Also, why are TDM maps in Nebula in the first place? They don't belong in Nebula. Isn't Nexus a TDM gamemode? That's where those maps belong, unless it's OitN.<br><br>I'm usually on the McZone servers, because there I can enjoy gameplay without having to even think about those new maps, with aesthetics a higher priority than gameplay. I can enjoy maps such as Quintus and Senex, without having to play something like Diamond Shore or Yellowstone (sorry Evo).&nbsp;<br><br><b>Nexus</b> is my second favorite gamemode. I'm not from McZone so I have no idea how it was like back then, or what the maps were like. I really enjoy it now, and I don't think anything really needs to be changed.<br><br>I've only played <b>Elimination</b> once, and got bored of it quickly. I would suggest removing it and adding Survival Games. This would attract a ton of new players.

I will just place some geneal thoughts:<br><br>1: stats: game modes should have rank signs posted in the hub somewhere with interesting stats and a top 10 rank . &nbsp;For example nebula could have most monuments broken this week or month. Different stats for each gamemode: maybe a lounge with those boards. <br><br>2: population : a general idea I am seeing from other posts is that players want to see more people playing. That bulls down to everyone ( owner and staff ) getting a new fire under there butts and getting active. I mean Avicus is ranked pretty low these days as compared to where it was. People miss Mczone because of the friendships , the people, and lastly was the game modes. Fill up the server and see what happens. I am not saying that all staff members are in a relaxed state, but I know from reading posts that some higher ranking staff admit to having poor focus, spending less time on avicus, and not giving certain game modes attention. We all lose focus at times, but I can see that focus has been lost in a lot of ways and it really shows. It shows in the player counts, it shows in the time it takes to implement solutions , and It shows with the amount of time not given to avicus by the staff.<br><br>3: gamemodes - I don't have a lot to say really on this. Other than not much time has been put into developing the current gamemodes : I mean nebula is a great game mode, but I haven't seen much done &nbsp;with the points store. I also see that unless you use the points store you can't track your kills. Seems odd that there is not a command or something where you can see your stats for the current match- bow kills, sword kills, deaths , etc. &nbsp;I also see that everyone is asking to be able to add friends, and that feature is Mia , I'm sure there is some long process to add a friend and message them , but it's hit and miss and not many know about it and its for sure not easy but is really needed, it is just another development problem.&nbsp;<br><br>Kits and team rewards - the kits are ok in nexus but they do need tweaked. The kits in walls are very broken. &nbsp;Look at the walls kits and you will see about 3-4 that are useful, the rest are a complete let down. &nbsp;A healing potion as a kit item? Really?, or how about a 5 sec random buff, you have to stop , eat and hope the 5sec buff helps??? Nope. Stomper kit where you still take fall damage? Or the famous barbarian kit in walls , 5sec of str after a kill? So limited and unless your fighting 2,at a time useless. What about team rewards in Nebula, that would be awesome, but again. not developed. &nbsp;I &nbsp;could go on and on, but the bottom line is no one is developing our current game modes. Cth and elimination fail due to population as does the under developed avicade nothing wrong with the game-modes . Combining game modes may help, but I really can't say. What can be said is that if the dev staff and admin staff and the map staff sit down and talk after reading all these posts Avicus still has a shot. There really isn't a reason for us to have the low population we have, other than staying not focused or not as committed as could be. I also think admin staff needs a higher since if urgency, more updates to the player base and more contact about the next exciting thing... I mean what awesome news do we have? We had a map testing event fail , then a map update that was going to take 1-2 days, but it's been over two days and no update in any way. I just think the community should be informed and updated, and I'm not sure the admin staff has a good communication policy.<br><br>Thanks for reading! This post is not directed at any person so please do not comment that I am picking on any one. I am just stating my opinion, and any post defending any group or staff member is not needed. &nbsp; ( typed on my phone, sorry for any typos)

<b><u>Nebula</u></b>. My favorite gamemode, and it will always be. I basically use almost all my time on this gamemode, and if this is gone, I would leave avicus unless a gamemode similar is out, and I'm sure a lot of people agree.<br><br>Honestly, the gamemodes I would like to see added on the Avicus Network is&nbsp;<b><u>Skywars</u></b><u></u> and&nbsp;<b><u>Survival Games.</u></b><u></u><u>&nbsp;</u> As a lot of people said, the unpopular gamemode Elimination should be replaced with something similar which is SG. Skybase is a awesome mini game that I started playing when I first got minecraft. It is enjoyable and in my opinion should bring some players.

To be honest, I have to disagree with everyone saying that Elimination is bad or boring. The more you play it, the more you'll get to like it and get more strategies to it. It could use some minor changes, but doesn't need to be removed or revamped in my opinion. Just needs more popularity.

<span><b>What do you find fun and interesting about the Avicus Network&nbsp;game modes?&nbsp;<br></b>The variety - I love how each gamemode has it's own type, with different ways of how it goes, this is able to apeal to a much larger range of users, whom of which either love the fun and&nbsp;exhilarating&nbsp;mini games&nbsp;of Avicade, to the&nbsp;Adrenalin&nbsp;rush of Nebula.<br>Each gamemode allows users to gain XP, this sets a goal for the user, to&nbsp;pursue&nbsp;it, until&nbsp;eventually, the hard work pays off, and you get the gratitude of the star next to your name, as a sign of your&nbsp;achievement.<br><br><b>What improvements would you like to see from existing&nbsp;game modes?&nbsp;<br></b>I believe there should be more prestiges, to set even higher goals for users.<br>more diverse maps being added to the rotation roster.<br>More mods need to be more active, to ensure they can react to player reports in time, to take action<br>Team staking is a problem that needs to end, and some good suggestions have come up in the past.<b><br></b><br><b>Is there any&nbsp;game modes you'd like replaced/removed?

<b>What do you find fun and interesting about the Avicus Network&nbsp;game modes? </b><b>&nbsp;<br></b>Every game is different, no matter how hard you try to make it like another.

Nebula is great the way it is, although I don't like TDM, I usually weed through it to find a DTM map. Walls could use more maps which I know is happening, so that's great, also I don't think anyone agrees with me on this but I really liked Skywars, it would probably be played more than some of the game modes we have to be blunt.

Why everybody says "push CTH in to Nexus"? CTH is a great game and Nexus is a great game, but both together is not so good. The gameplay is different aslo. The point is to defend the middle and score points there. Nexus is to kill everyone to win. There is a big different. I love CTH and Nexus, but I would hate it if they are together...

Mostly because of CTH's inferior popularity nowadays. Personally I think it'd be nice if they were combined, along with adding other gamemodes to nexus also.

One idea i have thought of is kind of like what mineplex does(hate to bring other servers up). Mineplex has a big selection of games that you can play over and over again, kind of like all games here on avicus. But they also have a arcade where you can play all games in a random order. Avicus should throw maps from all 6 game modes combining them into an arcade like thing where everyone can play all maps. I think this sounds right. Ask me if you need better explanation

I like the games as they are right now, but elimination needs to be fixed in some way. Avicade needs more games, I know some are being works on and I know that snake it being fixed (yay I love snake) but I suggest bringing back game committee or using some of the games that were accepted by the game committee before it fell apart.
