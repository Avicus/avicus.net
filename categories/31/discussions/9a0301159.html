<b>Hey Guys!</b><br><br>So, I don't know how to start this off...<br><br>I first joined Avicus in 2013 when it was still McZone. I had just started Minecraft and I asked my cousin if he knew any good servers. He brought me here. (This was the first server I joined). Avicus was easily the best server I ever played on. I went through many good times and bad times on this server. However, recently they have been bad. I was recently promoted to Jr. Mod, but then demoted and that kind of started the decline. It was then that Avicus started fading away. I started coming on less and less because each time I got annoyed by the players on it and sometimes (although rarely) got frustrated at the staff (for things such as never being on TS [That is just my observation]). Basically I liked it better when it was a quite server with players I was used to. But enough with the badness, I DID say I had some good times. Now I would just like to point out some people:<br><br><u>resepignev:</u> You are awesome, stay that way. But seriously, you are probably my best friend on Avicus.<br><br><u>Ryilo:</u> I always had fun chatting with you on TS and skype. Not to mention you are amazing at&nbsp; PVP.<br><br><u>Random_Guy:</u> Thanks for always testing out my maps. You are really funny and make me laugh a lot.<br><br><u>_TinyBear</u>: You are just awesome.<br><br><u>Spartamex:</u> Even though it was short lived, thanks so much for the build server.<br><br>So I know I did not include everyone (you know who you are), these are just the people <u>I knew the longest</u>, or who have done the most for me. So anyhoo, I guess it is time for me to say goodbye! (That just got really bittersweet as I typed that thinking back on all the good times I have had). Wish you guys the best and good luck in life!<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sincerely,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joseph (Running_Boy_12), (x_Redstone_), x_KyloRen_), and (DipperPines_12)
