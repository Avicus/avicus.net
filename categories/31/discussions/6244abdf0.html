Hi,&nbsp;<br>I have recently brought this issue up while in-game and I would like to further it. I love this server and so do a lot of people. And it is just so hard and annoying when hackers play. I have noticed that there are more hackers on avicus than any other server I have player. One person in specfic I have reported so many times for hacking and also bullying and swearing has only got a small infraction like a kick. I am just asking if you could be tighter with this. Thank you.<br><br>Kind Regards ExShot

It is an Avicus system of infractions. For bullying you first get warn, then kick, then temporary ban.

May I ask what this person's name is? You might as well record them hacking and report them on forums. Also lots of people can think someone is hacking but they aren't. It doesn't really mean the person that is hackusating is an idiot it just means the person being accused of hacks can be very sketchy. I for one have been hackusated many times because I have good ping and take less knockback than normal, not to be cocky. Just know sometimes you could think someone is cheating but they aren't.

Hello! If you come across a hacker,&nbsp;always use /report stated above! It alerts staff when there is a rule breaker and we will assign an appropiate punishment if the reported player is rule breaking. Don't worry, we&nbsp;always try our best to get rid of rule breakers.

Also depending on the hack you think they are using, for instance aimbot, you could see the hack auto aiming if you press f3+b. It shows the players hitbox(White outline), where they are facing(blue line), and a few other things. this is what I usually do when I suspect of hacking, and its usually the first line of inspection. But do not report of hacking just if you think you saw it move jerkily, because there's this amazing thing called sensitivity

I expect quality posts that are well written and have excellent grammar. If you do not post in this fashion you are bad at posting and should eat my farts.
