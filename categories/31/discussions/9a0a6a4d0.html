Go Avicus!

I see so many post about New Game-Modes, “What would you
like to see” and Game-Modes “What would you change” and Game-Modes “What would
you remove”. So many posts about game modes but we are overlooking the main problem,
the current game modes have tons of work that is needed – before adding more….
Adding more game-modes is not the solution to the population problem on Avicus
alone. People come to a server and they don’t just try out a game-mode and then
leave, they play a few of them and see if the server is one they want to add.
Currently If a new player logs into Avicus they have three choices, and
currently we only have the population to support 3 most of the time. At peak
CTH may have a game, but other than that Nebula has just under 200 players,
walls about 40 and Nexus about 20-25 in games. Elimination none, CTH none,
Avicade None.

First do we need more game modes Yes! Can we support them
currently No. The population is going to continue to drop through the week with
schools back in and be a little better on the weekend. So if you add another
game mode now it will most likely have traction problems no matter how good it
is.

My suggestion: Avicus must get the community / players
talking about the current popular game modes. We should not jump the gun and
add other games that are going to be buggy, have few maps, and a learning
curve.

We should without a doubt put some time into the following:

<br><span>`<b><span><br>Nebula 1st:</span></b> <br></span><span>`<b><br>Fix the /mgs&nbsp; /friend issues:</b> How can you make friends
if you can’t add them. You need to be able to join the server and type /msg
name, and whisper to them no matter where they are on the Avicus network. &nbsp;People play because they like the game-mode
they come back because of the friends.</span>

<br><span>`<b><br>Points Shop:</b> Fun
interesting things need to be put in this shop, get creative, what would make
it fun? What about Team rewards in the shop not just personal? Think about what
would help the defenders defending the monument, what about attackers – could they
buy a super pick axe or an infinity bow on maps that don’t have those items?
Make it fun…. Come up with great items. <br></span><span>`<b><br>Stats: </b>We really
should have a way to see how well we are doing in a match, kills, deaths, ets…
It would add so much to it. What about a hero board that shows monument breaks
/ kills / fastest monument break time, etc – This gives a goal to hardcore
players and friends. You need competition to keep it fun.</span>

<span>I am sure the long time players of Nebula have even more
things they would like to see, poll them and really see what would make nebula
so much better. It is the bread and butter and I feel it has for the most part
been put on auto pilot, it should be <b>“The
DTM game that destroys all other DTM games”</b></span>

<br>`<br>OCN has 1000+ online most of the time and Project Ares is
the main game for them. It is super close to Nebula gameplay – focus on that. It
is the big draw, Remove all the poor maps, put only the best maps in that game
mode, rotate new fresh maps in every week and rotate some of the great ones
that we already have.

<br>`<b><span><br>Walls 2nd:</span></b>

<br>`<b><br>Fix the /mgs&nbsp; /friend issues same as above:<br></b><span>`<b><br>Kits: </b>The Walls
kits need serious work: The<b> </b>kits are
supposed to not be over powered, but still offer an interesting way to change
the game and play style for the player.<b> </b>The
maps and kits are what make the walls different on Avicus. The kits are what
keep people playing to gain more exp to get higher kits and see how the new kit
will make the game more fun. If a player gets to a certain level and works hard
to get a kit and then that kit is no good or has no use in a situation that is
a huge letdown.&nbsp; All kits should be
useful on some level and in some circumstance.<b> </b></span>

I won’t go into a rant about each kit, but currently we have
kits that do not work, some that are useless, and some that add no game play
change at all. One kit is a single low level healing potion like you would find
in a chest, awesome!.

<br><span>`<b><br>Maps:</b> The walls
gets very little map attention until recently, and thank goodness for IZ and
Crazy Clowns because no other staff member has bothered to make a walls map and
have it published even if they published dozens of maps for other game-modes,
it’s just a fact. </span>

Like Nebula and Nexus – The walls should have game
Variations, but this is not being developed. What about borrowing ideas from “The
Bridges at mineplex” or making a two team or 8 team walls map? How could we
make the walls on Avicus be the Walls game to play? Even if you don’t like
walls, if you are for Avicus, you should help develop it.

<br>`<b><br>Nexus and the rest:</b>

&nbsp;Nexus / CTH /
Elimination / Avicade :

We just need to do the same with Nexus / CTH / Elimination /
Avicade that we should do with the Nexus and Walls. If we don’t like one game
mode – incorporate it into another until the server starts to grow again. Take
a deep look into the game mode and make it exciting then add new ones when we
are happy with the state of the others. Develop the game-mode!

<br><b>`<br>Lastly: Communication
to the player base:<br></b><span>`<br>Avicus has really poor communication to the player base, it can’t
be denied/ Just read all the posts where people want answers about different
things, and no one gets them. “Things happen when they happen”. “Be patient”
should be the Avicus motto. I will say this, With the New EULA changes, poor
customer service will run good paying donators away and when the money starts
getting tight Avicus will have a different view on keeping the player base informed,
excited, and respected.<br>&nbsp;Avicus went from 1000 players + on average to now only
keeping 3 game modes going… &nbsp;Servers with
10x the population keep the player base informed about what’s being developed
and what’s going on, Avicus does very little of this.<br><b>`</b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>Everything said is to help Avicus – If this
makes you mad or upset, think about why? I promise you being upset at my posts
will not bother me in the slightest. I have not said anything that is not true
or my opinion. I have not been rude and can back up everything I have said. I
am <b>pro Avicus</b> and want to see the Server grow, but it should not take weeks to
update maps, It should not take months to fix a friend or msg problem, and clearly
we are not focused on making game modes better, we are taking the easy way out
and just dropping in a new game.<br><b>`</b><br>Thanks for reading :)&nbsp;</span>

I can basically agree with all of this. I'm actually working on a 5-team walls match just for fun, and if the plugin would be able to work with it, I could submit it. And a kills board might be a bit pointless, as you can go to the website to check a player's stats (it even advertises it in-game), but a monument breaking board could be quite fun.

I'm currently working on a 8 team walls map, we'll see what happens... But pls don't push CTH in Nexus, they are different gamemodes with different gameplay. The problem with the Avicade is, there are only 2 gamemodes with boring maps, because everybodz knows the maps. New maps could be helping. I already tried to make red alert/minotaur maps different. Like doodle jump and I'm planning to make a pacman map. All are minotaurs and 1 player has to escape and to find the four stars, then the can kill the minotaurs. Hope this will add more fun in the Avicade Gamemode.

We need to find a way to spice up Nexus, CTH, Avicade and Elim. Add a little bit of the avicus touch.
