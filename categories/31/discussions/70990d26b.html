Hi few quick questions:<br>- What are the rules and regulations concerning advertising other servers on the forums? (I say this because of this thread&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://avicus.net/forums/6aaf332fa">http://avicus.net/forums/6aaf332fa</a>&nbsp;from roboticboy)<br>- What ip's can I and can't I say on the forums.<br><br>I ask this because anybody saying things like that on my own server would receive a permanent ban. Also before I changed to prison I could not say the ip of my server (Which was a map build server (Therefore alot more avicus related)) why can roboticboy do that?<br><br>Thanks,<br>Subzero

He is technically hosting a public event. That gets more appeal and also it more community driven. Not everyone in the world wants too make a map. Also clearly he was given an all go from the Sr Staff.

Here's the thing about it:<br>Robo and I didn't make te UHC server to bring people away from Avicus; we made it to<br>bring the community closer together.&nbsp;<br>Also, we have explicit permission from the Senior Staff, so you'd have to bring it up with them.

No I get that, if anything a build server though is more beneficial for Avicus but I was never allowed to. I even made a post asking about how I can give the ip.

I believe you can advertise other servers as long as you have <b>permission</b> from a Sr. Staff member.<br><br><b></b>

<u></u>Don't get me wrong here,&nbsp;I appreciate you trying to help but they hashtags and bold text is unnecessary. It doesn't need to stand out.
