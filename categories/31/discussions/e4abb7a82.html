It's all based on the situation.<br>For example: One swear that isn't directed to anyone and only happens occasionally is Ok.<br><br>But if you swear all the time and it's directed to someone specific then you could expect an infraction. Again, you can't really say which infraction because each situation is different.&nbsp;<br><br>This is the same with Combat Logging; Being rude; Using excessive caps; spamming chat and abusing /report.<br><br>As for using a hacked client/Hacking. I believe it is a Temp-ban for the lighter form &nbsp;of punishment and a permanent ban as the harsher form.<br><br>So it's all dependent on the situation and how someone is breaking these rules.<br><br>Although, I am not a moderator and could be wrong in some areas.<br><br>Hope this helped :)

It really depends on the situation of the offence. What I can tell you is that hacking is a permanent ban. If you are a repeat offender, the punishment will be more severe every time.

Although it does depend on the situation, some of us.. I guess, have a basic mental guideline that we use. It can definitely change, but mine is:<br><br>Swearing punishment is ... Verbally warn if minor, kick right away without warning if it's severe.<br>Using a hacked client punishment is ... Perma-ban. Although we can give long tempbans, I personally do not.<br>Combat logging punishment is ... &nbsp;Warn them if I see them. If I do not, I tempban them for an hour.<br>Being rude punishment is ... Verbal warn -&gt; Kick<br>Using lots of CAPS punishment is ...&nbsp;Verbal warn -&gt; kick<br>Team Griefing punishment is ... Kick, tempban if continued. I tempban for 6 hours, but I've seen others do it for up to a day.<br>Abusing /report punishment is ... I usually give 2 warnings (verbal), then kick.<br>And spamming chat punishment is ... Verbal warn -&gt; Kick<br><br>Not all moderators go by this, we do have a very basic and general guideline thats way different from this. We also have /warn, which I use, paired up with verbal warns. I've never gone by guidelines, I always do things my way. It is usually more lenient than the guidelines I've &nbsp;been given in the past, but it works. Really, it's completely up to the staff member, as to what they want to do to the person.

If it is a first time offence, the punishment should be 6h to 1 day.

Oh dear, I'm worried as to who said this. IMO, this is way too lenient, and it should be, at the very least, 7 days.

A hack is a hack.&nbsp; Perm ban a hacker (period).&nbsp; I hate hackers and the mods shouldn't be lenient towards them.

I remember hearing that if you say which client you have you get a tempban instead of perm.

As amusing as that is... it's not true. Most mods just do it for a quick giggle :P

Ah. I've seen such in-game but I don't get the giggle part other than a slight one from trolling them by perm banning even after they've complied. xP
