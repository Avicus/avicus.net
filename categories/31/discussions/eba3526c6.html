So I email'd support around a week ago, and never received a response.<br><br>I let it slide for the first few days, maybe they're busy. But a whole week? and not a single email back?<br><br>I've talked to others who emailed support and they've also had insanely long response times. So, what are you guys doing that's not responding to this?

Did you try skype or anything? I know jozz stepped down and he did a lot of work for the email, so maybe they don't have anyone to replace him atm? This is pure speculation, ofc, but it's possible that they haven't got things back up to speed after this.

From my knowledge as a former admin, the support email had over 200 emails... whether or not the senior staff actually went through and did them all is out of my belief, but try resending the email.

If you don't get a reply in a week then send another Email.

My email took them about a week and a half to respond after I sent it twice, so eventually it will come.

Sorry for the inconvenience, I'm assuming there is a lack of response to emails because of the recent changes to staff, especially the Sr Staff. Like mentioned, just resend the email.

There is less Sr Mods which could be a reason, but Sr staff interviews are happening soon so I'm sure they'll respond faster.<br><br>P.S. It took me a month to get unbanned when I got a false infraction for autoclicker lol.
