Issue Regarding /report.

Hello everyone!<br><br>As some of you may have noticed, the /report command has been very glitchy lately.<br>Whenever you report a player, your game will either crash, or you will time out. However, the report still goes through.<br><br>To avoid this issue, we ask that you use the command <b>/TELL (Moderator name) (Message)&nbsp;</b>to inform us of any rule breakers.<br><br>Please note that to use this command, you must either be spectating the game, or you and the staff member must both be spectating, or both playing in-game. You cannot use this command when you are in-game, and the staff member is spectating, since it will not deliver the message.<br><br>We apologize for the inconvenience, and we hope to fix this issue soon!<br><br>-Porky

Just to clarify further on what porky said, you have to have the command in caps. So like this: /TELL.

The thread wasn't originally like that. It was probably edited now, since it has some of this information on it.<br><br>@Leafeon: I haven't seen that command before so I wouldn't know. If it does send a message, it's perfectly fine to use it as well!
