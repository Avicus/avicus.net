I do love all staff and i think they are doing a really good job, however you have a lot of infractions and i know why the staff member didn't go so easy on you.&nbsp; You know it was wrong but you did it anyway.

Not to plug my own topic but I recently made a suggestion topic about appealing warns and kicks because I don't like having something like this on my record without being able to defend myself about it. In my topic Nolan says "Kicks and warns will most likely be appealable in the future" :)

Adding a direct server exploit to the rules will only make people abuse it more.

'Abusing glitches' is just a generalisation. Anything that falls under this gategory is considerated illegal. Common sense goes a long way.

I wouldn't really call a warn an infraction, and it won't affect your chances of your application in the least. So there's nothing to worry about ^.^

Players should know if it is an exploit. For example glitching in the Venemous TDM axe and bow into another game is a exploit because it isn't part of the map and you have to do something to get it. Or, managing to get ahead of everyone in Minotaur in Avicade at the start. Shooting someone in walls is less clear i understand but it is still not allowed and whatever you got, a warn or a kick, this should not affect your staff app. An idea for the community would be to help the staff find exploits and not abuse them.
