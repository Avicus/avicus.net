thats ok but why would a senior request a temp ban on me for ban evasion when 5thteen is actually my bro you would have to watch 5thteen and kojo play and notice we play really differently so its easy to tell when im using 5thteen or vice versa. but i've never actually griefed from a team either

Seniors are the only ones who can IP check. Since you and your brother play off the same IP and your brother was banned at the time, they thought that it was one person and not two brothers and it looked like you were ban evading.<br><br>Also, I am not replying to your next comment, I don't wanna start a flame war.

im not starting one either but for the record my brother plays completly different to the way i do so if you ever suspect us of ban evading you need to watch us if 5th was using my account he wouldnt be rushing in like i do on 90% of the maps so lol but for the record your team griefing one on me the week prior was bs i dont team grief tbh i just want an apology from you for that one cos ive never team griefed and there was no warnings involved to indicate i was even griefing if you warned me id have got rid of whatever i supposedly griefed cos i am a fair player

Why are you bringing back something that has happened? What does him apologising do? Unless it actually makes you feel better
