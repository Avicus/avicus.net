So today i just read that one way servers can get money for running the server is... letting players pay to get in. so i was wondering 2 things (ik I'm late on this kinda stuff ok?)<br>1. Will Avicus be doing this?<br>2. Will donors be able to get the money back for the ranks?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Hope Someone will answer please thanks :D<br>P.S i just put it here cuz i feel thats the best spot for it. staff please move it somewhere else if needed thanks!<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; -DasBlues

I highly doubt that donors will be able to get their money back. I also don't see a reason why Avicus would make it so you need to pay to play since they would lose a lot of players.&nbsp;<br><br>This is just what I think tho.

We currently have not decided what we will do for finance after July, but the high staff will have a meeting in the near future as to what we are going to do. However, paying for access, I can guarantee will not be one of the ways.
