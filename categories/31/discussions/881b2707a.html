1 - No, it is considered team trolling if you deliberately block another person who is already mining the monument.<br><br>2 - Against the rules. Punishable with a kick, temp-ban, or ban.<br><br>3 - Accusing others of hacking is not allowed. Take a screenshot and report that player, or use /report to report that player in-game.<br><br>Hope I helped!

Team Spleefing is not allowed. If you mean monument stealing by "blocking them so they can't break it and you get the monument", then that would be illegal. Also, #3 isn't necessary to say in chat if you mean it as if you are saying it, if players are saying that to you, then tell them to use /report.

1) Absolutely not. It is considered team grief and it is punishable.<br>2) Team Spleef is against the rules; it's not allowed.<br>3) It depends on the situation. If it is a joke, then it wouldn't be punishable, however if the player does mean it, it is considered "hack accusing," in which case the player can be punished.

<b>1.&nbsp;</b>No, monument stealing is&nbsp;<b>not&nbsp;</b>allowed. This is due to the fact as it's known as "team trolling" which in result would be considering as a punishment. Report the person if they ever monument steal you, or anybody else!<br><br><b>2.&nbsp;</b>Team spleef is <b>not </b>allowed, as it's a rule. This also in result would be a punishment (such as a kick, tempban, etc).&nbsp;<br><br><b>3.&nbsp;</b>This is known as "accusing others of hacking". Calling somebody a hacker in chat, is useless and causes spam. If the person was really hacking, they would just turn it off immediately, so they wouldn't get banned.<br>This is not allowed and is a warn, kick, tempban, etc.&nbsp;<br><br>If you see anybody doing this in-game, I advise you to report them (immediately).<br>I hope this helped, and have a wonderful day! :)
