Best moments? Well there's been way to much from joining the Forums to becoming Mod. I've met some fantastic people and have had wonderful experiences. Although the best will have to be everything about Cacal &lt;3 (Too much to name :P)

There was a ton of "best moments" for me this year.<br><br>- Joining the Avicus Network.<br>-Meeting and playing with the staff and players.<br>-Becoming a regular on the forums and later, the server.<br>-Meeting the noodle-eating Director in-game and becoming great friends with him.<br>-And more that I can't remember!<br><br>There are two things that really stick out for me though.<br>When I first joined, I set a goal for myself.<br>I told myself that I wanted to become well known, help others and have a good reputation to everyone.<br><br>I think I have reached this goal which is amazing for me personally.<br>I am well known, and am "liked" by players and staff alike.<br>I am very thankful for that.<br><br><br>The second thing was that when the server was being attacked, I was chosen to temporarily become a Jr.Moderator to help watch over the server as some of the other staff tended to the server offline.<br><br>I am still to this day extremely grateful that the staff picked and trusted me with the position. There are so many worthy players and to be issued with this Big role took a lot of trust.<br>I understand this and cannot be more grateful.<br><br>This year I have learnt a lot from this server.<br>I have also made some extraordinary friends which is amazing!<br>I also never thought I'd have such a healthy and "close?" relationship with the staff and the community, it's so very awesome.<br><br><br><br>So thanks for an awesome year guys!<br>I am very grateful.

I would say, getting promoted to Junior Moderator. I was so nervous for everything, interview, results, etc.&nbsp;<br><br>Another thing is, getting to know the people on Avicus. Thanks for everything so far, let's aim for another awesome 2015!

I've had so many fantastic memories this year, probably the best is recently reaching prestige 1 (WOOOOOOH) and almost prestige 2. Ii also beat sunrise in a 1v1 with diamond, and that's always fun (xD). Thanks to all of the staff and players for making this another brilliant year on the Avicus server. Hopefully next year my greatest memory will be becoming Jr. moderator (hint hint). Have a great new year everyone!

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My favorite moment of the year had to be joining Teamspeak back in February and discovering how great it was. As I became more and more confident of my abilities I began to branch out and take my first steps by using my mic. Honestly, choosing to start communicating really brought me closer to everyone on teamspeak. I can still recall the many times I stayed up all night playing and overall having a great time with the "crew." However, the "crew" began to dissolve and sadly many of my great&nbsp;<span>acquaintances left or just stopped coming on Teamspeak.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Getting denied from jr. mod was also a somewhat defining experience. Mostly because it still confuses me as to why it took 4 weeks for results. Although it doesn't sound like something I should look to as a "great" moment, it really was a nice slap in the face. (p.s. ~4th to get interviewed, one of the last to get results)<br><br></span>

There was a ton of "best moments" for me this year.<br><br>- Joining the Avicus Network.<br>-Meeting and playing with the staff and players.<br>-Becoming a regular on the forums and later, the server.<br>-Meeting the noodle-eating Director in-game and becoming great friends with him.<br>-And more that I can't remember!<br><br>There are two things that really stick out for me though.<br>When I first joined, I set a goal for myself.<br>I told myself that I wanted to become well known, help others and have a good reputation to everyone.<br><br>I think I have reached this goal which is amazing for me personally.<br>I am well known, and am "liked" by players and staff alike.<br>I am very thankful for that.<br><br><br>The second thing was that when the server was being attacked, I was chosen to temporarily become a Jr.Moderator to help watch over the server as some of the other staff tended to the server offline.<br><br>I am still to this day extremely grateful that the staff picked and trusted me with the position. There are so many worthy players and to be issued with this Big role took a lot of trust.<br>I understand this and cannot be more grateful.<br><br>This year I have learnt a lot from this server.<br>I have also made some extraordinary friends which is amazing!<br>I also never thought I'd have such a healthy and "close?" relationship with the staff and the community, it's so very awesome.<br><br><br><br>So thanks for an awesome year guys!<br>I am very grateful.
