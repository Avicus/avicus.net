Hey everyone. Once again I'd like to start another discussion in order to gain feedback from the community on different important topics. These discussions are becoming very important when we (the senior staff team) look to design and execute new ways to improve upon the server and its community.&nbsp;<br><br>Today's Topic:-<br><br><b>What do you feel able the current communication between yourself and the staff/senior staff team? <br><br>Do you feel it is effective enough, or do you feel it could be greatly improved on?&nbsp;</b>

I think that it is quite efficient the way that it is.<br><br>Because the Sr. staff members all have Skype, it is easy to communicate with them.<br><br>If they also had individual emails, it would be even easier, such as "jozzmcozz@avicus.net" or something of that same basic principle, but it does truly cost a lot more, so Skype will have to be the easiest way of communication.

I personally wanted private emails for the senior staff but it does cost a fair bit now with google's new pricing.

A good majority of the new staff team is very active on TS. This provides almost instant communication between players and staff. Many of my bans come from regs on TS who tell me verbally where there is a hacker :)

Try and get some of the staff to stop reading out of a textbook and be a bit more laid back. Not too laid back, but just not to stiff.

I think the staff's communication is great! I'm also happy that the staff are bringing these topics up to make sure Avicus maintains it's number one spot on the servers. But the staff team could get better with the upcoming staff applications if you catch my drift :)

The communication is the only bad thing about the moderators (not all just some of them) they need to warn somebody in chat before kicking them or giving a warn because most of the time it's just a missunderstanding, a lot of people gets warned or kicked for hackusation/being mean in chat without any chat warn, for example I get a warn for hackusation when I was just derping with a friend (The Jr.mod didn't ask why did I hackusate and more important why didn't I report) after that everything is perfect with mods, compared to other networks we have the best staff (exceptions can be made)

ye, you can get one for free if its username<i>@gmail.com,</i> but gmail also allows custom domains for the email (example<i>@avicus.net</i>), which costs money.<br><br>Maybe seniors should just be required to make their own gmail like, "username.avicus@gmail.com". ofc the username would have to actually be their username, no nicknames.

hmm.. There isnt much i would change, but I think there should be:<br><br>More mods (Since this is a pretty big server)<br>When a mod recieves at least 3 - 4 reports on a player they should check the specific player.<br>And final... and Most of all important....

Moderators should check every report that comes in unless it's invalid. If there's many reports, it's set to a higher priority.<br>Ex: Someone reported once for "Spamming" is less of a priority than someone reported 5 times for "Fly Hacking."

<b>What do you feel able the current communication between yourself and the staff/senior staff team?&nbsp;</b>I think the mods need to not hide up in the moderator chat all the time and when people poke and ask for help or whatever, that they should answer the pokes. Earlier today I poke 5 staff sitting up there and only 2 poked me back. And none were AFK.&nbsp;<b><br>Do you feel it is effective enough, or do you feel it could be greatly improved on?&nbsp;</b>I think it could GREATLY improve

So I guess we won't be able to add messaging to this forum then o_O? &nbsp;I am still wondering if we would be able to message each other plus staff o_o' &nbsp;That would cut out the need for skype and teamspeak when they are afk on ts or busy with real life.

I like the mods, I think communication is as good as it can be for non paid positions. They have lives and are split between many things. Do I have all my questions answered? nope. Do I get a reply in and hour or two? Not most of the time, but it is what it is, and I really don't have anything to complain about. Avicus mods are not employees so any help I get I really do appreciate.<br><br>Normally when &nbsp;I report someone - or someone reports me, they seem to be very quick and respond pretty fast and communicate fast, other ways of communication are hit or miss, but again, I am glad we do get the communication we have. Keep up the good work.

I think the staff communications are generally really good, but reporting, I never feel like it exists. A great addition would be if a player you reported got banned, kicked etc. The reporter would get an automatic reply saying something like (report handled), so it feels like reports actually work.<br>Just a recommendation (And what about that friend button?)

The staff are great, I think them being more social creates me to think of them as help and not some police patrolling the server. &nbsp;At the same time, I'm glad they take the position serious and enforce any rules broken. One thing though is treat everyone fair. &nbsp;A staff may know one person and not know the other. &nbsp;They should make sure your not to feel exclusive to anyone. &nbsp;If someone joins the server they should feel welcome and know the staff has their back.

I'm not a fan of what the mods don't say. I keep reporting people say spawn blocking even though a mod warned them. When they warn/ban/kick someone they should say something like -Thanks _______ this player was punished - so I can finally stop spamming /report on someone punished already.

I think the communication is really good. I have some of the staff on skype and that makes it really easy for me to talk to them if I ever need anything. Also, it's nice to have them on team speak so you can say "There's a hacker," if you're in game.

Try and get some of the staff to stop reading out of a textbook and be a bit more laid back. Not too laid back, but just not to stiff.

The dev team really needs to listen more to suggestions by players, there are some great ones out there.

We only have one dev (Ivy), and he can be really busy, but I do think he should check suggestions when he can.

One thing that has always bugged me is the Map Rotation, and how it's managed. More specifically, I'd like to know what maps are in the Rots, and what maps aren't. While I do know that there's the <a href="http://avicus.net/forums/ebe55f928" rel="nofollow">MD Thread</a>, it just feels like it doesn't work for me, mainly because I have to follow a trail of "which maps got removed in this update, which maps got added back in this other update, etc., etc.,"<br><br>What I'd suggest is having a main thread, (<i><u>preferably stickied),</u></i> with a list of the current Map Rots. It be a bit of a hassle for the Map Devs, but I do feel that the extra work would help regular players immensely when trying to follow the maps.

It's very good! This can be approved maybe trough a section in the "Administration" called "Staff Questions". There you can post Questions about other players or just staff related Questions. It would be like the "Player Report" section (only staff and the thread creator can see the thread). This would be useful, if you want the opinions, advises or answers from the staff members. Also if you have any consults related to the thread. I know skype can be used for that, but there you have only one person answering and if they don't know the answer you have to contact another staffmember. Same with the Emails. So I would like to see the new section.

We had this a while back it was called <i>Ask the Staff</i>&nbsp;and it was public for all players to reply. If we dont do this you can always either email support for questions of post a topic in <i>Avicus Help</i>&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://avicus.net/forums?topic_id=34">http://avicus.net/forums?topic_id=34</a>&nbsp;and you will more than likely get a reply from an able staff member. ^_^

Yeah it was in the old forums. I never used that, it's sad, if I think of it now.<br>I looked in to the old forums and I think it would be better, if only staff and thread creator can see the threads. I would use it, to ask about other players or ban appeals form others. And yeah, if it won't gets added I aslo would use the email. I sent a detailed email with the Pros and Cons via email. I still hope it gets added.<br>Also thank you for the fast reply :D

What do Managers do? I feel like the fact that I don't even know what they do is like a breakdown in communication on their part.<br><br>I only ever really see 1 Manager post sometimes and I've only seen 2/3 ingame.

I think it is quite good, but I do wish there was a kind of tab for asking admins questions. There probably is one and I just missed it, but if there isn't maybe we could add that. If there is one could you point me towards it? I have a question about teamspeak.
