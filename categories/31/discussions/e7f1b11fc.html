It has been 2 weeks since my ban (Since June 19th). I've contacted&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow">support@avicus.net a day after I was banned, yet no reply (I understand you can be busy but still). I was banned for 'Kill aura'. Jozzmcozz banned me. I contacted him on skype. I talked to him about the ban and stuff. He had the evidence of me hacking yet he doesn't give it to me. Today, (2nd of July) I said Hi Jozzeh, he then removes me as a contact. Was I annoying? No. I respect Jozz and how he does he's job as a moderator of this server. I don't know why he deleted me. I want to see the 'evidence'. Maybe get unbanned?<br>Picture when connecting to the server:&nbsp;http://imgur.com/7oLk9tq</a>

It wasn't being rude, he probably thought you were gonna ask him for the evidence again which would have been really annoying for him, and staff do not have to give you the evidence if they would not wish to, and remember, making a forum post just makes your chances smaller to get appealed

Emails can easily be lost considering the huge amount the staff team receive every day.

Hello.<br><br>I removed you from my contacts list because of the insane amount of Skype contacts I have. I kept the ones who are active, and who are not banned. Sorry if it was rude and unexpected, my apologies.&nbsp;<br>You may add me as a friend again.<br><br>Going back the the evidence. As vlad stated, it's not mandatory to show you proof. However, I can show fellow staff members from preventing appeals.

I've heard the wait time for a response to these "appeal" emails take a long time.<br>Why not just make a forum section called "appeals" where only members of the staff team can reply to a thread?

You have to register for the torums with /register in-game, if you're banned, you cant go on the server, so you can't register.<br><br>We're thinking of ways to have a better appeals system.

If you guys have no idea, why not make a separate "Banned Players" server.<br>A simple server where you spawn in, you have no permission for anything but the register for avicus thing?

I don't think it's fair for someone to get banned without them seeing any evidence at all...&nbsp;<br>If a player is banned, he/she SHOULD be allowed to see the evidence.
