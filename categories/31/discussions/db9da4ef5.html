I don't understand why video is needed to prove this team kill.&nbsp; <br><br>It states in chat what the player did "spleefed into lava".<br><br>Other offenses have been temp banned like being shot off a skybase by the opposing team before walls drop.&nbsp; That offense only seems to need chat evidence.<br><br>Why does this offense need video evidence?&nbsp; What is the difference?&nbsp; Can someone explain?<br><br><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/vS6LeI0.png">

This really does not need video evidence in my opinion. The only thing that needs video evidence to me is when players place lava or fire on you to kill you.

I'm pretty sure that everyone that has played mine-craft has Accidentally spleefed someone before. It's pretty common for someone to break a block as another goes to stand on it and they happened to fall either into lava or the void. It's that reason why we that staff do not go off what chat says in these types of situations.&nbsp;<br><br>A example: You're playing Nebula and you decide to break a block that another user had just walked onto and the chat says you spleefed that user. In this situation i would have to temp-ban you. Would that be right course of action?<br><br>We ask for video proof because it is too simple for anyone to manufacture evidence for this type of punishment. You could of easily been in spectator mode and took a screenshot while someone was near lava.

I guess it's because some sort of lag. I remember sometimes when I used to play Nebula when I was on a bridge with a player from the other team and I hit him off it said spleefed out of the world.<br>Also, the staff want to be sure 100% before they punish a player, so they want to have both evidences before giving a punishment.

If you break a block and someone walks to where that block was a second later and falls, it will be a spleen message. I've accidentally done it before in Nebula.

I will add two more cents and then I will drop it.<br><br>$.01) Nebula and Walls are completely different games with different motivations and types of players.&nbsp; I really don't think you can compare the two.&nbsp; Accidental spleefs on Walls are not as common as on Nebula. There is not as much void to contend with.<br><br>$.02) This map is Village.&nbsp; If you are familiar with this map, you might know the place where this happened.&nbsp; I am on the bottom of the mine getting the diamond that hangs above lava.&nbsp; It is a common place for ill-motivated team members to "hang out" and wait to spleef you.&nbsp; When I approach that area, I always look around me to make sure no one is around.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I thought the coast was clear, but he sneaked up on me and spleefed me.&nbsp; I have been killed here before, as have many players.&nbsp; It is a known troll spot.

No, you can't record every moment, and you can't know when you're about to get team killed, but they can't ban off chat messages. &nbsp;It's not enough. &nbsp;Yeah, It's&nbsp;<i>possible&nbsp;</i>that Murph was team killed, but we can't know, and that's the problem. &nbsp;It's a matter of "Do we just ban everyone who looks suspicious, or be a bit more careful and only punish those who we KNOW broke the rules." &nbsp;If we punish everyone, some people who didn't do anything wrong will get punished, but if we're too careful, some of the actual team killers will get off free. &nbsp;How is that not an obvious choice? &nbsp;An infraction sticks with you forever, and in this situation, there is no appeal, unless the offender had a recording. &nbsp;It's like saying "Well, unless you have a recording of your own basement, we're going to arrest you for murdering the women in your basement because we found your shoes in the basement." Well, yeah, his shoes are there, but maybe he keeps his shoes in the basement. Sorry, that's a weird analogy, but I don't have a better one. &nbsp;<br><br>tl;dr &nbsp;We can't punish this because there's not enough evidence. &nbsp;We need to know for sure that he was killed on purpose, because otherwise people could easily get banned for things they didn't do. &nbsp;You mine out a block and then someone runs over it, and you get a temp ban? &nbsp;Because they can't accept that it wasn't your fault, and they demand someone needs to be punished? It doesn't make sense.

I'm not saying this is helpful, but it's fair. I've accidently spleefed/teamkilled people before, like even myself. Imagine this k. So your just walking along and breaking blocks when a guy jumps into it, and it says u spleefed/teamkilled them. Then you get banned for it. If the mods were to accept this post, everyone would just put up photos of spleef/teamkill and we'd have countless of unfair bans. I'm not saying you're a liar, and I believe you, but I mean, everyone else would see this as "Oh I can get this person banned" and do it. Maybe this is wrong, but it's my opinion on this. :)

My opinion is this, with a screenshot.

So the guy probably wanted to troll and spleef the guy with all the diamonds.</li><li>He stood over the murph's face. Probably null because she is spectating.</li><li>This is walls and the only reason for one to break a bridge is if it'd be in their way... would most likely not cause a team spleef.</li><li>This is in a diamond cave over lava, what purpose could he possibly break a bridge. What, to "stop rushers from attacking the base?" this is walls and in a diamond cave.</li></ul>Most of the observations ive made point that the guy is clearly trolling...
