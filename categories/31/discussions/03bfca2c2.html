Hey guys, I'm sorry to have to make a post like this, and this is mostly directed at the staff, but does anyone who personally knows Ivycode know when he/she will be back into developing OR if Avicus has plans for a new/temporary one, because my experience on Avicus isn't becoming less fun, because i do, infinitely, cherish every moment, but it's becoming very difficult to play with the hubs being down, or timing out every 5 minutes after logging in.<br>I mean, i really have to push myself into reserving time for Avicus, as i am dead in the middle of school and I look forward to getting on after school, but then i get home and the server is down, more people are beginning to doubt the server and even quit and i keep timing out, so does anyone with trustable credibly know when we will have this entire issue/scenario fixed, because id just like to get back to good old Avicus.<br>And it doesn't stop there. Im trying to move along with my YouTube channel but i just can't find recording time with these issues, so that's another problem for me and probably many people.<br><br>And if you're a staff reading this, I'm sorry if this is out of context or spam or whatever, so feel free to lock this post, BUT please at least try to provide an answer or two to the issue.<br><br>Thanks everyone, have a good one :)

As Staff members told us several times Ivy is currently very busy with school exams and soccer practice so his time online on forums is really poor. Also, before all this started i know he was working on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://avicus.net/forums/6f5d0377c">a lot of Avicade minigames and a new game</a>. We also don't know when he is gonna be more active but hope he will soon =)

ivy is currently working with the server, but his online time is really poor, you need a lot of time to code some patchs for fixing the server errors + new gamemodes
