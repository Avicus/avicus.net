Am I wrong or not???<br><br>So avicus has tons of awesome maps right!? Well why not make a TF2 themed map?? Like there is no void, everyone spawns in separate spawns that are pretty much the same, there are different classes, and there could be a variety of game modes too! Please don't count this as spam ._. I want to know everyone's opinions! You guys can disagree with this post if you want :^)<br><br>-senor

I think this is a great idea! What type of game modes from TF2 are you thinking about?

I don't have much experience with TF2 but I dont believe it's maps are quite balanced for minecraft pvp the way nexus is. Also there are quite a lot of TF2 maps already made. I would however like to see some of the themes from TF2 maps be used to create maps.

OCN has tf2 maps. Why should we? Just make a map that looks like tf2 with different kits

Capture the flag, Special Delivery! Obviously CTF would work best, because of nebula!

+1<br>&nbsp;Lets Do The Pros And Cons Method.<br>Lets Start With The Pros. So It May Be Kind Of Cool And Fun To Play.&nbsp;<br>Cons: &nbsp;I Suggest Not Mixing The Gamemodes Together, And Also; If We Have To Many Gamemodes And Players Are Not Focused Or Not Willing To Change From Another Gamemode, It May Be Waste Of Money Hosting More Servers.<br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This Is A Big Risk, But I Think If All Avicadians Are Willing To Accept It, Go Ahead!<br><b>JUST KIDDING I HAVE NO AUTHORITY TO ACCEPT</b><br><br><img alt="" src="http://brittanybanning.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Accepted-Offer.jpg">

Sounds good! Maybe some TF2 gamemodes like Capture the Flag / King of the Hill will do ;) But do have to note that to make this gametypes, more plugins will have to be used in the server, and may cause more lag to the server. I could be wrong :P

I fully support this idea, especially since I am a big fan of TF2! I think that some of the maps could work very well, and I'd love to see some added. Terrific idea!

I'd love a CTW map with TF2-things. Maybe it could be a sub gamemode of Nebula or Nexus.<br><br>I also think some Control Point Maps would be cool for CTH<br><br>+1

I think a map like Turbine would be great, because in the middle of turbine, there is that huge open area, and If we create a map designed like turbine, that area would provide a huge area for PVP. I was also wondering about the classes... What would a pyro do? have like a flame bow? Would a spy have invis pots? What do you guys think? Tell me what ya think about this! I'm really happy everyone wants a map that is TF2 themed!!
