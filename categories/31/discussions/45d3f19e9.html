Maybe if all the bugs in OiTC could be worked out, it might be re-added.

I think a gamemode like minotaour, but instead "JailBreak" would be really cool. You spawn in a "cell" (inside of a prison) where it could be 10 prisoners vs 1 mino/guard. The jail is made out of obsidian but you spawn with stone tools. It is your job too open your cell and find a way to get out before the guard catches you.

Clash of clans in minecraft. It's like a game of walls. You have 10 minutes to prepare and then war. There will be defense towers that shoot tnt and stuff. There will be resource collectors that collect automatically and players can do stuff to speed it up. There will be walls that block people that can be broken.You can train warriors to attack the other base when it is attacking time. &nbsp;Zombies=Barbarians, Skeletons=Archers,Goblins=Baby Zombies, Giants=Iron Golems, Wall Breakers a creeper, Balloons a non fireball firing ghast with a tnt/creeper spawner, etc. Players are like a barbarian king of archer queen, and can attack and defend, and take some time to respawn. When attacking you can break the core blocks of a resource collector to get resources. After 5 minutes or so of warfare, gameplay pauses so that people can rebuild and stuff. If a game doesn't end quickly stuff will happen like easier to break core blocks. The hall has a bunch of core blocks that contain some resources. Break the town hall core blocks to win.<br><br>That's my rushed idea of a clash of clans war thingy.

I really like the idea of COC. It sounds very creative! It's like a walls game with classes!

2 teams- attack/defense<br><br>Defenders have 15 minutes to build a castle/defense around their monument-type thingy and attackers likewise have 15 minutes to prepare by making armor, potions, enchanting, etc. <br><br>When the 15 minutes is gone an invisible barrier goes down that allows the attacking team to assault the defenders fortress. The game will have a set amount of time, like 30 or 45 minutes.
