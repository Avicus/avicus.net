Hello,<br><br>We'd like to have a community vote on whether Quintus should either be <b>edited back</b>,<b>&nbsp;stay the same</b> or&nbsp;<b>be completely removed from the rotations in atlas</b>.<br><br>Please consider that the old version was mainly just a kill farm map that didn't really have much proper gameplay. If you're wanting the map to be edited back or stay the same for a reason such as "oh its a nostalgic map" or "its my favourite map", your vote will not be counted. We want your opinion on the map based on the gameplay.<br><br>When voting, please write down a reason for your choice too.

I actually find having two&nbsp;monuments increases stalemate matches. So I say keep the widened channel and lack of diamond to prevent excessive kill farming but revert back to five monuments; also the name means 'five lives'. For tradition I say keep the monument amount for nostalgia sake.

<b>Quintus is a favorite map to many players</b>, so I would hate to see it go. It just needs a few changes.<br><br>With the 2 mons now, it seems an easier objective and teams just bridge across void, control top of spawn, and bridge to mons. &nbsp;Many teams ignore top of spawn and it becomes an easy win for the other team.<br><br><b>Remove all diamonds</b>...that's what creates the kill farming.<br><br>I like the old 5 mons because I like longer matches and there were more mons to pay attention to. &nbsp;It seems like more players would help with defense with 5 mons.<br><br>Another suggestion is to <b>have 3 mons</b> by adding another one farther back behind spawn. &nbsp;We've created our own "3rd mon" in battles before and sometimes it helps with defense.<br><br><b>Quintus is a keeper!</b>

I'm gonna rant anyway l0l<br><br><br>First thing I wanna talk about is kill farming, yes, it's improved recently and is less common on Quintus although it's a big flaw with the map. The diamond armour is very overpowered against the leather armour and the layout pretty much makes a prebuilt kill farming area for you.Not to mention the fact that the only way to push is going straight out of spawn, if this is being kill farmed players will constantly die. If you was a new player here you wouldn't like you first experience to be getting excessively spawn killed would you?<br><br><br>The maps layout has large flaws also that make defence incredibly hard and make offence easy if not noticed. Any team pushing against good organisation will struggle to get past the front lines, let alone to the monuments.<br><br><br>The only reason it was kept was for nostalgia and honestly I'd rather not want to play a terribly designed map because it is "old" and brings back "memories", not to mention that throwback is being removed so there is no point in keeping it so it's time to ditch it.

Quintus actually does have poor gameplay, or at least it did in the ultra kill farm era. The problem is there are two ways to reach the other team's side. On the ground or bridging over the void. The second option is much riskier, leading to players choosing the first option more often. This means that by blocking off the "courtyard" area and killfarming, you can effectively stall the game and the offense, since trying your luck with bridges is still very hard, due to the lack of cover, central islands, ect. One could argue that skybridges offer a solution, but more often then not, the skybridges start from the courtyard area anyways, rendering the inaccessible during a killfarm. In addition, with the amount of diamonds on the map, a death of one full diamond player could potentially cause a 2-Set swing and unbalance the map. While the community love for the map is strong and the map started off well, it has aged poorly and its flaws being exposed.&nbsp;<br><br>I don't entirely disagree with you; I think it should be reverted, but with the removal of all diamonds except the swords. However, saying the current or even recent past versions of the map are amazing may be stretching it. To me it was more of a sloppy, depressingly pointless stalemate.

It's insane to me that it's taken this long for at least a few of the communities members to realise how horrible the map is. A clear remove.<br><br>As I suggested 8 months ago when I was mapdev, something like that atleast, remove it completely, but save it.

Remove diamonds, revert to 5 mons. Quintus just isn't quintus without five mons.In fact&nbsp;G_SKIPPY&nbsp;named it "quintus" becouse it had five mons (quint = five). Yes remove the diamonds becouse they cause a lot of farming, but please revert to having 5 mons. In most cases, the first 3 mons are taken within the first 5 minuts anyways.

Quintus actually does have poor gameplay, or at least it did in the ultra kill farm era. The problem is there are two ways to reach the other team's side. On the ground or bridging over the void. The second option is much riskier, leading to players choosing the first option more often. This means that by blocking off the "courtyard" area and killfarming, you can effectively stall the game and the offense, since trying your luck with bridges is still very hard, due to the lack of cover, central islands, ect. One could argue that skybridges offer a solution, but more often then not, the skybridges start from the courtyard area anyways, rendering the inaccessible during a killfarm. In addition, with the amount of diamonds on the map, a death of one full diamond player could potentially cause a 2-Set swing and unbalance the map. While the community love for the map is strong and the map started off well, it has aged poorly and its flaws being exposed.&nbsp;<br><br>I don't entirely disagree with you; I think it should be reverted, but with the removal of all diamonds except the swords. However, saying the current or even recent past versions of the map are amazing may be stretching it. To me it was more of a sloppy, depressingly pointless stalemate.

What I don't understand is, why can't we have 5 monuments with the current kill farming protection?

<b>Edit back!<br></b><b></b><br>For the first time I played the new Quintus everyone was saying: ''WTF???"<br>After that everyone started swearing about they have to change it back and I think mayby 2/10 will remove quintus<br>Mayby we have to make an other game on quintus like ctw or tdm, cause I am lagging pretty much sometimes and that is a pretty big problem.<br>It's one of the oldest maps on avicus and it's the gameplay is pretty special, I understand people why they say:''the gameplay sucks''., but that is why it's a nice and original map, the gameplay is different and I think that is a nice thing so see against its sucks.<br><br><br><b>Thank you, Phil</b>

the only people saying it has bad gameplay is staff. I have played on this server for like 3 years-ish and it was one of my favorites, but now its boring, so therefore i think it should be edited back, diamonds and all. I dont want diamonds to be removed because it makes it easier for people to guard. It should be edited back to original.

Bring back quintus, and bring back G_Skippy. Man is a god at making maps, also, its not that bad, you can add a few tweaks to it though:<br>1) push kf limit further (the redstone line) to middle of the big part. This will allow more room to make better decisions and gives the farmers a harder time maintaining the hoard.<br><br>2) (btw the text is cut off so i might make silly errors) tske out iron supply teleportation portals. I think those cause some of the lag but for the most part, nobody uses them and it's obstructing &nbsp;the spawn defenders (people who sit in spawn defending wkth bow). I cant think of any other way that only that map causes lag though<br>3) reduce, or abolish all the diamond in the map, to limit the kf opportunity. <br><br>Thats all I got so far, any thoughts?

Btw I just talked to Sli about it and he said that he wouldn't count the votes of people who only wanted it back for nostalgia, idk why, but anyway the map isn't going back into rotations, but there will possibly be a throwback day once a week or something like that where there will be old maps. He said it isn't a top priority, but if you bug the Map Devs about it I'm sure it will get done soon!

The reason Quintus is called "Quintus" in the first place is because of the 5 monuments, as someone has already stated. The word Quintus, in Ancient (and/or Modern) Greek actually means 5 lives or 5th life, so having the 2 monuments kind of takes away the Quintus feel.<br><br>#RevertOrRemove!
