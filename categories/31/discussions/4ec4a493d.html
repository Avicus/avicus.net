Ivy / Para / Evocal / Mods Etc...<br><br>Would it be possible to drop some of the walls maps onto a Beta server, knowing there may be bugs / game-play issues and have the players play them if they want before they are placed into a server rotation? The Beta server can have all the walls development maps or newly submitted maps that the map developers think would be a good fit. It is kinda like a trial run for maps..... Could be done for other game modes also if needed.<br><br><br>Thanks - Thoughts?

Good idea...<br>I don't see why not since it would make the maps 100% ready for public release :P

They're beta for a reason. The best you can get is the MapDev server which occasionally is open for events...

Beta as in first tryout...... not as in unfinished para.. &nbsp;All newly submitted maps go there first, if I wasn't clear.... We can find out any game play problems there and not in normal rotations.

I definitely agree to add this, I've tried the server mapdev but no one goes on it and there some maps you can't do unless there several, just like you advertise team speak in the hub to place a beta map server will be good. &nbsp;And on the forums could they officially announce new maps add the games? It would be nice to be inform in map submissions!

I can add on to this. We have a beta server where we play maps in beta. At the end of each map there is a voting system where users decide if u want this map in the rotation on avicus. It should be like that.

Would be great! Lots of servers have a map vote system. Could be really simple to get going. Also, If we want great maps on Avicus, we should actually see the maps that have been submitted, some maps have been submitted for months and no one has put them in rotation or spoken about them after the "approve" from a map dev. &nbsp;Lots of people have made maps and I am sure they would like their map to be tested out...
