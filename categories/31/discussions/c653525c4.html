So... Avicus is shutting down.<br><br>I've been on and off, shit on the server but have also praised it.<br><br>I joined the Avicus Network February 14th 2014. I've made friends, I've lost friends, but Avicus was a key factor in my life.<br><br>If you guys don't know, I am turning 18 on December 28th 2017, in 3 days (Merry Christmas BTW) and have been wanting to get a tattoo.<br>I've spoken as a joke about getting an Avicus tattoo for the memes, but honestly this server itself has been such a big influence in my life, and I have invested heavily into it that I honestly feel it deserves to be imprinted on me permanently.<br><br>I am here to call out you graphic designers to design a tattoo that would be going on the upper inside of my left arm, and hopefully if I like any of the designs, I will take it. If not, I will just use the logo.<br><br>I won't be getting it on my birthday because I'm broke atm and am getting paid the next day, but I hopefully will get the tattoo before the 30th of January to be able to share it with you guys.<br><br>It's been a really great 4 years with you all and it's been amazing to see this server grow as a whole.<br>I am going to miss every single one of you, whether we have had our personal differences, or we were of best of friends, I wish that you all an amazing last month on Avicus. It will definitely be missed and be one of my favourite minecraft servers of all times. I will definitely never forget this.<br>~Vlad

It's honestly not just a minecraft server to me.<br><br>This is the place where I've changed as a person as a whole. I wouldn't do it for any other server, including MCSG, which I would praise at any moment.

In all seriousness, the simple 'AV' logo would probably look the best; if you do go forward with it please send it to me on snapchat- I'd love to see it. :-)

if you get the AV logo you essentially have an incorrectly drawn vape nation tattoo, just to point that out
