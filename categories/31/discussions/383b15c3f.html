Yes Listen to the pig!<br><br><br>But in all seriousness you apply when they are open, you will be accepted and put into interviews if accepted then you will be Jr.Mod if you do your job you go to moderator if they want you to be a jr.mod a bit longer thats's what happens, Howsie22 is in charge of this if you have any other questions either get in contact with him or avigill and he can give you howsie's skype.

hehe<br><br>1. Caring is good but not too much or you seem like a pedo sometimes.<br>2. You got a warn for spamming and a warn for hackusating<br>3. You have 4 tempbans for team killing<br>4. Does it matter if you look at team killers? You have to be able report them<br>5. How does lots of friends help you become moderator except increase the amount of players online?<br>6. Will you make the server more&nbsp;<b>poplar</b> with #5?<br>7. o.o wow, looks like I am manager for being diamond.<br>Show your innerself and express the hapiness of PVP in game by playing &lt;3 not making this when the apps are closed &lt;3
