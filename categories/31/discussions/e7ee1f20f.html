Alright so recently Tazz and myself have trained most of the moderators to conduct Screen sharing on players who we think are hacking. There have been a couple of issues recently so i need to go over a few house keeping rules.<br><br>If you refuse to be screen shared, you will be banned. No questions asked. Refusing tells us you are hiding something.&nbsp;<br><br>When you are told to come on Teamspeak and NOT TO DISCONNECT FROM MINECRAFT, you don't disconnect, &nbsp;you listen to the moderator. Logging off could get you <b>permanently</b>&nbsp;<b>banned</b>, regardless if you are hacking or not.&nbsp;<br><br>When you are asked by the Staff member to come on Teamspeak and screen share do <b>NOT</b> delay.&nbsp;<br><br>If you admit you have been hacking, before the screen sharing occurs, then we will be more lenient with your appeal.&nbsp;<br><br>Listen to every instruction the moderator gives. Refusing to do something a moderator says is seen as you hiding something and a <b>permanent</b> <b>ban</b> could follow.&nbsp;<br><br>As the rules state, if we find any unauthorised clients you <b>WILL</b> be <b>permanently</b> <b>banned</b>.&nbsp;<br><br>We will be cracking down. I have a list i am going through of people who have been a bit suspicious recently, if you are asked to screen share then stay calm and listen to the moderator.&nbsp;<br><br>- Posighdun &amp; Tazz
