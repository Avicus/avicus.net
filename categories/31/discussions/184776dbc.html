I have not discussed this with the other map developers, but I am making a pull request to where we can discuss nexus changes. The changes will be some icon changes, EULA compliancy, fixed balancing, and kit edits as well as possibly new kits.<br><br><b>Please suggest changes below.</b> I will gladly take note of your idea and implement it. The current kit layout is at&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://maps.avicus.net/Shared/nexus-kits.yml">http://maps.avicus.net/Shared/nexus-kits.yml</a>.<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://pastie.org/private/0cxw6h5hyattua2ecu30tg">http://pastie.org/private/0cxw6h5hyattua2ecu30tg</a>&nbsp;So far:

Here's my Nexus kit change ideas. You don't have to consider them if you don't want to.&nbsp;<br><br>Warrior: leather boots have feather falling 2<br>Archer: fine<br>Medic: health boost (2 extra hearts)<br>Snake: speed 1, no helmet<br>Sniper: increase to 40 arrows<br>Scout: fine<br>Pyro: change the gold armor to leather<br>Barbarian: fine<br>Engineer: iron chestplate 5 TNT (not 3)<br>Freezer: 5 snowballs? Idk<br>Spy : fine<br>Heavy: fine<br>Enderman: projectile protection 4 on all the armor (ever tried shooting an enderman?), 7 enderpearls<br><br>Yeah, other than that you could add arrows, TNT, instant damage 1 potions and remove steak from the shop

Warrior could use a small boost, it's hard to win with medic in most fights, snake is underpowered at the moment, sniper is not that much better than archer and could use a bit of a bump up, pyro needs a big nerf, engineer is fun but it's not very good, no one even uses freezer, and enderman is fun, but again it's not that good, for the last kit you unlock.

Currently, I bumped warrior up to be a little better since it's the first kit. I lowered snake to level 2 and buffed it slightly as well. Pyro was nerfed well, and endermen was made better and more balanced.

For barbarian, slow digging doesn't affect the amount of hits you place on the enemy, meaning you'll be able to hit them normally without any affect. (Seth &amp; I tested that)

You're wrong. It's called Mining Fatigue in Minecraft, and it makes you hit slower.

Para we tested this on Alexander's server. I drank a Haste 2 Potion and I still hit as fast as I hit normally. I also tried a mining fatigue 2 potion and it hit the same as a haste &nbsp;2 which is the normal hit speed. Then I maxed out the Potions (level 63) and it had no effect either. Confirmed.<br><br>Haste was made to make you break blocks faster. Mining fatigue makes you break blocks slower.

Haste has no combat effect. Not sure about mining fatigue, though.

that's what we tested, its like haste, it only affects your mining speed, not your hitting speed.

I think Nexus should be more like the old Nexus Back in MCZone. I don't like the xp system, its just annoying since higher level people will just destroy lower level people and lower level people will have a harder time getting kills and raising there level. I think the leveling system should be more like <a rel="nofollow" href="http://avicus.net/forums/f701236cc">THIS</a>, don't let the xp system affect gameplay but rather make goals to race for ranking and prestiges. So I believe kits should not be rewarded for xp levels and must always be unlocked like back in MCZone. Also, please let all kits be given to each person even if they are not a donator. To fix the donator's problems, just add more random perks, they shouldn't be too hard to come up with.<br><u>Anyway, with that said this is what I think the kits should be like:</u><br>Warrior - Full leather, iron sword, bow, and 24 arrows<br>Barbarian - Full leather and diamond sword<br>Medic - Full gold, gold sword, splash heal potion, splash regeneration, and 5 apples rather than 3<br>Pyro - Full gold, iron axe with fire aspect 1 ,and infinite fire resistance<br>Sniper - Chain helmet and chestplate, power 1, infinity, and sharpness 2 bow, and 1 arrow<br>Archer - Gold helmet and chestplate, punch 2, infinity, and sharpness 2 bow, and 1 arrow (Gold armor to tell difference between Sniper)<br>Scout - Full leather, speed 3 (or 2), jump boost 2, no fall damage, and stone sword<br>Tank - Full chain except iron chestplate and stone sword<br>Spy - Infinite invisibility and iron sword<br>Enderman - Full leather, 5 enderpearls, 1 extra enderpearl after 3 kills, and stone sword<br>Engineer - Full leather, 3 tnt that blows up once placed, and stone sword<br>Freezer - Full leather, 10 snowballs that slow down enemies, and stone sword<br><span>Orc (Think that was the old name) - Diamond sword with sharpness 3 (or 5)<br>Leech - Full leather, stone sword, restores 4 hearts after each kill</span>

The only issue with that is changing EVERYTHING back to the way it was. As much as I'd like it that way, it'd be sorta tough to revert it back. Also if all the kits are balanced now, what difference does it make?
