Guess it's time to confess..<br>I used to play Walls a lot before I joined the MCZone forums. I had an xray texture pack my friend installed that I was only going to use in SSP, but I accidentally kept it on when I played Walls again.<br>I was still new to MC and everything, and I didn't know this stuff was illegal, before I uninstalled it for good.<br>I knew where all the chests, caves, ores, and players were. I won that match, and kept on using it.<br><br>It's uninstalled now, but I feel guilty for not being caught and winning "illegally."
