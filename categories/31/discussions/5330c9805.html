Before you get your guns ready to load on me here me out. &nbsp;When Polar was map dev he the "walls expert" in the group and he worked very closely with the walls community to add more maps and gameplay to the gamemode. &nbsp;Some people who don't know the server well thought Polar owned walls because of how essential he was to the improvement of the gamemode. &nbsp;I know you guys did give map devs game modes to focus on but if we're being honest will any of them take the charge that Polar did? &nbsp;I suggest finding a map maker who is known to making walls map (Random_Guy is one who comes on top of my head) to take on the role Polar did. &nbsp;Of course they should also take their time with other game modes but we need someone who can talk with the walls community with what should happened next or any questions on map making. &nbsp;Any suggestion? Bad idea? Let me know.

RIP itaity &amp; Polar_Express<br><br>Anyhow, I don't think we're looking out for any new Map Developers as of now since Dil and Seth (dilpickel and Zerkk) were recently promoted. I know what you mean, though, there's not anyone who really works with Walls as itaity and Polar did, but I'll bring up suggestions to the team to increase our efficiency in that gamemode (with our current crew, of course).<br>Thanks for your suggestion!

Guys, we have found our new mapdev. Wandom_Guy. He is amazing at building maps. Think about this. People who have built maps for the server that play walls and did the YML their selves.

Nobody even remembers itaity anymore, I guess. .-.<br>Anyways, we actually have plenty of map Devs for now in my opinion. By the way, might wanna fix the title. xD

I don't think we need to have someone promoted to a position of just being a "Walls only MapDev". I would perfer if the other Map Developers too time to learn the mechanics of the gamemode instead. That way we could have more Map Devs with knowledge of the gamemode rather than just one. <br><br>That's pretty much my current thoughts.

I agree with Ky so much. They should learn walls yml. They should make walls maps. Like come on guys. I love nebula maps so why can't you guys make those maps but into a walls version/
