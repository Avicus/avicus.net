Actually Zedd has a valid point. And I don't get why his posts got deleted/archived.<br>Only because he is now Jr mod he doesn't has the right to delete Zedds posts, on a normal AMA the posts would stay.&nbsp;<br>PS.: Don't try to delete/archive my posts aswell. I'll do the same as Zedd.

Thank you, Flo.<br><br>As I was trying to say, if you're going to leave, stay that way. If you make a post saying that you're leaving, you don't have the right to just come back a few months later willy nilly and expect everything to be fine.
