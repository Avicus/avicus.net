Today I stumbled across the server [IP-REDACTED] (german) and saw that they have a gamemode exactly like dtm... They have far more players... I would like it if you looked after gamemode "minecraft cores" in yt and watch a video. Please tell me what you think about it. THIS SHOULD NOT BE ANY ADVERTISEMENT. I am just annoyed by them taking your idea or maybe from another server ._.

I don't think this is much of a problem. Overcast had destroy the monument before us, yet they aren't trying to take us down. We have no copyright or anything on the gamemode so I don't think anything can be done. Don't take my word for it, but I really don't think anything will happen. :&lt;

Many servers have objectives gamemodes, whether it is DTM, CTW or CTF. This isn't the only one. And yea like what Badger said, it isn't much of a problem.

The problem was that their owner was talking like "our new gamemode" I think they should at least have sayed that they didn't invent it by their own. They have like 20000 slots '-' But I think you are right, it still won't be like avicus :D

You understood it wrong? It's their server's new gamemode, nothing wrong.

What's the policy on game modes? How does this work with sky wars, prison, survival, creative, and etc.<br>being on a variety of servers. I know Avicus has special game modes, but why can't other people use<br>the idea?

No policy, it's just a block game, you can have whatever gamemodes you want.

No one said that other people can't use the idea. Avicus has more unique gamemodes which are enjoyable.

Oh I have no real problem with them taking the gamemode. I think my post sounds a bit wrong, I just wanted to get your opinion on this ;)
