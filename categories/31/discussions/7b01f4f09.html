I guess this is the best way to ask a lot of people this question.<br><br>What can I do to become a better Moderator?<br>I always strive to become a better staff member but haven't received a lot of feedback from the community.<br>So I thought this would be a good opportunity for me to listen to what you guys have to say.<br><br>Don't sugarcoat things, don't be afriad to offend. <br>I want to become better than before and I need your help.<br><br>&lt;3

&nbsp;All seriousness your a great friend and an amazing mod to work with. If your looking to improve how you moderate then look at your feedback spreadsheet and try to improve on what the seniors have asked you to work on.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>You could ban yourself a little bit more often. :)

Imo, I don't see anything what you could do to improve, but it's only my opinion so other players would have other opinions...

"Get your ass out there and become a leader. Work as a team with the other mods and try not to cover for other mods just so they can look good. You will look good if you act as a leader. Open up to more players and try not to act damn defensive. This is based off info that I got and it might not be right. Everything else is a team problem&nbsp;<br>~K_Cord

So the only thing you can do to improve is simple lighten up a bit. You always act so robotic when responding to topics on the forums and ingame, also don't jump the gun and lock topics so quickly, its very annoying when you're trying to have a serious discussion on the forums and it gets locked shortly after leave it to the senior staff.

Like 99 said, don't lock topics instantly as if you are defusing a bomb to prevent an explosion.

I love you Snow. Honestly, if I were you, I would take a little break from Avi, go to another server, apply for staff. If you get the rank, and become mod, then moderate for a month and then leave (unless you dont wanna =P) Then you would get another perspective of how a server should be like, or shouldn't.

I can let a few things<br><br>-be a leader, be an example for other moderators. Don't let the senior staff intimidate you.<br><br>-don't lock posts excessively. I know you're just trying to stop flame,but wait and see how it plays out. Don just lock it immediately.<br><br>-Maybe seem a little less strict<br>I know this is less important, but a lot of players I've known have seen you as kind of strict, because you act that way. Maybe be a little bit more laid back, but that's up to you.<br><br>Otherwise, your honestly the best mod I know.<br>Keep it up, Mate.<br>:)

Well,&nbsp;<br><br>1) loosen up, joke more. I've spoke with you on ts once, and it was fun, now take the good personality and take it other places&nbsp;<br><br>2) don't be so hasty when locking topics&nbsp;<br><br>3) Stop being so defensive constantly, from what I can't tell, it just irritates the community. Tbh, being able to admit it openly.Is admirable and looks a hell of a lot better.

I've been making an effort to make my infractions a little more specific.<br><br>Ex) Saying "Hacked Client" instead of "Hacking".<br>I've also formatted it to make it [at least seem] more professional.<br><br>I started doing this after having a chat with Howsie a few weeks ago. <br><br>He talked about how he used to encourage people to be more specific when issuing out infractions.<br>He encouraged people to add "Team Griefing" before the actual reason etc etc.<br><br>I liked what he was saying and adopted it to an extent.<br><br>Adding the two colons between the broad and specific punishment made it seem more tidy in my opinion.

Just seems a bit out of place with the formatting. I would personally think "Hacking - Fly" is something that should be used but not putting chat<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; ">&nbsp;violation ::&nbsp; before each swearing or spam related punishment. Just my opinion if every staff member was doing this it would be fine, but just one doing it seems pointless and confusing.</span>
