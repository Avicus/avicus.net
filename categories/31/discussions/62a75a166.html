Alright! So, some of you guys may know I made a little rant due to this thread:&nbsp;<a href="https://avicus.net/forums/3d33280db" title="Link: https://avicus.net/forums/3d33280db">https://avicus.net/forums/3d33280db</a>&nbsp;not being locked... It was&nbsp;<b>not</b> a leaving thread, he clearly stated he might leave, it is against the rules, I was even told by a mod the rules&nbsp;<b>IN</b> that post that it's only for repetitive times. Now this thread :<a href="https://avicus.net/forums/2fd837543" title="Link: https://avicus.net/forums/2fd837543">https://avicus.net/forums/2fd837543</a>&nbsp;has been locked for&nbsp;<b>being</b> a leaving thread. When the last time I noticed as long as your not coming back the thread is fine.<br>And even if it is against the rules the other post should have been locked as well no? Because many of the staff team thought it was a leaving thread.<br>&nbsp;<br>This isn't fully a rant but more a suggestion to get your knowledge straight for locking. Because one was totally legal and the other one was not and the one that was fine was&nbsp;<b>locked</b> and the other&nbsp;<b>was not</b>.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Please take this in consideration!<br></b><b></b>I hate seeing injustice, which is the reason why I'm making this post. Bias? I'm not sure, I'm gonna leave it to you guys to decide.<br>&nbsp;<br>Best Regards!<br>Vlad<br><br><b>Edit:</b> Here are more post(s) that are leaving threads or maybe leaving threads that were not locked and are recent:<br><a href="https://avicus.net/forums/e906852c7" title="Link: https://avicus.net/forums/e906852c7">https://avicus.net/forums/e906852c7</a><br><a href="https://avicus.net/forums/c5d7dc459" title="Link: https://avicus.net/forums/c5d7dc459">https://avicus.net/forums/c5d7dc459</a><br><a href="https://avicus.net/forums/196f2e278" title="Link: https://avicus.net/forums/196f2e278">https://avicus.net/forums/196f2e278</a>

Completely agree. Unless there's a very good reason to write a leaving post, they should be kept private and be left off the forums.<br><br>However, I disagree with locking either of Dubby's or Rile's posts; they were both well-respected mods, and should at least be given a chance to explain what happened.

nono, the reason for this post is that Leaving Threads&nbsp;<b>are allowed</b> from my knowledge as long as you do not come back or say that you "Might Come Back".<br>I do understand that Dubby and Rile were well-respected mod&nbsp;<b>but</b> the staff team is always stressing on how the staff team is not above the rules&nbsp;<b>at all</b> therefore if leaving threads are not allowed regardless of being well-respected or not their post should be locked.

I agree with this.<br><br>Leaving post is fine for everybody if it's a goodbye forever post, temporary goodbyes are what are not allowed from what I've learned and I also think that is what is most fair

I'm sorry, that I locked Endsys leaving post.<br>I made a big mistake as I locked it, because it was the wrong post.<br>The leaving post from Endsy was perfectly fine, since he wanted to leave permanent.<br>Actually I wanted to lock another thread that violated the forum rules.

In my opinion I think we just need some proper guidelines for the forums.<br>&nbsp;As much as I would like to think that peoples common sense is enough. People have different opinions and over time it has just led to very inconsistent locks/Archives.<br><br>Glad you made this post.
