So I don't really keep up with things anymore so if the answer is simple, forgive me.<br><br>Now that Owners and Admins have their own ranks, how does Kyoal and Tyler stand out from Distraction, Passively and Micah?<br>What do the Admins do that the Senior Mods don't? Considering the Owners run this server, what do Admins do now?<br><br>Maybe it's just because I'm not really here anymore, but I look at the 2 Admins as glorified Sr Mods.<br>Publicly, the Admins don't seem to do much.. Passively and Distracion have a bigger presence on the forums than the 2 Admins for example.<br><br>Not trying to start shit or anything, I'm just curious I guess.

Good question tbh. I've been wondering <a href="https://avicus.net/forums/discussions/3361609be" rel="nofollow" title="Link: https://avicus.net/forums/discussions/3361609be">what the Srs have been doing for a bit now...</a><br><br>Permission wise they obviously have more access. I think the "staff response" would be that Owners run the backend of the server, like Keenan running the business end &amp; ALM focusing on the development (though ALM obviously plays a bigger part in just development). Therefore the Admins would be left with running the staff team, and they probably have a say in the server direction as well.<br><br>But seriously, I have no idea what the Admins do these days that is different than that of a Sr. I'm not even sure what the Sr team does.

Forums wise the Sr Team posts are either Map Development related or application related..<br>There doesn't seem to be any real direction which is a shame.

That's cause the Srs are Map Devs, but like it still doesn't tell us what the Srs are doing as Srs.
