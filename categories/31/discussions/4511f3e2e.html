I've been demoted at 10:58 am on Thursday the 22nd of October, 2015 for reasons confidential to the senior staff team.<br><br>I'll still be active on all platforms and scrim with Apollo, just won't be in the staff team anymore.<br><br>I really am sorry about how I acted yesterday, I hope you understand why I was so mad... you know who you are.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Aura<br><br>-Demoted Senior Moderator.

I know how a demotion feels first hand, mine doesn't seem as serious as yours but the experience is the same. I am happy your not leaving because you aren't staff anymore because I have seen others follow that path. If you ever need me for anything I am here but by the sounds of things you seem alright on your own...

Wow, it must be hard feeling going through a demotion. The fact that I have never gone through a demotion I can't really feel the pain, but I got a straight idea of it.

Well, this is my opinion. I don't see why this should be a sad day. For me the staff in this server (which I love a lot) is useless, I mean, that yes you try to do somethings, but I don't see any change.<br>So Aura if you did something bad, accept the consequence, and don't post that, because I think you are trying to feel sad, to get support of the &nbsp;people. Note: this is only my opinion, any negative answer will imply consequences.

Why are the staff useless? There wouldn't be any server. Please explain your logic to me? Also Aura was a great mod.... And you can't deal out consequences... xD
