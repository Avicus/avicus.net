</h1>
Hello.<br><br>I've been around for 2 years however I didn't play for about a year in the middle. Former Mod and Dev on Avalanche. I upload videos on the youtube account:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRYi0KSqwR8fbwCDHHen2Ug" title="Link: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRYi0KSqwR8fbwCDHHen2Ug">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRYi0KSqwR8fbwCDHHen2Ug</a>. I'm current part of Big Dango Family on OCN and currently I am on Apollo here, on Avicus. I have been part of Bad Company and Team Lightning here and numerous teams such as Ambush, EffV, Storm, VnD and Escalate; I played HCF on Shotbow for 15 maps (13-28) however only actively for the first 7.&nbsp;<br><br>I returned to Avicus after my IRL friend (Notal) asked me to make a team with him. I didn't really want to recruit one myself seeing as I didn't know anyone so I would be useless, however I would lead in game and be more active when we had a base roster. However, I joined BC after Notal approached me. I thought I was a leader from the start because of that and that is why my attitude was so bad. I have more of a firm leading style which Avicus players are not used to. Yes, I will answer questions about why I was kicked.<br><br>I consider myself a very good objective player who is also a good tactician. My comms have improved over time and I believe I have changed after I was kicked. I am sorry for my past attitude, I didn't realise it was that bad&nbsp;until I was kicked.<br><br>AMA

You've really improved a lot; you're becoming one of the best skybridgers here. You're very chill and you're comms are good. The only downfall is that you take things a bit to serious :D

Really good defender, quite good with a sword and bow. Your attitude is really good and I look up to that. Whenever Barney and I argued you would tell us to stop, and when we didn't I felt bad. You're doing a really good team leading BC.

Cringey name. I hate you sometimes but it doesn't last long. You actually put up a really close fight against me on pot, more than what you do to the other solid PvPers in BC. You're improving with the bow and sword. Even before the first tourney you were solid skybridger and Barney and I saw that and left you up there when we did some big ass push and won the game. Sometimes you're immature (in game) and you take some jokes too seriously but I really like you.

Thank you.&nbsp;<br><br>You're a very good archer and you're quickly improving with a sword. I think your comms lack however. I think you will be on a top tier team soon.

I would never try to talk to you with that attitude of yours. I found you very annoying and rude.<br><br>I'm glad that you have changed, I hope things are still good after getting kicked. Hope to know you better.

...<br>Tourney? I've always loved RFV2, Ring Race, SSB and Airship.<br>Senex Scrim and Rendezvous are good.

You're really chill. I wanted you in BC so I didn't have to play against you LOL. I was really confused that you left and then lied about the reason; I understand that you left to play with friends instead of playing with the best team to win, but why would you say you weren't playing at all? I understand that's you and how you are, as in you don't want to upset anyone but people prefer the truth. You're also very unique, in a good way. You don't take the game seriously at all expect when you have to which I like.<br><br>Moving on to you as a player, you're an extremely good PvPer and you fuck me on Avicus but on Kohi/ Para are fights are a lot closer and I normally win (&lt;3). The only downside is the same with Jive, you don't talk much because you physically can't.

Avalanche is a server owned by 123mpc (or letters then numbers) and Haribo was the developer however I helped develop. This is where Nebula came from. A lot of known OCN players from that time (ylo, pmheys, me etc.) were mods. It was just like OCN like this is and the main part of the Nebula plugin right now was created by Haribo more than 2 years ago.

There was a very unorganised unofficial tournament just after I had been kicked from BC. From that, I asked BmB if he wanted to make a more organised event with me.<br><br>For the maps, I'm not sure. I just got bored one day and started something with Jive and Robin. That map never got anywhere and got abandoned. Then, Robin asked for some feedback on his map, that he said he was about to abandon. I saw potential in it and I took it over. Next, Sli asked me if Barney and I wanted to be added to the trello so we could judge maps, and I said yea, I'll sort it out later. However, later that day BmB got Jr. MapDev and I thought it was for both of us because of the past offer ROFL so I asked for it as well.<br><br>Best experience on Avicus was probably beating Berzerk in the Semis.<br><br>I really like you however I don't really know a lot about you. Because you have no mic, I don't really know you if that makes sense. I think that you're a quite capable offender however when I played for Apollo, I didn't see much from you as I took your position and I think you were going through a bad patch at that point, or I couldn't hear you to know what you were doing.

Not being able to talk is a huge disadvantage for me and also for my teammates. Although I do think I've played with Apollo long enough for them to understand what I'm doing if I can't type, it's also the reason most of the times they just let me do my own thing. It isn't the best but it works. However I find it extremely hard to play with people I usually never play with. That's why I dislike mega scrims.

Avicus teams?<br><br><ol><li>BC</li><li>PPB</li><li>Apollo</li></ol>However I think that Apollo can beat PPB as I'm PPB are quite inactive ATM whereas Apollo are scrimming and stratting very often.
