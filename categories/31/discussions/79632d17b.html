My retirement rumor...

</h1>
Many people have gotten the wrong vibe about what's going on with me and my position as staff.&nbsp;<br><br>When Peachy made the decision to leave, I was so upset, and angry with myself for not being able to keep my best friend a staff member with me. But my efforts were inadequate, and I couldn't hold him here. Peachy... He's my best friend. He's the one who got promoted to Jr.Mod alongside me in the same TS call, at the exact same time.&nbsp;<br><br>We had a very close friendship on McZone before the switch as well. Since we met, we've gone through everything together. Absolutely everything. And... We always looked up to the staff. We both wanted to become staff one day, and we did. Together, as one.<br><br>But it seems it's his time. People thought if he left I'd leave too,&nbsp;but I'm not. Im not going anywhere, anytime soon. It will be more difficult than ever to continue on without him by my side, but I guess that's the price ill have to pay. <br><br>Peachy, thank you. Thank you for always being there when no one else was, and comforted me. Thank you for sharing your life with me, it's truly been a blessing. And to end it off, I love you, bro. I love you like the brother I always wanted. Take care, pal.<br><br>Best regards, -Jake

I personally feel we've been losing too many staff members to handle. So to counterweigh the losses, I'll stay here. I'm not planning on going anywhere anytime soon, I love Moderating too much.
