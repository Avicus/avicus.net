Hey guys, <br><br>If we catch you bridging into survival worlds on nebula maps, you will be punished. It might seem fun, exploring the survival world, but you're abusing glitches.<br><br>Also, if you catch people doing this, report them in game or submit an online report, thanks!

It's <i><u></u></i><u>not</u> meant to be there. You can also get multiple advantages from going into the world.

ikr. For instance in clay wars you can find the edge pretty fast, and then get iron and even diamonds. Also with much wood you would have a BIG advantage again. <br><br>But would you also be punished, if u just go there in spec mode and just look around a bit there? It wouldn't harm the game really.

Ivy is working on a fix. I encourage all moderators to use //drain if they see a player get water or lava from a survival world as well, and call mapdevs or directors over when there's a game that's absolutely broken so it can be ended (meaning both teams have several players using survival glitches).

As long as you are only in spec mode, you're fine. If you join the game, and go to the land, you'll be punished.

Can we go into the survival worlds if we do no alter the game? For example, can we bridge to the survival island, break the bridge behind us, and then explore and not go back? This wouldn't effect the gameplay of anybody besides yourself. Would that be allowed?

I got spawned into a survival world randomly and was stuck in nexus a while back, I don't know if it was fixed with the update or whether the staff team was aware of this.

It can't be fixed that way, since world edit can't select the entire world, as Minecraft worlds are inifnite. The survival worlds are corrupt chunks regenerating into a normal world.

I'm fairly certain that the naturally generated terrain is not the map maker's first concern. If anything, the only thing that matters about the original world is that as much of it as possible is gone. Thus, you can rationally assume that being able to access this terrain is an unintended glitch (by definition), and exploiting such a glitch would be punishable.<br><br>Arguing that this is fair because both teams can do it is fallacious, the same way you can justify hacking because anyone can download a hacked client. Not to mention, I often suffer from egregious lag spikes whenever anyone — be it team player or spectator — loads the remnants of the original world. I already complain about lag enough; please don't make it worse.

You probably wouldn't be punished.<br>But if you're going to do that, I suggest you /leave first if you only want to explore.<br><br>You're just taking up a team spot and are preventing someone who actually wants to play from joining.
