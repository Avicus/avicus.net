I’m not at all happy with my performance in the last 2 months; although yes i have done some work behind the scenes, It’s not the standards i want to be setting for myself. I used to be on the server every day , forums , ts, slack etc. Although many will say toning it down is fine - for me it doesn’t make me feel happy about doing my job. &nbsp;knowing that i could give more but i simply don’t have the dedication to anymore. I still have a &nbsp;passion for this community and server. But as for the staff team i have given much to them but they have also given much back to me. Simply put, i don’t feel like i give enough back anymore. I want to move on . I have more interests and friends than when i was 11 - it can’t all be balanced. I want what’s best for you all of you , that’s not me.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;  ">At the end of the day it’s about us.

It’s because this many of us realise - me certainly - we have more in common with this small world than we might think. In a time where we are judged arguably more than ever it’s important we stick to our own beliefs, but also escape our ‘echo chambers.’ Share your views and opinions, challenge yourself make the most of what is given to you.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;  ">I will still be playing avicus but on a very low scale , until future updates , in comparison to what i used to once play.
