Suspicious links ingame.

After some recent events I've noticed some links have been flying around the place, posted by random people. These "links" have mostly been ingame and are Key loggers/Ip Grabbers that are posted by people who just want to cause some trouble. So I want to remind everyone, that really we need to be safe when it comes to opening links from; a) People we don't know or b) Links we aren't so sure about. I personally don't open any links that get spammed ingame, even harmless youtube videos just to be safe, but that's just me from person experiences.&nbsp;<br><br>I'll just remind everyone that when you open links, this goes anywhere to be honest not just Avicus, you should check the links thoroughly and make sure their isn't something hiding or wrong with the URL. If you're suspicous, don't open it. I'd also recommend you don't open links from people you don't know, or even partly know, although things such as IP Grabbers (as far as I'm aware) can't really do to much damage in terms of Minecraft, it's still a concern and potential security risk.&nbsp;<br><br>I don't mean to frighten anyone with this post, there isn't any current issue or concern directly regarding this, but I just wanted to remind everyone. I've made this post separate to this weeks community update, which I will post in a second, just so the message will stick out more.<br><br>- Posighdun

Most suspicious links normally have only one or two letters added/changed, so although they may seem fine at first glance, they could hold the key to your ultimate destruction... (Check those links and make sure you know what website you're about to go to.)

What??? We need a link filter! This&nbsp;<b>must</b> be the highest priority for the developers right now! The biggest part of Avicus players are not active on the forums, or don't even use the forums, how should they know, especially as non-regular Avicus player? Add a link filter please! Make it so nobody can post links. A forum post is nice, but it won't help dealing with this problem!<br><br>#LinkFilterNow!

With "link filter", I mean it blocks&nbsp;<b>each</b> link&nbsp;<b>expect</b> well-known domains like gyazo.com, imgur.com, avicus.net etc. etc.. The developers could give Admins/Sr. Mods the power to add domains in-game with a cmd, like /filter add [xy.com]. Links like bit.ly and goo.gl should always be ignored!

Key loggers have to be downloaded, you can't just click on a link and be key logged.

A key logger has to actually be on your computer, you can't just click a link and be key logged. It's an actual program on your computer.

True but you can get ip grabbed or info stolen if the link looks like a real website and you put a password or anything there etc

That's not key logged though. You just have to be careful, for example: mlnecraft.net/login. Majority of people would fall for that and enter their stuff. That's just people not being careful you know.

Actually it can.&nbsp;<br>There is still a possibility that it secretly downloads behind the scenes. It can also trigger macros and other stuff like that by simply hovering or even letting the page load.<br><br><br>Cookies are also another way to key log
