It was nearly 4 years ago - June 29th, 2012. Hypixel (at the time there was no Hypixel server, just the build team) created the Minecraft vanilla map, The Walls. Several weeks afterwards, <i>wallsmc.com&nbsp;</i>was released to the world and shortly after that, MC Zone was born. It's the game-mode that started it all, and there would certainly be no Avicus without it. It drew in hundreds of players, player counts that only a handful of other servers had hosted at the time. But today, Walls is sad and lonely, and it needs your help!<br><br><b>What could we add to The Walls to bring it back to life? Do you play The Walls? Do you like it?&nbsp;</b>We have been strongly considering holding back releasing it into Atlas because it doesn't draw in the players it did in the past and developing it would be quite an undertaking (it would not be done through a simple walls XML module, but rather through structures and regenerating blocks that would have to be carefully planned out). If we bring it back, we want it to be fresh and unique.

I never liked how you would spend half an hour gearing up to just die right as the walls drop. &nbsp;Quite depressing. &nbsp;Also, even though it's a team game, people really don't share supplies too much because they don't want to die. &nbsp;So how about each team has an obsidian block where as long as that block isn't broken, you can respawn. &nbsp;However, if a player from another team breaks your obsidian, if you die you are out of the game.

Make a mash-up of walls and you-know-what-gamemode. Same for SG ;-)<br>Edit: some kind of what Adm suggests<br><br>The main problem is boredom of playing alone (not enough players) for ten minutes.<br>Speed it up, maybe make 2 teams walls, make maps more "artificial"

I used to play a lot of Walls. What I really think it needs (some people might agree with this) is the original Hypixel maps back. Walls and Jungle were two of my favourite maps because they were difficult and required knowledge of the cave systems to win. <br><br>Avicus also needs some sort of official Walls tournament with large sized teams competing.

That is more like DTM based UHC where each side has an island with a monument. There is a period where players can collect resources before PvPing. I think that would be a cool gamemode to add.

What about a UHC version of walls. With the current walls no one grabs the gold or iron on the maps all they grab is the diamond. If we make UHC walls we wouldn't be able to regen so gold and apples would become a necessity.&nbsp;<i></i>

This could work for a lot of gamemodes. Have events such as a 2x credit multiplayer for walls for 1 day, chance to win keys upon victory for a week, etc.<br><br>I also like Ari's siege idea.

Please keep Walls. &lt;3 &nbsp;I originally came to this server to play Nexus and SkyWars with McZone, but I stayed because I discovered Walls. &nbsp;Recently, I play Nebula more because it's hard to get a decent Walls game going.<br><br>Walls could continue to be an awesome gamemode with a few tweaks:<br>1) Bring back the original maps you had at the very beginning (original Walls, Jungle, one where house blew up (Idk name), etc...<br>2) Increase height limit back to original height (est. 150 blocks)<br>3) Prevent team stacking (no team with 2+ more members than any other team)&nbsp;<br>4) Fix compass<br>5) Remove most golden apples &nbsp;(I like the idea of having to make your own using gold &amp; apples found in quad)<br>6)&nbsp;Remove OP regen/strength/harming potions (speed is okay)<br>7) Turn on fire spread again<br>8) Enable mobs to spawn (Jungle was great that way and one of the tetris maps too)<br>9) Allow a vote to start with less than 8 players (sometimes we wait too long for a game to start)<br><br>Another idea is to create maps that you can use in Walls, but they are really SkyWars type maps with enderpearls. &nbsp;I think a couple of map devs created this before, but they were only tested and not put into rotations.<br><br>I also like the other ideas mentioned above Walls/Nebula Hybrid, Walls UHC, etc... <br><br>Thanks for asking for player feedback on this topic. :)

Walls if fine lol, there is nothing wrong about it. I originally played walls when I joined this server, and that is why I am so shit at nebula. The only reason it doesn't get attention is because those regular players just don't like the gamemode in general. Avicus's&nbsp;current player count if also very low, so everyone just plays nebula. I'm sure all walls players think it is fine, and they would play it, if they were all on at the same time.

Please keep Walls. &lt;3 &nbsp;I originally came to this server to play Nexus and SkyWars with McZone, but I stayed because I discovered Walls. &nbsp;Recently, I play Nebula more because it's hard to get a decent Walls game going.<br><br>Walls could continue to be an awesome gamemode with a few tweaks:<br>1) Bring back the original maps you had at the very beginning (original Walls, Jungle, one where house blew up (Idk name), etc...<br>2) Increase height limit back to original height (est. 150 blocks)<br>3) Prevent team stacking (no team with 2+ more members than any other team)&nbsp;<br>4) Fix compass<br>5) Remove most golden apples &nbsp;(I like the idea of having to make your own using gold &amp; apples found in quad)<br>6)&nbsp;Remove OP regen/strength/harming potions (speed is okay)<br>7) Turn on fire spread again<br>8) Enable mobs to spawn (Jungle was great that way and one of the tetris maps too)<br>9) Allow a vote to start with less than 8 players (sometimes we wait too long for a game to start)<br><br>Another idea is to create maps that you can use in Walls, but they are really SkyWars type maps with enderpearls. &nbsp;I think a couple of map devs created this before, but they were only tested and not put into rotations.<br><br>I also like the other ideas mentioned above Walls/Nebula Hybrid, Walls UHC, etc... <br><br>Thanks for asking for player feedback on this topic. :)

As murph said, two BIG things that could make walls is bringing back to Original walls map/Jungle too, and fix the compass

** Could we please keep the walls discussion alive here? &nbsp;**<br><br>I'm afraid that walls will not be included into the Atlas release based on this original post to keep it "<b>fresh and unique</b>".<br><br><b>fresh </b>- Add all the updates that have been suggested in the past 4 months regarding fixes and tweaks (see comments above).<br><br><b>unique</b> - Add back original maps made for walls that are out of rotations. Currently, 17 are in rotations and 3 are in storage. Bring back old maps not in either of these areas.<br><br>Originally, what made walls fun was to play on maps that the "big youtubers" were playing on youtube. &nbsp;You could watch what they did and then try strategies out for yourself. &nbsp;Bringing the original 4 maps that you had in rotations at the start would make a huge difference. &nbsp;<br><br>I don't think walls has to be all that unique. &nbsp;Classic walls is just fine. &nbsp; <br><br>Off topic: &nbsp;I feel the same way about SG. Bring the original SG maps back and players would play them.

Ugh you don't need that much, people right now are suggesting things that would change walls completely. :/<br><br>There should be (and is) a mini walls, which is a smaller map and only has 5 minute preparation for fast games.<br><br>The rots needs to be changed more often, we are stuck with the same rots for like a year now, it's boring and repetitive.<br><br>Team stacking is annoying, so yeah :/<br><br>And don't change the walls kits if you are going to make them really awful.(like it was last time)

It's just not fun to play.Tropical Falls, this map is decent but the game play after the walls fall is just not good. It's too fast pase, even with 4 people in the map the game is over in under a minute, if people start to play walls again, this map will be terrible for everyone.

Ugh, about swampland terrors, it was my fault for adding so many things, a bit too many lol.<br><br>I made a fix for it and lessened the amount of op stuff that are on it, and also removed some stuff so there'd be a chance to fight people, but the map devs still didn't change it :/<br><br>Like I have the actual fix for it, or atleast so it'd be better to what it is now which is just a shit ton of stuff and grass xd

We would never remove walls or make big alternations to it in any way. We are known for Walls, thats's the reason we went big in the first place. We were the first network to release an automated version of the Walls after Hypixel released the map with all the command blocks and stuff. Although people don't play it that much anymore, it's part of our history so I'm pretty sure it will be staying for a long long time.

This is great news! &nbsp;In the past, some players would snipe you off your skybase near middle before the walls dropped, but once the word got out that it was punishable, players stopped doing that and waited for walls to drop. &nbsp;<br><br>Also, if you build your base near the edges, it's always a risk that you might get snipped off into the void anyways regardless of height limit, but it would be after the walls have dropped, not before.

The one I made (hi it's Random_Guy) is called Grun Kaskade, I did fix it's gameplay issues. But they never found their ways to the rots haha.<br><br>I also think Ascent, another map I made, would have better gameplay now, now that stomper has been nerfed, but that's only if people want it back.<br><br>OP: regarding kits, I think stomper still needs to be nerfed, like, it shouldn't be stomper anymore, no fall damage being transferred, it's just too strong, I think it should just be no fall damage.

The one I made (hi it's Random_Guy) is called Grun Kaskade, I did fix it's gameplay issues. But they never found their ways to the rots haha.<br><br>I also think Ascent, another map I made, would have better gameplay now, now that stomper has been nerfed, but that's only if people want it back.<br><br>OP: regarding kits, I think stomper still needs to be nerfed, like, it shouldn't be stomper anymore, no fall damage being transferred, it's just too strong, I think it should just be no fall damage.

^^ I agree with this fam, Stomper shouldn't be stomper, and if it stays stomper then it should take fall damage, but give like 50% or 25% of the damage you take. But just getting rid of stomper and just making it either 1, no fall damage, or 2 feather falling 4 diamond boots(?).

What about a UHC version of walls. With the current walls no one grabs the gold or iron on the maps all they grab is the diamond. If we make UHC walls we wouldn't be able to regen so gold and apples would become a necessity.&nbsp;<i></i>
