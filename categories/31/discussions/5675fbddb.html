This has been coming for a good two months now and I feel I owe this to anyone that actually cares, so here goes, I'm going to try and make this short and sweet.<br><br>Goodbye, it's been an awesome three years. I've made friends, "enemies", but most of all memories (good or bad). This was my first server. I remember joining with my friend and playing Survival Games for hours with him, even though I would never win and pretty much died off spawn half the time.&nbsp;<br><br>There are multiple reasons I'm leaving. For one, Minecraft got boring as a whole, especially lately. It's a very broken game with tons of cheaters, shitty staff on lots of servers and the direction the game was going was a completely different direction I was going as a player, and I think lots of people here can relate. Second, the one server I could always count on to lighten my mood up and have fun on (Avicus) got boring. It was the same recipe all the time. Nothing new. I tried to get into competitive but that pretty much died right after I made that decision. Third, and this is probably the main reason I left, is because I started playing Overwatch and it's really, really fun (even though I suck ass).<br><br>I'm not good at thanking people, so I'll just pick like five people I remember right now to thank with a short summary of why I chose them.&nbsp;<br><br>Zaidms- You probably won't read this, but you've always been nice to me. I've always respected you as a player and you're always really fun to skype with. playing with you while you ban evaded constantly was fun xD.<br><br>Nathy- You're a really nice guy. I mean it. For the short time I was actually active in Cacal you were really fun to play with. I remember that one time we were talking about Game of Thrones together. You're also really funny. Good memer.<br><br>Lunacy- Favorite weeb by far. I've always respected you as a player because you can be a god with such high ping. It was really fun playing alongside you in Cacal and helping you carry us XD. You're also really funny and have decent memes.<br><br>Emily- Oh my god. You're fucking hilarious. You're really, really nice and can really put a smile on my face sometimes. It's always fun being a retard with you. Holy shit I can't stop thinking about that video you made XD.<br><br>Badger- I remember you as the one genuinely nice and sincere guy that I could always turn to. Sure, you've pissed me off and I've pissed you off but at the end it never got in the way of us getting along. You're a really good staff member while still being a cool guy. One of the coolest :).<br><br>To all the rest that I forgot, thanks for three years :).<br><br>Bye.
