There are some rumors (actually I think it is confirmed) that when the 1.8 version is released you can modify your IGN, but the question is, if someone that was banned from the server changes his name, is he still banned? how do you check? and if I change my name will my stats reset? I was just wondering with a friend (he gets banned for his name).<br>btw we don't have anything to prove that avicus will be the same after the new EULA's rules

1.8 Introduces unique player codes instead of usernames, so if a player was banned from a server you are banning their code therefore they will still be banned even if they change their username.

So if you were to do /ban for example, what would it look like?

I would assume that when you do /ban [username] it will recognize the unique code and the player will be banned.

Cupcake1241 is correct. In 1.8, name changes will be available but all bans and player status (inventory's etc.) will all be saved with a unique player code attached to each account. All of the pervious 1.7 update versions have been preparing server's to make the switch. Everything is in the process of changing to UID's.
