Ok, so i have seen some other servers with a rank like this and i thought that it would be great if Avicus would do it too.<br><br>The rank is called:<b> Assistant or Helper</b>, and they basically answer any questions that people have and help them with their needs<br><br>This would benefit the community quite greatly so that everyone can learn more about Avicus and rules, etc.<br><br>To apply (just what i think the requirements should be) you must have at least 5 days on Avicus and should be able to take a general knowledge test on Avicus.<br><br>Thanks :D

I already answer people's questions all the time and have a fair understanding of the rules. <br>Your prerequisites for this rank are insanely easy to meet, which is why it won't work.<br><br>We don't need another staff rank, we have too many as is and this 'Helper' rank will literally serve no purpose.<br><br>Also, other servers may have a 'Helper' rank, but on Avicus, the equivalent of the 'Helper' rank is the 'Junior Moderator' rank.

If you think its that easy you are a clown. It was difficult learning the aspects of obs and streaming. I've gone a long way. You have to drag in viewers and its not easy. You cant just push a record button and everything comes live. For the record, its a start streaming button. Obviously don't know anything on our side.
