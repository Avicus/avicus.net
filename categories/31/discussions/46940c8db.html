Here we are with another plug.dj event! This event, like the others will start at 6:30 EST, and any kind of music is allowed this time (excpet violent, overly explicit, and sexual songs/videos of course). If you already have an account, or need to create one, go to <a rel="nofollow" href="http://plug.dj/avicus">plug.dj/avicus</a>, and you can register/login there. Hope to see you there!

Would really enjoy to come, but would you guys mind taking into account the Europeans who play on the server (just so happens I'm English) and maybe host these events a little earlier so we don't have to be up at midnight or later. Anyway hope it goes well and have a great time!!!

I'm not making a criticism, just a way to improve the system slightly. Say for example the Christmas party. I know about half of avicus couldn't attend that because 1. It was too late for Europeans and 2. It was Christmas Eve, therefore making it about 1am Christmas Day for Europeans.&nbsp;<br>It's just a suggestion...

We've been trying to find methods of planning GMT plug sessions. Our only answers so far were to host a two-day session..
