A personal update shouldn't be considered "spam".<br>If you mean constant posting like it's Twitter, that's just general spam.

I like. You get to learn more about the members of this community. The post about getting suspended is a good example. We learnt new things about the players and was able to comfort the creator of the post by giving our past experiences.

I agree.&nbsp; It's hard enough to make a post about something that is bad about your life let alone a staff member locking the thread saying that it's unnecessary.&nbsp; We are a helpful community full of love and support and not allowing these types of threads is awful.

This is beyond just "hopelessly&nbsp;pathetic"... I've always been led to believe that the "official" rules page was obsolete and frivolous, considering — time and time again — its content has been referenced as argumentative evidence, yet ultimately struck down for being irrelevant or outdated. Now, this was all the result of misinformation? It's even worse when people smugly reference that one rule concerning self-centered discussion, with complete disregard to the sentence you stressed in bold; I thought the rule, in its entirety, was perspicuous enough for the common player (or a typical staff member) to understand. Apparently not.<br><br>So, I guess the community has some studying to do...?
