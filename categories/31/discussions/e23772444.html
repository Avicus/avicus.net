A quick update from the administration team!

Hello everyone,<br><br>I'd like to make an update post on behalf of the admin team. As I'm sure many of you are aware, there have been many changes in the staff team within the last few weeks. Unfortunately many of our staff members have retired or been demoted, which means we're quite low in numbers at the moment. The staff reassessment that was held on the weekend had a number of flaws, and I would like to apologise for that.<br><br>After DoctaPop and I were promoted to the role of admin, we met together and discussed a number of topics, one of which was the state of the staff team. There were plans in place prior to our promotions, and we decided to go ahead with the staff reassessment. With that said, we lacked organisation and in all honestly we were not fully prepared.<br><br><b>STAFF POLICIES:</b> The first point I would like to address is that the promotion and demotion policies will see many changes within the near future. Communication between the admins, senior moderators and moderators will be more transparent, ultimately making day-to-day tasks easier to manage. Official staff warnings will be issued in certain cases rather that demotions, and we will ensure that the moderators are aware of what is happening. The means in which we go about achieving this are not set in stone, however another update post will be made later to expand on this topic. Many of you have expressed concern for the demotion policy, and that is why we are making these changes.<br><br><b>PLANS FOR THE NEAR FUTURE:</b> The community has provided us with plenty of criticism recently (come constructive, some not so much) and we're prepared to take that on board. This is something that we want to implement on a more regular basis considering the amount of ideas and questions the community has. Transparency between the community and staff certainly hasn't been the best recently, and one of our priorities is to change this regardless of what it takes. Feedback and ideas are vital to the ongoing success of Avicus, and at the moment we're discussing ways to make this as efficient as possible.<br><br><b>STAFF APPLICATIONS:</b>&nbsp;The newly implemented hand-picked staff system has definitely had its pros and cons, although it is now time for us to open staff applications once again! When the format for this is completed a post will be made including more information. We're hoping that this will be ready very soon, so keep an eye out on the forums. If you've ever wanted to apply for our staff team now is the time!<br><br>Thank you for taking the time to read through this update, and we look forward to these upcoming changes.<br><br>Regards,<br>Mango_
