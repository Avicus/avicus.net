Hey guys so I've been noticing that my KD has being going down ALOT since I started rushing in Nebula. Before my KD was 1.5 and now it's about 1.3. I really need help because I don't want to get my KD below 1:( So yeah I was just wondering what you guys think! Thank you!<br>~ Splade

I will give you a hint.<br>To have fun on avicus you MUST give a shit for your K/D.<br>Anyway to get kills I normally jump like hell and click as fast as possible.

Play the walls and win. It takes longer but you will end up with more kills per death. I have gone for 100 kills and only one death before.... I had a k/d of about 9/1 then i went to nexus/nebula and now it is trashed.

If I want an easy kill in Nebula, I make sure someone 20-30 blocks away sees me, I dig a 1x1x4 hole downwards and I place a block above me. Then will then either tunnel next to the block, in which case, I block-hit before they can switch from their pickaxe to sword, or they break the block above me in which case I block-hit and jump a lot for crits. A lot of people don't block-hit very often, so this can be a very deadly technique. If they don't block-hit, I can usually take on 2 people in the same armor as me with about 3 hearts.<br>Block-hitting is too strong &lt;3

Maps that are good for kills like...<br>(Nebula)<br>Luar : Bow spam the players running across the bridges.<br>Quintus : Diamond armor.<br>VenomousTDM : Snipe with a stack of arrows.<br>(CTH) <br>The Fall : Small map lots of players = lots of kill steals.<br>(Walls)<br>Garden : Strength + Invisibility = lots of easy kills.<br>Walls : Full diamond.<br><br>That's how I get most of my kills.

In the map Quintus in Nebula. Get the diamond armour in the beginning. If you have extra diamond armour, hide it somewhere that nobody will find it. Start kill farming and if you die, go to your secret chest and collect your diamond armour, then you can kill farm once again. You'll get a lot of kills. :)

Suggestions v1.2.22:<br><br>Bow tactic, by: Overcast, and MCSG: Using the bow's ability to quickly fire, and knock someone back, gives you a huge advantage to get a Death Blow Combo. Scene:&nbsp;<br><br><b>An enemy is running towards you... Pull out the bow, about 10 blocks apart shoot your target causing them to get knocked back (While in mid air) Use this opportunity to get a combo that will sure to destroy the target! (Same with the fishing rod) Tutorial:<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3leu0NXOSSc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3leu0NXOSSc</a>&nbsp;(Using <br>the fishing rod same thing as a bow!)<br></b>Sword:<br><b>&nbsp;<br>Using a sword, a powerful weapon. Strafing: Strafing is turning around your target, while hitting them, and possibly not get hit back. By strafing you are allowing yourself to get around your target and get hits that your target may not get due to (Combo's, Side strike). However, to defend this, click as fast as possible, and if you are in a combo, turn around and run until you are comfortable to fight again. When getting into a strafe, using block-hitting if you cannot get hits on your target (While at the same time possibly hitting them). Keep in mind that Block hitting slows you down, so DO NOT use it to chase, or fight if you have the upper hand! "Block hitting in general": Simple but effective method to use while in - Tight spaces, Trapped in a corner, or while being combo'ed. It is self explanatory, most of you know this.<br>Tutorial:<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kt7D-tR9YU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kt7D-tR9YU</a><br></b>Void kill:<br><b>&nbsp;<br></b><b>Void kills is self explanatory, knock a person into the void. This is effective when fighting against a really Over decked players, by knocking them into the void. Using the bow, when someone is crossing the bridge, use the bow, and aim as best as possible and hope to knock them off!&nbsp;<br></b>If you need more tips and tricks, or general pvp suggestions, Please tell me! :) Hope this helped!<b><br><br><br></b>

Yup, I made it myself c:<br>Also, if you can find any games on Illegal Office, then make sure to join.<br>The map is just big enough in the maze part to block-hit, get crits, and strafe. I can usually take on a full iron with the normal equipment o3o
