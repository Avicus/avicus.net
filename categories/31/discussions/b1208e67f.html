One thing this server never really seems to focus on is long term goals.<br><br>I'm curious to know what the community thinks about this server and where it will be in about 6 months.&nbsp;<br><br>Will this server die in 6 months? How will it happen?<br>Will this server see a permanent player increase in 6 months? How will it happen?<br><br>Do you care at all? <br>Because community involvement, or lack there of, is a telling sign of a server's future.

Avicus is like MRE's, Meal Ready to Eat.<br>They're shit but they last a long time.<br><br>Avicus is shit but it will die out one day, slowly but surely from decisions that get made, but not anytime soon imo.

I personally believe that this server will for sure thrive onwards as the decisions the admins are making are extremely beneficial for their development. I'm sure that they will end up as one of the top Minecraft servers in the near future!

If the server decisions that 90% of the community disagrees with keep happening, then Avicus will be dead in the next couple months. I think that most of the regulars that have been here as long as most of us are on the last straw with the server updates, especially more recently. There's polls that ask the community what they want, then that poll gets thrown out and the update still happens, most of the time going against what the vote of the poll was. The most recent topic I can think of is the poll about updating to 1.9+. Thankfully this was listened to, but if you read through the whole post, you can clearly tell that the point of the post wasn't mainly to get an opinion, it was made as a "hey we are doing this at some point, so we are going to make this seem like an option, but we don't really care what you think". <br>I'm not totally sure that this makes sense, but I think I got the point across.<br><br>I think Avicus will survive for a while if the community starts to get a say in what happens. The community is fed up with being told they are getting what they want then not getting it, and at this point if that doesn't stop soon a lot of people are going to leave. Avicus' community is very strong and pretty much everyone knows everyone, but just because we aren't on Avicus doesn't mean that won't survive. Stratus has a bigger, and if we're being real, better server. The only thing Avicus has over Stratus right now is the community, and a lot of Avicus is starting to play on Stratus and playing less on Avicus. It's not hard for a whole community to switch servers and still survive, especially one as small as Avicus'. I think the people in charge of decisions need to realize that and base updates off the community, not development.

I feel like Avicus won't die any time soon, the playercount just bounces up and down a bit, like it's done for ages now.<br>Like mentioned above, I think Avicus will not die until the ones hosting the server lose interest.<br>People always say a server is dying when the old players leave, but this is far from true.<br>Servers grow by getting new players, not by keeping older ones. Ofcourse keeping players is great, but not needed...<br>Take any server, Hypixel for example, I bet you almost all old players aren't playing anymore, yet they're still growing.<br>Another example is Mineplex: they are barely getting new players, the current players are mostly ones that have stayed with them for ages. This may be why their playercount dropped this much?<br><br><br>Conclusion:<br>I don't think Avicus is going to die soon, they just need to get new players interested and (sorry) stop focussing just on the older ones.

Maybe not thrive, but I can see Avicus with 50+ players at any given time within 6 months. With the addition of a new owner, there is a bigger of an incentive to develop the server when the owner is a shareholder as well. <img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/c2a4c847653e482ab62ed7f8b64330cb?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/ALM.html" style="color: #E77400">ALM</a> has already done a few nice updates such as the MVP award and scrimmage reservation system. Hopefully those updates can be tweaked towards the desires of the community.

Avicus will&nbsp;<b>NOT</b> die anytime soon, Sure avicus has low player count &nbsp;and with Stratus, less people will be coming but with a huge community like this, It will surely thrive. The only reason i can think of Avicus Dying is if they update to 1.9+. Then they will probably die.

1 thinkable action could only kill the server to it's demographic. Will it thrive? Even as head of advertising I have to tell you it won't be easy and may have to be up to be calculated luck to give us a spike to "thrive." If anything though it's just setting the server up to make it marketable and then we can raise the counts.

Really don't think it will be thriving but who knows. Avicus had good opportunities to increase their player counts when OCN/"OverBoat" shut down, but not a lot was really done. &nbsp;Now that Stratus is around it will make things more difficult.
