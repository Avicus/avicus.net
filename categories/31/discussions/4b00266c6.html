As a new player everytime I log on..... and try to get into a game its always full and It's kinda annoying I dont know if its lack of community or if you should make the player limit smaller

I don't think making the player limit smaller would help. But&nbsp; I do know that there is sometimes a problem with only 1 or 2 full games running sometimes when the player counts are low. I'd suggest trying to start a new nebula game with other players who can't join full teams.

If you purchase a donor rank, you have the ability to join full games. Other than that, I generally see that there tend to be about two Nebula games running at a time, so if one of them is full, you should try joining the other.

I believe that the limit really is a factor of having a small amount of active games; whenever I try to start one on another map, it's impossible &gt;_&lt;

#getsmallerplayerlimit.<br>I usually see 2 games of 40 players with another 10-20 players who aren't in the game. A 20-30 player game is funner, you also get to have more than 2 choices when in game.
