The Moderator Team

</h1>
Hey guys, it's Stim here.<br><br> As many of you know, I was a mod for roughly 7 months and during my time as mod, I learned a lot about the staff team and a lot about the community's standpoint on the staff, especially mods. I'll cut straight to the point, the community as a whole needs to stop bitching at the moderator team so much. Stop whining because a lot of this shit isn't their fault. The moderator team is mostly good, actually. The thing is, you constantly see the mod team mopping up after the senior staff's mistakes and certain idiotic policies, which makes them look bad. <br><br>The moderator team is actually keeping shit together as of now. This is also a post to bring attention to this matter. I want more pressure to perform on the senior staff, because many controversial issues blamed on mods or general staff were purely disorganization from the senior staff. This is not to slander anyone, but rather a call to step up and be the leaders you should be. I'll exempt a two people from this: Pos and Greg, you two are doing great and keep it up. <br><br>I don't want to see people getting their backs up trying to defend themselves, that is what's bringing us down. The rest of the senior mods just seem to follow. The only other senior mod I've seen clearly state their disposition and stand for it is Zeus, though I cannot confirm a pattern of this. A lot of leaders are stuck in the mod position while a lot of followers are up in senior staff, which doesn't work. The responsibility is also on the community, if you won't give proper feedback, don't expect anything to change and certainly don't whine when nothing happens. <br><br>Thanks for tuning in.&nbsp;<br><br>Tl;dr&nbsp;<br>Don't give the mod team so much shit because they clean up after the seniors a lot, Pos and Greg are fine and the leaders are the moderators while the followers are seniors, which is idiotic. Pay more attention to senior staff and focus less on the mods, puts pressure and forces them to improve. Community: don't sit there and moan, actually do something useful.&nbsp;<br><br>I'm on my phone so autocorrect will screw up.

Very well said, totally agree with you especially the part where the seniors need to step up their game and be the leaders and role models they should be. Because right now, I can't see us, as a staff team, enhancing and moving on to bigger things if we can't get basic things done right.&nbsp;<br><br>I actually brought these points up to the Admins yesterday, so I really hope they'll wake up and do something about it.

There are some points here which I can agree on and are well explained in depth. I can see some senior staff members who assist but not lead and don't communicate as much as others do. Perhaps that's out of confidence in a person. Still remember that pressuring them will only create more stress.<br><br><b>EDIT:&nbsp;</b>In addition, putting more pressure will cause more stress, which will lead to slower work rate.

The community's standpoint on the mods and the reason that we bitch and whine is not because they are seen mopping up after seniors's mistakes.

Seniors need to be&nbsp;<b>pressured</b>, so they can perform at their best whilst being the best <b>role models</b> they can be. However being a senior is a lot&nbsp;<b>more stressful&nbsp;</b>and will&nbsp;<b>considerably reduce spare gaming time</b><b></b>; unless you've experienced this then just be mindful about how much work they deal with.

It really is incredible how much stress and shit they get from the community about various bugs.<br>Don't get shitty at the mods, most of them aren't developers.<br>But well said, I definitely agree with everything you said.

I agree that we need more of a sense of leadership in the Senior Staff team. As a mod, I can't remember the last time a member of senior staff "led" me in some aspect.&nbsp;<br><br>As for stupid policies and stupid decisions and then going back on them, to the community that just looks like you have no idea what the fuck is going on. And you are supposed to be leading this community.<br><br>I know I'm in a different timezone to most of them, but for some members of the Senior Staff members, the most interaction I have with them is asking them to ipcheck somebody. That's a bit of an issue.....<br><br>In saying that there are some great sr staff out there and I love you

I'm gonna have to disagree with some that you said. Don't bash on me because I have my standpoint and is what I observed from the moderation team. I really don't mean to be rude, but it's really what I see that I don't understand why.<br><br>1. Some moderators do not reply to questions/enquiries or even bother to check on a blatant hacker - they're in game and actively playing.<br>2. Continuing from above, they would honestly rather stay in their scrim matches than check on /report.<br>3. I've overheard a few moderators banning on another player's speculation without proof, and then proceed to require proof from the player.<br>4. I don't see much of moderators doing work either, it's only the usual select few who are only passionate about their duties - Eteh, Acceqted, Posighdun, etc. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; On one hand, I agree that Senior Mods should do more, but it's not just the senior teams, but the entire staff team together. It's the Seniors that should motivate the staff team and the moderators stay passionate about their "duties".

Depending on the decision mistakes can be made, but it's Ethan's and my job to try and make sure that we make limited mistakes. As for more pressure, that will help no one. It's already stressful enough for me to say the least to manage all this, a competitive team and having to juggle everything else a 19 year old has to deal with. Rather than make it more stressful for us and whine when things don't go the right way I encourage you all to thank the moderators and senior moderators for the wonderful job they have done and are doing.

You don't see the staff chat do you? Therefore it's hard for you to make a statement that your reports aren't checked. Also, your judgement of a player will not always be correct. If you are watching a player and no staff are watching, then you have a fair point.

To be fair, if you've spent a fair bit of time as staff, you can generally pick out reports as likely false just by players reported and the writing. Staff will be afk sometimes and I was a mod for 7 months and never saw anyone ban off of other players' opinions without any proof. Well what is your timezone as well? I just kinda want to see if there is a reason behind it.

You have reported 9 people in total on avicus, 4 of these were regulars who we are certain that don't hack, 3 of the users you reported were punished, only 3 reports were left unattended, 1 of which is probably false, so a rough total of 2 reports were left unattended,<br><br>"<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  ">I understand that they would miss one or two reports, or not reply to messages, but it is farcical that 80% of my reports go&nbsp;unspeculated" that's no tru is it now =D<br><br>Plus, simply go on Teamspeak and Skype (or Support@avicus.net) and report the staff members if you notice any trouble.

As I do agree in a lot of what you say, and I don't know the 100% truth as to how the Staff works behind the scenes, just remember that:<br><br>1: They don't get payed at all.<br><br>2: They are human beings, meaning they can't help but make mistakes.<br><br>3: They also have a life.<br><br>4: You can't expect a moderator to look at every report that comes in or to never actually play the game. Also, time zones can make a difference in when your online obviously. By my knowledge most Staff is EST (not sure), which means there will be less staff on at certain times. That might be why you report and less staff come on.

I support every point here 100%. We DO actively check reports, even if we're not seen. That's what being a moderator means; we don't necessarily look for gratitude, but criticising us for slip ups that generally occur when mods are AFK or off-line is hardly fair. I for one take reports whenever I see them, yet the fact that I often don't have to means that there are many, many moderators who take reports and whom are willing to give up their free time to help. Please don't knock us unless you've experienced how demanding being a moderator or a senior moderator is. Most if not all of the seniors do an amazing job, and the other moderators are some of the friendliest and most helpful people I've ever met, even before I became a moderator.

You seem to be talking out of your ass. Staff members do not ban without evidence and if you think that then report that staff member to higher authority with evidence of them doing so. You don't know if they check reports do you? Just because you believe the person you reported you think should be punished, does not mean he should be. There&nbsp;aren't many improvements to be made, I have one for you though, don't come complaining about these statements that are false.

For the most part, I feel as if the staff has been responsive to my reports and questions. &nbsp;:)<br><br>The only improvement I would suggest is <b>during mod scrim matches</b>. &nbsp;When the majority of mods are actively in a scrim match, it's hard to determine which mod to direct msg for help.<br><br>For example, if I've sent a report (./report) and it's been 5-10 minutes later and no mod has shown up in game, I will try to direct message a few mods to ask them to respond. &nbsp;<br><br>It would be nice if the mods could respond with "<b>[modname] is responding to reports right now</b>". &nbsp;That way, I won't disturb scrims. &nbsp;In addition, even before mods go into a scrim, if one of them comes onto throwback and tells us which mod is "in charge" while mods are in scrim, it would be helpful. &nbsp;Thx!!!

lol I'll be honest, back in the day when Avicore came out, and /report AND staff chat would constantly break, that the staff were more active in reports.<br><br>If you look at my /reports, there have been quite a few recent ones where I've had to /report more than 2 times because the staff member would be either scrimming, afk, or just playing in a public game (I went over to the server they were in and were playing).<br>And usually in scrims, it's not 1 moderator/sr staff, it's usually 5-6 online in that same scrim server.<br>I know y'all wanna play too, but I'm sure they can go rotating around, at least for hackers... Which if you look atm, 12/15 were reports against hackers, 8/11 of those reports were non-repeated reported players and 7/15 of those reports were repeated. So hm, half of the reports were repeated for staff not attending them (I did check /staff, and no, none of them were not regulars and did end up getting banned).<br>So 90% of reports is probably too high of a number considering that in one day, 2 reports were sent out for one guy by me, surely by many others as well who ended up getting banned for that report, but only an hour after the last report I sent, so imagine how many more reports there were, and trust me, there were staff online otherwise I don't /report...

At the moment I would say that although not all the fault should be laid on the moderators, I cannot deny that recently it would appear that some of us have been a lot less active. As much as this is a concern, I hope that the new batch of juniors will remedy this. However, it should be noted that summer is coming to a close and many different scenarios are popping up for many different staff members. I for one, am about to divulge myself into No Mans Sky....

I refer to reports as those that I've informed staff about. You should ask Acceqted or Pelpelajax on how frequently I inform a staff member if there is a rulebreaker of any. The fact that I do not use /report is soley because it would be useless if the staff member *cough* plays on scrims and doesn't attend to those.

My point is that, a moderator spectates and bans the player, then requires the player to provide proof. I won't point out names if anything.

Let me ask you a question. <br>How do you know that some Staff Members don't take evidence?<br>Because you've had no punishments in the past, so it doesn't really concern you.<br>If it was a friend, your friend,&nbsp;<b>not you</b>, can ask for the evidence from a Sr Staff member or the moderator that punished him/her.<br>If you're asking, the staff member has no right to give any evidence to you as you were not the one being punished.<br>And unless you're going to admit that you hacked into some staff members computer to check his/her files, there is pretty much no way to know if a staff member gained evidence or not.<br>And if there was no evidence, your friend can easily dispute the ban and get appealed, since there is a policy that if there is no evidence, you get unbanned (only in game).

You didn't answer my question of how do you know that some staff members don't take evidence...<br>And that part is saying that you will&nbsp;<b>never know if a staff member gained evidence or not unless you hacked into their computer.</b><br>There is no way, and if they ever do, that's why you should always dispute any punishments.<br>Now if you're pulling words out of your asshole trying to prove a point that never happened to you, and that probably hasn't happened to someone in a long time (seems a lot like it), I'd suggest that you stop trying to prove a point that you have no evidence or experience to back up your point, since this post was meant to actually inform the community of what is happening, not to try and trash talk the staff team and then get locked because you're too stubborn to actually do some research.<br>And like I said, even if there are cases that staff members don't take evidence, you appeal it, and then that staff member gets in shit.

What's funny is the fact that i've been gone for so long that i have no idea what is going. But from what i have seen in game is that, not a lot of people actually respect the staff members. Many of you might think of me as a mini mod, but in reality i'm trying to stop you from getting punished. But that's besides the point, the staff team should be working together and mot cleaning after each others mistakes, believe me. I know what being a senior staff member is like and it is hard, but if they keep messing up and having moderators clean up then that's<br>completely wrong.

People tend to defend things that they don't see as true. And since your argument was essentially that you knew that the staff member didn't record someone before punishing them, but never mentioned how you knew this, they questioned you opinion. You have 100% every right to hold whatever opinion you have, people are just trying to say that you keep bringing up random things that aren't helping to prove that opinion of yours in the slightest.&nbsp;<br><br>But yes, moderators record. It's essential to moderating. Trust me.

Then provide proof. The only times I've seen a mod ban someone without evidence was when their recordings glitched. If they get banned they can appeal. I have not seen anything of the sort in 7months of being a mod. This argument is tedious and idiotic, so please take it off of this post. Discuss over Skype or something. The purpose of this thread isn't so you can be ignorant in both regards and start pointless arguments.

I never singled you, personally, out poorly so I don't know why you're being defensive. A few mistakes are fine, but it's the repetition of mistakes that shouldn't happen in the first place that senior staff and moderators alike are held accountable for. That is what I see happening. It's not an issue that not everyone is a leader in senior staff, but it is an issue when we are sorely lacking in terms of leaders in the senior staff team.&nbsp;<br><br>Just two final things. The community surveys never really seem to do much, nor does feedback. A bit of pressure and/or stress actually helps push people to improve or carry on. That was the motive here, as I said in the post, I'm not attacking anyone. A lot of people have been waiting a long time for change that hasn't really happened. and I think putting a bit of pressure on can help motivate the senior staff to improve along the staff team as a whole. I think the staff have made progress, but the issue is there isn't any incentive to improve. I'm trying to provide this in a way that maybe seems harsh at first, but really is to help progress the server. Some of you guys have done an amazing job and worked your asses off. The staff don't get nearly as much credit as they should. that being said, there are still issues that need to be solved and being proactive is a positive thing.</span>

</div>
I'm not being defensive, or I don't mean to be. That's just my opinion on what was said. I don't know who uses stress to improve, I personally improve when I get feedback and not when stressed. Putting stress on someone, especially people who make high level decisions, might not be the best idea since stress could affect how a decision is made. I see where you are coming from but, for me at least, stress doesn't help me improve. Although there is nothing wrong with someone encouraging others to step up.

That seems like a really bad cover-up excuse, use /report. From the statistics, your reports do get answered, so you have no reason not to use it.

As Stim said before, if you want to continue, do it somewhere else. This thread is for different purposes than what you two are on.

Can you help me answer this? That Senior Mod called Protel - no offense but what the fuck does he actually do? He may seem nice but I have never really see him actively comment on the forums or go into teamspeak or in the game for that matter? Please tell me what his role is and what he is in charge of because I am confused as to how he is a Senior Mod if he doesn't meet those two requirements?

His old name was John and I think it may be timezones for you as I saw him in-game and on TeamSpeak yesterday night. (9-10pm BST)

Oh oops, well the staff team <b>ditched departments</b> and are now <b>using weekly assignments</b>, so&nbsp;each senior has different jobs to fullfil each week. If you want to know what his job is this week speak to an admin or John himself.

Question to all coming to this thread:&nbsp;<br><br>What do you think the senior staff need to improve on?&nbsp;<br><br>I personally think transparency, because even as a mod, not a lot of things were communicated properly. If you want the community to understand and appreciate you, then be transparent as to what is going on.&nbsp;<br><br>Suggestion: Write down a list of things done for the week and post small updates on a stickied thread every week. You don't have to do a ton of writing and the community sees more progress and more of what you guys are actually doing. I think this could be a very healthy change because you'd probably get more appreciation for the work you do and get less hate while keeping the community informed. You can have a schedule where you take turns posting between senior staff, which means it really isn't a chore (given you'd only have to be posting a bit of writing every 2 months approximately). The writing itself can be on a schedule between people as well, taking turns.

I'm not being defensive, or I don't mean to be. That's just my opinion on what was said. I don't know who uses stress to improve, I personally improve when I get feedback and not when stressed. Putting stress on someone, especially people who make high level decisions, might not be the best idea since stress could affect how a decision is made. I see where you are coming from but, for me at least, stress doesn't help me improve. Although there is nothing wrong with someone encouraging others to step up.

I actually suggested a 'simplified calendar' a while ago, but as you can see it never really happened.

If they want to help themselves, hey go for it. If not, they can't go on as much about being under stress.

Transparency, communication skills, problem solving skills, how to defuse a situation instead of making it worse. Is stop playing the stupid blame game a skill?

I don't know much about the current staff team considering that I retired long ago and don't play anymore, but I think that the staff team generally does a good job on what they do, I think that the admins have gotten more transparent though which is good. The staff team definitely has good and bad staff members, but overall I think they're pretty good.<br><br>I always felt as a staff member though that the community generally disliked us, that no matter how hard all of us tried to be a good staff member and help the server, the community was still against us. I like the community here which is why I still stick around, but I think the community needs to appreciate the staff more.
