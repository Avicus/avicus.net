I'm done with this server. Avicore is no where near up to par as Mczone.<br><br><br>Every single map is bad.<br>Kits are bad IMO.<br>Feels like Controll the Hill but in different spots on the map.<br><br><br>I don't feel like discussing anything. Maybe I'll comeback if nexus fixes their shit but you know.<br><br><br>Cya one day.<br><br>-ViolentBoo<br><br>Edit:<br><br>After watching Free To Play (It's On Youtube) I realized what a horrible mistake I've made. I've thought as everyone here as my team and I have never made so many freinds in my life. This server changed the way I think of my acts everyday. You were all there for almost two years and I just abandon you all?<br><br>What kind of freind am I?<br><br><br>I'll comeback, and I'm sorry if I offended the server in anyway. I was just frustrated at the game.

Yes, suggestions would be nice. You can't expect the map developers, kit committee and I to make the games precisely how you like it, especially if you don't voice your opinions on what needs changing. That's just unfair and disrespectful.

Avicore came out less than 48 hours ago, so it still needs adding and removing, but for the most part it's amazing considering funky was the only one that could do the coding.
