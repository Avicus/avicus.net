I retired. So yeah recently after getting axed from Senior I really lost all my motivation. I had nothing to work for, nor did I have the patience/dedication to go through with moderating. Especially recently I found it equally enraging that &nbsp;the moderators were ignored to an extent far more than acceptable. Seeing as that there is a meeting today, I hope you do well and cooperate well together. &nbsp;On regards of my "Journey" I really did start out under-valued;however, I'm still not quite sure. I got through Junior Mod in only 5 days and it was a hell of a ride. Moderating was always easy for me, I never really engaged in conflicts that much and got the job done. After getting senior all hell broke loose. I made a few careless mistakes and from then onwards the dream was over. I still tried all that I could. However, most of my work was ignored. (First non admin to host a meeting, setting up about 40 spreadsheets for the mods which take an 8 hour marathon that did span over midnight.) I will agree I argued a bit to much with 99250 and his gang. Although I will say it was fun. My apologies.. So yeah, I got warned for the 3rd time in a month and to be honest I've had it. The seniors have the odacity to demote/warn one of the only 16 or so mods to the point of retirement. In-fact I'm not even allowed to have my own opinion according to one. Alas that does not matter now and I bid thee staff farewell.<br><br>Thanks/Apologies?:<br><br>-Zeusy: God Himself (heh see what I did there :^) Zeus has been with me for ages and has helped me through quite a few 'dark' times. Praise be to Zeus. The main Habibi<br><br>-Sunrise: He wont see this probably, but Sunrise was the first person I met and honestly a great and energetic guy that I miss dearly.&nbsp;<br><br>-Cyanide: Great fun to rant with. Helped me do stuff as a mod/senior. Also stuck up for me and is a great role model. This guy truly does care about the server. Shame the community is killing it. (No Offense)&nbsp;<br><br>-Greg: Greg is good banter. Odacity4ever<br><br>-Cole: Senior Mod Rant Buddy<br><br>-99250: lol what do I have to say... I enjoyed your comments!! I hope you enjoyed mine.<br><br>-Berzerk: Salt or riot.<br><br>-Apollo: Gods aswell.&nbsp;<br><br>-Teamspeak: God God God God God God God God God God God God God God, I go completely when Teamspeak goes.<br><br>- Dylan: Aussie Python/Destiny G0D<br><br>- Sessp: You are the best moderator if not the best in a long time. Keep up the work. I will 8 block you all day everyday.<br><br>- Paraspider: Thank you for teaching me how to be stuck up.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>&nbsp; - "Salty Apollo Player"</i><br><i>Shows over for tonight folks. Catch ya later<br>(If you archive anything on this post or the post I will bring it back.</i>

I'm not saying it needs a hugbox, or that it wasn't voicing an opinion, but rather he always did have the option of talking to a senior about my behavior, and it wasn't super necessary to single me out considering we argued prior to this post. I've already voiced plenty opinions, and I'm not shutting down AMAs either for asking opinions on people...?

Well since you have actually retired now I can say a few things. Thank you for giving me something to do this summer your shit behavior as a staff member made me realize how bad the entire staff team was becoming. You were a good mod IMO but once you got senior and became more active, I found out what a total dick you could be. Being Rude towards me and the rest of my team, plus your salt wasn't very enjoyable. Hopefully now that you're gone off the staff team they can move forward to better things. Not trying to be a salty dick but kthxbai its been fun.

Well since you have actually retired now I can say a few things. Thank you for giving me something to do this summer your shit behavior as a staff member made me realize how bad the entire staff team was becoming. You were a good mod IMO but once you got senior and became more active, I found out what a total dick you could be. Being Rude towards me and the rest of my team, plus your salt wasn't very enjoyable. Hopefully now that you're gone off the staff team they can move forward to better things. Not trying to be a salty dick but kthxbai its been fun.

I love people saying not trying to be a salty dick and being a total salty dick in their post lol.&nbsp;<br>I honestly wasn't expecting your behavior.. Well iron did a great job for the staff team IMO and he deserved his position. Maybe he has done some stuff wrong, then he got demoted back to moderator and he improved and did great.&nbsp;<br>I want you to understand sometimes people take words seriously no matter if it's on the Internet or not, you could've just said your opinion in easier words but the way you said that was disgusting, I'm really dissapointed in you, since you've been staff too.
