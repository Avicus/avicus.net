When I used a Mac, I had to right click each channel and click "Subscribe to Channel" It takes a while to get every single one, but it'll show you who is in what channel.<br>Hope this helps! ^-^

It didn't really help, since I still see nobody else in the TeamSpeak channels.&nbsp;<br><br>I tried connecting from the bar at the top of the screen and I thought that would connect me to it, but it didn't. Still stuck in this part.

Pretty sure it's not a problem with the download, since you're able to connect to a TeamSpeak "backup server". The channels don't seem correct though, so it might be the wrong server you're connected to.

The problem is when I try redownloading it, it jumped ahead several steps because I'd already done it, and something in between was where I went wrong, so it won't work.
