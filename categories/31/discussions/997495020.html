This came up when I was on a server....<br><br>Instead of kicking/temp-banning players for spam and vulgar language. Why not mute them for a certain amount of time? (Depending on what the player does/says) Staff can decide how long the player should be muted.&nbsp;<br><br><br>Again this is just an idea, so no salty comments pls :)

It might work, except I think you should only really be able to temp mute people and perm mute if the case.

<p>I thought a little bit about this, but if someone is being rude/spamming they should just be banned. xD There's no point in keeping them around, they could still team kill, team troll, ect.. I like the idea of&nbsp;/mute but if someone is mad because they are muted they may start to team kill. </p>

Yeah perm mute is too much. I was suggesting like a mute for an hour or two at the most.

Being muted permanently is torture. I was thinking of temp mute... Wouldn't you just kick or ban if they continue breaking the rules?

Temp mute (max 2 weeks) I'm all for, but perm muting is torture. I was perm muted on Mineplex for saying "Hello Asians" (apparently that's "excessive" racism...). Just ban them if they're that bad :)

I don't agree in permanent muting, maybe&nbsp;only say a temporary one, however, this is likely to frustrate said player even more &amp; cause them to repeat offend, if it were to be implemented, it'd have to be,&nbsp;warm -&gt; temp mute&nbsp;-&gt; kick?

Muting is to give the offensive player something like a slap on th wrist. If they fail to cooperate in following the rules I'd say it should be a Warn-Mute-Kick-Tempban

im pretty sure they're talking about staff only, but what if a staff didn't come and some guy was spamming rudeness everywhere- some servers have a system where if enough players (i think it has to be like half of players online or something) vote for a player to be kicked or muted. i don't think it could be abused due to the fact that the only people who would actually use it would be responsible and mature people, and there aren't enough idiots in one game to get someone kicked for, say, killing them.<br><br>i doubt this would get implemented but i just wanted to know if you guys think that system could get abused

-1 very very bad idea in my opinion. A player without chat-permissions could not interact with friends. Example: I say something like f*** 4 times in a single game, and then I get banned for 1 week out of the chat. Friends would say to me "Hi" and "How are you" etc. and you aren't able to interact with them. I have bad experiece with /mute.

Being muted is temporary so it won't be legit to explain to a mod if you have like 10 minutes. But it'll be legit if they abuse this power

I know it's not my place to say what you guys can do. But Imo if they continue to poorly comply with the rules it should be a warning-mute-kick-temban. And even a ban if it's a serious issue.

-1! Being muted is very annoying and frustrating. If you just made a joke and then a staff member mutes you for 2 hours. You can't even explain the issue. IMO they should get kicked, so there are not on the server anymore and they can come back if they know how to act normal.

In my experience, I've found that some people learn their lesson after a kick and some people don't.<br><br>Also, if you replaced the word "kicked" with "muted" in your sentence, then you can see how muting someone could potentially not work.

Muting would be &nbsp;beneficial to advertisers and chat related offedenders, allowing them to still enjoy the server. Permanent mutes would be issued of course. +1 :)

I never liked the /mute thing.&nbsp; Just kick them and if they continue, take further action like a tb.&nbsp; Getting them off the server if they can't behave properly.

Why should there? What happens if there is a spammer in chat that needed to be muted, but we can't due to the "limit"?<br><br>EDIT: All mods know how to use their commends efficiently...
