I was playing for a good amount of time last night and once i went to go look at my rank it didn't change, however my Kills, Deaths, PvP K/D, and K/D changed. I know i'm not ranked 2428th. Although when i look on the LeaderBoard my rank is 1215th, compaired to when i look at my Rank on my homepage. Someone please help! My Ocd is killing me! Thanks again. -SergeantBoom

It's probably just a website glitch.<br>Report any glitches or problems that you see to a Sr. staff member.

I would try contacting NolanDalton or jozzmcozz, that is what I usually do. Their skype names can be found on their profiles.

You really don't need it fixed. The leaderboards are glitched right now, so just be patient.
