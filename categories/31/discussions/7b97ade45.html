Community Party!

<a href='/users/PictureFrames.html' style='color: none'>PictureFrames</a>
<small>January 18, 2015 at  5:01 AM UTC</small>
</h1>
<span>Hello everyone! I'd like to announce that I will be hosting a party on the 25th of January, beginning&nbsp;at approximately 8:30 AM EST. This party will consist of the following:<br></span><br>-Plug DJ<br>-TeamSpeak<br>-In game fun<br><span><span>-Emerald giveaway... <i>(I'll go in to depth below!)</i><br></span><br></span><span>This party is mainly going to be a hangout. I'd personally love to meet some new faces, have a few laughs, and just have an overall good time. The soul purpose and main goal that I hope to achieve in doing this is, to bring the community together. Never know, this may be a great opportunity to make some life long friends!<br></span><br><span><span>On to the giveaway details, at some point during the TeamSpeak call,&nbsp;I will be announcing a competition that will decide the winners of the giveaway. I'm not going to let you know what that competition is now... You'll just have to wait and see. The winner of this competition (if you requested to take part in the giveaway) will be awarded with a free Emerald rank.<br></span><br></span><span>So if you're interested and would like to join us, please do! I feel like most of you are really going to enjoy the time to just relax, chat with friends, and have a nice time. And if you'd like to enter for a&nbsp;chance to win&nbsp;the Emerald&nbsp;giveaway, please let me know down below.&nbsp;I hope to see you there!<br></span><br>Regards, -Jake

I apologize for the horrible format it was in before, not sure why it did that. My computer's spacing system is messed up, so if all you could see was a cluttered paragraph when I first posted this, my bad. It's been&nbsp;fixed.

The reasoning for this is because it was the only time Fluenza_ and I could agree on, due to the time zone differences between us two. He wanted to be able to make it as well, and help out hosting it. Therefore, 8:00 AM was the only time that was somewhat suitable for us both to make it, however the party will be going on for quite some time I'm assuming... So you may be able to skip in mid way! &lt;3

5:30 for me, I'll try to make it tho. But for all those who have to wake up early or stay up late, whenever we have a party that's a perfect time for us (which usually it is) it's not the best time for Europeans, but they make it anyways xP

<span><span>Thank you everyone for participating in the event! <br></span><br><span>I really hope you&nbsp;had fun, met some new faces, and had an overall good time.

This week's winner of the Emerald giveaway was JustBudah, so congratulations! I really hope to see you all back next time, and&nbsp;hopefully some new faces as well.

Also before I lock this thread, this goes out to the players who joined me earlier in the party. How'd you like it? Anything that&nbsp;I should have done better, anything else you'd like to see...&nbsp;Any feedback is appreciated, but please make sure it's constructive criticism. Thanks a lot!

Well, I really think we can get a better time because it is the weekend and people do want to sleep in and maybe also a little longer for a party.
