1. Take a look at the Nexus idea topic<br>2. Introduce a new gamemode<br>3. Open staff apps for players (not naming) that have been helping a lot and are very well known cross-servers<br>4. Maybe some new lobby perks<br>5. Prestige prizes<br>6. Another rank maybe, Platinum...<br>7. Keep the server running

Considering the potential developers are being contacted and interviewed, I've love to see a few extra helping hands for Avicus that can work on the server to move it forward and put it in 2nd gear. Some of the devs I'm aware of are really intelligent and are what Avicus needs: Especially for updates. Developers being announced with the update would be nice.<br><br>Other than that, I'd like to see less focus on Nebula and more focus on other gamemodes. While Nebula is our signature gamemode, I don't want it to get milked. It's fine right now, but as we expand we need to focus on other gamemodes as well.

1. A new hub; I noticed that I'm always lagging out when I log onto avicus. Maybe it's because of the large hub??<br>2. Sky wars: I love this mini game! Also it can train new players for the next step up: Nebula!!<br>3. Cooler names for donators, such as, warrior for gold, knight for emerald...&nbsp;<br>4. What if there were nebula kits! I think I had a thread about this before, but we could have the archer kit, rusher kit, or the warrior kit!<br>5.

1. A new hub; I noticed that I'm always lagging out when I log onto avicus. Maybe it's because of the large hub??<br>2. Sky wars: I love this mini game! Also it can train new players for the next step up: Nebula!!<br>3. Cooler names for donators, such as, warrior for gold, knight for emerald...&nbsp;<br>4. What if there were nebula kits! I think I had a thread about this before, but we could have the archer kit, rusher kit, or the warrior kit!<br>5. A factions server?? why not??<br>6.&nbsp;<b>This is a bit off topic:</b> Add a friend button on the website again :)<br><br>That's pretty much it!

There are some maps for nebula kits (ex Axis) but it's better for gameplay if most maps don't have kits.&nbsp;<br><br><br>and no factions please. I love factions but it creates terrible communities.

1. Smaller lobby, please... I'm sorry but the current one is kind of huge which is fine but it takes a while to get to each individual game.<br><br>2. More lobby stuff. Parkour with prizes, lobbies for each game where spectators can do parkour, puzzles, etc. or just watch the game.<br><br>3. Prizes. Please, don't limit rewards to donators. Have more interactive things to do on Avicus not related to any specific gamemode that reward. This will draw more players.<br><br>4. Skywars<br><br>5. Revamp Avicade. Add more maps, more games, get rid of the lobby at least until other games have one if this happens. Make the layout like other games...<br><br>6. More gamemodes<br><br>7. Keep staff apps open always. You'll have less to deal with at once, because you'll have people submitting apps more spread out through the year. You might have more apps coming in, but this will get more staff on hand possibly, bring more players definitely.<br><br>8. New ranks (a new donation rank for less money, and maybe one for more than $100, and also some that come without applying for staff or donating such as ones that title you as a master of a game (Walls Master, Nebula Master, etc.)<br><br>9. More map devs<br><br>10. New website. I believe this is already happening. It should have an appeal category at least. A messaging system (toggleable if you don't want to receive messages)<br><br>11. Add friends button<br><br>12. Factions pls<br><br>13. Get rid of Elimination, put in SG/HG and accept maps for it<br><br>This would maybe be as significant as the avicore update. Not sure. It's probably not gonna all get fixed in one winter update.

Considering the potential developers are being contacted and interviewed, I've love to see a few extra helping hands for Avicus that can work on the server to move it forward and put it in 2nd gear. Some of the devs I'm aware of are really intelligent and are what Avicus needs: Especially for updates. Developers being announced with the update would be nice.<br><br>Other than that, I'd like to see less focus on Nebula and more focus on other gamemodes. While Nebula is our signature gamemode, I don't want it to get milked. It's fine right now, but as we expand we need to focus on other gamemodes as well.

I have some make it when you break a monument in Nebula you should get at least 12 XP because breaking the monument isn't easy . And you should being in a survival games .

There aren't kits in Nebula but, if you are meaning Nexus...<br>I get where you're coming from but, the kits are what Nexus is. The higher level kits are only as overpowered as the player makes it. The new players that do go to Nexus see the higher level kits as really good so, they keep playing to get those higher level kits. Once they get all of the kits in Nexus they can set their goals farther and farther and, get more kills.

In the winter update I would love to see:&nbsp;<br>- A new hub with parkour and other perks&nbsp;<br>- New gamemodes and maps for existing gamemodes<br>- Increased amount of Nebula servers open so that more games are running&nbsp;<br>- A smaller hub that doesn't take as long to travel in<br>- More people playing CTH and other, less popular gamemodes
