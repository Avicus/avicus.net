<div>I have a really bad idea for some kind of future tourney. So each player will select their nationality (probably their continent), an will</div><div>&nbsp;be placed in teams with players of the same continent. Then a tourney will take place. Europe and North America may split into countries because of the greater population. So leave your opinions below and if there are ways to improve this suggestion.&nbsp;</div>

It might be a little bit too messy to coordinate, &nbsp;plus the teams would lose cohesion if they had to play with new people instead of players they have been practicing with.

I joined the team I'm on because I knew I'd work well with the people on it. I think the same goes for a lot of other people and I can see some teams breaking down because of players who have problems with each other. If a few players have a problem playing together and following the same strategies, the whole team might be screwed.

I understand where you are coming from, but you will never get better if you don't change tactics and play with different people. Good to get the community closer together &amp; to learn new strategies

Maybe have USA east and west, because so much of the community are from the USA and Canada. Could you also have Europe east and west? The UK might just scrape enough people but countries like France and Italy certainly won't be able to form a full team. Time zones could also be a problem if you have a game between Europe and Australia.

AU doesn't mix much with anyone already. EU players mix quite a lot since there isn't a particularly large presence of one EU nationality. US players either divide up by the region they are from or based on skill level. Spanish speaking teams also section off for obvious reasons. The server's national divide is already rather present I don't think we need to make it official. This also will lead to resentment since this makes the host location an even bigger deal.
