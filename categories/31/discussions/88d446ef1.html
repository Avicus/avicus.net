Improving Competitive & Ranked?

Currently, Competitive has been added to the server. Ranked is in development and is confirmed as a gamemode, however right now as it stands they are just different in maps. In order to keep it true to competition and make it a better environment, I have the following suggestions. Feel free to include your own.<br><br>- Add blindness on the respawn screen to prevent ghosting <b>(confirmed)</b><br>- Make tactical information punishments harsher on competitive/ranked <b>(proposed)</b><br>- Enable team chat by default instead of global chat<br>- Prevent joining once the match has started

- Prevent donors or non donors joining at all after team cap (usually 8)<br>- Make a plugin like in OCN that doesn't allow team stacking: "If Red will remain stacked random players will be moved to Blue."

No team picking, otherwise players would stack.<br><br>Maybe copy OCN and just all out give limited ranked matches and donors get extra?

agreed give non-donators about 7/8 ranked matches and donors 20-25. IMO I would consider highly of donating if this was the case because pretty much I'll just be playing ranked because it's a nice competitive add other than tournaments. <br><br>also what ryan said as well was nice and same with raging

1. I didn't have OCN in mind when making this post.<br>2. Our ranked is a LOT more elaborate than Overcast's.<br>3. Even if we did copy, it doesn't matter. Progress is progress.

I would like to see a separate leaderboard just for these ranked matches.

That's completely invalid considering the fact that other servers use this method too, not only for ranked.<br><br>I find it very hard to understand why people say this. But this is a completely different server. So why compare it to another server that other people play on. Just because you're from ocn, some people (including staff) might not know what ocn is. So you really shouldn't compare these ideas to ocn when some important people involved in this update might not know what ocn is.
