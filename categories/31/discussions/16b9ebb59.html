Post your ideas below on how to make the server more fun or better overall! please don't be mean towards other peoples ideas, everyone is entitled to their own opinion. I would just like to say that it would be better if they made the server hub less laggy but still make it look good. I would like a less laggy hub because not long ago I used to have a pretty bad computer and every time i went on Avicus I would lag like hell xD. People with not so good computer will feel more comfortable joining the server and knowing they wont lag a lot :). But thats just what i think, tell me your ideas! I would love to know.<br>(Btw not saying the hub right now sucks, the hub looks AMAZING)

Very nice, but the&nbsp;<b><i>Assists&nbsp;</i></b><i></i>would be more useful in&nbsp;<i>Nexus</i>.<br>Still, a good idea.

People could abuse the assists, if they give you rewards

Maybe you have to hit the person more than one time to get the Assist? idk it sounds like a cool idea

Assists mightn't be a great idea cause people would just hit everyone like once in a pack and get credit when they die.

It would be sensible not to allow it to do that, it would be more logical if you got 50%-99% of the hits or more and someone came and stole your kill.
