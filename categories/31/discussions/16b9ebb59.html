Post your ideas below on how to make the server more fun or better overall! please don't be mean towards other peoples ideas, everyone is entitled to their own opinion. I would just like to say that it would be better if they made the server hub less laggy but still make it look good. I would like a less laggy hub because not long ago I used to have a pretty bad computer and every time i went on Avicus I would lag like hell xD. People with not so good computer will feel more comfortable joining the server and knowing they wont lag a lot :). But thats just what i think, tell me your ideas! I would love to know.<br>(Btw not saying the hub right now sucks, the hub looks AMAZING)

Things that could be potentially improved on are:<br>-<b>&nbsp;</b><i><b>Precise reporting system</b>, that includes date &amp; time, and an ability to insert a YouTube URL through the /report command.</i><br>-&nbsp;<i><b>Assists</b> in the part-taking of killing an enemy player&nbsp;</i>(specifically the game-mode; Nebula)<br>-<b>&nbsp;</b><i><b>Additional maps or improving the current ones</b>&nbsp;</i>(could include fixing a glitch on a map etc.)<br>-<i> <b>Additional donator rank</b> that is a bit cheaper than $25, reason being because for some people on the server, that is a hefty amount to spend on a video game even though it is the lowest price for a rank.</i><br><br>Not exactly sure if some of these can/ or will be achieved by I am just throwing some ideas out in the open.<b>&nbsp;<br></b>

Very nice, but the&nbsp;<b><i>Assists&nbsp;</i></b><i></i>would be more useful in&nbsp;<i>Nexus</i>.<br>Still, a good idea.

People could abuse the assists, if they give you rewards

Maybe you have to hit the person more than one time to get the Assist? idk it sounds like a cool idea

Assists mightn't be a great idea cause people would just hit everyone like once in a pack and get credit when they die.

It would be sensible not to allow it to do that, it would be more logical if you got 50%-99% of the hits or more and someone came and stole your kill.
