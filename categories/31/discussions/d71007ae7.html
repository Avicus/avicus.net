I would like to know if it will effect the ranks like gold, emerald, and diamond. I was wanting to buy one, but if we are just going to get the ranks taken away then I don't want to spend my money on it. Several people have told me that EULA shouldn't effect the ranks because they are just xp boosts, but some have told me different. Can someone give me a real answer?

Mojang just basically ruined Minecraft multiplayer. Close to no one will by ranks..<br>But if you're going to buy a rank, BUY A SUBSCRIPTION so you won't pay as much but still get all the perks. Also, it will help the server more because you'll have to pay again and again if you still want it. About to get diamond subscription.

Sadly, I don't think so :c<br>We'll just have to see how it plays out.<br>I'm sure if it becomes a major problem, Mojang will do their best to fix it.&nbsp;<br>There's no need to worry :3

I belive we're allowed to keep our ranks :P Isn't it just stuff Mojang Themselves have put into the games like items, as they didn't put in the rank Plugin I guess they have no control over that, same with CYOT(Choose your own team :P)

Well mojang said it, that you can not charge hard money(real money) for something that lets other players get XP faster so like the ranks will no longer be able to yeild more XP.

They won't be taken away. The only perk taken away is probably going to be donor kits because it violates the EULA<br>Also, I support the new EULA, Mojang if finally stepping up.
