My ban appeal has been denied, so this will probably be the last time I talk to all of you, unless I feel the need to communicate more on the forums.<br>Because there are 50 USD on my account (I have an emerald rank), I don't want all of that money to go to waste, so I wish to give it to my friend please (vladthesexy100).<br>I don't know if you can do this anymore, but I don't all of this money to be on an account that is no longer going to be in use.<br>If possible, please contact me over skype (A manager or someone who can do this for me).

Actually just too let you know. You weren't falsely banned. You were recorded by more than one person. So don't say "Oh I wasn't hacking" because that's why your appeal was probs denied because they had proof of you hacking. So just rewrite your appeal saying your sorry etc..

Guys as much as we all love porky for his vids and whatnot just let him and the mods sort this whole problem out.. As Mooch and Emerald stated above I don't think it allowed.. If the evidence were to be shown, you could target the recorder. That isn't fair for the person who caught him because he could be attacked for doing the right thing... Also I'm sure that there was a general consensus between the mods that porky was hacking. It's sad to see you go porky..

Why don't you let porky talk to the staff??? As I said above you're only targeting Nolan for doing his job.. Porky why don't you talk to staff instead of herding people to beg for you? I know this is flamey but honestly porky why do you have too make this problem public... If you wished to try and appeal again this would only lower your chances of being appealed.

Although Porky has been banned for hacking, there is no such evidence to prove such a claim as of now.&nbsp;I can also presume Porky has already talked to the staff, and has publicly brought this dispute to the forums due to their unresponsive actions.

Also, no, I will not be showing the video.<br><br>It is between Porky and the staff, this is not a community issue. I know you guys care about Porky a lot as a friend, and I understand that, but a video like that is confidential, it is kept that way to protect the reputation of the player who recorded the video (whom I was in-game with) and the reputation of Porky as well.
