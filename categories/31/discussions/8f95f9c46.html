Seeing the results of the recently concluded staff reassessment, how does everybody feel about this? Personally, I feel that despite the efforts to try to see which staff was "worthy" enough to continue, it seemed to me that only friends of these senior moderators got in. I've noticed that there were some very good moderators that were demoted just now. I don't see how or why this happened, yet there are moderators who aren't quite as competent that stayed in position. I will not name any names.&nbsp;<br><br>I provided a Strawpoll link for you to vote on, and you can further discuss your thoughts on what just happened below.&nbsp;<br><br><a href="http://strawpoll.me/4043303" rel="nofollow" title="Link: http://strawpoll.me/4043303">http://strawpoll.me/4043303</a>

I agree with this. Sunrise should not have gotten demoted in my eyes. There may have been some things between the staff and him that made you demote him but he is one of the most active avicus member and one of the greatest. Keep him as mod.

I honestly don't see much bias.<br><br>Take me for example, I haven't really gotten too close to most of the Sr Moderators +, but I still remained Moderator.<br><br>If a demoted Moderator wishes to speak about their demotion, they will do so. They were not demoted because of bias; there was a reason for why the Sr Staff felt like they should not continue moderating.

Our Sr staff team is not bias toward anyone, you don't know half the shit the staff as a whole goes through. You think we need you to call us &nbsp;corrupt, lazy, and bias? No. We do a lot of stuff for the community as a whole and individual players who are seeking help, and what we get? Treated unfairly. Point blank disrespected. I find as much as we do for you, no one cares. We do try and like Michael said you dont know some of the stuff that goes on behind the scene. I think we should get a bit more respect or our decisions and actions to help te community. Thanks

I can see a vast majority of you guys are upset. But you see, we can't please everyone, and we won't do that. It's not our objective to cause havoc or have bias towards other fellow Staff. Nothing will always please you in life. Our opinions on the revamp were justified. I bet if your friends weren't demoted, I bet you wouldn't have complained one bit. You know, it's part of the system, we can't be bias and let Staff who aren't doing their job correctly, stay. I haven't been Senior for very long, and I can't already determine what Staff members we'rent doing their job correctly. It's wasnt revolved around ones opinion. We had all of our own. So, tell me, when you're a Senior Moderator, tell me that you're going to please every single person on this server. &nbsp;You can't. It's impossible. Whether we demoted your friends or not, we reviewed and watched them closely on their performance. It's not like we made up a last min. decision if we like them or not. This is the complete truth. We watch and review, just like Junjor Moderators. If they're ready, we can promote them. If they can't do the task we assigined them, it's fair enough they will be demoted from their rank. Half of the time, you don't see what Staff do. You're not in our Staff Chat. You have no idea what Senior Mods see. It's our job to watch over the Mods. We will maintain that role professionally and with zero tolerance of a Staff having bias towards one. So now, we all have our opinions, you spoke yours. And we have the truth. It was in fairness.

Nonononono, not at all. Every single thing that is discussed in the Sr. Staff chat is important and crucial for the server. We have a chat for random discussion, but in the regular staff chat as well, moderating discussion and ideas are present at all times.

*clears throat*<br><br>The problem here is clear to me. I see both sides of the story. All to often, as MidnightBeats said, mods are being demoted for what they did&nbsp;<i>wrong.</i> Maybe if what they did right was also assessed, and then they were given feedback on how they could do their job better, rather than being straight up demoted, with no feedback given. Think about it. If that was the process, we wouldn't be in this fucking position!!&nbsp;<br><br>Thank you.

No, that's incorrect.<br><br>I'm sick of people complaining about how 'bias' this whole thing is when they have no idea what goes on behind the scenes. There was a huge amount of factors brought up when planning this and we have our reasons for each demotion/promotion.

Look, I pretty much Understand the frustration of some people, I was like that at the beginning. But, I have realized, As Michael Says, That <u>Senior</u> Mods Actually know Mods much better that we all do, And He is right on that.<br><br>Some Demotions in some opinions were not correct, In the eyes of others there are. So we have a Bit of a Forum Division. But please don´t Talk Crap about Staff members In general Are people that work to help you guys, And You pay them with Insults. Are we really on the 21st Century Guys?<br><br>I will give you&nbsp; a Example So you see what I mean: <br>Situation: Avicus Teamspeak<br>Time: Couple of Hours Ago<br>Where: Suite 2<br>-Guys, Have you heard About the Demotions?<br>- Yea, Jozz´s Was really Fair, He really didn´t do much.<br>- But Riley´s One was SO unfair, Friken Senior Mods, They don´t know what they are doing.<br><br>Senior Mods Dont Know what They Are doing? Senior means <u>Experienced</u>, And that means, That Senior Mods probably Have more Experience than you, And As Docta Said, Tell them on a Private way, Not on a Stream.<br><br>In My opinion, You should not be talking Rubbish about Staff members, Because They Work <u>MUCH </u>more than you think, And Some people Say Michael/Straightened does not help, Or does not do anything. Trust me He does, If he Didn´t, He would have probably already got demoted.<br><br>Please Just stop it, Demotions are <b><b>TEMPORAL, NOT PERMANENT</b></b>

No, that's incorrect.<br><br>I'm sick of people complaining about how 'bias' this whole thing is when they have no idea what goes on behind the scenes. There was a huge amount of factors brought up when planning this and we have our reasons for each demotion/promotion.

I can tell by confidential evidence someone gave me (Not naming anyone) that a Mod called me an "asshat" in Slack when I became a toxic asshole on the forums (Yeah, I admit it) but still, he's a Mod and he shouldn't do such a thing.<br>Now he's been demoted so Seniors are right, there is some sh*t behind the scences.<br>Also, as I previously said, can we stop making this kind of discussions? Imagine how harsh is for the people that got demoted (I feel you, same happened with me), just give them a break and let them deal with this by themselves instead of making posts that lead us to flame wars (Has happened a lot this days).<br>Thanks! ^.^

You were a senior staff member the first time you were demoted, which of all things, it's pretty disappointing.<br>The second time maybe just a week had gone by before you were demoted again, if you can't keep your head in the game don't play it.<br>That being said, you don't exactly have the right to tell me "says you.", When you're another culprit.

There's a difference between taking a stand for what's right and taking a stand for what&nbsp;<i>you&nbsp;</i>want. Don't think that I haven't actually touched upon this situation before. I've already argued my point at least 80 times on this already and I'm sick of seeing the same results. It has gotten so monotonous to the point where I can't stand this anymore. I just keep saying what I have to say, yet nobody listens. When they do listen, it's because the feel the need to contradict me. Now, you apparently are the more intelligent one here, mind coming up with another solution? Go ahead. Blow our minds with your wisdom.

It just goes to show how easily you've given up. Members of the community like you who just refuse to continue because people wont listen to you seems almost pathetic. If you stop and give up, nothing will happen and everything will just remain the same, The community has to keep on trying to get the staff team's attention, even if it goes in one ear and out the other it's bound to get to them some time. The same results keep happening because you refuse to do anything about it. Just alone I can't change squat, but if we as a community do something, than things can change. But that can't happen unless people like you who are unwilling to do anything start trying to make a stand.

It's not that simple. My point is that the server would be far better if the community all took a stand to point out the discrepancies &nbsp;in the staff team for the better of everyone

I did not say you had a lack of experience, but more experience, therefore you having more experience should have known better. AND I do know why you were demoted the first time.

It's people like you who cause these headaches.people like you flat out refuse to make a stand, If you can't stand up for what is going on than you might as well find another thread to stir, or at the very least find another server and take your redundant comments elsewhere..

You were demoted according to the logs for something along the lines of your attitude towards being a staff member was decreasing. Not only that, but the second time, you were demoted as the senior staff team saw it best that you reapply rather than being promoted straight to mod

I think you all need a bit of an enlightenment here.<br><br>I'm not mentioning anything about the staff re-assessment, and I'm not pointing fingers. But to those of you who are continuously pouring gas into the fire, then you have the balls to call&nbsp;<i>someone else</i> pathetic? Shame on you. It sure would be nice if we could all get along, right? Wait.. We can! If each and every one of you take off your pissy pants and change your attitude, that can become possible. However, ranting and going on and on about something isn't going to change a damn thing. "Sweet, I won an argument" is just about the best thing any of you are going to get out of this. I&nbsp;wouldn't say its worth your time to continue this, it's pretty pointless.&nbsp;<br><br>Another thjng to add, is that this is a pretty large flame war. Could one of the staff members who's been responding to this post just lock it? If possible. <br><br>Thanks!
