Please remove the map portal on nexus.&nbsp;<br><br>1. The portals doesn't work.<br>2. You aren't getting any golden apples when you're killing someone.<br>3. The map is laggy - Too much glowstone.<br><br><i>Thanks for reading!<br></i><br>- Have an awesome day/night<br>- Adam

Portals do work, but it just takes a few tries. And golden apples are working fine for me.

Glowstone doesn't lag.<br>It just makes your fps lower. (<i>if you use your intel graphics</i>) lol

We have removed the map Portal from rotations, thank you for your input.<br>I was aware of the fps drop caused by glowstone, and I was actually wondering if it would be okay to remove that map from rotations, anyways, I wasn't aware of portals not working properly and golden apples not dropping, so being a buggy map overall caused its removal.
