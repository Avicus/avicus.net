clicking right and left on your mouse at the same time, it reduces damage dealt on players, but it also reduces the damage you take if you were hit whilst block hitting at a player. It can slow you down too when you do it, as if you are sneaking and walking (that is unless you are holding down your sprint button, then that's a different story).<br>If you get a good blend or hitting/crits/block hitting, then you can kill players to your own extent. But personally I don't overuse block hitting, I do my own combination and blend but I still use it.<br>If you want more info about block hitting, look it up on google or youtube<br>xP

Block hitting allows you to block and hit with your sword at the same time, thus effectively reducing the damage done to you by your opponent. Block hitting is done by right and left clicking at the same time.<br><br>The ninja is real ^^
