I hear lots of people saying that they prefer 1.7 better. Many people say that 1.8's pvp performance is not good enough. And.... I do think that 1.7.10 is way better than 1.8.&nbsp;<br><br>Is there any possibility that this server will change to version 1.7.10? If so, I'm gonna.... Whatever.

This must be the most controversial topic ever on Minecraft servers.<br><br>If you want to play pure&nbsp;<b>1.7 pvp&nbsp;</b>then go to dedicated pvp servers.<br><br>Avicus can't ever go back to 1.7.10, the developers would have to scrap years of work, and by now a vast majority of the player base have moved on and accepted 1.8 pvp. We can't always stay on an old version, we must keep updating because it's proven that a majority of players are on the latest version.

The way I see it is that Avicus is a pvp based server, but not everything consists on the actual melee itself. There are a lot more factors, like how fast you are, what type of player you are(rusher, defender, etc). I think avicus is doing just fine at the moment with 1.8 and 1.9 support, and as Jack/Auratixx said, if you want 1.7.10, visit pvp based servers, like 1v1 servers.

At the minute, we run 1.8, and allow 1.9 and 1.10 players to connect, which is pretty crucial. There is no way we can downgrade to 1.8,&nbsp;considering all of our plugins are on 1.8 and it would take way to long for the devs to do it and they have a lot more important things to work on. The obvious answer is a protocol hack for 1.8 to allow 1.9 and 10 connections but also 1.7. However, I am pretty sure this is not possible, unless we upgrade to 1.10 which means like pvp is like it is in 1.10.&nbsp;<br><br>1.8 isn't that bad, at least I am pretty sure we aren't upgrading anymore anytime soon.

1.7 is great, I think in 1.8, Mojang added some stupid leftClickCounter, which means not every click registers, because of the counter, you have to wait for the counter to reach 0, then your click registers.

You can. But it requires editing the server jar A LOT and if not done correctly it would lag the server.<br><br><b>EDIT:</b> I just realised that 1.9 removed block hitting, since this was also a client change, it would be impossible w/o mods

no such thing because 1.9 gets rid of blockhitting completely so how are you going to blockhit then if the pvp is like 1.8? also 1.9 has seriously weird kb worse than 1.8 and 1.9 is hated by almost every smart player who knows how to pvp. You can't make 1.9 and 1.10 like 1.8 because like I said <b>no blockhitting</b>

Downgrading back to 1.7 would mean that the hard work that the admins put into the transition from 1.7.10 to 1.8 would go to waste. I for one would rather stay on 1.8 as I don't really notice the difference between the two anymore. In fact, I quite enjoy 1.8 (even if I prefer 1.7.10).
