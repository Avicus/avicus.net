TeamSpeak isn't working when I try login to Avicus, it just says. "Failed to resolve hostname" Is this just me? Or is this for other people as well?<br><br>If this is spam, feel free to lock this. My apologies if it is.

The teamspeak server tends to go down time from time.  It usually comes back on later in the day.

I don't think the Teamspeak server is <i>down</i>, it says: "Can't resolve hostname", not "Can't reach server".<br>Ivy probably forgot to pay for his domain!1!!1

That joke is a bit dumb, but it does say 'Can't resolve hostname', so, apparently it is the domain, not the TeamSpeak server, so.... yea.
