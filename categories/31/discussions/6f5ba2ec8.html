(group discussions to accept/deny maps)</li></ul>Feel free to comment below with more ideas.

Map testing event.<br>x2 credits for game modes, the more players the more chance they will play other game modes.

To encourage other game modes besides DTM: Hold events, like mini tournaments or credit multipliers in one gamemode.

Do a UHC on hardcore games.

It's really cheap but definitely worth while.<br><br>Please put the really good maps in nebula that everyone used to love back like Gladiator and clay wars (I believe that was removed due to a lack of gear, THAT WAS WHY IT WAS SO GREAT!)<br><br>+1 to trello!

<p><b>Hey everyone,</b><br><br>So this has been a problem with certain gamemodes (CTH, Nexus, SG, Arcade) on Avicus for a while now.Most of the players that join Avicus daily are joining to play the gamemode, Nebula. That is because this gamemode is intensely&nbsp;fun, amusing, and is unique. <br><br>Now, we have a <b>bunch</b> of other gamemodes on Avicus, such as CTH, Nexus, Survival Games, and Arcade. These particular gamemodes have barely any players, in other words they are not very popular with the community. <br><br>The Avicus map developers are interested in knowing, from you guys, what would make you play these gamemodes more? Events? Double credits? More maps?<br></p><p><br></p>

Double Credits would be great<br><br>Maybe a new rotation called "Avicus" which will be&nbsp;<b>every single&nbsp;</b>gamemode on avicus from a set of maps that the community love

I don't know, almost everyone on avicus just joins to play nebula, and nothing else.<br>They just play nebula and don't give other game modes a try, probably double credit events or something like that would help.

Events and combine CTH and Nexus maybe? The stats would get a little bit messy but having maps from both gamemodes in the same rot would conserve server space and hopefully blend the playerbase a little bit more.

Redo all the rotations according to player size. The mix rotations can be an exception.<br><br>Example: Northern Omens after Senex 1 would be bad.<br><br>Also, I will work on a rotation list if you want.

Set dates for when maps are tested and try not to review one map you see then totally overlook another map. &nbsp;Try giving different maps reviewing and testing with equal timing.<br><br>I think doubling credits is the best option to lure in more people.<br><br>More map testing events.

I´m disagree with doubling credits. I think that the server give enough credits, and if you want more 1 option. Buy a rank.

One of the biggest reasons nobody plays any other gamemode is that almost everyone plays on Nebula. If you guys got more people on the server, though, that problem could be fixed. If Avicus was marketed more to the millions of minecraft players, it could have more than 100 people online at a time. Start up an Instagram, Tumblr, Pinterest, etc. Post awesome gaming stuff. Follow/unfollow to get people to see your stuff. Reach out to popular Minecraft Youtubers to get them to play Nebula. You could also have prize giveaways like 10,000 credits or something like that. IN SHORT- More popularity= More people to play= different gamemode players
