Hello everyone, Jake here. Because of the fact that my very first account was so bland (Jake41901) and I didn't even get to choose Aversively's name, (given to me, it'll still be used as an alt) I've decided to create a third, and final account.<br><br>AuraFusion will be the account that I use from now until the end of time, even when name changes come out. I'm sticking with this. And I'm sure most of you are wondering why I did this right before name changes. I figured that when name changes come out, there's a good chance that at least one out of the however many people who own a Minecraft account may take the name that I want, so might as well get it now while it's still free to use.&nbsp;<br><br>Sorry about all of the confusion. There was a lot of confusion with the switch from Jake(numbers) to Aversively, and I felt bad about that too. However this is the last time I'll be doing this. Thanks for understanding!<br><br>Regards, -Jake

The switch from Jake41901 to Aversively occurred, because I was completely fed up with having such a bland name. (Jake41901) So Peachy had this alt account that he didn't use (Aversively) and said he'd be willing to give it to me. Thus, the switch from Jake to Aversively came to be.
