<p class="MsoNormal">Before you read I would like you the reader to read all of
the information I post. Saying that I would like to warn you that this is going
to be a very long post and if you do not have the time I would suggest that if
you do not have 10 minutes of your time to read or to contribute to leave this
post until you do.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">First off people are going to be saying the same thing. “Oh
no, not a useless post about telling the community about the problems of this
server.” In all honesty you do have the right to think that but I am not going
to be doing that in my post. In all due respect to the people that tried making
the posts referring the problems you are doing it wrong. Everyone that posted
that actually wanted to try to help the Avicus Network did wrong. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In the state of the Avicus Network right now we have 4
parties, staff, John Cena Imposters, Numberz Salt Crew, and everyone else.
These parties have been taking the forums over and have been fighting to no
ends extent to try to prove them right while in reality, the Avicus Network is
crumbling. History Repeats and one of the strongest empires was India when a
man named Akbar was in charged. Akbar had a kingdom that had separate
religions. Akbar learned that to have a strong kingdom you needed tolerance
from the religions. The kingdom was extremely powerful for the rest of his rule
when tolerance in religions formed in India. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Same thing can apply to Avicus Network. From all the four
groups they have something in common. The similarity is that we want Avicus to
live on. You can be a skeptic about if Avicus is dying or not but do you want
such a divided community that is killing off the forum activity. We have 2 fun
threads where everything else is about blaming another part of the community. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">So am I going to leave it there with just telling you we
have to have tolerance and to save the community with just that? I have decided
to become a leader for the server when I made this post and I will be working
to help the problems. How this will work is that in this thread alone. You are
not from the Salt Crew, From John Cena, even from staff. You are a member of
Avicus that wants to see the network live and you have a valid concern. You may
not like everyone that you work with and I may not like you, but I would ask
for your respect as we are teammates to work on this project together. Do not
call each other idiots, don’t be an idiot, and remember that every opinion is
valid to a curtain extent.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">On this post, this is where I will only address staff as a
different part of community. I request that everything that makes you have
ideas will be discussed here only. I do not wish for secretive conversations
and most of the community doesn’t wish for it either. You are community members
and you will help with your community members, not with others in a secretive
area. Also another request I make for staff is not to moderate this forum. When
I ask for this I wish that I call the shots. If someone posts something
inappropriate then I will request for a moderator to remove it. I would like
the mindset of staff and the community that everyone in this thread is your
fellow community members wanting to make a positive change. This will also
remove the illusion that is called “staff vs community” which people use to
start useless arguments. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Before I reveal how this will work, I have one other thing
that I would like to say about the recent threads addressing the problems.
Their main mistake also is just addressing the problems and the finger is
usually pointed at a curtain crowd. Usually the people that get pointed at go a
little too defensive and soon enough we are in this endless state that is ping
pong where people argue about the small stuff where the real problems are not
being addressed. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">What is my plan you ask? My plan is to try to unify the
Avicus Network’s community and to focus on problems slowly instead of stating
50 problems at a time, I will post 2 problems and I will change them once those
problems are fixed. I will repeat this until the community is mostly unified
and I do not feel I have to lead anymore.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">So what are the problems? This is where the community comes
together. I would like to ask staff and players to post problems that they wish
the community would look at as a whole. I will also be posting a sheet with
everyone’s suggestions and the ones the community wishes to work on the most. I
will also be posting themes the problems have to roll around because the
community obviously can’t fix problems like block lag or hit lag.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">No pointing fingers and work with everyone. I do not like
how Avicus is right now and a lot of others don’t either. Instead of doing
stupid shit, we can move forward as a whole instead of moving in every other
direction. We need everyone’s help for this. I don’t care who you are. Drop
your pride and help Avicus.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">So let’s discuss. The first theme I would like to work on in
unification of the community</p>

If anyone doesn't know why I reserved this spot. I am reserving it to show the problems that I want the staff to look at the most<br>Rule Clarification-A lot of members are confused about some of the rules. The rules need to be clarified so that less confusion can happen. If there is less confusion, the community is a little more easier to talk to

Personally I don't see any problem with Avicus besides the player rate, to me Avicus is a lot more enjoyable than OCN. The Maps selection is great, the scrim servers are a plus, and the community is far better than the one back at OCN. The things that may need a bit of tweaking such as removing some gamemodes or reviving them somehow won't really happen unless the owner or some higher up staff get the urge to improve. Until then we are stuck with what we have, which is fine by me.

The community is almost destroyed. No one goes on ts anymore. A lot of posts are staff v community. People are making these stupid groups out of no where. Will this kill Avicus? I do not see it killing it in the near future but this is make everything easier for staff and the community. Thank you for your input though

Gurk shares quite similar views to me, honestly if more work went into player count, then all the negative players and all the stupid try hards who use this as an outlet for having something to argue with and something to try and look cool on; would simply be drowned out. There is no point making this bigger than it actually is. Just get rid of sort out the people who cause problems, minimise staff arguments within each other and learn to work as a proper unit. Get the competitive scene thriving and advertise the competitive side better as that is the most likely feature to attract players. I genuinely just want more teams to play against, more events and meet more new players.

I agree, but I would also like to point out that if the regulars doesnt give the Staff a chance to fix the relation there isnt much we can do. Atleast not I can do. :(

avicus is dying due to lack of gamemodes, especially avicus. Avicus has 1 gamemode that people play, ofc people play the others sometimes but nebula is all that gets played. Instead of trying to add other crappy gamemodes and pointless gamemodes like the walls, &nbsp;just focus on improving the one that you have and is your best. Try to expand on that, advertising it more, which will eventually work and get more players, more regular tourneys with big streamers, pay for a youtuber to advertise avicus.<br><br>this was on my phone excuse the poor punctuation

To be honest, I do agree with what most people have said. I have seen the server from both sides and can say that both sides need to take a chill pill. I myself have tried to. I never really intended for an argument to start... Alas, I really think that once we start advertising the servers competitive side and we update to 1.8 we will experience a nice new player base! However, I really think we should update to 1.8 before the tournament! Seeing as that I will be spending my last few weeks on Avicus I shall contribute to it how I should, and how I have... Anyways, I think that regarding TS we should let community members run it. I know it sounds crazy but think about it! Its actually not a bad idea. The TS community will get their voices heard by the person in charge, and the staff get &nbsp;a break from criticism regarding Team-speak.&nbsp;<br><br><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; ">- Make the Rules and Guidelines clearer I agree</span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; "><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; ">-Fix Block Lag I think this one is being fixed with 1.8!</span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; "><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; ">-The Relations between the Community and Staff Definitely, I think both sides need to calm down a bit, and then sit over a cup of tea and discuss.

Regarding relations, the best thing we can do is probably integrate the two into each other through the variety of medias avicus has. Overall, Teamspeak has always been a great tool regarding relations etc.. However, with the recent changes that I have discussed quite a bit (:P), I cant say that some players kind of want to hide from staff. I know it sounds stupid, but some people are feeling this way. :(<br><br>Again I apologise for only caring about Teamspeak, but like Indian Tech Support's love for phone calls, I love Teamspeak (hehehehehehe)

All of your ideas are awesome, although I don't really understand how community controlling teamspeak would work. I mean yeah, most people think the staff are bad at running it which is somewhat true, but consistent trolling is bound to happen.

Don't let fear of rule breakers control how you act. The more you have fun with the community and the more you are proved when you can react to situations will make you more respected by the community. Trust me it works ;)

As much as I hate 1.8, we need to switch to 1.8. I love 1.7 and that is the version I learned everything on, but player count issues will lessen if there is a switch to 1.8 and the blocklag/server glitches will be lessened, given most are due to 1.8/1.7 hybrid.&nbsp;<br><br>This is IMO, feel free to critisize or disagree.

Something Im just going to note down because I cant remember anything is to remove TNT Maps. Its just not for Avicus. The general pace of most Avicus maps are not suited for TNT.

lol I realized this post was a joke and stopped reading once I saw "Numberz Salt Crew".<br>So many people are salty but&nbsp;<b>NOT</b> because of 99.

There is no&nbsp;<b></b>"salt crew" as you call it, it's just everyone who decides to be salty.<br>So maybe do your fair share before starting accusations or non existent clubs that just ruing a person's reputation please...

Gurk shares quite similar views to me, honestly if more work went into player count, then all the negative players and all the stupid try hards who use this as an outlet for having something to argue with and something to try and look cool on; would simply be drowned out. There is no point making this bigger than it actually is. Just get rid of sort out the people who cause problems, minimise staff arguments within each other and learn to work as a proper unit. Get the competitive scene thriving and advertise the competitive side better as that is the most likely feature to attract players. I genuinely just want more teams to play against, more events and meet more new players.

avicus is dying due to lack of gamemodes, especially avicus. Avicus has 1 gamemode that people play, ofc people play the others sometimes but nebula is all that gets played. Instead of trying to add other crappy gamemodes and pointless gamemodes like the walls, &nbsp;just focus on improving the one that you have and is your best. Try to expand on that, advertising it more, which will eventually work and get more players, more regular tourneys with big streamers, pay for a youtuber to advertise avicus.<br><br>this was on my phone excuse the poor punctuation

</div>
Yeah... I'm not sure how having less game modes will increase player capacity. &nbsp;There is a big walls community(not as large as Nebula, obviously) I think there should be more focus on them to make your point completely opposite tbh. &nbsp;If we had an unique caliber of games to play on here then we advertised those games then you'll see people roll in here
