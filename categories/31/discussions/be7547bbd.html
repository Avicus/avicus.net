I noticed that some people on Avicus are going afk for a long time.. is that allowed? On other servers it kicks you and is not allowed

On a side note, I see mods AFK a lot in the lobbies. I'm feel like that's one of their duties or something if they're waiting for a report.<br><br>But anyways.<br>I do think they should be kicked after a certain number of minutes. Besides, why would you want to raise your playtime up anyways? What good does it bring to them? .-.

People AFK because they're AFK, not because they want to bring their playtime up.

Yeah, that's true .-. Tbh I don't see why people should or shouldn't be kicked. There's no way that playtime will ever do you any good (unless you want to have the most playtime on the server, idk) so it's really up to the staff to decide if they want AFKers to be kicked...

I go afk in walls and CTH until the game starts and that's how I have 51 days online .-.

Online time doesn't really matter. So I wouldnt say it's a big problem.
