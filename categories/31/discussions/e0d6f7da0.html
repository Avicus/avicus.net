Hey guys, so 1st off i really didnt wanna do this but i haf no where left to go on this server, so ill be quitting from Avicus and probs minecraft for good since Avicus is the only server i really play on and enjoying my time with everyone, but i guess good times arent forever... I let my mouth slip once and i can never take it back... Im expecting a permaneny ban soon on my acc cause of 2 tempbans on my accord and excessive infractions, even though i tried really hard to keep myself clean, i just ended up falling back in the mud again. I just wanna say its been quite the ride, its been fun hanging out with all of you ever since my iTerraCubist days upto last night, but now i gotta just go, and lastly to Lokigh, im truly sorry i couldnt carry your name perfectly, i feel unworthy now as i say it.<br><br>Hope you all have a good time without me, who knows you might find a new Jiff, a new Worst One, a new Commentator for your games, a New Weeb, a New Me.<br><br>Sayanara.

From the amount of infractions you have, you're not going to get a perm ban until you at least double the amount of infractions you have. Kinda odd to quit just because you got a short temp ban, besides, just try to avoid saying the type of stuff you said in chat in the future and you won't get any more infractions.<br><br>Anyways, if you're not joking about this, then it was nice having you on the server!

:(<br>if you're really going to quit, then goodbye. It was fun to play and chat with you!<br><br>By the way, please don't leave just because of the infractions! It's very unlikely that you will get a permanent ban, so please stick around and see what happens!&nbsp;<br><br>Just in case however, I will you luck in whatever happens and in your future endeavours if you leave Avicus. Assassins will always welcome you back.<br><br>Goodbye :'(.<br><br>P.S: Don't worry about Lokigh. He's hardly the best role model. xD
