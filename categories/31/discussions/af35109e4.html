Probably good idea to email support@avicus.net with your question if no one can answer you here. Why do you want to refund it though?

He wants a refund because he got banned.<br>They aren't refundable, just email support@avicus.net to appeal your ban, that's as far as you can get.

Ivy needs to make money and pay for the server somehow, diamond/emerald/gold donors cant just refund easily if they were banned, then no money would be made.

I understand you and I'm fully aware of the cost of a server and a website, though I don't understand why it isn't enough to just say "No, we don't allow refunds" instead of also banning. He shouldn't have hacked in the first place, but being banned again because you ask for a refund seems a bit over the head.

As I understand it, he didn't do a paypal chargeback. He <u>only</u> asks if there's a possibility of refunds.

Just saying, it isnt illegal to chargeback once you have legit claims, like you never got what you want, or goods not as described etc.

Yes but it is not illegal... if you have legit claims you are entitled to your money back. If Avicus decide to ban you then for that, well that's their choice and they can do that sure.

Legally, you can refund, but due to the system that Avicus, and as well as many other minecraft server use, you will get banned from every server using this system<br><br>Note: This was effective when MC Zone was up, I don't know if it still is

refunds are not allowed, it would be a pain to have to go through the whole process to send the money back, and then avicus has around 86 servers (each will probably cost 20$-60$) plus 30$-50$ for the website, and then 10$ or so a year for the avicus site and server custom domain, in 1 month it is a lot of money, so that would be another reason to not give refunds, that is why you don't hack or whatever you did to get yourself banned after donating
