Hey avicans!<br><br>I had just noticed two small changes that have occurred recently.<br><br>As everybody knows. Peachy retired, couple of hours later, he was mod again. So, that was once. Big surprise. Done.<br><br><br><br>Then I saw theo, have a blue name again, I'm not hating or anything, but how'd he get mod again?! After so long without mod, all of a sudden he gets it back!?&nbsp;<br><br><br><br><br>Wat.<br><br>Was jt a false demotion? Or what?<br><br>Can somebody explain what happened? Preferably staff.<br><br><br><br>Question 1. How Peachy came back...<br><br>Question 2. How Theo came back...

Well from what I remember he went on a rant about getting free stuff cos he was a mod and banned funky. I don't think that'd qualify him to be a moderator...

The rule when I was staff was that retired/demoted staff would have a harder way to get back in... I guess that changed... although I luv peachy and theo &lt;3

He was the only one to ban funky. 2 other mods did. Both are no longer mods either but that's not the reason.

I didn't go on a rant about getting "free stuff", I started argueing that staff were doing tons of work and not getting much remuneration.

Now for some story telling.<br><br>I have tried to get back into the staff team for 5 months now. It has been 8 months since I banned Funky, and apperantly the staff still don't trust me.

If Peachy and Theo got to become mod so easily again, why couldn't I? I only retired for a few weeks to study for exams and finish school with good grades because they were low due to myself spending so much time moderating on Avicus. When I retired, I was at a good standing with the community and all the other staff. Yet I wasn't given a chance. Why?

Now for some story telling.<br><br>I have tried to get back into the staff team for 5 months now. It has been 8 months since I banned Funky, and apperantly the staff still don't trust me. I'd like to give a thanks to Gillette for understanding my situation. I have tried contacting other staff about my application like Howsie, but when asked why I was denied it was met with silence.&nbsp;<br><br>I was denied simply because the staff don't trust me after 8 months; because I banned one guy. Not only did I ban one guy, but I also tried to help my other staff members to get the remuneration they deserve. I also stood up for Howsie and Gillette getting paid. No one looks at this.<br><br>I also did an entire summer holiday's work, I was a moderator for 4 months. I moderated well; majority of the staff liked me. I played like a mad-man. No one looks at this.<br><br>I left the staff team out of lack of time, and other personal reasons which I will not release to you. (EDIT: Personal reasons include being captured by a Nigerian Prince)<br><br>I was told to re-enter the process; it took ages like most things in Avicus and in the end I was denied...<br><br>I don't play on Avicus anymore because of lag and lack of interest. Although I have established strong views on the server with other users.<br><br>I disagree with a lot of things on the server, and this is one of them.<br><br>If staff leave it should be easier to get back; you've proved yourself. You shouldn't be judged on something that happened 8 months ago, one time. You shouldn't purely be judged on this, when I've done so much good.<br><br>Thanks Avicus...

If Peachy and Theo got to become mod so easily again, why couldn't I? I only retired for a few weeks to study for exams and finish school with good grades because they were low due to myself spending so much time moderating on Avicus. When I retired, I was at a good standing with the community and all the other staff. Yet I wasn't given a chance. Why?

Back on topic: Staff should have a leeway on getting back in.<br><br>Or have it easier to get back in.

This is such a controversial topic. Every mod that resigned their staff position or got demoted were for different reasons... Regretting your decision ( if you resigned ) is up to you, but don't expect to get back to the team so easily... I do agree with that point of view, but I also agree that it should be at least equally the same difficulty if not a slightly better chance to get to the staff team again as any other player in the community. I do think that past retired mod should ask for a reason to why they can't get mod back the way Peachy and Theo got it and get an answer, this way they at least know. Because telling someone it is an entire different story doesn't help us retired mods at all...

It shouldn't be the same difficulty to get mod back if you've already proved yourself.

<span>"Well from what I remember he went on a rant about getting free stuff cos he was a mod and banned funky. I don't think that'd qualify him to be a moderator..."<br><br>I don't even know how to reply to this. I didn't go on a rant about getting "free stuff", I started argueing that staff were doing tons of work and not getting much remuneration. Banning Funky doesn't suddenly make you a villain, it is a way of protest. He literally just needs to take 5 seconds to take his name off the ban list.<br><br><br></span>
