Hello Avicus Community, <br><br> The&nbsp;moderator team would like feedback from the community of Avicus, so&nbsp;they can strive towards becoming better staff members individually, and as a whole team. To do this, we need community members to submit feedback which will be given to&nbsp;them through a google form (<a title="Link: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Zx8gSixqcRMTG_e4e1jvhoZATP-3YbGAyrJXxPHuLGw/viewform" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Zx8gSixqcRMTG_e4e1jvhoZATP-3YbGAyrJXxPHuLGw/viewform">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Zx8gSixqcRMTG_e4e1jvhoZATP-3YbGAyrJXxPHuLGw/viewform</a>). <br><br>We hope you partake in giving feedback to us, and thank you in advance.

This is MODERATOR feedback, the one I previously made was feedback for SENIOR staff.

Keep in mind that you don't have to fill out feedback for ALL of the moderators.

The senior staff was good size, but this?! Re-make it smaller and ask questions in general, but leave a box at the end where we can pick on certain moderators we chose. Sorry Sky. :(

Again, you don't have to fill out feedback for each and every moderator. If you have certain feedback you want to give to only ONE moderator, that's completely alright, and you can only fill out their section. The only required question in the form is "How can the team improve in general"
