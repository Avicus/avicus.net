You can't really post about self achievements or things concerning yourself.<br><br>I don't think it's a very good rule, because I think we should all celebrate in eachothers achievements and I think the community would grow like that... But it does kind of prevent selfish behavior and spam.<br><br>There are pros and cons but overall I think the rule should be changed to "No selfish posts", not regarding self achievement.

You're right. However, as I said in my point, I think some selfless self achievement wouldn't hurt, because it helps to community grow... :L<br><br>I personally like it when people post "I just got 50k kills! :D", because it makes you respect them for it. If people are like "Look at this killstreak I got!" then I agree that thread should be removed/locked. :P

So at what point do you become "well known"? There's no such thing as that! That's unfair for other players, and that kind of like favoritism, something that DoctaPop was even demoted for. There is probably another reason.

That's when you start using common sense about what you post. There is a clear line between Avicus related things that you can, and that you can't post.

Well, obviously, the reliance on "common sense" is insufficient and this "clear line" is still hazy and vague, considering we're actually having an argument over what counts as "Avicus-related" and what doesn't.<br><br>An apology for something directly pertinent to the server, coupled with less relevant information, is nonetheless, at least marginally, "Avicus-related". If you were to ignore the tangential, unrelated half of the post — which you easily could, and therefore should — would it not be "perfectly fine"? There have been countless other threads in the past as well, where people discussed personal updates that, normally, would warrant a lock, yet they managed to get by for whatever reason, be it popularity in the community, pity from others, or (such as in this case) adding a remark or two about the server. One thread gets archived, another is allowed to remain; this disorganization and lack of consistency constitutes why players cry "bias" so often.

Cocky isn't a swear word, don't worry about blurring. :3<br><br><br>Anyways, I'm 50/50 on those threads. Honestly, you have to admit that most people just make them for the "Congrats dude!" or "Aww, we'll miss you! Hope you come back!"<br><br>In other words, attention. But, topics like 2 year anniversary's are fine, IMO.

I wouldn't blame it right away on favoritism but instead different mods with different levels of strictness, some mods lock posts for being personal updates while others lock them for "centered around one person".&nbsp;<br><br>Still an issue though, and needs to be fixed.
