If you have clicked on the link, you'll be fine. If you logged in the your credentials, then change your MC password ASAP.<br><br>My Skype was hacked, so it wasn't me who sent it (FYI).

I did the same as you, but nothing will happen to you.<br>Unless you click on "register" on that website, nothing will happen. If you&nbsp;<b>did&nbsp;</b>click on "register" and you made an account, then you should change your Minecraft password&nbsp;<b><i>right now</i></b><i></i>.<br>It is support to give you some type of keylogger, if you do log in, but if you simply clicked on the link, you have nothing to worry about.<br><br>However, you should change your password nonetheless, just for safety measures, although nothing is supposed to happen to you.

I agree 100%.<br>Also, on the link, you can notice that it says "cm" instead of "mc", which is easy proof that it is fake.

You are screwed, your MC account is gone, as is your bank account and everything you ever owned. A secret society will steal your family and your future children and your life will never be the same for you. Good bye if you ever see daylight again then that is a miracle in itself. Have a nice day now.

I came here because I thought this was about Avicade ;-;<br><br>Anyway I would just change scan your computer incase you got a keylogger to be safe. And if you did enter your account info, go to a different computer/device to change it, incase you DID get a keylogger.
