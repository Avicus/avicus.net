</h1>
Hello everyone, ALM here.<br><br>For the last couple of months, it has been discussed both internally and in the community about switching our servers to 1.12 and allowing 1.9+ clients to connect. This has some major advantages in development since we can now use features that we haven't been able to use in over a year since we have been on 1.8.&nbsp;<br><br>I would like to get some community input on this matter since you guys are the one's that play our servers.<br><br><b>Some things to consider:</b><br><ul><li><b>We can still support 1.8</b> but new features in games won't be available to those users.</li><li>Combat Update style PVP will be in affect, with many modifications made to match it up with the way we currently have PVP</li><li>We will get features from 1.9-1.12</li><li>1.8 will eventually be dropped.</li></ul><br>Vote here:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.strawpoll.me/13335429" title="Link: http://www.strawpoll.me/13335429">http://www.strawpoll.me/13335429</a><br><br>Feel free to discuss below but be warned that any useless posts will be archived.<br><br><b>UPDATE</b>: We can support&nbsp;1.10.*, 1.9.*, 1.8.*, 1.7.* clients if we update.<br><br>Thanks,<br>ALM

Abandoning 1.7 support is a huge folley, please learn from your predecessors and do not repeat their mistakes. The reason Avicus tourneys have been increasing in size as of recently is because you're just now tapping into the huge playerbase of people who loved team based 8v8 minecraft (ocn) and like playing in 1.7, the objectively best version for pvp. In 1.8, your crosshair lags behind where it is alleged to be by a few miliseconds, and the laundrylist of unplayable features and bugs added in 1.9 will not only take more dev time to remove than it did to make all of atlas, but even then at the very best you can only achieve a quazi 1.7 pvp hybrid where you're neither appeasing the people who want a real 1.7 pvp experience, or the 1.9 purists who I assume you're trying to attract with this move. This is a lose lose. Keep 1.7 support or your current competitive playerbase evaporates, I promise.

Um did you not see what happened to ocn? Updating to 1.9 is a huge mistake and dropping 1.7 support is aswell<br><br>the server had 1 person on at 1 point yesrerday, if that doesnt count as being dead, then dropping 1.7 will make sure of it

Please, please, please, please, please! Don't do this. Avicus has made some mistakes in the past.. Killing of the player count hugely. This, is one of those mistakes, but it's not some small mistake, I and from the looks of it everyone else, can tell this is one of those major fuck ups that a server could make. As everyone has been saying, OCN did this.. Look where they are now. <br><br>You recently updated the scrim server, great job! However, massive shame the <br>competitive scene is now dead..&nbsp;<br><br>It's worth the thought, but it's not worth the time. The only thing that stops me playing stratus instead of avicus. Is the community and the 1.7/1.8 support. By getting rid of 1.7/1.8 support, you get rid of the community. Then you might as well all start applying for staff at Hypixel, because if you do this Avicus is 110% dead.

srsly if u want proof just look at all of those mega servers im not going to mention them but u should probaby know what they r. They were actually smart enough to not get rid of 1.8 and some even 1.7 because they actually had brains and thought that 'if we removed those versions everyone would be sad and leave the server so we wont get get rid of them.' Like most of them aren't even competitive servers and they could legit get rid of 1.8 support and the whole community would probably still be alright with the 1.9 hits. But even they didn't get rid of it. And since avicus is a 'competitive' minecraft server, i doubt that removing this support would be beneficial to this server at all. 'i'd rather see the server move forward than being held back by a 1 - 2 year old version instead of using outdated software for development.' U either didn't think twice before posting or u just dont understand how this process works at all no offence but that is legit one of the most reckless and unrewarding ideas I have ever heard of in my life. Getting rid of something old and getting something new instead doesnt necessarily mean that it will be better. For example, u have a laptop and the company releases a new version of the laptop that u have but its inferior in specs to the laptop u have rn in all area. What u r saying is that we should buy that laptop and get rid of ur old one even tho its better because u want to 'move forward'. Avicus staff team plz take all of these replies on this thread to account because WE r the people playing ur server and not YOU and what we r all saying is that u shouldn't drop support for 1.8 and also bringing back 1.7 support. Plz do consider that our opinions r the ones that matter the most because when u do drop support for 1.8, most of us wont be here anymore and by then, u will be regretting&nbsp;this decision. Mark my words.

1.7 was the only advantage of avicus over stratus. If you remove 1.7&amp;1.8 I, or any other player, have no reason to come prefer to play here over stratus. They have better maps, better staff, better everything. You had one advantage and you fucked it hard in the organs

There's no advantage of using 1.9 for avicus at all. I find it funny af that people think just because a version is a higher number than the next it makes it more of a viable choice for development or w/e. MC is dying 24/7 because of these shitty updates, I can only name 1 server that has some success with 1.9 pvp and even that is minuscule in comparison to the success it would have if it were 1.7. Every update after 1.7 to combat is terrible and no pvp server that wants to get a decent player count should prevent 1.7 clients from logging in.<br><br><br>but hey this is AVICUS

To be honest, 1.12 is currently my favorite minecraft-version. I was doing a mod and then I realized that the worlds now look much cooler and epic, and the new changes werent that bad either. For pvp, I prefer 1.7 or 1.8. Also I think that 1.8 has to do more with skill, because it made movement more important

I am personally against this move at this moment because it does not fit with our general demographic that we are currently trying to attract. The only aspect of the pvp community that plays above 1.8 is the faction communities and even so the biggest faction servers in mind stick with 1.8 or lower. The server at the moment does not fit such a shift that if this was to happen it would decimate our community and give them less of a reason to play on our services compared&nbsp;to our direct competition.&nbsp;<br>I get the ideas of having an easier time developing the plugins and bringing new and exciting games into the Minecraft community, but doing a full change towards a version can hurt us more than help us even in the long run.

I'm sure as a PVP&nbsp;server you could have easily expected those poll results. A lot of well-known servers have made very stupid mistakes, which have ruined their player base or server in general. Avicus is barely lifting off the ground, as the server struggles to get more than 40 people online each day. Avicus has had a lot of updates in the past, and some were absolutely awful. I'm sure by now, Avicus knows what the community wants, and what it doesn't want. If you want this to stay alive, then give the community what they want. Don't expect the community to adapt to your changes, and think they will like them. Removing 1.7 support was quite stupid, and removing 1.8 support is going to stop the server. I get that not a lot of people used 1.7 daily, but when it came to competitive tournaments &amp; scrims that is something I'd say about 75% of people used. If we want to have a competitive side and continue as a PVP server, then don't remove the versions that have the best pvp. I understand the server wants to update to all this new fancy stuff, but in the end, you are achieving nothing but failure. Don't ruin PVP like Minecraft did.

Idk what you admins or whoever are thinking but,<br><br>In no sense is updating past 1.8 a competent idea from a competitive standpoint. Not only are the 1.9 features literally gamebreaking (elytras for example) to a level where the "whole map" is irrelevant since you can fly to your own base to the wool rooms.<br><br>Possibly, 1.9 and above have some good factors from a public and casual standpoint for "the fun" of it.&nbsp;<br><br>Although, if the server were to be updated past 1.8 and for there to be no prize pool, Bulldogs/Pureblox will not participate in future tournaments due to the terrible combat/PvP experience of 1.9 and above (Essentially, no fun or incentive to win or play over other Tournaments/servers). As an example, the update caused The Overcast Network to get bought out by Lifeboat causing a crash in the server as a whole. I would also like to input the server is already pretty "Laggy". As in the hitregistration/detection is worse than a lot of other servers and 1.9 will just make it more worse and add disgustingly broken knockback.&nbsp;<br><br>Thanks for the read whoever cares idk, cya.

I was questioning ALMs intelligence for a while. I was unsure which side of the fence to put him on, but this had made it clear.<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwY3HbSIRTE" title="Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwY3HbSIRTE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwY3HbSIRTE</a><br><br>Fixes everything and then ruins it with 1 retarded decision. It's like he was involved in a car crash and lost 70% of his brain cells in said crash/during the surgery.

come now boys and girls there's no reason to flame ALM.<br><br>I can understand why you'd want to update to 1.9+ because of the features you'll receive for development wise etc but you see the thing is and to be quite honest with yo<b></b>u <b>a lot </b>of the community would like to keep 1.7 because of how well it plays just purely in pvp. This is evident by the voting that you did which stated whether or not to keep 1.7 or remove it. A lot of people voted to keep but you still removed it. Nonetheless, this server was thriving with the competitive scene and brought in more players because they see the version and immediately migrate. You know this but the same problem occured with OCN. As soon as they dropped 1.7 which was the version everybody loved, they just went into decline and then eventually they updated to 1.9 and yeah bye bye server. <br><br>However, I am 100% not against 1.9 <b>but</b> and I say "but" in bold to imply how important this is; if you update to 1.9 and the pvp mechanics is how it is in vanilla 1.9 in which there is that shitty cooldown, I am telling you right now this server will die. Unless you can manipulate the pvp mechanics like how Stratus does it then I am fine with that, but what's the point if you're willing to support 1.8 anyway.<br><br>Avicus for the last 2 years ish, has been just the same band of people and those band of people with their experience know what is right for the server. This whole server wouldn't exist without a community and you're simply diminishing the community, leaving them in the shadows and thus you see a decline in players. Remember Austin all the good teamspeak moments; that's the community right there. You eventually say you will update to 1.9 but keep this in mind the same people that willingly played the server for a long time will be gone. You want to cater to the "new" players who are running the latest version but if they come on the server they're most likely going to just leave in an hour or two rather than those who were playing prior and stayed. <br><br>TLDR:<br><br><br><ul><li>1.9 has some benefits such as enhanced development and new features</li><li>However, 1.7 is the major version which <b>most</b> of the players would prefer and would rather have 1.7 because it simply contains better pvp mechanics than any other version. Popular pvp servers like minehq, badlion, ultra support 1.7 for this reason bear this in mind</li><li>Even though 1.7 may be removed, we're back to where we originally started with 1.8 however if you intend to drop 1.8 whilst supporting 1.9 think again and look at what happened to OCN after March 2016 (which is when they dropped 1.8). So many players just left lol</li><li>Avicus is the same group of players just cater to them rather than the "new players" who just join for less than an hour and leave. And what I mean by this is listen to the players, they're experienced and know what's right. If you burden the community that community will just leave to something else because they're not being listened to. Same mistake OCN did. Don't repeat history</li></ul><p>hopefully that's most of the things summarised. ALM, if there's anything that's bothering you, you can speak to me and we can talk more about this if you would like. I'd appreciate a response. sorry for such a long post lmao and thanks if anyone actually read most of the shit. <br></p>
