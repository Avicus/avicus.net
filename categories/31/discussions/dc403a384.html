</h1>
<b>Event #6:</b>&nbsp;This is the&nbsp;sixth official event on the Avicus Network, known as "Aldebaran". It has been a while since we last had a contest due to small bumps on the road and I'm sorry for that. I will try my very best to keep this contests more consistent on&nbsp;Avicus from this point on. For this contest, you are given a&nbsp;certain amount&nbsp;of time to construct a map for Avicus's gamemode,&nbsp;The Walls.&nbsp;There are a few rules however, but it should be fun for everyone!<br><br><u><b>Who are the judges?</b></u><br>The individuals that will be judging this competition are ScriptingCookies and Slicorn. Judges for this contest will not change, so please do not ask to become one. You may however request to become a judge for future Avicus building competitions.<br><br><u><b>What are the rules?</b></u><br>You have to follow these rules or your map will be rejected.<br>- You may not have more than 3 authors.<br>- You must have a Walls map. Anything else will not be entered in.<br>- You may not create more than 5 Walls maps for Aldebaran. <br><br><u><b>What are the guidelines?</b></u><br>Maps are judged in the following aspects;<br>-&nbsp;<i>Gameplay</i>&nbsp;(How do you think the map will play on the servers?)<br>-&nbsp;<i>Aesthetics</i>&nbsp;(How pleasing to the eye does it look?)<br>-&nbsp;<i>Creativity&nbsp;</i>(Is it unique and really stands out?)<br><br>YAML will be done by a map developer if you wish, and it will not count against you. We're all here to help!<br><br><u><b>What gamemodes can I do?</b></u><br>You can do anything possible within YAML in The Walls<br><br><u><b>How do I submit my map?</b></u><br>Put a [CONTEST] tag in the title. By doing so, you are entered into the contest and put into a spreadsheet. It contains the map name, authors, thread link, jurisdiction of approval/denial, and it's gamemode. All&nbsp;Walls maps&nbsp;are eligible to be in this contest. You have the permission to post your thread link in the post below so we can see it easier.<br><br>1.&nbsp;Do <b>not</b> give in-constructive feedback&nbsp;by knocking others down to build yourself up.<br>2.&nbsp;Do <b>not</b> steal maps; all maps are your property.&nbsp;Violations of this are a permanant&nbsp;ban.<br>3.&nbsp;Do <b>not</b> ghost produce;&nbsp;don't have other users make a map for you and you take credit.<br>4.&nbsp;Do <b>not</b> spam judges;&nbsp;patience is a large key. Wait for a response on your map.<br>5.&nbsp;Do <b>not</b> ghost view;&nbsp;don't tally a ton of thread views in your thread for attention.<br>6.&nbsp;Do <b>not</b> make joke maps;&nbsp;all maps must be true submissions to the server.<br>7.&nbsp;Do <b>not</b> submit maps made prior to this;&nbsp;all maps must be "newly produced".<br>8.&nbsp;<b>Always</b> give credit.&nbsp;No matter what the case, credit everyone who authored.<br><br><u><b>How can I create YAML?</b></u><br>Use our documentation resource at docs.avicus.net.<br><br><u><b>What is the prize?</b></u><br>When winning a build competition, you will receive a gold rank. You may choose to transfer your rank to another user is you do not wish to have a <br><br><u><b>Is the spreadsheet public?</b></u><br>Yes!&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a9CYPRvSxJWrkJiugM7Hl3dlCmi6M5iwYG-xU5dhK0w/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a9CYPRvSxJWrkJiugM7Hl3dlCmi6M5iwYG-xU5dhK0w/edit?usp=sharing</a><br>&nbsp;<br><u><a rel="nofollow" href="http://avicus.net/forums/569e73432">PREVIOUS EVENT</a></u><br><br>Starts; <i>January 15th, 2015</i><br>Ends; <i>February 1st, 2015</i>

Perhaps we could have longer breaks between each event because pretty soon the people participating in these will be burnt out of map making.

First place will indeed be promoted to Gold rank, but this doesn't mean it will be the only map accepted. The accepting part works the same as if it were a regular map.

This is a great event for map makers. if anyone needs help please let me know, but I will not be entering into this contest as of now, it may change, but I dont think I will at this point. If you need help with Walls YML please let me know, or you don't know how to copy quads etc. I have submitted 3 maps in the last month so I think I am all mapped out, and since I have Diamond already it is a better served reward for others.

You can also try finding some cool themes on the internet! This is what helps most people start on a map.<br></span><span><span><u>What do walls maps usually contain?</u><br>A good amount of aesthetics and game-play.<br>This can be shown by having caves, secret areas in the map, some houses, trees and anything that you think would be appropriate. </span><span>Customizing the map without using a template would also work and be a cool idea! (Optional)<br></span></span><br>Remember, it's about having fun rather than going for the prize.Anyways, I highly suggest that you all participate in this contest, as it contributes a lot to Avicus and it's just a fun new experience.Good luck to everyone!

The map testing event was cut short due to the server going down. Because of this, contest maps weren't tested.&nbsp;We will finish off testing the rest of the maps in the near future.
