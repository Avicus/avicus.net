I have literally no idea why roles keep switching either, I'm pretty sure Midnight has been for and against and for and against it, speaking from my experience. It hurts the server's progression to condense roles into 2 positions, and it's less efficient to have an admin that can't deal with their department because they're inactive for 8 days at a time.<br><br>They should consider revising that, and letting it stick.
