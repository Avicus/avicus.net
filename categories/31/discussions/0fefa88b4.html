I think I would be wasting everyone's time for me to apply again.<br><br>I think i'm a mature enough person(You decide about that) it's just when I came to the interviews I could not get all my ideas across that I would have and didn't express myself the ways I would have in a normal chat situation.<br><br>This is simply because i'm shy. Drama is my worst subject in school and I hate doing anything in front of a large body of people and people of high authority.

No.<br>Why? Don't get me wrong I love the staff, but I don't want to become a staff member for a couple of reasons.<br>1. I'm too busy.<br>I'm 17, going into senior year, and it's the most crucial period of my life. I have massive amounts of homework, exam preparation, College prep, etc etc.<br>2. Sometimes you have to come to reports when you don't want too.<br>Yeah sure, having /kick and /warn is pretty cool. But when you're killfarming in Quintus and you're getting reports about a hacker in another game I've seen mods sigh with depress. I know this is inevitable and is part of being a staff member but I just don't want to have to deal with this.&nbsp;<br>3. You have a lot of responsibilities. <br>Personally I don't feel as if I can carry all of these.

I would really like to become a Jr. Mod and eventually a Moderator on Avicus, and I will try my best to write a solid application.<br>But, I do not want to apply if people on Avicus have something against me. Yes, I was recently banned and then unbanned, but I have changed now, and understand that Avicus isn't the place where you should break rules, or&nbsp;<b><u><i>any</i></u></b><u><i></i></u><i></i>&nbsp;server for that matter.<br><br><i>Just a little tip for those of you applying...</i><br>If anyone wants to become a moderator,&nbsp;<b>do not&nbsp;</b>do it for the sake of kicking and banning players. Do it for the good of the community. Make your role have an importance, and make sure that you're not applying for the wrong reasons. Also, do not try to become a moderator if it affects&nbsp;<b>anything&nbsp;</b>in your life outside Minecraft. If you see that your grades are falling because of this, then you should probably leave this position, because school always comes first.<br>Also, do not let it get between you and your social life.<br>If you are spending way too much time on Minecraft / Moderating on Avicus, make sure that you have enough time to spend with your family and friends.<br>Just make sure that you know how everything will work out in your real life before applying for this position.<br>-Porky.

I've been here since MC Zone, and I love being on the forums and being active in the community.<br>I just feel like I could do so much to help out the community, and I have enough time to be on here 1-2 hours a day at least.<br><br>It's also that everyday I see people break the rules, and when I /report it still takes a few minutes for a staff member to come, but they don't see what you see. They're not with you in that moment, they don't always see how abusive someone is being.<br><br>The only other option is screenshotting and forum reporting, but usually not enough evidence is able to be gotten, a few screenshots don't prove how bad they were being.<br><br>So, everytime applications open, I will try and try again to get interviewed.<br><br>-Zach

No. I don't really think having a job in a video game would be good because I got to be in the server a lot. I don't think looking at a screen for a long time is healthy for me.

If you guys actually have a problem with applying for staff, such as, looking at a screen for too long, or having too much homework or class work, then it's your choice to apply. But I sincerely urge all of you who aren't applying to apply just because you think your own grammar isn't "good" enough.&nbsp;<br>Always give it a try, it really isn't that much testing your grammar, the main purpose of the questions is to see how you respond to them and your creativity to them.&nbsp;<br>Of course grammar is still important, but give it a try!&nbsp;<br>It even practices your writing skills for school. :3

Your place on the leaderboards has no affect on your ability to get staff. It may seem that the top 100 players on the leaderboards go for mod because they are usually the most active.

Unpopular users have the same chances as a "popular" regular would have if they had ALL the requirements. There are requirements to apply, that's why players who don't go on the forums are usually denied.
