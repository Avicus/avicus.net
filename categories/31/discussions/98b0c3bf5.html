So I am planning on applying for mod except I have false infractions on my profile lowering my chances, xxgamingfoxxx kicked my false for using tab which he apologized for but never taken off my profile and also he did a false kick by thinking i was antiknockback hacking yet i wasn't&nbsp;<br>and FightToWin banned me for that which later he found out i wasn't. The warn on my profile was real because my sister ;/ She was typing but still i would like to get these taken off my profile, Thanks -Matt

Infractions don't play a direct role in becoming a staff member. You can have infractions and still become staff. Whether or not you become staff is decided on based on the person and their character (behavior), not quantity of infractions. Besides, the three you said were false have been appealed anyway, and are clearly marked as such.&nbsp;

<b>NolanDalton I have something to say to you. You banned my brothers account 1 min after he joined a game of Nebula for "Click Hacking". He was not quick hacking and you need to stop being abusive with your admin powers. </b>I would like you to unban him and see if he has ever had any other infractions before now. He has never hacked, and I consider it offensive to call someone a hacker when they are not one.<br>

You are off topic from the original discussion and should not be posting appeals on the website anyways. Please do as previous staff have told you and email an appeal to support@avicus.net if you have not. Otherwise, be patient and wait for a response, as a staff member is bound to reply eventually.
