Problems with the Staff Team

<p class="MsoNormal">Hi,</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Thought it was time for me to make a post like this
regarding the problems within the staff team and the server in general along
with my ideas of how to fix them. First off, I want to make a quick apology
towards the staff team, I have recently acted in a somewhat rude manner in my
attempt to “test” staff members on my own to gather some information on how
they act in situations. Tested the staff’s new rule set which at least 90% of
the community was unaware of, staff members were very inconsistent in this most
punished accordingly while others slacked. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span>I’ve recently experienced
both sides of the story and see how it’s being handled by each party (staff vs.
community). The staff team is still very unorganized in many ways, seniors lack
in their responsibility, if anything happens within the staff team lower staff
instantly blame admins. Inconsistency in punishments, Jr Mod applications and
trials (main reason I quit), failure to enforce rules on Avicus related services,
lack of mod training. The community on the other hand have been very impatient
with the staff team and rightfully so, we’ve given so many chance to allow the
staff team to change but we continue to head back down the same paths towards corruption.Flame wars and heated discussions on the forums should be allowed (somewhat) if they get out of hand staff member shouldn't be blaming specific members of the community. <br></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My list of main problems regarding the staff team and how
they can be fixed:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Bias </b>- I know this is a part of human nature but it can be
avoid by allowing all staff members to have a say. <b>Solution:</b> Allow staff members to vote on certain topics such as
player reports, locking topics and Jr Mod trials. Admins and senior mods should
all get a say in appeals, Jr Mod trials and applications. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><u>Inconsistency-</u></b> Big factor in my reason to leave, staff team
don’t always follow guidelines and make poor choices. <br></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b>Solution:</b> Make a set list
of guides to follow and stick to them, don’t break them for any circumstance. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><u>Rules</u></b> – Avicus rule set is probably the most confusing one
in Minecraft, it’s constantly changing and posts being made to update it. <b><br></b></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b>Solution:</b> Make one centered rule set at <a title="Link: https://avicus.net/rules" href="https://avicus.net/rules">https://avicus.net/rules</a> don’t be making
dozens of posts with new rules. Keep it nice and simple easy to link to new
players, if a major rule is changed like the “swearing is no longer<span>&nbsp; </span>tolerated” then please make a post regarding
the changes to it after the official rules set is updated. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><u>Mentor/Training – </u></b>This was one of the great things that
Michael and Peachy actually made, it worked great, allowing Mods to train Jr
Mods and give them feedback about their trial. <b><br></b></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b>Solution:</b> Simple bring it back instruct the present mods to train
Jr’s and to help them out as much as possible with their trials. Allow them to
vote on the trial of the Jr’s giving more opinions on who should be promoted,
making the staff team better. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">That’s all I can think of at the moment ;-; I’ll add more if
I think of it. Hopefully this counts as being constructive criticism and not
being the salt king. Sorry for any spelling mistakes typed this up in a hurry. <span></span></p>

Some staff need to loosen their banning and kicking privileges. I have been kicked and warned many times because apparently "holy crap" is a major infraction. Also, I am not further available to appeal my ban. Sorry staff, I am just saying what I've seen from my point of view.<br>

Your wrong buddy. There was a new "ban guide" made and you know of it giving out what infractions to give under what circumstance the offence given. It gives you the exact punishment, not an estimate like the old one thus it was changed.It was implemented when you were a mod and if you still don't know about it it proves 99's point even more that even the best staff members have their fair share of problems that they don't want to approve of.<br>The Guidelines:&nbsp;<a href="https://avicus.net/forums/09e2758fd" title="Link: https://avicus.net/forums/09e2758fd">https://avicus.net/forums/09e2758fd</a>

Fair call.<br>tbh, I didn't really follow the guidelines much because I knew what to do.<br>Not to sound arrogant but I didn't have a lot of problems when issuing out punishments in game.<br><br>Having said that, I was one of the few (if not the <i>only </i>staff member) who didn't really look at the guidelines, so my inability to keep up with the guidelines doesn't reflect the staff team as a whole, it was just a me thing.

Personally I think the staff team gets stuff done which is great. The biggest issue i see is how much ppl change when they become mod. Yes turn the raging at idiots on pubs down, but if they were accepted when they enjoyed ducking around with friends on ts, they should be good enough to stay mod

I honestly think that this is the 25th post about something like this. It is literally the only topic on the forums right now. I know this has been said many times before but something needs to be done before Avicus spirals down into an even bigger hole. If the only topic that is ever talked is about the problems that Avicus faces, why would anyone want to stay and play. Please no hate, just voicing my opinion.

It's hard to see change if they are internal... For example, mod training. It's somewhat difficult to notice an immediate change. The mentoring system too, it's not an external change but rather a system for promotions and discussions held within the staff channels.

Not really, you would be able to see the change from a community perspective. The way rules are enforced should be slightly similar among all staff members if they follow the guidelines that were being implemented.

Avicus caps around 40 players. Usually staying in 20's. 15 is just fine, it is how competant a lot of them are that is the issue.

SG was poorly made and a bad idea in the first place. Since Jozz got mutinied against he hasn't done much. I hated Jozz early on but was willing to admit he got stuff done. Atm, at least imo, Jozz seems content and willing to let things go and follow the leads of others.

SG was poorly made and a bad idea in the first place. Since Jozz got mutinied against he hasn't done much. I hated Jozz early on but was willing to admit he got stuff done. Atm, at least imo, Jozz seems content and willing to let things go and follow the leads of others.

Yeah, I agree it wasn't made very well, but the community did ask for it. :P<br>Jozz has done quite a lot of internal stuff like giving the staff weekly newsletters and the community monthly summaries. Hopefully some external stuff can be done too.

Everyone makes mistakes sometimes, and in all honesty, any mistake we have instantly gets broken down, harshed on, and bloated by the community. It makes it really hard to improve when we spend all of our time dealing with high levels of toxicity on our services. We are improving, and as Jozz said, a lot of it is internal, so it's hard for you guys to tell how hard we're working on it.

I respect your opinion as I'm sure lots of others do, but tell the staff on Skype, not on forums.

Well, 99, at least this thread isn't very demanding, which I commend.<br><br>Though it's been a really long time since I've been active on the server, some changes aren't going to be immediate, or immediately apparent to the rest of the community. Like Jozz said much earlier in the thread, some could be made as we speak (well, type), but we may just not know it. Yet.<br><br>Just know this: I bet they are trying to make improvements, and at the very least, the staff aren't ill-willed (well, I hope to God they're not). They mean well, and I'm pretty sure you know that.

Yes, but if they are publicly announced they should be followed. Why would staff tell you their guidelines if they weren't going to be followed?

Avicus caps around 40 players. Usually staying in 20's. 15 is just fine, it is how competant a lot of them are that is the issue.
