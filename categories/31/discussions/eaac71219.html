The fact that you are banning people based on them spoiling something like this i find to be ridiculous. Absolutely insane. I guarantee you if i were to spoil a random game you wouldn't ban for it. Let's take the new Metal Gear Solid game to be exact. You are selectively banning as well, not only is that unprofessional but is just wrong. Also to begin with why do you have to ban? I get people are upset about spoilers to the new Star Wars movie. But can you not just mute them and call it a day? What the hell are you accomplishing by banning them? Asserting your dominance over them in a minecraft pvp setting is a very productive use of your time i suppose. There is no point to banning these people, you guys look ridiculous if you do so. So please, try not to be complete idiots. Also if any staff gets demoted for posting spoilers that is absolutely idiotic. The fact that this is an issue is the reason why many don't play avicus. The staff team and the way you handle things is idiotic and inefficient at best.<br><br>TL;DR: Don't ban people for stupid shit, and if you do at least be fair and ban all spoilers.

I agree somewhat, but by the way, /mute doesn't exist here.

So a pretty decent network doesn't even a /mute command. That's also very silly. But still banning someone for something so little is ludicrous.
