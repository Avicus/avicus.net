Lately it seems that once I got back on amicus after a while there are either glitches or hacks. &nbsp;I want to know if I'm imagining it more does it seem that some people have more reach then others making it impossible to fight. I'd also like to know if critical can cause about half health damage. Otherwise I think people are just hacking.<br><br>If your with me on the hacking thing say so<br><br>Thank you

Not really, people usually have<br>A) Ping advantages, or better internet connection (TO THE SERVER), not per monthly cost type internet.<br>this mean they are usually closer to the server<br><br>B) Moar PVP skills, &nbsp;or they are using a different kit that you think, for example I get called a hacker when I use scout in Nexus, as I can juke around them super fast<br><br>C) Know how to jump crit and have fast mouses.<br>If you have a fast mouse and you jump you can usually get 2 or 3, even 5 crits on a person, and boom, they're dead.<br><br>D) 2 of these.

With some players that are good at PvP, it can look like they're reach hacking, but they are just clicking faster than you or getting their timing on their hits better. Reach hacks don't work on the server as far as I know. However, there are some hacks like Click aimbot or Kill aura that could look like reach hacks. Also I don't think damage hacks work on this server either. (Correct me if I'm wrong).

{Correct me if I'm wrong}<br>What do you mean by damage hacks?<br>If you mean health hacks I have seen that happen on the server, though the person {I won't say username} was swiftly banned {because of me and a couple of people in Secret Fly, but that's another story}.<br><br>If you mean insta-kill hacks, I don't believe that those are even out there. If they are, than I wouldn't know, but they are apparently easy to beat, as all of my time on the 100s of MC servers I've been on {most being PVP servers like dis one} I have never seen one.

I was referring to him talking about the damage he takes from criticals. I thought he might be talking about a hack that causes more damage to a player than normal. I think auto-crit might be a thing but I don't think&nbsp;it works on Avicus. (That's what I was asking if I was right about, sorry if I was unclear)

The only major hack I have seen is Fly, and it's insanely obvious when you do see it.
