Well I have just been on a number of games and lots of people have been complaining that (The Name The Hacker) has been hacking I spectated and I saw he clearly he/she had anti knock back etc .He left before I could capture video evidence. Then I told the people who said he was hacking to use /report . They did it and he just left he didn't get kicked or what ever the correct punishment is like temp-ban . So I was wondering what could be done if this happens again and there isnt a member of staff online. Thanks ElementProHD.

If you were spectating him/her, you should have reported them before being concerned about capturing video evidence.<br>Public hackusations aren't allowed and are punishable, so most of what happened shouldn't have been happening in the first place.

Did you note down the name? Sometimes, staff members aren't online 24/7. I suggest that you note down the name, so if he comes back on the server, you are sure to keep an eye for that person.&nbsp;<br><br>Also, can you privately message me regarding that issue?
