Alright, so I got this idea because of old Mario Kart Wii clanning memories, but anyways let me introduce the idea.<br><br>Its called Map Wars, because it is basically Team vs Team vs Team vs Team etc. What happens is we set a certain amount of time usually 2-4 weeks and every single team is assigned a map. <br><br>Now what your team is responsible for is YOUR map. That map you are assigned is your "home base". So other teams job is basically to get rid of everyone elses home base. The way that you do that is by attacking a fortification map.&nbsp;<br><br>Now here is where you might get really confused. In order to attack the Home Base map you have to win a round on a fortification map and then you can transgress to the home base map. If you lose your home base map your out and you can only get one chance for revival. Now you are allowed to choose your home base map, however there will be around 5 set fortification maps that when defending, you will get to choose.<br><br>Whoever has the most maps at the end of that time wins. Now for an example,<br><br>Let's make the team names, Red and Blue.&nbsp;<br><br>So red's homebase is the map Quintus and blue's home base is the Ternio. Blue challenges Red and thus blue is attacking and red is defending. Now Red chooses a map from the fortifications map list and they play that map. Let's say the map is Rendezvous 1. Blue wins the map, and then the game goes to Quintus. Blue manages to win Quintus as well, now the red team is out. However there is a way to get revived but I still have to determine how to do that. So now Blue owns Quintus and Ternio, and they don't own any fortification maps.&nbsp;<br><br>I know this sounds confusing and I would probably have to make a big forums post about it but I just wanted to give the idea of another type of tournament that can either be run by Avicus or I could run it.&nbsp;<br><br>Feedback is very welcome here and I want to know your thoughts about it.
