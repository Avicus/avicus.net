You probably see these threads a lot, or maybe not, i haven't been here lately :v<br>How do i even PVP?; I haven't played seriously for a year. I feel like half the time my hits don't even land.<br><br>I have gotten tired of playing MW2, and want to come back to my avicus, but i really cant if i get my ass kicked 96% of the time.

All u have to do is have a ping under 50, click at the guy and sprint forwards at the same time. If u followed those steps then u will be able to pvp in no time. If u have 200 ping or higher than it's a lot harder

someone who knows how to strafe, w tap and/or s tap will rape you every single time if you do that, especially if you don't know how to straightline well

it's about timing it, which most people (including myself) don't do extremely well. you don't want to spam it at all<br><br>there are controversial opinions about when exactly to tap w, but as far as i've learned you should do it just as you're about to hit your opponent. people like brick would know better than me about this though

When w tapping you need to wait until they have taken kb... watch a video on it (probably Latenci's). It is all about timing it correctly and being patient
