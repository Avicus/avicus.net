Alright. So the other day I retired from Admin. Not everyone knows my reasons for leaving, and since I imagine most people have made their own guesses by now, let's clear up the confusion.<br><br>I guess the biggest one that I've heard is that I retired because of something going on with the Admins, or something that I didn't agree with in the Admin team. To debunk this in the simplest way possible, I'm the sort of person that when faced with a problem in my work space, I work to fix it. Retiring for that reason would have been, in my opinion a waste of an opportunity.&nbsp;<br><br>Second most common guess I've heard is kind of related to the first. I did not retire because of any one individual in an Administrative position. While there were definitely things I didn't like, it wouldn't cause me to retire - it goes back to the whole thing about how I like to fix the issues, plus it's not like you can't put your foot down and argue with reason and logic against something that has none.<br><br>So now that those two have been debunked, here's the real reason I retired. I've been on the Senior team since November. It started getting to a point a few weeks ago, where I started not enjoying spending countless hours resolving issues, maintaining internal services, and working on new projects. I kept the idea of retiring at the end of the summer in the back of my mind. Then the offer of Admin fell on the table, and I still wasn't sure what I wanted to do, so I figured I'd just take the position and see what comes from that. Now we're at that last few weeks of summer and I still feel like I wasn't enjoying my job as much as I did a few months ago. My first year of University starts in a few weeks, and with that comes a bunch of work and opportunities. I'd much rather be spending my time towards that sort of stuff, instead of Avicus.<br><br>These sort of retiring posts typically have like a thank you to all the people who made a difference in my time here. Quite honestly, there's too many to count. If you left any positive effect on me, you know who you are. I will give a special shout-out to Greg for getting me to join the staff team, to Posighdun for making me want to come back and for working with me as my Admin bud for several months, and to Josh for spending countless hours helping me out with the projects I worked on - it really goes a long way.<br><br>To the Avicus staff team, I wish you the best of luck, I love you guys. To the community, I hope you can bear with them as they try their best to make this the best server to be a part of &lt;3<br><br>I'll incorporate an AMA into this as well, if you'd like to ask any questions. I'll try my best with those opinion questions, but there's a good chance that if we never spoke, I won't have much to say about you.

As a mentor you can get exposed to that sort of stuff, which I think is great. There's going to be work to do with the mentor system, all those new changes I've made need to be talked about and tweaked now that they've had some actual use. I've said this to someone else, and it still bears repeating. Don't force yourself to work towards a promotion to Sr - work towards making the server the best place possible. If you get offered Sr along the way, that's great, but it shouldn't be the ultimate end game goal.<br><br><br></span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><br></span>

<b></b><b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Opinions as a person? as a mod?&nbsp;<br></b>You weren't someone I got to know all that well on the staff team. Sorry about that. From an outside perspective, you're a good guy, I don't think there's ever been any issues with your maturity. You're great at being a moderator, and I think you'd make a pretty good mentor. Congrats again on Map Dev, that's great!<br><b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><br>What can I improve on?<br></b>Now more than ever (rip Josh), I think the mod team needs a fellow moderator role model. I'm not saying you have to be that guy, but work towards being the best you can and be open to helping others who don't.&nbsp;<br><b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><br></b><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>Fav pizza toppings?</b><br></span>Uh, I like vegetables tbh. The vegetarian pizzas are great :)<b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><br><br>Best part of being admin? Part of the staff team?<br></b>I wasn't an admin for very long, and I didn't get to do anything really that I couldn't have already done as a Sr mod. So I'll split this answer into two parts. The best thing about being an Admin was how much more involved in the server I was. Being an Admin forces you into that position where you just have to be able to know what's going on around the server and deal with issues anyone might have. While this can be a pain sometimes, it was awesome since it really allows me to do more on the server, and not just focus on the mod team - though the mod team was always my biggest interest.<br><br>So the second part of this then, my favourite&nbsp;part of being a Sr was being able to do all the internal work needed to manage the server. There's seriously&nbsp;<i>always&nbsp;</i>things that can be worked on, and a lot that go unnoticed until they become issues. Like sure moderating is fun for the first few months, but then you start to feel forced to join the game and actually moderate&nbsp;- especially if you got bored of the game years before like I did. It was fun to be able to keep busy and do all those little things<br><br>My favourite part of being on the staff team in general was how involved in the community you get. I love being able to get to know people, and just all around be a part of it (as I'm sure some people have noticed if they've known me long enough ;p).&nbsp;<br><br>I'll be sure to pop around and see how the community is doing every now and then. And don't worry - I'm not going anywhere just yet!<b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><br><br><br></b><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b><br></b></span>

Originally I wanted to see how you'd do as a Mentor to see if you'd make a good fit for Sr, but I guess you never really ended up mentoring lol. And honestly, you make a <i>great </i>fit as a Sr. I enjoyed getting to know you and to start working with you in the Sr team (and in the staff department). I've never once had an issue with your behaviour, and overall you're a good guy.<br><b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><br></b><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>What's your major, and what college are you going to?<br></b></span>I'm studying Human Resources at the Telfer school of Management - which is just the business school at the University of Ottawa.<b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><br></b><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b><br></b></span>

You're welcome, and thanks as well.<br><br><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>I know I've asked before, but what are your opinions of me as a person, and as a staff member?</b></span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">I can't remember exactly what I said last time, but my opinion of you hasn't changed much since. You're a good friend, and you're dedicated to what you do. You're one of the most un-bias people I know, and you always seem to see things from a side that I never do. Sometimes as a result I find you appear to come off as a little "harsh". You've done wonders with the map dev team, and you make a pretty good Sr.&nbsp;<br><br><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>Do you think I've improved, as a staff member?<br></b></span>Definitely. As a staff member in general, you're so much more experienced and you've gained valuable knowledge that allows you to do your job as a staff member than much better. I also remember there being some issues with a certain situation a few months ago, but honestly there isn't that issue anymore.<br><br><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>Are you going to be sticking around, or are you leaving the community as well?</b></span><b>&nbsp;<br></b>Much like with the OCN / PGM / Stratus community, I'll still be around. I might not be up to date on whatever is going on anymore, but I've met so many people in all the communities I'm a part of that I don't think I'll be bored when I do stop by and catch up ;)<b><br></b>

Thanks :D<br><br><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>As for the ama, I'll go with the classic opinion<br></b></span>You're someone who I feel like I've known since forever (which isn't really the case, but I can't remember when it was that I first met you). The barriers between Avicus and PGM aren't really as high as they used to be before OCN closed, but you remind me of myself (and I guess all the other people) who worked between both servers as a staff member. Maybe you only entered the OCN staff team (you were a ref right?) around the time OCN closed, but you would have made a great mod over there. You've developed a pretty good moderator-sense in the last few weeks you've been in the staff team &amp; I can see you going far if you stick to it. You're always so friendly and you have that sort of community feel to you (if you know what I mean).

Thanks Snow :)<br><b><br></b><b>Opinions?</b><br>As I expressed back when you retired a few months ago, you were a great staff member who, if given the opportunity, would have made a significant positive difference in the Sr staff team and in the server. Much like Badger, you've been around for so long. And you're constantly wanting to see Avicus succeed - I can still see it even now when you're retired. I wish you the best of luck with whatever you decide to pursue, you're going to do great, no doubts about it.

<b>Opinions?</b><br>I guess you're forum banned now so there's a lower chance you'll see this, but you never know. I'll be honest, you disappointed me. It sucked you were demoted, but your demotion as harsh as it may be, was your fault. Blaming the server for ditching you isn't going to get you anywhere. What really disappointed me was when you actually were network banned for leaking staff info, plus you attempted to give yourself and shadow an all perms rank on TS. It wasn't so much that you did these things, but it was your behaviour while doing it, and still your behaviour as you continue to leak staff info with that website. I think you and I both know you aren't doing anyone good, and honestly you're digging a bigger hole for yourself in an attempt to bring down ALM or the server because you feel you weren't treated right and they didn't allow you to retire. They definitely aren't treating you the way they would treat a former admin, or hell even a demoted staff member anymore, but again that's on you and your actions.

Ok finally got to your question.

I really hope for Avicus' sake, they let you back on the team right away, or they're missing out. Bold and I were actually just talking about this, and you were basically the figurehead / unofficial leader of that team. You were the driving force behind it, and truly a great example of what a good mentor looks like. You would have made a great Senior, and I hope you get that chance soon.<br><br>You're easily one of my favourite people in the staff team, even Avicus as a whole. You're so easy to get along with, you're kind, and friendly. If I remember right, you were the first person to welcome me into TS, and I would try and join the same room as you for weeks following. You're also great at dancing.<br><br><b>Any advice?</b><br>Keep doing you. You have the right mindset, and I know you're going to do great in whatever you take on. Even outside of Minecraft.<br><br>When you do get Sr, hmu and maybe I'll come back &lt;3
