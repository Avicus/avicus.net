Just making sure all of you know, I find no use for it anymore. So, I decided to share my old account Jake41901 and entrust it to PeachyYas, considering he's one of my closest friends on Avicus. So, I'm just informing all of you. If you ever see that account in game, it may or may not be me. Either way, feel free to ask!<br><br>Regards, -Jake

He probably won't, it's just an alt now taking up space. I'm just letting everyone know that I probably won't ever use it again, but if you ever see it in game again; It's most likely Peachy.
