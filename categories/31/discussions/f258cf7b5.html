edit: Nobody told me to make this or advised me to make this<br><br>Hello<br><br>[redacted]<br><br>The first victim we will be talking about is xtramajestical who banned this here specimen:&nbsp;<br><br><img src="https://i.gyazo.com/f00cb5e38a9cb8e6ad6daee99c8799ee.png" title="Image: https://i.gyazo.com/f00cb5e38a9cb8e6ad6daee99c8799ee.png"><br><br>for kill aura as you can see. Now, dont be mistaken as to why i'm making this post, because many moderators will experience false banning somebody during their time as staff. This is relatively common since we are humans and we make mistakes. HOWEVER (dun dun dun), according to the victim of the ban, xtratestical attempted to justify himself in the appeal saying that the victim of the ban will STAY banned, not because they were cheating (because they weren't) but because they were PRETENDING to cheat. Now this gets under my skin a little bit because WHY THE FUCK would you ban someone because of a mistake that YOU made. If this is seriously a rule it joins the list of most moronic and fucking witless decisions that an avicus staff member has made, which is probably about a mile long by now.&nbsp;<br><br>The only reason this is a rule is so that the moderator team doesnt look like they have no idea what theyre doing. Doing this makes you look more idiotic than actually owning up to your mistake an just unbanning the player - which would also take a lot less effort than having to then deal with an appeal for days/weeks/months. This happened to me personally the other day; i was banned for kill aura and was unbanned afterwards because the moderator realised that they had made a mistake because this is what normal people do.&nbsp;<br><br>Now please put your egotistical arses aside and think about this.<br><br><br>if i have said anything untrue or inaccurate, PLEASE correct me as i dont want to look as stupid as the moderator team does right now.<br><br>:D

When you make it look like you are hacking, especially if that person is a regular, you waste the staff member's time. The length of the ban is a bit long though, so it'll probably be lowered. Don't quote me on it though.

@vlad<br>@PokerFace<br><br>You guys don't think staff members should be able to tell the difference between someone pretending to cheat and someone who is actually cheating? There's no fucking way someone pretending to hack can make their crosshair move directly onto the center of someone's hitbox on command. That's just not realistic. It's honestly not that hard to compare someone just spinning their mouse around while playing versus someone actually using aimbot or kill aura, because there's a gigantic difference in precision and accuracy.

Why can't a mod tell the difference between someone actually cheating and someone pretending to cheat? As I said, imitating kill aura/aimbot to the point where it looks identical is very very very hard to do and basically impossible. You can't consistently lock onto the center of someone's hitbox to the same degree of precision/accuracy that aimbot/killaura do, you just can't. Just because someone is headtwitching around doesn't mean that they're cheating. You have to actually look at where their head is going and how precisely they are locking onto people.<br><br>edit: The head twitching is part of locking onto teammates, except that someone pretending to cheat is not actually locking onto them. Instead, they're literally spinning their mouse around while fighting to portray a similar appearance to someone actually using kill aura/aimbot. If you actually look at where their head/crosshair faces, it likely isn't directly at the player.

Why can't a mod tell the difference between someone actually cheating and someone pretending to cheat? As I said, imitating kill aura/aimbot to the point where it looks identical is very very very hard to do and basically impossible. You can't consistently lock onto the center of someone's hitbox to the same degree of precision/accuracy that aimbot/killaura do, you just can't. Just because someone is headtwitching around doesn't mean that they're cheating. You have to actually look at where their head is going and how precisely they are locking onto people.<br><br>edit: The head twitching is part of locking onto teammates, except that someone pretending to cheat is not actually locking onto them. Instead, they're literally spinning their mouse around while fighting to portray a similar appearance to someone actually using kill aura/aimbot. If you actually look at where their head/crosshair faces, it likely isn't directly at the player.

After Xtra banned him, we told him about it, but rules are rules, you aren't supposed to pretend that you are hacking. We had a discussion between most of the staff and I mentioned what you said hours before you posted this. And keep in mind that you cannot exactly see the exact angle from a third person perspective. That's why the video Seuthy provided was very helpful.<br><br>It was an honest mistake and nobody is perfect.

Telling you that you are fucking up is not disrespect. In fact, trying to silence your playerbase instead of fixing the problem they are bringing to the table is you having a lack of respect for your playerbase and shows you could not give less of a fuck. If I ran a shop and a customer complained about a product, do I tell the customer to stop disrespecting me and tell them to fuck off or do I take their criticism and attempt to fix mistakes? Avicus doesn't take any criticism from its players, thats probably why one month old servers can get more players than you lol. You can't do stupid things and expect everyone to pretend they're not stupid. ..<br><br>In terms of Avicus, this is one of the smallest problems lol. I'm not even angry at this point, this is pretty tame compared to other topics. &nbsp;I'm not sure how I'm asking you to slack off, I'm asking the complete opposite lol. I want you to learn some basic stuff. Tournament ghost clients, ok bit tricky, we'll let that slide, but basic fucking kill aura? How do you get that wrong?

Aren't you just proving my point? I'm sure if you looked into any of the evidence they used to ban him you could see that he wasn't actually hacking; you have to look at where his crosshair is actually pointing instead of banning him because he's head twitching in general

Also to add on, if you're using head twitching as a legitimate tactic that should be fine, I'm refering to those people who go out of their way and try to get banned on purpose.

I dont &nbsp;get the whole rule of &nbsp;pretending to be hacking. &nbsp;First whose to judge if youre pretending or not cause you cant prove that. Second how is pretending to be hacking a problem for staff. If the player gets reported how is it the players problem? &nbsp;If you know they arent hacking . Then just dont ban them. &nbsp;Ignoring those reports isnt any different to ignoring a report of a player not "pretending to be hacking".

You make a quick decision when more than 9 reports come in within 7 mins, you try your best to deal with situation as fast as you can in order to punish the individual, to keep everyone happy... When you take the report and see the player is head snapping and locking onto other players occasionally, along with a large amount of reports, from known well experienced Avicus players and x mods, and that the player is doing very well, assuming they seemed to not have been online before, you make a decision which may be wrong now, but at the time seemed to be the correct decision to go by. I hope you understand my POV, and at no point did I say that he would never be appealed.<br>And at what point have I not liked seuthy? We do not ban people we dislike, or I would of banned far more people than just Seuthy.

Seuthy's ban and what to do after was discussed on and off for over 30 hours. I personally 100% disagree with his ban for hacking, (Which everyone, including Xtra has also agreed on.) and his temban for "Pretending to hack". I'm not going to explain every little detail as to why, but we've asked around and gotten multiple stories about what happened. The evidence is almost solely based off of one of them and I don't think it's sufficient enough to hold up in an appeal. Although it was decided would happen as a group, (And I won't say who agreed or disagreed beside myself.) I got the impression from the conversation that the punishment had nothing to do with the actual rule, and more so the fact that the people who reported, and Seuthy, were in TS together when it all happened. Based on that there was a lot that happened that we don't even know is true.&nbsp;<br><br>Seuthy if you read this, I'd encourage you to appeal. You were banned for nearly 2 days for "Hacking" even though every one that was involved agreed that you were not hacking. It hurts to see that happen.

The rule itself is retarded and should be deleted due to how subjective it is. There's no one who can tell the line between pretending to be hacking and not doing so, therefore, the rule should not be enforced since some mods may have thought he was actually pretending to look like a KA while some others may have thought the opposite. As simple as that.
