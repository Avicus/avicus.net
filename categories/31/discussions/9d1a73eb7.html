You need to upload it on Imgur or any other website like that, your link is only viewable if we would be on <i>your computer</i> as it goes to <i>your desktop</i>.

It was quite a discussion yesterday when I was attacked with&nbsp;harrasments, I was called nigger&nbsp;many times and I was&nbsp;told to suck a cock. I'm greatful to glitchy as he kicked this/these players, I do feel though a warning isn't enough, I would like Avicus to be more strict with this kind of behavior. I still see myself as a new player as I've only been here for a month, I got attacked the first time a day after I joined and I don't think Avicus want a reputation like that.

Staff aren't always online and able to check reports, and I apologise about this incident. Just a suggestion, if you are afraid of your parents or what not walking in on your with offensive language in your screen, you can turn down the opacity (Basically the see through level) of chat in settings. Also, a door lock helps ;)

I suggest you post any rule breakers in the Player Reports section, just not to publicly shame anyone.

There is a plug in that filters what you say in chat and for example words like these on your screen shot would turn into ****, if the player would carry on he would get a warning and then a kick.

Yea, your going to have to. You can't publicly shame people on the forums, you need to blur the names and online player report or there is no reason for them to be on the forums

I'm gonna lay this on you as kindly as possible:<br><br>Listen to Mountie.<br>Listen to Bader.&nbsp;<br>And in my opinion disallowing the use of language is undoubtably censorship, which I believe is plainly stupid and ludacrous.<br><br>Honestly if you don't want bad language, turn chat off and play the game.<br><br>My work here is done.
