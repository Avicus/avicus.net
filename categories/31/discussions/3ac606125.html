</h1>
I've decided to leave Avicus because I'm tired of all the lag, and I just don't have very much time anymore, plus not very fun anymore with the decreasing amount of players. I'm also leaving because several people are really rude and mean to me ingame, especially [Removed], and i've had enough. If you don't like me, great, because i'm not going to be playing anymore. I guess you can msg me on Skype if you want something, but I'm not going to be on it as much as I used to. So yeah, bye.

I feel like this should be locked since its your third leaving post... it is clearly just attention seeking which goes agaisn't the rules of the forums. One leaving post should be all that is needed.

Well, no offence but you DO sound like a bit of an a-hole because this guys is probably the best rusher in the servers history, he has provided us with entertainment in game and on YouTube and has some of the highest stats.<br>This is a HUGE loss, and on top of it all, leaving posts are fine IMO because if people everyone knew just left out of nowhere there would be confusion, and its a nice way to explain why you left and just overall say goodbye...

True, I'd like to know why someone left, instead of all the confusion/questions asked as to why someone disappeared.<br><br>IMO, permanent leaving posts are fine, but threads similar to "Going on a 1 week vacation! Hype!1!!" should be locked.
