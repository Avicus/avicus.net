Hey guys!<br><br>Iron here, back at it again with them community events!<br><br>Anyways, this weekend why not spice it up with a fun little event. As most of you know, "MegaScrims" are small events that the community hosts so that we can all have fun in a somewhat competitive environment. Anyways, MegaScrims involve playing maps such as RendezvousCTW, and other tournament game modes such as DTM, and TDM. However, for this particular events we will play a BO3 match.&nbsp;<br><br>The maps will be:<br>&nbsp;<br>-Senex 1 (Scrim Edition)<br>-RendezvousCTW<br>-WahizCTW<br><br>I plan on coordinating the event; however, if I am not present for all of it/or none of it. I will designate someone else to try and help out with the choosing of teams and the managing of the games. Since the event is somewhat geared towards European players, I can try and host another event such as this for Americans. (Assuming this gains traction)<br><br>The Prize will be:<br>-A private channel for the team winners, they will have the channel for around a day. However, these channels can be joined by any players who get the password from the player who "owns" it. In the event that a moderator/ref/any rank joins without permission please report them to me and I will have them grilled!&nbsp;<br><br>Cheers!<br>Iron.

Guys, I would just like to clarify. These events are for fun, not for the prize! Don't sweat the prize, focus on the fun you will have. :)
