Ok so recently me and my friend decided to look up this server since we played it like a year ago and we loved it. Well we stopped playing about 8 months ago because my friend c25689 was banned for hacking, now 8 months later we forget hes banned and try to join. Anyways im just asking if theres anyway he can have another chance. I promise he doesnt hack anymore and he is sorry for hacking on the server, Please if any admin is on his name is c25689 and he was banned for hacking a year ago. Thank you for reading and i hope you guys show some mercy.
