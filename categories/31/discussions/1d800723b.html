Now, say you're making a awesome sweg defense around the monument in Nebula with a base, and glass surrounding the monument. But then someone on your team, Player 2, comes along and breaks the glass to place wood around it.&nbsp;<br><br>Now yes, you can report him, and if he gets kicked, then good riddance to him.<br><br>But say he wants to make a defense of his own on top of yours that you already made, only for Player 2 to report you since you were breaking his defense that he was attempting to make.&nbsp;And you get kicked for "Team Grief of Defenses."<br><br>Honestly, this is a grey area in the rules. You already made a defense, then someone comes along and tries to modify it to their liking. Then when a staff member comes to respond to the report, he doesn't know who to punish, or punishing you mistakenly, the one who made a defense already...<br><br>Sorry if this is getting long, and you might not understand, please bear with me. Now opinions and help? Thanks!

This has happened to me before, except instead the guy proceeded to cuss at me and accuse <i>me</i> of team griefing in chat and told me to "Drink bleach" and broke the entire defense, then I'm assuming he got kicked :P

Maybe implement a rule saying no accusing of griefing in chat? xP

This is why I don't like making hardcore sweg defenses in Nebula... but I do understand. I hate it when this happens...

You should never cover the monument, instead you remove all blocks around it. Place fences around it&nbsp;if&nbsp;it's a game where nobody gets&nbsp;an axe&nbsp;and wooden slabs below it with a gap so you can't reach the monument when standing under it. When you are doing this, you get a full view of the monument and surroundings and you won't have the issue where one tries to "protect" the monument by placing blocks around it and someone else tries the same but first removes the first persons blocks.

Yes you are right, I would, however want&nbsp;Avicus to be much more strict when it comes to rule violations. As far as my personal opinion, I count it as a team griefing when a teammate&nbsp;is griefing in any way that makes it difficult for your team to win. It also applies when you are crafting armour and a teammate&nbsp;destroys the&nbsp;crafting bench.

In the case where you spawn with a axe, you cover your monument with glass panes. As I said before, you have the full view of the monument and there's no tool to break glass faster.

Though griefers are relentless, placing blocks faster than you can break them. All we can do is /report, wait for a Staff Member and clean up the mess :/

It also slows down yourself and your teammates, that's why water is a big no no.

Maybe surround the water with glass panes?<br><br>Then there comes the griefer who breaks the glass...

It would actually be smart if you could contain the water inside, I'm thinking of something like this.<br><br>Glass Pane - Water - Glass Pane -&nbsp;Monument - Glass Pane- Water - Glass Pane.<br><br>When you are doing this, your monument has triple protection, the only issue is that you don't have a clear view of it. Another issue with the water is, all those who bridge above will jump and water prevents you from taking fall damage.

If you surround your monument with water, where do you stand and defend? You need to stand somewhere where you're not pushed in all four directions by the water.

Making a big base around the monument with a roof and walls, then placing the water and glass panes indoors?

Now I need to have to ask Staff Members to elaborate on the ruling, and how they would catch who the original builder of the defense is and who the actual griefer is? Please? Thanks :)

Imagine the monument like this. X is the monument, | is glass panes. If you do this on all four sides plus above and below it's triple protected.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|<br>| Water | [ X ] | Water |<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Water<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|

I can see what you're saying, and you have a good point. At times it can be quite hard to distinguish whether a player is intending to 'improve' the defense or simply cause grief. Unfortunately there's not a whole lot that can be done when issues like these occur.<br><br>I still recommend you report the player if you believe they are breaking a rule (in terms of intentionally negatively impacting your team), and leave it to the staff to determine whether the player is breaking that rule or not.<br><br><b></b>Thank you for bringing it up though, I realize it can be very frustrating at times.
