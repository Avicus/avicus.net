</h1>
Today I'd like to present to you a staff spotlight from a valued member of the senior staff team and senior moderator to the Avicus Network&nbsp;<b><i>jozzmcozz</i></b>!&nbsp;<br><span><br><b>1. What is your username in minecraft and what is your favorite game on Avicus?</b>&nbsp;<br></span>Hi there! My name is jozzmcozz, but please call me jozzy ^-^".&nbsp;&nbsp;My Minecraft name originated from my Runescape account, which was inspired by my mum actually.&nbsp;<span><span><br><br>My favourite gamemode on Avicus would have to be... Mhmm... NEXUS! :D<br>Teamdeath match has always been my favourite game types, whether it's in Call or Duty of Minecraft =D<br>However I still play Nebula every now and then, just to warm up for the big day ahead :P<br><b><br>2. What are you most excited/obsessed over at the moment?</b>&nbsp;<br>Avicus!! (I know it's sad, but I do have a life =D). I love playing basketball, as I am a very sporty person. I've been playing bball for 5 years now? Yeah! 10 seasons :)<br>In my free time, I like to draw random things! Whether that's drawing my cat, myself, my basketball ring. You name it, I'll draw it! (Well, try too)<b><br><br>3. Where are you from?&nbsp;<br></b>The one. The only. Aussyland.<br>That's right, I'm sure most of you know though. I'm an Australian (which is obvious if you ever hear me talk).&nbsp;<br><b><br>4. Are you in school, or do you have a job?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></b>Yes I am in High school. High school is definitely better than primary school though! The electives I have chosen are:<br>- Game Making<br>- Web Development / Animation<br>- Art<br>- eCommunications (photoshop, dealing with programs etc)<br><br>As you can obviously see (from the list above) is that I'm extremely tech savvy.<br><br>I don't have a job, however I'm going for one soon! =D &nbsp;<br><b><br>5. Who or what inspires you the most in your life?</b>&nbsp;<br>Tony Abbott. Full stop; top bloke.<br><br><b>6. How do you contribute to the Avicus as a staff member?&nbsp;</b><br>My role on the Avicus Network is to work with the Managers and Directors from an official point of view. I work really closely with the Junior Moderators (with a couple of others) to make sure they do the right thing! Hopefully we can increase the promotion to Moderator rate :D. I now also deal with support email (Yes, no more delayed responses)! However with my recent promotion to Senior Moderator, it means I have to sacrifice my twerking time in the lobby; for being AFK in the lobby ;-;<br><br><b>7. What are the most common questions you get asked while moderating or managing?&nbsp;<br></b>"Can you unban me?", "Mr Mod, how do I apply for mod?". Fairly basic questions.&nbsp;<br><br><b>8. Anything else you want to mention?</b>&nbsp;<br>Yeah one quick little thing. I just want to thank the members of the community and the staff members who have supported me throughout my time as a staff member, it's truly been a bumpy journey. I couldn't of done it without you! Much love &lt;333 (No homo)</span><br></span>

Australian Prime Minister. Everyone dislikes him, but I can get 1ms to his toilet. Therefore he is my "bae".<br><br>(Translate "bae" into Dutch, then it'll make sense =D)
