Never feel scared.&nbsp;<br>Always be confident in this process, but never cocky.&nbsp;<br>If you got the reviewing tag, I suggest you look at your application, edit it to make it just a bit more perfect and ask them to check it out again!&nbsp;<br>Good luck ^_^

at least those topics have some kind of discussion around them. <br><br>theyre not just talking about your current condition that 90% of players dont give af about. nobody can even make a conversation about it besides agreeing which is useless

As Mooch and Tino have said, there are no limits the amount of moderators are accepted. This, however, shouldn't even be an issue because if <b>you</b> think you can't get it, why even bother applying?
