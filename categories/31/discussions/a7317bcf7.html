Is there any reason for the change in the staff's rank colors?

Not really.<br>But you don't want the same thing forever do you?<br>Change is good. <br>It's a nice refresher.

No, Administrators are just directors. We removed the Manager rank because there was no difference in permissions/power between Senior Moderators and Managers. Therefore, we merged Managers with Senior Mods.

I personally like the new rank colors. &nbsp;Except the Mod color, I like the blue more. &nbsp;But that is just me.

I like all the new rank colors, and I also noticed the Gold rank in-game is a little more "yellow" than before.

IMO These should be the colors:<br><br><b>Map dev: </b>Purple<br><b>Jr Mod:&nbsp;</b>Green<br><b>Mod: &nbsp;</b>Lime Green<br><b>Sr Mod:&nbsp;</b>Dark Red, almost like the "Denied" color for the contest maps :P<br><b>Administrator:&nbsp;</b>Black xdddd, No, Aqua

I think the in-game gold should go back to what it was before... Now it's yellow, and I wanna feel special with the gold color.
