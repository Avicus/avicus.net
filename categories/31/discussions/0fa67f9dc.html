there was a forum post where people could put their top ten maps and ternio was one of the maps that everyone put in their top ten. Why is it not in the rots. All the new maps are shit &nbsp;and everyone misses the map rotations of mc zone. Please just put it back in the rots

Is Clay Wars in the Throwback rot?<br>I loved that map, because no one person could get stacked with armor more than others. I was mostly based on skill that teams would win, not at all overpowering with full diamonds like other maps.<br>If it is not, why isn't it in?<br>

Ternio was one of the best maps, not each map has to be 100% perfect. I really disagree with this supid decision. I don't know how someone can remove an old map... Even ParaPenguin created. ParaPenguin... are there any other maps from him which are still in rots?

I really don't understand why you're complaining so much about this. Read what I said above, "it will be added back soon".

You can't calm down when you read that one of the best Avicus' maps got removed. Even if it's only a temp-remove. Like 4lextr said, it's for everyone in the top 10 list. So when somebody is saying that it doesn't have enough space to pvp, why would all the other people care?

I'm gonna have to agree with them being that it was a great map. For all the times that I have played it, it never got to be a stalemate a lot and it was always fun to rush! However I respect their decision even if it wasn't the more popular one.

Honestly, if you think Avicus is that "shit" then I'm not really sure as to why you're still here. You need to realize that no matter what decision anybody makes, there will always be a huge group who disagrees, meaning not everybody can be pleased. I want Ternio back, too, so hopefully the map devs can find a way to fix whatever was wrong.

Alright here we go,<br><br>People that play regulary on Avicus are scared of changes. And I can understand that, no one really enjoy changes, not even I. You find these maps funny, enjoyable and they have always been there for you.<br>&nbsp; But Avicus and their maps will never, never improve if Avicus isn't ready to take the step and remove the maps that have poor gameplay. Terino have very poor gameplay, it's skybridge based, crafting armour is a pain in the butt, the amount of space you get could only work if it was competetive and the monuments were literally the most stupid thing ever to defend (The platforms were small and extremely far away).<br><br>I will probably get a lot of hate for this, but I was the one bringing it up that Terino shouldn't be a map on Avicus anymore, because I didn't find it enjoyble. But I also knew that people loved the map, therefor I came with the suggestion to have a nostalgia server that had the communitys old favorites which isn't really that gameplay based. The nostal rotation could like come back for one week every month or something and it would get the community hyped.<br><br>Nebula is kinda the same thing nowdays, get on, desotry the monument, killfarm, and get credits. It isnt really more than that. That's why tournament are important. With tournaments, players like me will stay, but with the fact that the tournament is competetive and some teams take it very seriously, we want good maps with "based gameplay" and "no biased favorite maps". I really hope you can understand that.&nbsp;<br><br>When I was a mapdev, we had an reassassment, where every mapdev could put a vote and an opinion on a map. 95% of the maps I rated had the "red" colour, which means I thought it should get removed. And I still stand for that decision. I really do think Avicus needs to improve their maps, and their YML features, which I know (hopefully) kylo and javi is doing.<br><br>I guess that's it. Probably got some misspells but idc tbh, if you didnt understand a centense or something just ask.
