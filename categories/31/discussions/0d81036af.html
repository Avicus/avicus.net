Hello,<br><br>As a conclusion to the map development meeting, we have decided to implement a numerous amount of features that will be brought to Avicus soon.&nbsp;<b>NOTE:&nbsp;</b>Most of these 'items' are not actually a thing yet, so be sure to stay updated!<br><br><b><u>Removal of leather armour<br></u></b><br>As to show, not a lot of people actually craft iron armour. Why? Because they may be too lazy or figured that they already have enough armour support (the leather armour). This leaves it so the iron is left behind. We thought that possibly removing the leather armour would be best so people actually make use of the iron supplies. This would hopefully make gameplay more interesting than before. We would also like your opinions on this topic.<br><br><b><u>Removal of diamonds on various maps<br></u></b><br>This topic somewhat connects to the one above. On some maps, diamond armour can lead to maps being stalematey and what not. Kill farming also has a major value in this; if it's such a problem on so many maps, why not consider removing some? Having diamonds on small, cluttered maps doesn't provide the best gameplay as we see it. We hope that we can possibly improve maps with this in hand.<br><br><b><u>More YML features</u></b><u><br></u><br>It was somewhat confirmed that there will be more YML features soon (possibly in the 1.8 update). This will lead to having 'better' gameplay on maps and faster methods - void regions component? There's not much else to say about this, so get hyped.<br><br><br>There were other things discussed in the meeting as well, but those are currently confidential.<br>If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to respond below.

Thanks! maybe they should just get a leather helmet. The only issue I have is that it makes it easier to kill farm and its very annoying getting 2 hitted by a diamond guy (It even happens when trying to make armor)

This is why we are thinking of removing diamond on certain maps! We disscussed everything about killfarming and such, have no worries! C:

I would recommend removing it on certain maps. One of the reasons for this is because on a 4 team dtm map it is already pretty confusing. So I would recommend keeping the 4 team dtm maps, other than that I don't have any complaints!

love the first idea. similar to ocn but who cares and infact it will make the whole pub avicus thing much better so that people will learn to get iron so they don't get killed quickly.<br>second idea i'm not too worried about <br>third idea great one<br>basically keep up the good work guys &lt;3
