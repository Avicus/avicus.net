It helps by keeping the chats new users would join, PG-13ish and if that player wishes to be in an environment like nightclub they can donate. It also stops people from being forced into a chat in which they do not feel comfortable so that they are not just in a chat by themselves.

I like you Viper but as a personal opinion, I don't a think the "night club" or 18+ channels are needed, like adding this channels is an excuse to be allowed to be a dick with people, this can be bad.<br>Also people can do any of these things in any channel, and it's not like a mod is always checking how they are talking. it's just that of course most people won't use insults with people they don't know or don't have enough confidense but at least if you are confident with someone, it doesn't matter wherever you wre you might use insults because at the end you are friends

We are trying to crack down on mods dealing with TeamSpeak punishments more often so we don't need to worry about that. I do see you point though but as long as there is staff there it won't happen. It can always be reported to a staff member.

Why would you even think about making it for only donators? How is that going to fix the problem, because most of the people with colourful language aren't donators? Just keep it how it is, as there is a broad range of attitudes on the TS server. Let those who are naturally rude and swear uncontrollably be in the Nightclub, those who swear in and out in the Cursing Allowed, and those with clean mouthes use the Cursing Forbidden. Honesty, just keep it how it is.

There is a difference between having colorful language and being offensive. With the current rule set of Nightclub chats it allows this offensive behavior. We want to limit it when possible by making Nightclub donor only so if you really have a need to be offensive to others just buy a rank.

You should just make a cursing allowed or night club and one for people that don't like cursing and stuff.<br><br>Like it's not your fault that kids join the nightclub and hear cursing. Like it says in the description cursing is allowed so it's up to you if you want to join or not<br><br>Making it donator plus is stupid then why not just use the donator suites D;
