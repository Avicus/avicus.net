To make it simple for you, I consider TeamSpeak an alternative to Skype.<br>It is a place where you can join any channel and talk to people who are in different chats.<br>If you ever wish to talk to anyone at any time, there will always be friendly players on TeamSpeak willing to start friendly conversations and help you out!<br>I hope that this cleared it up if you were still confused.

Personally, the TeamSpeak community is fantastic. &nbsp;It's a &nbsp;new better way to hear constant screaming and yelling. &nbsp;I'm on it almost 24/7. &nbsp;<br><br>But in all honesty, TS is totally worth it.
