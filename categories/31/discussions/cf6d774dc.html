Can we have a announcement so we know that player is punished like for example<br>a staff is online and he or she sees a player breaking the rules so when that staff member is punishing him or her it announces it like this<br><br>[Staff Member] kicked [Player] Reason:<br>Better example (Im using jozz and i as an example NOT REAL XD )<br><br>jozzmcozz kicked DarkArcher810 Reason: To Happy

Yeah, this really needs to be implemented. I feel like all these random people spam "*so and so* IS A HACKER!!!!!!" 10 minutes after that person got banned/kicked... Maybe that's just me, but it really seems like that's what happens if a mod doesn't speak up. Also, I'd personally like to thank all mods for all the volunteer work they do to keep the server fun and clean. You're awesome :3

Seems like a great idea. Could be set out like this /ban [player] [reason] [true, false] the true or false tells the forum whether to post why they were punished.

Umm, sounds nice but a bit spammy to the forums.<br>Also, true/false thing is called a <u>boolean</u>. Its used a lot on code.

There would be a preset page (on the forums) that has a list which is where it would go for the forums and then for in game it could link to Steven's idea. I know what a boolean is, I didn't use it because the word doesn't actually exist (like funner,) so I didn't write it to avoid confusion.

For staff it can show all infractions that other staff make and for players it can be from the match they are like If Somebody gets kicked in Nexus-05 it will show that for all players in nexus 5 and all the staff can see it wherever they are.<br><br>That is my idea but I also like all of your ideas.

The infractions page is what I was meaning and if I'm correct it posts the punishments anyway without a choice which is why I was saying a true / false in case the moderators didn't want people to see them get punished.

+1 Love this idea. Would really let someone know if there report was handled. Also it would let someone know if the person that was being rude/using profanity/hacking/etc is gone and handled with.
