I would say I should be at least at the top 5, as 75% of my 3000 kills are bow kills. I use it both far and when a opponent are near as five blocks from me.

at longshots he is.&nbsp;<br>But you are right, there are archers better at him when it comes to bowspamming and close-mid range.&nbsp;<br>He gets more credit though because (generally) longer shots are harder to aim and predict the trajectory.
