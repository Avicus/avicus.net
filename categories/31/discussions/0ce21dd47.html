Just let him play, don't try to bother him or anything.<br>I bet that if he record a video on Avicus, shortly Avicus will have more players than the Overcast Network.

I am, I'm just trying to figure out a way to prove myself without having to make a video.

Avicus has a less competitive feel to public matches, Overcast has a lot of veteran PvPers that try too hard. ;p Well Russian players would give pur translator team a chance to work. xD We have a few Russian players that I know. Anyhow great to see you trying out servers! Hope to see you around. :D

Welcome :)<br><br>I've been on this server for about 3 years... Joined when it used to be called MCZone. Now Avicus. OCN was my first server ever... my Mother-Server. I personally prefer Avicus because the community here is much more tightly-knit and close.<br><br>We're gonna get a huge META soon that will introduce a slur of new content and whatnot. Perhaps if you're willing you could stay for awhile until we get it?<br><br>Anyway, it's nice to see a Youtuber who is famous yet isn't an idiot or an egotistical nutjob come aboard. Welcome and enjoy your stay, my friend ;)

Hey Dilleron I hope you enjoy your stay here at the Avicus Network. We have some talented people here and the community here is really chill. I've played this server for a very long time and it has gone through a lot of changes some good some bad however what shines about this server then other servers is mainly the community e.g teamspeak a lot of users go on there and chat with friends + mega scrims in which players competitvely play against others in certain gamemodes like Capture the Wool or Destroy the Monument. I know for a fact I enjoy this server that's why I'm still here xD (almost 3 years and going).

Yeah, not even DILLERON can. :p<br><br>I haven't been here for very long, obviously...but can anyone tell me perhaps how many players Avicus had before dropping?<br><br>I also would be glad if someone could also tell me all the gamemodes that were here and are now gone

In the golden days it was number 2, minecade being number 1. It reached over 2000 players easily everday.&nbsp;<br><br>In regards with gamemodes;<br>- Skywars<br>- Ghost Squadron&nbsp;<br>- Avicade (Arcade type minigames)<br><br>Add me on Skype and we can talk (htminecraft).

This is not the real Dilleron. DILLERON's account was compromised and the user who created the thread decided to do this and use the account along with ban evading with the account. I will lock this thread now and Dilleron has been web banned, banned Ingame, and we have removed his famous rank.<br><br>To all users: We are sorry for this happening.
