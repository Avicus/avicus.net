It just falled into my mind, why dosen't Avicus have a trailer to show new players the gamemodes here? Could be nice to have so new players knows a bit more about the server before they choose to&nbsp;<u>not</u> try the server out.<br>&nbsp;If i'm wrong, and we have it, it is really hard to find it.

We have a few unofficial ones floating around, but it would be nice to have an updated one.

We should take to add one to the page where you come to when you connect to avicus.net, and the video should automatically start. Not in full screen, but the same as if youtubers have a trailer for their channel (if you understand).

automatically starting videos are the worst, like what if I'm on the metro and I open the avicus website and a bunch of that crappy modern music all the kids listen to that I'm sure will be in the video starts playing because I forgot to mute my phone one time and then everyone starts looking at me

Ye ok, but my point is that they should add a video that's easy to see when you connect to the website.

That's the problem, there's gamemodes since that. They should wait to all the new things have been added, and then make a video. Instead of working on making the monuments gold blocks (after 20min), they should work on advertising. In my opinion to have this kind of video would help new players decide if they want to try the server out.

This is a massive +1 in my opinion, and as for <img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/47b15675a0484e8f863a0cbf86ba22dc?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/profbananaslug.html" style="color: #009396">profbananaslug</a>, it doesn't have to have sound. I've seen plenty of trailers and promotions that come across fine without music. The thing that would make it even better is to add different shaders and renders, that really gives off positive vibes and is a great and cheap form of advertising.
