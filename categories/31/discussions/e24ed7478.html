Lmao, each person here on a team knows already the IP and it's only Teamspeak, there are already 10 or even more ppl online.<br><br>But if the mods here really think the priority of the "forums rules" are bigger than those from the Teamspeak, they are like they don't wanna take help, then I accept that stupidness. Go on Mods! Keep the great work up &lt;3

No we do not relies you are working hard. We never do. Why? Because you never let the community know what is happening. No issues are being brought up and it always have to be done by a community member. When the problem is addressed staff make sure that their asses are saved because that is more important apparently. &nbsp;I am sick. I am sick and tired of the same shit that always happens. I have said the same thing on my thread that the community and staff need to work together but what happens? The staff say "I like this." or "+1" or "Nice job Pie for doing this." Only 2 mods were helpful in that. The Sr Mods and Flu disappointed me. The community does not want words. We want actions. Stop this stupid hiding and come out. We are part of the community to so why leave us out?<br><br>This was to all staff. Spart you have done a better job and I rank you higher then all of the Sr Mods.

@Iron: You can say it a little bit nicer...<br><br>ON TOPIC: I must commend you on your efforts to help Avicus. We all want it to survive, and we all want to keep playing. Your suggestions on the Helping Avicus Thread are great recommendations. I know that senior staff is working on applying those topics. To be honest, Mods can't do a whole lot. We basically just watch over the server. we don't really make many decisions. That would be the seniors and up job.<br><br>Now don't blame it on them, because that is not the point of this reply. They are doing their best to get things done. I don't know what they are doing but I'm sure that they are dealing with a lot right now. Jozz is on leave atm and we really need an admins approval to finalize things. Yes, we don't have proof that things are being worked on like you said, but you will just have to ask the srs. I'm sure they are busy doing things, however I hope that they will reveal new ideas at the next staff meeting.<br><br>Hopefully that answered your question.<br><br>Regards,<br>Riley

When the TeamSpeak crashed, it caused the channels on the bottom to disappear. The staff channels were there the second it was loaded up.

Again on the saving asses issue. I feel like when you get mod or something you are fixed to think that admins and Sr Mods always do the right thing and because you are working hard you do the right thing. I can work hard at work, I can still be fired. If the mods have done everything right, then it all lies with the Sr mods. I know this isn't the issue at all and I am not stupid. Again I do not trust you. I am doubting things that I know are wrong and I feel that I can doubt other things. The mods have enough power to hide posts, lock, and other things. Hiding posts and locking is not a big deal but the staff do it on the wrong things. A community members feels his opinions will be locked because of this. Do you want this on your community?

Moderators don't do any work progression for payments or uptime for the TeamSpeak. Literally this will happen on slack.<br><br>Mod: "The teamspeak is down again."<br>Other Staff Member: "!admins"<br><br>1-2 weeks later;<br><br>Mod: "Someone made a topic about the TS being down."<br><br>And yet nothing gets done because only Kylo can pay for the server and NO one else but him.

Ok, thanks for the feedback. I'll take this into account and think of what needs to be done in the future.<br>Anyways, currently we moderators cannot do anything other then notifying the admins. It may take some time for teamspeak to restore back to it's original state.

Oh I agree, 100%. There are some choices that I believe the seniors and admins made the wrong call on. I can name multiple occasions. However, this is where agency comes in. Everyone has their own part to do in this community. If it be a player, a mod, a senior, or whatever. We are all working on doing our part because we care. Sure the admins/seniors might not be the most efficient people on the planet, however that is why we are all here. To learn. I would love to expand more on this topic.

I do not trust any suggestions will be put into use. There is no indication on saying that anything will be done. I was lucky to know that the idea of the community and staff meeting(Oh if the community didn't know, they are apparently working on it. I got asked to help a bit) but no one knows. I don't know why the openness is so bad and I trust people less that are less open

Ok cool. Im afraid, that making threads like this is the only way for myself to get points across. You can argue all you want, but using "Caps and yelling" is the most effective way of gaining attention. We have been told to be patient, but the tournament is in 1 week, and none of the admins appear to have any intention of fixing Team speak. And then when people try and solve the issue, by creating a Team speak. Its IP gets archived.<br><br>I could write more but its 3 am. So this is what you get

If you're talking about my comment, i'll admit, I haven't really taken much into account over the past as a moderator.<br>While the staff team wants to improve, so do I. I'll try taking topics and situations into account more for the future. If that makes any sense.

The moderators and senior moderators are not able to fix issues like this. I have made temporary channels on TS so people can still use it in the mean time. Jozz and I are in an awkward timezone which makes it hard to send messages back and forth with Kylo. We still address the issues, it just takes a while for things to be sorted. Apologies for the inconvenience!

Cool. That makes it worse, seeing as they weren't turned into regular chats .-.<br><br>And im pretty sure the admins could fix &nbsp;Teamspeak if they wanted. OHWAIT..1..1!! The one whos not on leave doesnt play minecraft, use the forums, or Teamspeak!

I use TS quite extensively actually, and my current role doesn't require me to go in-game or use the forums as much I had to in the past. Now that I'm the staff admin most of my work goes on behind the scenes. With that said, I do agree that I could post on the forums more frequently.
