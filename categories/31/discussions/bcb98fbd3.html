I would recommend checking out some intro templates made by either "Velosofy", or CaptivaLP. They are both very skilled, and they make Minecraft intros as well as other types of gaming intros.

Actually, I just screen recorded an iTunes visualizer and added text over that in iMovie. Worked pretty well in my opinion. xD

Alright, so, if your going to download a template, it's going to be bad I can tell you, because alot of other people would be using it also, making it show that you just downloaded one. IF you legit want to make one yourself, you sortof want to get well known with either Cinema4D/Blender/Maya (C4D is best for beginners, but takes longer to download, Blender is good but takes longer, and Maya is for professionals.) If you want a 3d banner, use those, and if you want a 2d banner, either use photshop (Make sure to use the video frame layer) or adobe after effects (Really easy to understand, and learn.) These are mainly for 2D banners. Just get well known with them, and then you want to make an intro. It's best that you learn and then do, not just try off the bat, because I've been thru that, and I've suffered thru my learning time. <br>NOTE: These are for minecraft intros and/or some other games that might work. I am not sure what program would be best for other intros.

1. Download one and use YouTube editor to add it to future videos. (Not recommended)<br>2. Windows Movie Maker or iMovie, then upload as "my new intro" then add it using YT Vid Editor. I would use short gameplay clips and then your name or something showing. (Good idea)<br>3. What other people said.
