Please can I come back?<br><br>I thought that you'd unbanned me since I hadn't received a message. Then I tried connecting to the server&nbsp;and I saw that I was still banned from 2013. It just left me in tears. Pleas guys I wanna come back. :(<br><br>I miss everything on this server. I have no friends on this website. I didn't get time to make any.

I've been gone for 6 months it's not like an average person can wait to go back on a good server for 6 months, if so please try and prove me wrong. I know I did a stupid thing and I really wish to come back.<br><br>EDIT: I was banned for using Anti-Knockback as that was the one I was only using in game. It may say that but I hope you know the quote "You can't judge a book by it's cover". I was there, you weren't. I was in Game with the Director/Moderator "Howsie22".<br><br>Most of the events are between me and him personally, however he hasn't been on for around 2 weeks.

You have made several posts. Repeatedly doing so is not at all helping your case. It is not "between you and Howsie." When Howsie banned you, he did so on behalf of the Avicus Network. You <b>will&nbsp;</b>receive a reply from support@avicus.net when your appeal is viewed. Do not send in multiple appeals, and do not spam the forums with requests to have your ban appealed- those two actions are going to work <b>against</b> the possible appeal of your ban. Just sit tight and wait. There are currently a very limited number of people actively responding to support emails, and there are likely hundreds of emails. Be patient.&nbsp;

The idea is to prevent an uproar from arising in the first place.<br>He knows that he should appeal via the support email. He has submitted an email in an attempt to do so. There was and still is no need for him to post on the forums about it. He does it once, fine. He didn't know. But it has happened several times. "Begging to be unbanned" is going to accomplish quite the opposite.&nbsp;

S<a rel="nofollow" href="http://avicus.net/soulreaper2012">oulreaper2012</a>&nbsp;This Tread wasn't your best Idea. I know from the old forums, that when you make post about your ban, your ban won't be appealed or you have only a little chance.

It was a rule or something else, that if you make a Tread about your ban, the ban won't be appeled. I think the rule is the same on this forum.

You were only on the server for 3 hours.<br>How can you be so attached? You can't get to know many players in 3 hours, so I can't see how you are so upset if you've only played on this for such a short time.

Please stop spamming this topic soulreaper2012.<br><br>Quite frankly, nobody really cares about this right now, and this is just spamming the forums.<br><br>If you really want to get unbanned, you should write another appeal. However, it is very unlikely that you will be unbanned because you were using a hacked client.

That makes me wonder if I were to go use Anti-Knockback on the server, I would get unbanned. People shouldn't use the community as a factor for someone's unbanning. That would put XxtheexampleplayerxX, who is not in the community, at a &nbsp;disadvantage. XxtheexampleplayerxX can't even get a forum account.
