It was just discussed between staff and players and the majority said yes to start it. The hand picked staff will start in March(or the next mod openings)<br><br><br>Edit: Here is the link&nbsp;<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://avicus.net/forums/c012240d1">http://avicus.net/forums/c012240d1</a>

We haven't started trialing it yet, but we will most likely start sometime near the beginning to middle of March.

This is true. We do plan on doing hand picked staff in March. The staff has decided how we will go about doing this already, so no need to worry:) We will notify the community when we start to begin doing hand picked staff.

We have not implemented the hand picked staff system as of now. It's expected to be enforced sometime in March.
