Its come to the staff's attention that we need a new hub soon. At Ivy's request, the Map Development team will be making a new hub that is more satisfying and overall, more fun. They need some help though because they don't exactly know what you all want. Please leave a list of the things that you want to be added to the new hub.&nbsp;<br>Thank you,<br>Max

It should be big, better design... like, more variety of blocks...<br>It should have bigger &nbsp;names of the minimodes, and the logos bigger and well designed too ^~^<br>I know map development team will haven't any problem making this, so,... be cause they're awesome!

To be quite blunt. Why the heck would we start a new hub when there's a multitude of glitches to fix in gamemodes? This just sets us back from fixing these things. We need to worry about long term gameplay issues&nbsp;<b><u>before</u></b><u></u> we work on aesthetics. It's like a map, it can be the nicest looking map ever, but if it has functionality issues like potholes everywhere stopping people from sprinting, no one will play the map. This is meant with all due respect, i'm trying to help the server not get everyone pissed off. We need to fix Elim compasses if they haven't been already, fix slowness instead of speed in the CTH scout kit, the double hit glitch, people glitched into the ground. The bug in Nebula where it makes you invis and on a neutral team where you appear grey on your screen but you appear to be on a team to everyone else and you can teamkill. I'm just saying address the issues before adding luxuries.&nbsp;<br><br>I do like the idea though :3&nbsp;<br><br>just after the issues are fixed

Flying for donators, a MUCH smaller hub (the current one is far too massive), secret areas to explore, and maybe, if you don't want too many areas, just a simple, slightly hidden area like the secret room in the MC Zone hub. That was my favorite place ever in Minecraft.

No, creating a hub does not matter much about a "contest". It matters if the hub is build properly, efficient and is fun to use for others and such. The hub matters on taking time, you cannot simply rush it as a contest or it would not be made at it's best work.

Calm down, Ivy isn't personally working on this project. He is currently busy recoding most of the plugins and creating new game modes and what not. There is a lot planned in the next update, and we would like for a hub for all players. Please report all bugs onto the github, or send them to me over Skype: gilletteracer. <br>Complaining about glitches that the staff doesn't know about does nothing to help the issues.

A statue of me! xD<br><br>No, you should add secret paths with a surprise at the end, like XP. If you are able to find the secret path and make it trough, maybe parkour, you get your surprise. It should be difficult as fudge, not something easy everyone will use just to get their daily XP, it should be a struggle to get to the surprise.

Like everyone else said,&nbsp;<br>1. Parkour would be amazing, it's easy, simple and fun to create.<br>2. Many types of Parkour? Like an "Easy," "Medium," etc.&nbsp;<br>3. Secret places to explore because those were definitely fun.&nbsp;<br>4. Tutorials on gamemodes so that new-comers won't have to go into a Nebula game and ask.&nbsp;<br>5. List of Basic Rules.<br>6. Simple and Small, not super big that it makes your computer lag. Small Hubs are what, I think, most new-comers enjoy. Be sure to still make it look pretty so it doesn't look too plain though.&nbsp;<br>7. Staff Members.&nbsp;<br>8. Erm, did I mention Secret Places? More of that please xD

If you're building a new hub, I suggest you look towards the hubs of Hypixel and Mineplex. There are clearly other popular servers with nice hubs, but those two really stand out to me. Perhaps a parkour with a specified start and end block... you could rig up a simple plugin to measure the time for players to reach the end, and then make an auto-updating leaderboard. That would be cool. Definitely add more gadgets to play with. Sure, the current hub looks nice, but it's pretty much just a big box with some signs on it, and really, who likes being in a bix box with some signs on it? Not me. A big box with some signs on it full of parkour and secrets, however, is someplace I would stay.

/fly: yes, as long as there are barriers so people cant fly out of spawn and into the distance.<br><br>/disguise: maybe&nbsp;<i></i>only a&nbsp;<i></i>couple mobs available (for example: everyone can disguise as, say, pig, gold can get pig and chicken, emerald can get pig, chicken, and cow, diamond gets pig, chicken, cow, and horse)<br><br>/nick: please, no. this will get abused so easily.

also, this isnt necessarily a hub, but maybe a money system of sorts, like change the xp system to money and have an xp shop where you could buy lower level hub trails, disguises (see xInfantry's comment), and buy other hub perks like mounts and such. this is what makes the hubs in other minigame servers so fun and draws so many players... don't limit yourselves, either. i know there's already a new hub, but what draws a ton of players is uniqueness and creativity in the hubs, not just a generic hub with maybe a couple things to do in it.. i can't stress this enough tbh...

What I would really like is parkour which would stimulate players while they are waiting for a friend to get online.

Parcour<br>Secret hidden rooms <br>More attention to fun then detail<br>Less buildings more like a nice relaxing hub<br>I room with all the staff members <br>Less time to walk to each gamemode<br>And <br>To save time from the poor Map Devs ... It could be a competition for the public!!!!<br>-Jess

Just so you know, I am one of two owners of a build team that has built multiple maps for Avicus. If you need help, we can pitch in a bit.
