<b></b>So I was just thinking how you know if how scouts look at college or high school athletes to have them move to the next level. So I was thinking why doesn't Avicus organize like a Tryout with everyone that wants to attend to have like a big tryout type thing when like the leaders of team spectate or watch players and see how they do. If they do well the team can make him an offer.&nbsp;<br><div><br></div><div>Just a little brain storm<br><br></div>

PPB wouldn't do this. Nice idea but no teams would do it.

Most teams would private scout players if they needed a specific position filled, but if you're just starting up a team then try outs is most definitely the way to go, could be a bit bias, but gives everyone a chance.

Most teams would probably prefer to tryout people in a scrim, because it public games show nothing really

I was thinking something along those lines:<br><ul><li>Make a forum post about Tryouts</li><li>Make a Tryout team (ex. Bad Company Tryouts)</li><li>Invite all people who say they are interested on the forum post onto the tryout team.</li><li>Hold a Scrimmage with the actual team. Then either:</li><li>A: have the real team split into 2 and fill in the spots with tryout players and play a match.</li><li>or B: split the tryout players into two teams and just have the actual team spec.</li><li>Then after that the team could do whatever they want to evaluate players.</li></ul>
