I haven't been playing on Avicus basically ever, and I've decided to make this post as to why, and maybe give some tips to help. First off I won't be leaving completely, just will rarely be playing, and not really be a part of the community much anymore. The main reason I have stopped playing was because I have noticed that most of the people have been very rude lately, and it's just not a fun environment anymore.&nbsp;<br><br>I'm going to list a few things that Avicus can work on, some of them the staff team knows about, some maybe not. I don't want to cause a fight over this, I just wanted to point out the things I have noticed that needs fixed, I'm not going to be rude about it, I want this to be a calm post.<br><br>1. Block lag. This has been around for much, much too long, it needs to be fixed. &lt;3<br><br>2. Bans that have been very, very wrong. An example is OpticSlinky. I was not there when this happened, but she was not hacking as far as I know, and she was banned for x-ray, fast ladder climb, and no head. This seems very strange to me. I have talked to her a little bit, and she said she was not hacking when this happened. I have also talked to people that were there, they all have said that she was not hacking. (This post was not to get her unbanned, I just have noticed a lot of bans for bad reasons, and I know the most about this one.)<br><br>3. Making tournaments for other games than DTM, there was a post about this not too long about, but it got a lot of hate from DTM players that find walls dumb. I understand that some of you don't like walls because it takes too long or what ever, but we have DTM tournaments a lot more than we do walls. Plus Avicus can't survive on&nbsp;<b>only</b> DTM. Advertising other games would be very helpful to Avicus. And it gives the walls people to get something for us, not just you guys. I also saw some DTM people that liked this idea, so I'm not just hating on DTM people, most of you are nice. &lt;3

Optic was caught using x-ray and fast ladder. I won't say much but it was pretty conclusive.<br><br>Once we upgrade the server fully to 1.8 it will be easier to pinpoint the cause of some of the lag that's present on Avicus.

I think blocklag is getting fixed in this upcomming update kylo is talking about.<br><br>Did you ask her to appeal? She should do that if you thinks the ban was wrong. It takes like 5 minutes :/<br><br>I think avicus should focus on Nebula tournaments because Walls isn't very developed as the Nebula servers are. But I'm going to admit, it would be pretty sick to have a walls tournament.

1 Yeah there have been around a thousand posts about this. It can't really be fixed until Avicus updates fully to 1.8 (as I've heard)<br>2 She was hacking. If opticslinky wants to see the evidence (she hasn't requested for it yet) I will gladly show it to her, and if she wants, she can show it to you. Don't assume things. You weren't there.<br>3 Agreed<br><br>Anyway, cya later man, didn't really get to talk to you that much

1. The 1.8 update to the server should fix most/all of the block lag<br>2. I have no idea but she better appeal/check the evidence first before concluding that bans/mods are bad cause of that (I'm guessing she is cause she was saying it was a "false ban"<br>3. Our next tourney is CTW, not dtm yo. And remember, we have only had 1 Avicus tournament lol. So DTM was the first gamemode we covered since it's the main gamemode

I am sick of this. Stop going on about walls players and how they are different to nebula players. I am sick of hearing all this stuff about "Walls players are quite ez to kill" or that shit. As patrikano said saying no offence doesn't gvie you the right to do this. If avicus keeps complaining about how walls players are different I am just gonna lose it. We are all human, we all like different things. "They don't know how to create a team". This is sad because about 98% walls players are in a team and own the team. Iz and I made a team and I am a walls player. Coco and ezzzSniper made a team and they are walls players. Random guy made a team and he is a walls player. You stop assuming. I swear if I get banned for flaming I will kill myself. This is me stating a point!

Calm down, it was an opinionated assumption — he never complained about anything or anyone. The only issue here is that you, among others, are overreacting and taking what he said as an offensive personal attack, which is not what he intended (or even did, for that matter). Moreover, it's already been thoroughly discussed in the past, and hosting a Walls tournament was determined not to be a viable option because of the nature of the game. As such, Walls would only be suited for mini-events, of which I believe some have already been held.

You were a great player Micah, will be missed! &nbsp;Hopefully Avicus will fixed these issues(I'm pretty sure they will plan a walls tourney, like random and vlad said, there's only been one tourney)

Lolololololol it cracks me up when people think walls players are e.z I dare some nebula players to 1v1 them they will lose there shit on how surprised on how good we really are

Look, I think I have the right to speak for both the walls and nebula community, and I'm going to say that even the best walls players will probably find it hard to beat most Capture/Destroy the objective players. Until you guys fight it out somewhere and see who wins, that's how my views are going to stay.

Erm, I'm a walls player and I know that nebula players are better at pvp, they face it more, they are in pvp 24/7 (unless rushing)<br>Walls players don't face as much pvp, so we don't have as much experience.<br>We have ten minutes of zero combat! XD<br>Where during that time, a dtm match is already knees deep in combat. &nbsp;It's just the truth, now there may be exceptions, like Endertrevor and Porcupine, that maybe could beat some decent nebula players, but overall, a decent walls player isn't the same level as a nebula player.<br><br>Just being honest here and stating some things that I think should be considered, love ya guys &lt;3<br><br>Bai again micah XD

Holy shit, flame war OP.&nbsp;<br><br>Nebula players have more experience in one game of nebula in PvP than walls players get in 10 games (well, unless you were there in the OG days with the tons of people and you hunted).&nbsp;<br><br>OP: See ya michah, sad to see you go. :c

Oh please, you know it's true, most of the walls players don't know about the forums. The well known ones do, but most of them don't. Let's not turn this into a war. &lt;3

I don't actually. But alright. I do apologise for arguing in your leaving post, of course nobody replied to itzrilo's post...I guess I was 'special'<br><br>But sadly that's not a good thing :D<br><br>I didn't know you too much. But I do remember playing walls with you. I do remember getting wins with you that we shouldn't of won, and it was fun. Don't leave forever :D Bye
