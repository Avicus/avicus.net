I know it's a bit late to make suggestions because we're just going into a new update but, why not right? Devs are always open to suggestions so, I was thinking about having a chat box in the forums.<br>For example, you want to message a friend, well, &nbsp;you just go in his profile, press the "Open chat box" option a side from his name and a box will pop up, then all you will have to do is start chatting.&nbsp;<br>Communication (Community - Staff) would be so much easier and complaints would be reduced so if you add this into the website, I would be pleased.<br>Thanks for reading!<br>Juan c:

Now, think about this, what if someone needs a Mod..?<br>Reports don't take 1 sec and e-mailing is gone.<br>A chat box would be suitable for issues and answers would be faster.

But you can easily message them on skype, contact them ingame or you can go in one of the supportrooms on the TS.

No, this would be rather spammy, and annoying. I despise stuff like this. People randomly from the web can just spam keyloggers, viruses, etc.

XAT is a good chatbox plugin although, there is a website for it and it's just chatrooms, and there is staff ranks too.
