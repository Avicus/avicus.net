The word 'faggot'

</h1>
I have recently seen somebody get banned for 5 days because they called themselves a faggot/gay. Now, I understand that saying faggot is a rule, 100% get that, but when it's not directed and its a 5 day ban, that's&nbsp;a bit stupid. The word gay is not really inappropriate at all, it's just a word showing if you are sexually attracted to boys or girls. I mean, the word 'faggot' has been used as an insult for many decades, and I get why that is bannable. But why is it punishable if it isn't even directed, that's&nbsp;stupid. People say 'fuck you' and manage to get a warn if their unlucky, but as soon as you call yourself a faggot its a 5 day? The ratio between the rules is stupid. You say 'nigger' and get a warn and a 3 day temp ban, but faggot is a 5 day. I just don't get it, what are your opinions?

The logic behind it is encouragement. If you start saying it in chat, and aren't punished for it, there's a good chance others may take offence to it. On top of that, some people take offence to the word considering that it's a derogatory term, in the same way that 'nigger' is a derogatory slang term. Using terms like 'nigger' and 'faggot' put invisible walls between people by differentiating them based on something out of their control, such as their skin colour or their sexual orientation. <br><br>However, I do agree that the ratio is stupid. I had a few arguments with the seniors about that disparity, as if you're going to punish someone for discrimination then you should punish them equally depending on the offence.<br><br>Off-topic somewhat, but the logic behind the term is rather stupid. A 'faggot' is also a traditional British food in the UK, while 'fag' is used for a cigarette.

It's more likely to be out of people's control than within their control. If it weren't, people in more homophobic countries probably wouldn't choose to be interested in the same sex.<br><br>Regardless, it's still putting social barriers between yourself and others, so it's still wrong.

Discriminating for the sake of bullying someone is just being an arsehole, anything done to bully someone is wrong. But even without the slur there are still some very clear barriers set up in society regarding sexuality. If it was directed or not does matter, people shouldn't be limited to what they say just in case someone who takes offence to is in earshot. That is one of the worst impacts of the rise of political correctness. If I was gay and saw someone type fag in chat, I don't think they are trying to bully me. Just like the kys rule, listen, they are 99% of the time not urging you to kill yourself, they're pissed off they died in online lego.&nbsp;<i style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><br><br>'</i><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><i>On topic: Political correctness has fucked society so fucking far.

However all&nbsp;</span>unnatural sexual relationships have been widely agreed upon until the second half of the 1900s. The rise of the LGBT community is a direct consequence&nbsp;of the overuse of "political correctness".

Different moderators have different interpretations of the rules. However i can clarify for you, the word itself is enough to be punished little alone if it's directed or excessive.

It's not a case of different staff disagreeing on how to enforce rules.<br>It's that some staff don't make themselves aware of a situation before punishing. <br><br>They'll see key words and issue punishments without analysing the context of how the words were used.<br><br>It's an experience thing more than anything else.<br><br>You'll see this more with newer Moderators.<br>It's not really their fault, it'd be the quality of the training they've received and how well their Mentors have mentored them.

Ah but we do. There is quite a bit of a difference when it comes to mods punishing others. But like I say, It's up to them, you don't have to follow guidelines as long as you can justify it. I get what your saying but there is always context, which we can never account for in the guidelines as there are so many ways people can say things.

I know all staff approach situations differently. And I preach the "you don't have to follow the guidelines as long as you can justify it" more than anyone else on the staff team xD<br><br>My point was that as a team we aim to maintain symmetry with all punishments regardless of the moderator. Obviously it's not going to be perfect with every unique situation, but it's a constant goal to have anyway. (So that we don't seem biased if we give our varying infractions for the same punishment)<br><br>tl;dr I agree with your post. But am attempting to clarify what I meant :P

Why is this word so offensive? Why is 'fuck you' a fucking warn? Why is 'kys' a kick, why is faggot a fucking 5 day tempban. You don't get punished for swearing if its not directed, so why do you get punished for saying 'faggot' if its not directed?

you fucking muppet. you're like 12 years old do you know what the word "faggot's" connotations are. You don't use slurs from the fucking 1960s anymore. BUT, yes you are right there should be nothing wrong with saying faggot or nigger if its not directed at anyone.

Actually, the rule on matters such as this states that slang terms such as 'faggot' which are inherently discriminatory are punishable regardless of whether they're directed or not, or at least it was a few months ago.

Discriminating for the sake of bullying someone is just being an arsehole, anything done to bully someone is wrong.

While you may not take offence to it, it still expresses the outdated belief that those who are attracted to the same sex are somehow different to those around them, in contrast to what society once saw as 'normal', e.g. those who are attracted to the same sex are somehow less deserving than those attracted to the opposite sex, which as society, or at least parts of Western society, has shown should no longer be the case.<i style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><br><br>'</i><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><i>On topic: Political correctness has fucked society so fucking far.

This is the kind of thing that the LGBT try to change. I also wouldn't really consider being attracted to the same sex as being unnatural, as I find it highly unlikely that in cases such as Oscar Wilde - a famed Irish playwriter who lived during the 19th century, where homosexual acts could lead to years of hard manual labour in prison - would simply <b>choose </b>to be attracted to the same sex as he. However, as you said this is a rather sensitive topic and quite questionable, so I won't say anymore about it.<br><i><br></i>Sorry for the wall of text. This and other social issues such as racism, sexism, etc are topics that I feel quite passionately about. xD<i><br></i></span>
