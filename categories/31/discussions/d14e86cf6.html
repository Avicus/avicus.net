Well the evidence says otherwise.&nbsp;The only way you&nbsp;can dispute it is if&nbsp;someone else used your account, or you accidentally posted while you were looking through the topic.

I was in upstairs in the bathroom and my friend was down stairs playing in Single Player and I told him not to mess with anything, I came back and checked Avicus forums and I saw "My Discussons" and I checked em and saw yoav replied to me in a post.<br>EDIT: I asked him and he admited to clicking and looking through stuff then posting and being stupid. Case closed.

I'm pretty sure the "My Discussions" tab only shows the replies to a topic that you made yourself. And you would have no reason to have this post in your subscriptions. Case re-opened.

Why would your "friend" crawl though the forums to that post and do that...?&nbsp;<b>You</b>&nbsp;are responsible for your account and actions here not your "friend". My advice? Just apologise for the bump and don't do it again. At the moment you are just digging a grave for yourself.<br><br>EDIT: Yup. BOSS_Turtle just blew a hole in your lie. Want a shovel?
