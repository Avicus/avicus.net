Hello there Avicus staff and users. I would like to request further information and advice&nbsp;regarding the ban of the account Auzeru. Auzeru is my other account. I was informed that I was banned for speed hacking. I have photo proof that I wasn't hacking if you look at the times the screenshot was taken. The reason I moved as fast as I did was because I used the technique in which you run in a space that is 2 blocks high and mash the space bar in order to sprint jump extremely fast. It is a normal part of vanilla minecraft and has been since the addition of sprinting. I would like to hope that this is resolved soon, as I am a long time fan and player of the Avicus (or skywars ) server. Thank you in advance.<br><br>-Auzeru

Thanks for informing us, but please email support@avicus.net as an appeal. &nbsp;Posting it on the forums does absolutely nothing to fix it.
