Staff & Community Development Update

Hey all,<br><br>The Administration Team has decided to give you guys weekly updates on what the staff team is up to. We've divided our work to focus on one or two projects per week, and we'll alternate which one of us makes this post each Sunday.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Policy/Rule Updates:</b><br>We've focused this week on reworking and adding some policies and rules due to complaints and suggestions from users. They can be seen in <a href="https://avicus.net/forums/be7a9d6a4" rel="nofollow" title="Link: https://avicus.net/forums/be7a9d6a4">this</a>&nbsp;thread.<br><br><b>Appeal System:<br></b><b></b>Due to the lack of efficiency with our previous appeal system, we've decided to change a few things within it. Thanks to Javipepe for the idea! The details of the system may be seen in <a href="https://avicus.net/forums/598eb0af2" rel="nofollow">this</a>&nbsp;thread.<br><br><b>Staff Assignment System:<br></b><b></b>Senior Moderators have been assigned to specific mentors in order to give them feedback and train them. Mentors have been assigned to groups of mods (between 2-4) in order to do the same thing. Staff members have been working in these groups to improve relations within the team, as well as receive a bit of training and tips.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Moderator Training System(s):<br></b><b>PieZ</b> has developed a training system for Moderators that works in divisions of weeks. Each week, Moderators who have volunteered to participate in this long-term training system will be given a different task/training aspect that is centered towards life and social skills, in order to apply them to their moderation skills as well. <b>GrapeSmoothie&nbsp;</b>has developed a smaller training system focused on general moderation tips that is designed to be brief and to "polish up" moderation skills.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Hack-Detection Training:</b><br>We will be releasing an official hack-dection training group for all staff members. This group will watch over other moderators, and if they feel the moderator needs to improve their skills, they will pull them over and teach them how to detect an assortment of different modifications and hacks. A moderator may also approach the group and request for a training session. This group will consist of&nbsp;<b>PieZ, Stimulating, </b>and<b> Tazz.&nbsp;</b>A Senior Staff member will guide this group.<br><br><b>New Senior Moderators:</b><br>It's about that time, isn't it? We plan to promote a few Moderators to Senior Moderator soon. We have recommendations as to who we would like in the position, but we plan to conduct interviews to see where everyone is at. We will announce the interviews officially soon! :)<br><br><b>Promotions/Demotions/Retirements:<br></b>-<b>SirCyaniide</b> has returned from retirement as&nbsp;<b>Junior Moderator!<br></b>-<b>Auratixx&nbsp;</b>has been reassessed, and has been given&nbsp;<b>Junior Moderator!<br></b>-<b>zero9178&nbsp;</b>has been promoted to&nbsp;<b>Moderator</b>!<br>-<b>DingDeLaDoggo</b> has been promoted to&nbsp;<b>Moderator!<br></b>-<b>Zeusy&nbsp;</b>has returned from retirement as&nbsp;<b>Moderator!</b><br>-<b></b><b>TheTNTPotato</b> has retired from&nbsp;<b>Senior Moderator</b>. :(<br>-<b>MidnightBeats</b> has retired from&nbsp;<b>Administrator</b>. :(<br><br>Oh, remember this? :))))<br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/XIguugT.png"><br><br><br><br><br><br><b><br><br></b><br><br><br><br><b></b>

Great!&nbsp;<br><br>Senior Mod:<br><br>Resepignev. Definitely. One of the kindest and hard working staff I've met who treated me like a friend rather than a random player when I first asked him for help. Couldn't think of anyone better for the role of Senior Mod.

Looks great, just not too please with one or more of the people that will help in the hack detection training. Not going into detail unless asked in pm about who I'm not happy with as I don't believe the person or people are too ready.

The comeback of managers? Let's get it going!&nbsp;<br>Resepignev should be senior, just because he has been a moderator for a long time and has a lot of experience in the field, maybe Jahaj or Jive aswell. Keeping community members updated is a great idea, I'm sure lots of people appreciate that

This new 'system' seems like something that'll cause headaches and unnecessary work loads. On the flip side if it isn't doesn't end up causing issues, the problem becomes the issue of so little work to go around; implying too many staff members.

You can register on the website, you just have to join the "register"-server to get an authentication code.<br><br>There was a post around new year:&nbsp;<a href="https://avicus.net/forums/4fba0121e">https://avicus.net/forums/4fba0121e</a>

<p><b></b>The Mentor Team is around 4-5 moderators I believe, who train newly promoted juniors, for example I was trained by Jive on Saturday just to refresh me and inform me on any new changes since my last appearance in the staff team. The reason they aren't seniors is to just reduce the amount of work I presume. Oh and I heard they can be asked to give their opinion on&nbsp;some topics the senior staff team discussed for further feedback. They might even give votes on staff applications next round, I don't know.</p><p>Don't take anything I've said as an official answer. :P</p>

Guys, I think you'll all agree that we're actually starting to get somewhere now.
