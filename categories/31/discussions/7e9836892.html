Ok, so here in the depths of Avicus, most of us are, say, 12-18. So that means most of us have pretty passed by our *little kid* childhood.<br><br>So...<br><br>I guess this topic is pretty much a place to talk about stuff you watched, or toys you had a child. xD<br><br>I mainly made this because I'm very immature (I can be serious tho T-T). :3<br><br><b>To start off...<br></b><br><u>As a 5 year old my favorite things were:</u><br><br>Watching Max and Ruby<br><br>Watching Planet Heroes and collecting the action figures (they're still buried in my closet somewhere xD) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>SLIP N' SLIDES (I loved those :D)<br><br>Sometimes playing my Wii, I slept over at my cousin's and one my friend's houses. It was fun.<br><br>Collecting Pokemon cards sometimes.<br><br>I had a DS Lite, a DSi (That I wrote badly drawn comics on xD), and now a 3DS.<br><br>I played Golf (still do).<br><br>I built a treehouse with my dad.<br><br>To me as a 6 year old: Webkinz is love, Webkinz is life. (I had 60 something of em' o_o).<br><br>Club Penguin, xD. I had 3 accounts, 1 that I played for a while but got banned, another that I played a LOT on, had Membership on it, and the 3rd I haz no idea why I made it.<br><br>Drawing. :)<br><br>Writing weird short, poorly grammar-ed, misspelled, bad handwritten stories.<br><br>Making up amazing and adventurous stories to people (usually centered around me).

Dude, no body cuddles their teacher, not even kids.&nbsp;<br><br>If someone did that, the teacher could loose their job.<br>They can't even touch a special needs kid to help him put his tie on.

I remember building all kinds of shiz with legos, (Mostly starwars custom built bases) building the automatic doors like a baus, and also building bionicles.<br>I can't remember many of bionicles i built, but i remember one with 6 arms, a spider like bionicle and one that i did not build too long ago. It was the biggest and talles one i ever built, (like 1,5 ft tall) but i destroyed it for parts for my other ones. I still have built a custom scarab from the halo series, it's in the end of my closet. However it could not stand on its own because it was so heavy and it's currently in pieces due to all the boxes shoved against it. I feel kinda bad for it being destroyed because it was my best lego creation yet and it took me days to build. Oh how i hated cleaning my room when i couldn't even see the floor since all the lego pieces were covering it. it took me like an hour to clean it all up. Glad i don't play with legos anymore so i don't have to spend hours of my life just cleaning my room...<br>Well, that sums up my childhood nicely.
