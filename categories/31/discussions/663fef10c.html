I have been playing this game for a very long time and I have come to the decision that now is the best time for me to leave.<br><br>I have been losing motivation to play for a while now and this game isn't enjoyable for me anymore. After taking a break from this game I realized how much of a waste of time it really is and that is why I am leaving.<br><br>I have risen myself in this game as a player who has been able to consistently stay at the top of the competitive scene and for that I am proud of. I have witnessed rise and fall of the staff, players, teams, myself and even the server. And to be really cocky, I feel that I have helped this server more than the majority of people. I rose from an average player to one who has been respectable in both the staff team but also in the competitive scene.<br><br>Sorry to anybody I have been a dick to, but I hope you realize that I'm not a dick to anybody unless they have done something to me or a friend.<br><br>I would like to thank everybody for this experience, all my friends, my teams, my subscribers, and everybody who made this possible. I had originally planned to write a long list saying thank you but if people want a direct thanks they can PM me, I will keep discord for a little while.<br><br>I plan to keep in contact with some of the friends I have made through this game (you know who you are), and I wish everybody here the best of luck.<br><br>I have something to say to you who don't enjoy this game. Why waste your time playing it<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkeDBwsIaZw" rel="nofollow" title="Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkeDBwsIaZw">?</a> If you don't enjoy it you should just stop. This game has gradually grown more and more toxic and doesn't have a spark of enjoyment anymore. Take a break. You will not regret it. <br><br>Goodbye, and thank you. Enjoy yourselves.<br><br><a href="https://youtu.be/2wlABOXlYYk" title="Link: https://youtu.be/2wlABOXlYYk">https://youtu.be/2wlABOXlYYk</a>

All I can really say is thank you, from giving me a chance in Apollo around 2 years ago, to helping Avicus so much. You've stuck by me as a friend on this debatably shitty block game for so long and I really hope we can keep in touch.<br><br>Good luck in the HISTORY GCSE LegOkEeeEe

Hi Lego<br><br>As someone in the community I've always looked up to you as a god avicus pvper. I thank you very much for giving me a chance in Apollo because without it I wouldn't have made so many friends and had so many good memories on a block game. Thank you for giving me a chance at Mapdev it's the position I spend the most time doing on the network...<br><br>Thank you.<br>"lego can I play ninja"<br>"he's got a hacky name so he must be cheating"<br>"will **** on fire"
