Well, what can i say<br><br>It was AMAZING.<br><br>Today was the very first time i ever played nexus, and it was great, i dont have to worry about bridging anymore, or monument breaks, its just PvP for 10 straight minutes. I played it so much today infact, that i got over 1,500 kills in 24 hours.<br><br>And as for everything else, such as the new nebula maps, and avicade...<br>They're amazing, it brings a breath of fresh air when i play nebula and Avicade is for when i need to relax a bit.<br><br><br>All i have left to say is, Im excited for the future of avicus at this point.

I agree! Nexus was really fun, and soon there may be new players to play with :). I also found some MCZone players come back already!
