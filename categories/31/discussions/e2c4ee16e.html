Well, you all know my HIDEOUS inactivity, I think you can now mark me as:<br><br>Left User....<br><br>I don't play Avicus anymore due to the repetitive and easy-going gaming, I have moved on to more advanced games like Robocraft, League Of Legends, Euro Truck Simulator 2, WATCH_DOGS and play Minecraft A LOT less. I think this is the end of the line...<br><br>Everyone, since MCZone I have had a BLAST, it was fun, exiting and enthusiastic, but I think it's just gotten dry.<br><br>I will go on the forums every few days, weeks or so, BARLEY at all go in-game.<br><br>I don't expect sadness, I am thanking the users who made me have a lot of fun.<br>You know who you are.<br><br>Good day, and good bye.

I so agree with you. The game modes I like to play are not doing well at all. Very few games going most of the time and most of my friends have gone. Seems like lots of people didn't take well to the Mczone to Avicus switch.<br><br>See ya around.
