Just because he isn't a staff member doesn't mean he's "thirsty" for his staff app. &nbsp;He can help out the community if he wishes. Lay off, guys.

There is no reason to hate on him, he is creating an informative (and needed)&nbsp;post to help out banned members of the community.<br><br>Sure this could have been made by a staff member, but there is almost no difference.

I'd guess the reason Nolan said that is staff member posts are more official regarding something like this. <br>Nothing bad being a regular player. But, staff have the official word :P<br>
