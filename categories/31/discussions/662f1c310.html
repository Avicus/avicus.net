I agree, it's ridiculous, as that is helpful info. Don't try to avoid the issue people.&nbsp;<br><br>If a long-time (now ex) Sr. Staff member says it's stupid and it should be unlocked, that says something

Maybe we're talking about completely different things. I was talking about the person that posted the DDoS thread, since it is the exact same case, minus the Web Ban. Sorry!

IvifetitaYT made a simlar thread like the poster. He also didn't gave any credit. But the only different is, ivifetitaYT got webbanned.

<i>Why do you guys care? </i>: Because this is our forums, not <b>Reddit</b>. The forums has rules too, and creating more and more topics complaining and just discussing about this isn't going to change anything. Anyways, it was not necessary to harass me on alternate accounts last night after you were punished accordingly for spawn blocking. Not locking this topic would just create a flame war, and we want the forums to look clean and formal to newcomers, not complaint threads like this. Please do not create <b>another</b> forum post regarding <b>this</b>.

If we don't enforce rules, no one will feel comfortable.&nbsp;<br>You should know the rules off by heart, Nolan because you have been an experienced staff member.<br><br>It just disgusts me to see this type of behavior practiced by previous staff members.
