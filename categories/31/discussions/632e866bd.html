Hello, thank you for viewing this post and hopefully taking the time needed to read this!<br>First off, I would like to readdress and identify the uses of reporting (/report and other reportings in and out of Minecraft) through some various explanations.&nbsp;<b>Reporting is very essential to the operation for the entire moderating portion of the staff team</b>. It is used for <u>keeping the community clean of cheating, verbal harassment, and many more objectionable offenses</u>&nbsp;that we like to prevent from taking place throughout Avicus.&nbsp;<br>------------------------------------------------<br><b>Part-taking in Reporting&nbsp;(in-game)</b><br><br>-Personally, I have seen many times (currently/recently and in the past) of people not wanting to participate in the use of /report. <u>If you are one of the people who are reading this and you refuse to use it, yet continue to openly accuse the other individual of the offense, it is essential that you do. As the staff highly suggests that you use it for the problem you are having with that other player!<br></u>------------------------------------------------<br><b>Publicizing Your Accusation/Claim (in-game)<br></b><br>-More times than not, most players will openly publicize someone cheating and if this is you, I hope you could possibly refrain from this aswell. <u>The staff is here to help ANYBODY who needs it and without some of the community not taking advantage of this critical command</u><u> we cannot fully change the situation you are facing.</u> (there are exceptions of course [notifying of advertisement, spam etc. to a staff member who has returned from being AFK])<br>------------------------------------------------<br><b>Be <u>Sure</u> When Reporting&nbsp;(in-game)</b><br><br>-When you have run into this player/individual who you believe is breaking a rule(s) and that can be applied with report standards, please be near positive this person is doing what you are concluding to. If you are <u>positive</u>&nbsp;to your report, this allows the staff team to take care of your situation efficiently and securely without an issue!&nbsp;<br>------------------------------------------------<br><b>Reporting off of Minecraft (TeamSpeak)</b><br><br>-If you find yourself outside of Minecraft on TeamSpeak and you run into someone being verbally abusive, criticizing sexual orientation, bashing religion, DDoS/Swat/DOX threats, and/or "intense" trolling, then <u>you need to report it to a staff member that can either be found on Skype or on TeamSpeak, as soon as possible.&nbsp;</u><br>------------------------------------------------<br><b>-Recording for Reporting (self explanatory)&nbsp;<br>This provides for solid evidence when reporting! (MAKE SURE IT IS CLEAR AND THOROUGH)<br>------------------------------------------<br></b><b>-Refer to the rules to be sure of what offense could be reported (Avicus.net &gt; Support &gt; Rules)!<br>------------------------------------------<br>If you need any clarification please leave a reply down below and ANY suggestions that apply to this post, I will add in to this post as needed!<br>------------------------------------------<br>THANK YOU FOR BEING A PART OF AVICUS NETWORK!</b><b><br></b>

Totally helpful for new players but I'm not sure if new players get into the forums right when they join the server.<br>Thanks for it anyway, it was really needed.

Not necessarily for new players, it can essentially apply to a diverse amount of old and new. A refresh never hurts?

Old players tend to know all this so I don't think they need this post anymore.<br>It's pretty helpful anyway.

Nice post! But I already made a post about this a few days ago... the only difference is that you added about teamspeak and that little part where it was saying to be positively sure that they are breaking the rules<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://avicus.net/forums/ae6b2218a">http://avicus.net/forums/ae6b2218a</a><br>Other than that, nice post!

There is already a post like this (look at vlads reply). Almost everyone that is recently posting in the forums knows for what and how to use the report system. And the underlining text parts are very annoying and it's hard to read.
