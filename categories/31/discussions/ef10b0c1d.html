Fancy, yet undeserved.<br><br>you say your tournament process needs some work. I beg to differ, I think it needs A LOT of work.&nbsp;<br><br>Our team got third place in this tournament without winning a single match. We played two matches and lost them both, but managed to cling on. A team in the semi-finals was dq-ed for cheating, I think there were more no-shows than actual matches played.<br><br>Until these problems are addressed, people will not take this network seriously and until you do, do not host another tournament. This one was not very enjoyable.<br><br>sorry, but it had to be said.<br>RIP Insidia<br>RIP Omega Championship<br>Gratz Berzerk<br>Bye

I believe the mistakes in the first tournament was/is a good chance to ensure they don't occur again. As some say, how are we meant to improve if there are no mistakes? We are always looking to improve, and now is the chance for us to do so.<br><br>You wanted a tournament, you got one. Sure it may not have been enjoyable for you, but when you actually tell us to stop planning future tournaments it doesn't help the situation at all.<br><br>For the sake of the community, I'll release what us Officials plan to do in order to improve ourselves, &nbsp;future tournaments and whatnot.

We have a thread for suggestions on improvements for the tournament&nbsp;right over here:&nbsp;<a href="https://avicus.net/forums/7f787b5be" title="Link: https://avicus.net/forums/7f787b5be">https://avicus.net/forums/7f787b5be</a>. I'm sure the Officials and Refs would appreciate your input if you have suggestions, otherwise it's pretty meaningless because they're definitely aware of everything you said there as far as I know.<br><br>Thanks!<br><br>Edit: I see you just posted there, cool.
