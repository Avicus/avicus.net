Hey everyone, i did actually mention this idea minority in a post from a month or two ago and i guess its worth saying more directly;<br>Would it be at all possible to have a 'Goodbye Posts' or 'Leaving' section of the forums?<br><br>I have absolutely nothing wrong with goodbye posts because they are a way of explaining your journey and letting your reason and emotion out toward the community about the server, but i think that coordinating your way to finding out who's leaving and what they have to say would just be another aspect of organising the forums a little better.<br><br>Thanks - OPTOBAT

Yeah, this would be good. It'll reduce the amount of spam and we could easily see who has left.<br><br>+1

Yeah, as the others said.. having a section dedicated to just players leaving would be pretty much screaming defeat.

That would make us look pathetic :P It would be bad if some new person joined the forums and noticed 1000 topics on people leaving....

<span>Personally, I don't like all of these topics some players (<i>I won't namedrop, if you feel offended in some way, good for you</i>) </span>create for every video they upload on Youtube. "Episode 1", "Episode 2", "Episode 3" and so on. I would like the staff to be more strict when it comes to this and in my opinion I would like the staff to only allow <i>one</i> topic per player/Youtube account where you only can bump your topic when you upload a new video.

This is a good idea.<br><br>The "Goodbye Section" of the forums could not appear on "Recent Discussions"; it would be like the "Teams" section. This would reduce the spam, and would allow players to see who is leaving, by visiting said category.<br><br>You have my support in this.

No, there is a "Media" section on the forums, which actually encourages players to make more videos on this server, because they know that they can post it on the forums. If you had a YouTube channel, you would understand what I'm trying to say.

For someone like me who haven't subscribed to you or even follow you, I would like to not see all these spam-topics about your youtube or your new video where you talk about sexual abuse with minors. I understand a lot of players here actually wants to become big on youtube but that won't happen if you post stuff like that or create facebook, twitter, instagram, etc accounts about it. You have to be different in order to become something in the youtube world, be unique, there's already sooooo many people playing minecraft on there. I had a channel with over 13 + million views and many many subscribers, I know you won't become famous if you spam forums, facebook, twitter, instagram, with status updates about your new videos. If you're different you will become something, we as viewers will want to see more.

-1.<br><br>Each category in the Avicus forums are meant to cover a multitude of topics, for example, 'Official News' contains all official Avicus news, not just specific ones pertaining to one topic.<br><br>'Gaming' is for all types of gaming, not just one genre.<br><br>There doesn't need to be a dedicate category, and they're technically against the rules anyways.
