OMG I thought I got forum banned since I'm already banned for no reason. Is this the cause for why the page didn't load?<br><br>EDIT: The Avicus Homepage as is said the server had an error loading it on Saturday or something.

As you can see the title that as it states. I'm sure it's just about people thinking that Avicus was closing down when it wasn't. I'm sure it's just a misunderstanding.

Someone hacked into Howsie's account, and posted a topic titled "Avicus is closing" or something along those lines, and stickied the topic. The post looked really official as well, saying that because of Mojangs EULA, Avicus would have to close down.

A while ago, Howsie's account was broken into, at that time, the /avicus (Administrator Commands) were broken, but they worked fine on the Avicore testing server, which was left up when Funky was home.<br><br>The hacker got the Avicore IP, and preceded to give many Overcast admins including themselves Owner and Mod ranks, taking down the staff page at the same time.<br><br>So, Howsie's account was broken into again, and the hacker posted a fake "Avicus is closing" thread in Official News, it was well written, but had a few holes in it.
