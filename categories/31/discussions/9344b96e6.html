A ban is permanent unless you appeal support@avicus.net.

^ What Pete said.&nbsp;<br>Furthermore, I don't understand why a Moderator&nbsp;<b>needs</b> to answer. This community has many helpful people that aren't mods.

Calm down. It's your own fault you got yourself banned. Send an email to appeal your ban support@avicus.net.

Make an email. It is quick and easy. Then email support@avicus.net explaining why you think you should be unbanned. Then, wait. It is important to have patience.

Maybe it was rude...<br>I wanted to write a reply and the post disappeared -.-<br>Well it was rude, but true. If you want to leave, then leave. A leaving post is annoying in my opinion. A "I'm back" post is better :D. He&nbsp;criticized Emerald, because he did his job. I think he is rude and not you.

Your ban was a permanent ban. If you email&nbsp;<b>support@avicus.net&nbsp;</b>and make a nice, well thought out appeal, and you also are a productive forum member in the time being, you have a shot getting unbanned.
