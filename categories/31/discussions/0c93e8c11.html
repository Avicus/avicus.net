Im talking about Perm. Bans for having a lot of infractions. I had seen two cases of this and i think its ridiculous to Perm. Ban someone for this.<br><br>So, why Perm. Bans for having a lot of infractions (16 i think) isn't automatic?<br><br>Another thing is that players needs to be warned about this before they get the 16th infraction.<br>~<i><b>Netux</b></i>

I thought at Infraction 20 it will be automatic. I think it's good, because you did many mistakes and then it is enough. It prevent the player to&nbsp;harm the Network.

Anymore than 9 should be enough to be pb'd. if you break the rules more than 3 times, you know the rules but chose to disobey them. Thats an attitude we can't have here

True Words, but I think when you break the rules 3 times in one or two weeks, you'll be banned. Or if you have 3 TempBans = Permanentban, after another infraction.

You should have been banned 1 page of infractions ago. You obviously didn't learn your lesson the first time hence why this automatic system should be implemented

+1 For the Automaticsystem, it would be better for the staffs. No dicussions with them about that. They don't have to waste their time for that.

I know, but it would e great if you can remove some infractions after a specific time. And if a player do very much for the Network, then the automatic system will be expanded to 30 infractions for that player.

Wait. I think the multiple infractions means that you did something way too many times that you should be banned.&nbsp;<br><br>I guess in a way it's just that the server can't "trust" you anymore.

I agree, the infractions should automaticly appeal themselfs after 4 months, unless it was a tempban or a permban or a web(temp)ban. Plus some of mine are misunderstandings and false, so that would be a plus to me and other people that had to go through what I've been through.
