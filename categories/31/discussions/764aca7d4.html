Most likely because everyone — or at least a larger population — will have a higher chance of knowing them. Wouldn't it be rather awkward having a poll in which the only available options are those for obscure or lesser-known players? Then again, this is only one of many ways of analyzing a subject as multifaceted as this...

We say we want Avicus to grow as a server and as a community, still we don't give recognition to the "less-known" players who actually are a part of what Avicus&nbsp;is today. We can't just stare ourselves blind at the fact that Avicus needs new players, different faces and a better reputation than it has right now, otherwise Avicus will not grow as we want it to and I don't expect new players to stay either. We can't just get twenty new moderators and think Avicus will change,&nbsp;it doesn't matter if you so would have fifty new moderators, we players&nbsp;make&nbsp;Avicus&nbsp;what it is, we need to think&nbsp;of how we behave and act when it comes to both less-known and well-known players.&nbsp;I just played for a month but when I started playing on Avicus I did feel welcomed and I felt appreciated,&nbsp;this server was different in someway, after a short amount of time, it was litterly a couple of days, I got attacked and harrased. Is this the reputatiion and growth we want to see in Avicus? I know some people won't agree with me, but this&nbsp;occurs even from the staff and we can't really&nbsp;miss the obvious fact that this actually is happening. I said it before and I will say it again, you are allowed to disagree with me and I'm not here to gain friends or respect, if you don't like me you can&nbsp;add&nbsp;me on Skype and we'll talk instead of spamming&nbsp;the forums about it.&nbsp;(It's mostly directed to DaGoldBrick).
