Hey,<br><br>Does anyone know when Avicus will have another map testing event? I see lots of maps being submitted but no date as to when we will be testing / placing them into rotation. I know we have a post that says a new date will be announced, but its been a while ...<br><br>Walls -<br><br>I played a lot of walls when the kits / maps were fairly new, but have really stopped playing because I know the maps so well that there is nothing fresh to learn. Also, with the kits, only a few are useful to me, so it gets repetitive without new content - just my opinion.<br><br>I do see people that used to be almost 100% walls - like myself, branching into other game-modes just to have something to do. I remember when walls had a few large groups of friends that would be on almost all the time, now that group has gotten very small. I know there could be many reasons for this, but I am thinking walls just needs some attention. It is the 2nd most played game mode, and has a very limited number of maps people like, ( 8 without jungle) even CTH has 9 maps, Nexus has 15 and nebula has many, many... in rotation. &nbsp;So with that said, any info would be great.<br><br>Thanks for reading

Last time it was cancelled because of something to do with IvyCode, so since he is away atm I imagine nothing can be done until he returns whenever that may be.

Please stop complaining about walls. We're doing all we can and us map developers are getting pressured so much because of these threads. Every moment we have we collaborate and attempt to help fix up the gamemodes and give them equal attention -- however Walls is the most complex because it needs several people to test it, needs lots of YAML checks, to make sure all the items are appropriate (some maps had this issue such as labeling items drugs or sex). Walls is getting it's attention, we slacked before but we're giving it our absolute best.<br><br>Please be patient. I may open up the MapDev server to test these walls maps but I don't want to create false hope like the event was. <b><i>Give us time.</i></b>

I really don't think I have anything else to say on the subject then. I was not rude or adding any kind of "pressure" but thanks for the information none the less.

Lol, I'm sorry I think I'm a criminal for the inappropriate items :p. &nbsp;But thanks avicus team for trying to give the gamemodes equal attention! &nbsp;I'm glad to here that there is talk of improvement! Keep up the good work!
