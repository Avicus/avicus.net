<b>`Civilian</b> - A good starter Kit <br></span><span><b>`Cow </b>- A fun Kit, but the grass does not add much if any to the food saturation level, So once you eat, you pretty much got to keep eating - like a cow, lol.I suggest adding more saturation to the effect of eating grass. `&nbsp; <br></span><span><b>`Miner </b>- Useless - Why would you pick this kit if you could get civilian? This should be upgraded to an Iron Pick. `&nbsp; <br></span><span><b>`Engineer</b> - This is&nbsp; kit is ok, but also give this class an Iron Shovel - to help make traps and dig so that the engineer can make a base quickly. A wooden bow and arrows or fishing pole would also help this class out and make it more fun. `&nbsp; <br></span><span><b>`Cook</b> - If food is all you need, its fine. I would add a 2nd golden apple to make it a stronger kit and more used. <br></span><span><b>`Monkey</b> - This is a fun kit - I would add 5 more apples as I cut down every leaf on the walls map ( just the starting quad) and found 1 apple. Also , add leather boots with feather falling 1. I got damaged a few times and when I jumped, and the damage kinda got me off track. It would also be fun to be able to jump from a little higher without getting killed - Nothing stronger than feather falling 1 leather.<br></span><span><b>`Warrior</b> - Warriors want to go into battle, Add a golden apple to this kit and a chain chest plate. Ready to go.&nbsp; `&nbsp; <br></span><span><b>`Beast Master</b> - I used the bones and could not tame all the wolves - add 1 more wolf and 15 more bones. That would make the kit useful IMO.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></span><span><b>`Snowman</b> - This is fine as it is.&nbsp;&nbsp; `&nbsp; <br></span><span><b>`Poseidon</b> -This should be 1 and 1/2 hearts every 2 sec while in water, and should start with a chain Aqua Affinity helmet. The current regen rate makes it where you cannot survive 1 addition hit by an iron sword, making it useless. Adding the AA helmet and increasing the regen rate makes it viable when running away, through water etc to gain some regen. the 1 and 1/2 rate will not give a superior tactical advantage, but it does make it a viable kit. <br></span><span><b>`Lumber Jack </b>- Good Kit -&nbsp; add a fishing pole. <br></span><span><b>`Fire Man</b> - Kit&nbsp; needs a little help - add an 8 min fire res potion ` <br></span><span><b>`Builder </b>- Add 2 doors , 4 glass, 4 saplings, and start this class with a gold axe.<br></span><span><b>`Cookie Monster </b>- 5sec buffs kills the use ability of the kit. buffs should be moved from 5 sec to&nbsp; 1:30 sec of random buffs, getting a different buff for 30 sec every 30 sec. Cookies cant be eaten but every 1:30sec. <br></span><span><b>`Dwarf</b> - This is an ok kit - but should be an Iron Pick <br></span><span><b>`Healer</b> - This is a pretty useless kit: This kit should modify any healing done. So if you drink a healing potion you get 50% more the effect not just the normal effect. This kit should also start with a 2:15 healing potion. <br></span><span><b>`Scout </b>- scout should be a passive 10% speed buff&nbsp;</span></span><span><span><span>`&nbsp;<b>Tank</b> - The leather should have protection 1 on each piece. <br></span><span><b>`Assassin </b>- The potion should be a 6:00min potion atleast&nbsp; <br></span><span><b>`Leech</b> - This kit should award health based on damage done you get back 1 heart for every 4 hearts delt. OR get a 15 sec regen effect when hearts fall below 7.<br></span><span><b>`Stomper</b> - this kit should no longer take fall damage <br></span><span><b>`Wither</b> - This is just a broken kit - having to switch weapons to "maybe" cause it to the wither effect, is not viable in pvp. - Any weapon used should have a 40% change to apply the wither effect.<br></span><span><b>`Bomber </b>- Need to start with 5 bombs and get 1 bomb back every 45 sec, max of 5.<br></span><span><b>`Archer</b> - good kit, should start with a bow that has infinity but can break. <br></span><span><b>`Magician</b> - good kit - no change needed </span></span><span><span><b>` Summoner</b> - This is not really a helpful kit - Remove&nbsp; <br></span><span>`Guardian - Fine as it is, should also start with an Iron sword <br></span><span>`Cowboy<b> </b>- Should start with Iron Horse armor, and 16 wheat&nbsp; <br></span><b>`Barbarian</b> - Broken - This does not fit - Needs Removed.</span></span>

+1 Thanks, Polar!<br>I really like the descriptions of all the kits.&nbsp; I realized that I had never tried some.<br><br>Suggestions:<br>* Don't give iron pick to MINER, too op at that low level; maybe enchanted stone<br>* Give iron pick to DWARF, but have the durability bar at like half life.<br>* MAGICIAN as it is... is too op; half the xp bottles with enchant table<br><br>New Kits:<br>* MAGICIAN'S APPRENTICE - anvil, 2 bookcases, 8 xp bottles<br>* DECORATOR - 4 vases, 4 flowers, 4 painting, 4 item frames, 4 redstone lamps,16 glass panes

Yea - It's hit or miss. &nbsp;The changes I made kinda went with " if all of the changes were made, or most, then the Iron Pick would be ok at a low level. but the stone enchanted is also a good idea.
