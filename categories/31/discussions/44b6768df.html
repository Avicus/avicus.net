I think we should get the best avicus players from every team and combine them into one team that competes in tournaments on different servers (like CTW tournaments on OCN) <br><br>What do you guys think?

I don't believe that's what he meant, saying as he said "Like" CTW tournaments on OCN.<br>An OCN administrator affiliated with Overcast tournaments stated that he would be open to discussion of a tournament if Avicus senior staff contacted him. They never did.

Setting one up would be difficult. One does not simply find the best Avicus players simply. There are some good PvPers who get little recognition, yet are better than all of us Avicus regulars combined. And they play Avicus. So really, making one would be next to impossible. But if you just jumbled together a bunch of good players then I guess it's an OP team.<br><br>But teamwork &gt; Skill

ppl who are on the top 100 should be chosen since they're usually active and they're good but the avicus all star team must have 50 players at least cause some other days there's gonna be a lot of ppl who wont attend the official tournament because of some reasons like on a vacation, accident and etc.

I'd like to point out that this would be impossible, with timezone issues, people not getting on well, lots of problems. You guys all seem to think that stats are everything, it's the teamwork that wins tourneys, and having an 'all star team' would only end up having communication worse than cancer and could be easily beaten by any old team that has none of these 'god pvpers'&nbsp;<br><br>You guys need to actually know how tournaments work before you post.&nbsp;<br>Teamwork and communication &gt; PvP skill

I am just gonna say this even if I sound like an idiot but I am very underated, but in a 1vs1 I can wreck for example Thecalined (Sorry, I used you as an example xD), but recently people have been saying that I am too OP, for example Thecalined, awesome_apricot and other people in other servers (No Advertising)! So yeah, also I rush mainly, this is why my KD is so low. My clicking skills are the best in this server I think, I don't think that anybody can click 30 times per second :P!

Sadly i have to agree with this, also there would have to be special maps designed for the games and a server large enough to hold it with spectators and it is impossible to create a team of "The Best" because there are soSO many underrated people, me amongst them.

This would just be a total mess.&nbsp;<br>First of all, "rusher" isn't really a real position. A rush is when you "rush" the game, aka ending the game within a few minutes.&nbsp;<br>In a tourney environment, a rush won't actually happen that much.&nbsp;<br><br>For offense, it doesn't just matter on pvp skill. A lot of it is based off of strategy.&nbsp;<br>The routes to the monument, the amount of people in a group, whether to tunnel or not, ect.<br><br>There really isn't a "best" 20. It's just people's opinions. Most of the people you picked are just people that are known for being on the server a lot. There are people who are probably better than most of the people on this list, but, they are not known because they do not go on TeamSpeak, talk on the forums much, or talk in-game.<br><br>And to finish off my main post, the communication would just be utter shart. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The main success of your team as a group relies on your communication skills. &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Just my opinion, but I think the communication for this team would just make me die.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;I would not be able to handle it.

I might be able to offer a little insight here.&nbsp;<br>First off, I referee'd the last Overcast tournament and am a referee for the upcoming Mini events.&nbsp;<br>In the last tournament (Breaking Core), there were only one or two successful rushes. A rusher would be a basically useless position after the first five minutes.&nbsp;<br>As for the concept of an all-star team: a little while ago, an Overcast regular by the name of kingoros created an "all-star" team by the name of CoolPVP. It was 45 of the best players on Overcast. They were fantastic. They were skilled. And they disbanded after just a couple of months. Why? Because it ended up being just for fun. Because it would have been utter chaos. You can get a few stars with a bunch of really good people, but the idea of an all-star team isn't practical for something like Minecraft. I'm not saying that it's a bad idea to send a team over to compete in Overcast tournaments, but to just pick "star players" just won't work out in the end for purposes of communication and availability.

The amount of people posting their completely un-informed 'all star team' lists is beyond me. I know a good amount of regulars in this community, through teamspeak, Skype, you name it, and they aren't 'Gods' Nobody is a 'god' I'm not saying these people aren't good or anything, but everyone has flaws. A lot of these 'gods' are loyal to their teams, this would never even happen, don't bother speculating.

@jake<br><br>i have a question. For example, people will only host a tourney a server against a server and another tourney is national tournament just in case minecraft hosted one and we joined and we'll battle vs the world until we reached the finals. But, if people who'll host a tourney or the official minecraft tournament itself said, you should have at least girls with you in your group so how will that system work to choose the female players?

Again, rusher isn't a position, it's incredibly overrated and is pointless after 3 minutes of the game. Suggesting yourself won't do anything either, well being honest, suggesting anyone won't do anything.
