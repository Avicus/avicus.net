This has become a really huge problem recently for me.. Whenever I bridge my blocks just disappear. Is it my lag or a server issue?

Would be on your side. Likely internet. Happened to me when getting 2000+ ping while downloading something.

Wow, Zed. :P<br><br>Anyway, I've had those problems last time. They seemed to disappear though. I know that it was because of anti-cheat or something last time. I think it should be better now.&nbsp;<br>Probably your side?

Its just lag. Seems to be from the server side because a lot of people are getting lag recently (like me that i never get lag on Avicus)

I was once bridging with 2 other people. I think the map name was Frostbite, but it was the one with castles and 4 monumenys on both sides. Anyways,I was bridging eith 2 other people, and at one point, all 3 of us glitched, the block we just placed disappeared, and we all fell. :/

<b>NCP is not back.<br></b>Also there is a plugin called AntiCheat Ivy implemented to the plugin list. Its better than NCP and as i know its not the reason of this problem.<b><br></b>

Happened to me numerous times. Another way it an happen is if a spectator comes along in front of your bridge and when you place it despawns because the spectator is there.

You probably have bad connection. I used to get this alot until we upgraded out Internet speed. It happens when you build during a lag spike or something, and AntiCheat removes the blocks that you placed during the lag spike
