Hello everyone! Continuing from where Crazy left off at, we are at #8 in the Staff Spotlights. Today, the Staff Spotlight is on&nbsp;<img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/2a16deb72e504c33b95d1296151321b9?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/K_R_Cord.html" style="color: #2980b9">K_R_Cord</a>! <br><span><br></span><b>Introduce yourself (4 or more sentences) </b><br><br>My name's Brandon. I am a project coordinator for Disney in California. Australian born and I have a certificate in coding. I am a fan of the Star Wars universe and yes, I will be seeing the new movie on Christmas.<br><b><br>What are your hobbies?</b><br><div><br></div><div>My hobbies change a lot. In Australia I was a very active in sports. I played Rugby and Football(Soccer). Here in America I have found a love for biking. L.A is an amazing place to bike and I love taking new routes every few days. I also like to game. I found a love for Sandbox games. Current games I like to frequent are Subnautica and Starbound. I play Minecraft once in a while and I am currently learning Pokemon from a terrible teacher.</div><div><br></div><b>What are you most </b><b>excited/obsessed over</b><b> at the moment? <br></b><div><div><br></div><div>Excited? Maybe a little off topic, but I don't find myself excited for really anything. It sounds dark but I am happy to wake up. I guess the day ahead of me is exciting. I get to talk to people, go to a job I sometimes love and I learn something new. If it was an event the new Star Wars movie is pretty exciting.&nbsp;<br><br></div></div><div><b>What interests you the most in life? </b><br><div><br></div><div>Knowledge. I like learning something everyday. It may be as little as taking a faster or slower route to work or even learning a new name.&nbsp;<br><br></div><b>What music/art/media do you like? <br></b><div><br></div><div>Led Zepplin is always a great sound to go back on. Not really an arts guy. I like to consume all types of media. I mainly like Sci-Fi books though.<br><br></div><b>What’s your </b><b>favourite thing about being the Head of the Social Media team? </b><br><br><div>The ability to work on a project with PieZ again. Nothing against anyone else on the team but any work I have done with some of my closes friends is always a gift and even if he isn't the smartest person in the world he is always amazing to have around.&nbsp;<b><br></b><br></div><b>What’s your most memorable experience as a Social Media team member?<br><br></b>Can't really say there was one huge memorable part of being in this team. I just do a job everyday and learn off of it.<br></div>

Kord is a legend. This was the most professional spotlight I've read. Well done, Kord.

Pie is a terrible teacher for this game. 50% of it is insulting me, 45% of it is insulting me for not knowing the game and 5% of it is teaching me the name of the things. I am still learning the types.
