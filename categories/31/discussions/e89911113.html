</h1>
Who would be interested in purchasing&nbsp;an Avicus t-shirt or sweatshirt? Both would likely be available for limited time and be placed at&nbsp;anywhere from $10 to $15 for a t-shirt and $15 to $25 for a hoodie. I need to get an idea of the demand for merchandise before we consider offering it.<br><br>Not sure what the design would be which is where I'd like your input as well. Here's a boring one, but still an option had I added text that reads "Avicus Network" or "avicus.net":&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://i.imgur.com/pLcYgEY.png">http://i.imgur.com/pLcYgEY.png</a><br><br>

Good idea!&nbsp;<br>However, I think it would be cooler if it had the avicus logo instead of the AV since it is kinda plain

My thoughts too detty. I think an "AV" logo is great for hoodies especially. If it is possible you could make another T-Shirt with the shield on it. I think that the "AV" would also look better as black writing on a white background. However i would buy one of these.

Same dilemma I have;&nbsp;I like the simplicity of the AV, but it doesn't do much to represent the server. I think a small Avicus Network wouldn't be too intruding. Having the name of the server is a minimum I'd say since we're not as big as Nike or Apple yet.<br><br><br><i>yet</i><br>

I love the subtle&nbsp;<i>yet</i> XD<br><br>My opinion is an "AV" in the centre of the t-shirt/jumper, then maybe "Avicus Network" where you would usually find a Nike or Adidas logo at the top right/left of the shirt. It wouldn't be too big, just like a logo :D
