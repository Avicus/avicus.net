<i></i>I understand why I was demoted, their was&nbsp; many things I put in front of Avicus so that I can moderate and play with my friends. A lot of things that's family based. I practically spend 15 hours a day Playing Minecraft, about 10 hours of Avicus and 5 hours of over servers, 7 of those hours I&nbsp;mainly search out for rule breakers (During Vacation). Whenever I was on probation for a week, I tried my hardest for online reports and in-game. I wont be leaving the community anytime soon, and <b><i><u>im not Applying for staff again.</u></i></b> This server has a very good community and I'm glad to have that.<br>EDIT: I don't feel like typing much right now since their is too much to explain how it was from my position.<br><br>S<span>incerely,<br>Emmy &lt;3<u></u></span>

Wow! That's ridiculous. I was talking to Emerald one day and he told me he was on the verge of getting demoted. I was like "What the heck?!?!?!? You are one of the best mods ever!" He always answers my reports and a few days ago 2 whole infraction pages were filled with his bans/kicks/warns/tempbans, all of it! I think it was a stupid decision to demote him. I don't know who demoted him but I think it was a bad decision. I respect the staffs decision but I thought Emerald was a great mod and did not deserve the demotion. I broke my keyboard like Tino. So now I can't type anymore im soaduoiweufpiwuergfhawrhfaworhg[oawre;jeiogjsdkgfjvks vjw4orioergioergj....

Like with all the other moderators (including me xP) you had your ups and downs. Sadly most people dont know how many downs any of the moderators have.<br>I do agree with everyone that you had some good times as an efficient moderator, but at most times it just didnt happen.<br>It was nice with you as a mod, but I know it will be nice with you as an awesome player in the community. Continue being as shiny as en emerald ;)
