You might agree or disagree with me on this but I believe the tournament silver or gold or bronze medalist rank does not need to be required especially with the last tournament not going extremely well.&nbsp;<br><br>Also the grey colour does not look good on forums especially for non-donors like me I'd rather just have no tournament rank at all and would prefer just my name on the forums. And it is an extremely long rank which looks disgusting...<br><br>P.S: I know people asked for this a long time ago when tournament ended but I want to get it out there to the devs or whoever manages the forums.<br><br>No hate pls I want to know what the public thinks about this rank on the forums :) thanks

A different one for each tournament would be good, make them small though so you could try and stack them up.<br><br>@Juanoh Possibly, different text would help though

No, because once you lose in that tournament you're no longer champion

You have still won a tournament though, even if you lose the next one your victory should still be recognised. Something like ToC Gold or if the name of the tournament was, say, conquest, the rank would be: Conquest Gold.&nbsp;<br><br>I dont know, just an idea.

Remove them because they remind me that I have no friends outside of PPB. They say it is because I insult them but I really say if you can't handle a joke about your skin colour then don't run for office.

Bragging rights means nothing because:<br><br><ol><li>We sound salty if we brag</li><li>Some people don't consider it a proper tournament due to the flaws</li><li>We're just seen as the team that won because of a cheap DQ</li></ol>

Just give a rank to the winners. tbh i dont really like the long, grey, boring tag. There should be one in a colour that stands out, saying TOC Champ, or for the next tourney CTW Champ. Another idea, is to have just Tourney &nbsp;Champ as a rank.

It's nice to see all of your guys opinions but do you guys think try should just remove the rank until the next tournament? That way everything is easier or you can remove the "tournament silver medalist or bronze medalist" and just keep tournament champion because that is shorter ?

You can do Omega Gold, Omega Bronze, and Omega Silver. &nbsp;That way they can keep it and new comers get the names of whatever the next tourney
