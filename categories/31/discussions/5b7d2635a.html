Hi,<br>I know staff apps aren't open, but I have a question regarding the Skype interviews.<br>I'm not allowed to talk to others I don't know on Skype, will that be a problem with staff apps?<br>When the time comes, I would like to apply, as I can submit a post, but I just need this question answered first.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Sky

If you are able to speak with people you don't know one time and never do it again, like call one time to do the interview, so, it's okay. But if you aren't able to speak with unknown people IRL on skype totally, so, that's a little problem.

Yeah, I can't actually speak&nbsp;<b>at all</b> with people I don't know on Skype. Because my parents are cyber-safety crazy.

I'm afraid without any verbal communication being the interview you may not become a staff member. You could just do it and tell them that it's one of your friends. And interviews are mainly done over teamspeak.

But you have the option to do the regular interview,&nbsp;<b>TeamSpeak 3 interview(es)&nbsp;</b>are very good, you don't need to add anyone on skype... but wherever you are, you will need talk too, sorry :/.<br>Just hide the true to your parents, if you are so surely for want be a staff member.<br><br><br><br><i>EDIT: Cupcakie ninja'd xD</i>

You will be needing to talk over TeamSpeak when the time for interviews will come. It's important to talk. I think Skype is used only if you really cannot access TeamSpeak at that time. I'm not quite sure.

I believe that you have to be able to speak to other people on the internet if you want to be a Moderator. It's mainly so the Mods can communicate easily. Are you allowed TeamSpeak?

<u></u>But when it comes to it, try to convince your parents first, because lying isn't really the best option..

Interviews are supposed to be done on Teamspeak, but since zieno's teamspeak mic doesn't work the staff interviewed him on skype.<br><br>And yes, you do need to talk, I have never seen any exception. It's much harder to lie while talking with voice to the staff then to lie while typing.
