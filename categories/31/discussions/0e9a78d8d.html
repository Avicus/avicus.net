Throwback Map Reassessment

<u><b></b></u>Hello,<br><br>As you know, we've recently just had a throwback map 
reassessment. The current throwback maps have either been left <b>Unchanged</b>, <b>Edited</b> or <b>Removed</b>. <br><br>We are going to spread the throwback maps onto
 the other DTM servers. The main reason for doing this is so that hopefully more people will get a chance to play on other maps and game modes. Let's be truthful, alot of the current throwback maps aren't enjoyable to play and have bad gameplay. Although the community will uproar because of throwback's changes, it still needs to be done in order to make progress.<br><br><b><u>Maps Removed:<br><br></u></b><ul><li><a title="Link: http://i.imgur.com/g20O4al.png" rel="nofollow" href="http://i.imgur.com/g20O4al.png">Abandoned Park 1</a></li></ul><b></b>-The map was very difficult to defend on and usually ended quickly.<br><br><ul><li><a title="Link: http://i.imgur.com/ujsQo4Y.png" rel="nofollow" href="http://i.imgur.com/ujsQo4Y.png">Fantasy</a></li></ul>-The map was very big and laggy, favoring one team to the other.<br><br><ul><li><a title="Link: http://i.imgur.com/VMd54O3.png" rel="nofollow" href="http://i.imgur.com/VMd54O3.png">Crusade</a></li></ul>-The map was either very stalematey, ended quickly or was a killfarm mess.<br><br><ul><li><a title="Link: http://i.imgur.com/glSXzX7.png" rel="nofollow" href="http://i.imgur.com/glSXzX7.png">Honeycomb</a></li></ul>-The map had confusing gameplay and was extremely hard to defend on.<br><br><ul><li><a title="Link: http://i.imgur.com/ql5JCha.png" rel="nofollow" href="http://i.imgur.com/ql5JCha.png">Frostbite</a></li></ul>-This map was very stale and had alot of killfarming.

We decided to keep halcyon the same because if edited the map would play and feel different. Many players like it how it is and if it's a problem in the future we will change it ;)

Agh you read it wrong, my fault<br><br>you know when you jump and place a block below your feet? That used to be possible on formorgar and it was overpowered.

Please listen to this guy. At least make Formogar monument islands block placable. It was really hard to push because you're very visible in the area and it's going to be very hard to get a mon now because you can't even block yourself.

I'm happy you've listened to the community and have reverted Quintus. The widened channel was a really good edit, the changes that created uproar was the monument amount being decreased.&nbsp;<br><br>The other edit was the armour chest, I know there were 8 diamonds blocks per team, but it's literally impossible to be in full diamond unless you kill an opponent with diamond armour.&nbsp;<br><br>Great&nbsp;work MapDevs! :)

Formorgar's spawn is harder to shoot from now. The underground block is Quartz so defense is quick to mine now.<br><br>Rendezvous 2 is being worked on by Crimson Aught, if he gives up it'll be removed<br><br>Quintus, we don't know yet ;c

Although you don't know much about Quintus yet, could you bring back the 5 monuments, I mean it was the only map with 5 monuments....<br><br>I think removing the monuments are&nbsp;<b>BAD</b> it now looks like every single map just has 2 or 3 monuments, it can get boring if there aren't any unique maps as in the objectives

Eyo, saw this and here are my opinions.&nbsp;<br><br>Most changes are good and great work but the only map I don't like is Formogar.<br><br>If you're going to make the monument islands non block placable, heres what I say.<br><br>1- Make islands close to the monument (where the diamonds are particularly) bigger and more flat.&nbsp;<br><br>2- Give us more iron and make both islands bigger or just make a big chunk of iron at the back.<br><br>3- Either make the monument islands farther away from both the spawn and diamonds island, make it so only the parts where most people just placed a block underneath on (the walls) and the roof aren't block placable and make the insides block placable or make a way to somehow help people push because I feel like the map will be extremely stale mate if we keep it like this.<br><br>Also, for Quintus just make mons a bit closer and give 2 diamond blocks more to each team..

I think throwback, because of its name, should have all the old maps and they shouldnt be removed or edited because of gameplay. a lot of the removed/edited ones were favorites, and now aren't.

Feel it'd also make sense to say that Throwback's original purpose was to, as the name suggests, serve as a way for older players to feel nostalgic when they played the maps. Since Throwback became the most played server and has been for the past couple years, it no longer serves that purpose, therefore the only thing it really does is make new players/returning players see Avicus as a network of lower quality than it actually is, due to Throwback being the first server that a lot of players join for the first time.<br><br>Needless to say, I think all of us will greatly appreciate the changes once Atlas is released. However, it would be neat if there were copies of the original, unedited maps in the repo to be setnexted, so that they can eventually serve the true purpose of the Throwback server/maps. They wouldn't be setnexted anytime soon, but it'd be nice for those that genuinely appreciate those maps for their history.

If you guys are removing Throwback and expect people to play on DTM servers expect lots of complaints about newer maps. Not saying that in a bitchy way or anything.

Yeah I know but because DTM servers are going to be played people will start noticing flaws on other maps. But you fixed the problem already for the most part anyways.
