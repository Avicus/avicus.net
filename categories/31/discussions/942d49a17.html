It doesn't mean you need to leave. As DaBader said, I think you should&nbsp;stay and try to improve yourself. In the end it's your decision, but I hope you think it through and don't do anything rash.

Don't leave for something as stupid as that.<br><br>Just because you made a mistake and someone pointed it out doesn't mean it's the end of the world. It's completely irrational to now think everyone hates you because of one small incident.

I haven't really ever seen you in game or contacted you but judging from what I have seen on the forums you really don't seem like a bad/annoying person at all! It's sad to see avicus regulars go so please dun go because of one person's opinion on you. You don't annoy everyone or bother everyone :/ Take criticism as ways to improve yourself instead of giving up. You won't be friends with everyone but don't give up on the ones you have now :)

Cya in a week or two.<br><br>But seriously I am sick to death of people leaving and usually leaving in a big drama and then coming back a week or two later. This goes for staff too which I think is sort of worse than a regular player doing this.<br>If you are going to make a big fuss about leaving then leave. Don't come back a few weeks later like "OMG GUISE I MISSED YOU ALL". (this isnt really directed at you OP, just a point in general).<br><br>As for the OP, you have never done anything bad to me and you seem like a cool guy. No one can force you to stay but I think leaving over a silly incident like that is pointless.

Are you three years old? Cyrus, you are leaving because something that one player said (in the defence of another player) that was barely insulting. Just a warning. If a mod had said that would you have taken as much offence? No. You wouldn't. So please grow up.&nbsp;<br><br>But yeah this kind of seems pointless to ask me but if you do go then adios.

This is no reason to leave the forums and Avicus. In my country, if you were to leave over something like this, everyone would laugh, ridicule, and call you a coward.&nbsp;<br><br>There is no reason to leave over what MLGTino said. You acknowledge your faults and try to do better. You need Tenacity! (My newest map BTW.)

It's all about the attention, nothing more, nothing less. I can't see a reason why I should say good bye to someone I haven't even played with once, so&nbsp;why should rest of the members on Avicus do? When I read all these bye posts, it's like the member thinks life is over. It's just a game, nothing&nbsp;changes, if you're not&nbsp;playing here&nbsp;24/7 o.O
