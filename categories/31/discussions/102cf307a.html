Hey everyone, OPTOBAT here and this is my very first OPTOBAT update that i am posting.<br>I am going to post daily/every second day updates on my gaming, feature people and give details on my YouTube channel that i am currently working on.<br><br>In today's update, i would just like to refer to some other posts i made in the Lounge and Media section, BUT also add something i haven't yet mentioned... First of all, this is a little personal but i think i can explain it. I LOVE playing here on Avicus and lately i have been offline for a few days. This is because my grandparents are over and aren't too fond of my computer time, so i am spending time with them, which is fine! So when they go to visit some friends for the day tomorrow, i will have time to visit Nebula and play! But they will be leaving our place on Sunday so i will be well and truly back then! So when i get back, reply or p.m me if you want to play together on a map :)<br><br>and also, another update on the channel which is currently called OPTOBAT GAMING, however i have plans to revert it back down to just OPTOBAT. I would also like to give a thanks to those who took just a few minutes, even SECONDS to have a look at my FRIENDS channel: MiningFlamingo - Minecraft And More. He features how to get your own minecraft skin and has kicked off his very own Nebula series! There will be links below. But my channel will have a link in my OPTO UPDATE #2 as i am in the middle of editing my Nebula trailer for the series, THEN i will begin my own nebula series myself.&nbsp;<br><br>Thanks for reading guys, and PLEASE have a look at MF (MiningFlamingo)'s channel links below.<br>Also, please reply if you have ideas i should add into my channel AND keep in tune for another OPTO UPDATE, as this one was especially long, being my first.<br><br>Thanks Guys, OPTOBAT<br><br>Links:&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVCk3iskzQ6zKP85VYTZOoA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVCk3iskzQ6zKP85VYTZOoA</a>&nbsp;- His channel<br><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lWfbcddamI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lWfbcddamI</a>&nbsp;- 2nd episode - BRAND NEW<br><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBITlOYi93E">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBITlOYi93E</a>&nbsp;- Very first episode!
