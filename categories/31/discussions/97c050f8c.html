To call forth upon the power of Shrek, our lord and our savior.<br>The power of the almighty Shrek will give me the power to bend the will of those around me, cease kings from their thrones, Destroy landscapes made of titanium with my ultimate weapons of destruction, unravel the deepest secrets and fool death on every turn.<br>Muhhahaahaha, you will all one day worship me, the right hand of Shrek, and of course Shrek too, that is. But before that, i will be tending to Shrek, for he is weak, but every passing moment he is getting stronger!<br>(Btw, this is a joke, i hope i didn't scare anyone)... (or was it a joke? &gt;:)...)

Hmm... the ability to be invisible and walk through walls and stuff. It would basically cover all these other powers... want to fly? Steal a plane. TPing to monuments (which I want to do so bad)? Just walk straight through everybody. You could do so much with it. Though I might have to kill @Lyyris first... I want to be special x_x Oh and I should also get teleportation, it kinda comes with being an enderman right? Enderman fo LIFE

Either teleportation or flying. Teleportation so I would never have to go to school, or I can easily get stuff I want by teleporting it to me. Flying because it'd be cool to just soar next to the clouds.

Too bad Shrekism is already recruiting members, i have already gotten a volunteer to be Shrek's left hand. Soon, everyone will turn to Shrekism. Now i only need more people to turn to Shrekism and now it is easier that i've gotten Shrek's left hand. Every member joining our religion makes Shrek pleased and happy. And after you die, you will be punished for not accepting Shrek as our lord and our savior. You will be anally raped by Shrek for all eternity if you do not accept Shrek into your heart. But if you do accept Shrek into your heart, after you die, you will access Shrek's might kingdom, THE Swamp, and you will be in Shrek's bliss for all eternity. Also, if you have accepted Shrek into your heart, you will be told by Shrek (after you die) how the universe truly came to be.<br>Choose wisely. Oh and the "Gru" is total bs. Yeah, totally. Even tho i don't even know anything about it. #ReligionLogic
