I'm sure everyone does, but the thing is, is that we can make new memories. :) Then these new memories that we are making will once be missed. Enjoy it while it lasts. Sure we miss Mczone, sure that we had fun back then, but we can always make new memories to look back. (: Change can be good.

Think of mczone as an old friend that passed away. Avicus is your new best friend and you need to move on from the past and make great memories with your current best friend.

I loved MCZone! :D I used to play on that server for hours. When Avicus came out, it just didn't feel the same. Anyway, time to start anew!

I love Avicus, because in mcZone all I did was play Skywars and Nebula and never talked to anyone well until I met Hughsie then I decided to be more open, but that fully happened on Avicus.
