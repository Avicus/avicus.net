<span style="color: rgb(115, 127, 141); font-family: Whitney, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  ">1. Using community servers as scrim when told not prior
2. Kicking players from scrim servers instead of uninviting  - Demotion reasons
3. Poor behavior for a staff member
</span><span>
1st. (</span><span style="color: rgb(115, 127, 141); font-family: Whitney, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  ">Using community servers as scrim when told not prior)</span><span>

I originally got this warning as Mapdev. However, after I retired from MapDev, Austin </span><i style="color: rgb(115, 127, 141); font-family: Whitney, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  "><b>wanted</b></i><span> to move the warning to a general staff warning (I don't even know why)

Proof: </span>
<span><img src="http://i.imgur.com/o3EOtThg.png" title="Image: http://i.imgur.com/o3EOtThg.png"></span>
<br><span>I'm not going to deny that I did use community servers as the scrim servers were broken at the time. However, I find it rather amusing how "somebody" wanted my MapDev warning to be a general staff warning. No bias at all right?</span>

<span>2nd.</span>
<span>This is false. I have kicked people from scrim servers in the past as the team leaders have specifically requested the certain player to not spectate for whatever reason. However, people with ranks (such as Streamer, Referee) have abused their rank to continuously joined the scrim server when a leader can't do anything because of their rank let's them join scrim servers without inviting them. 
</span><br>2nd (<span style="color: rgb(115, 127, 141); font-family: Whitney, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  ">Kicking players from scrim servers instead of uninviting)</span><br><br><a href="https://avicus.net/punishments/679108" title="Link: https://avicus.net/punishments/679108">https://avicus.net/punishments/679108</a><span> Remy was AFK and we needed somebody to sub in so I had to kick him.</span>
<br><a href="https://avicus.net/punishments/678852" title="Link: https://avicus.net/punishments/678852">https://avicus.net/punishments/678852</a><span> This was on a community server when we were doing a megascrim and he decided to join and just ignored the people telling him to join specs. Hence why I kicked him.  </span>
<br><a href="https://avicus.net/punishments/678274" title="Link: https://avicus.net/punishments/678274">https://avicus.net/punishments/678274</a><span> If I recall correctly, Jaystah joined one of the teams in the megascrim and went AFK so I had to kick him.
<a href="https://avicus.net/punishments/675785" title="Link: https://avicus.net/punishments/675785">https://avicus.net/punishments/675785</a> Same as the 2nd punishment 

3rd (</span><span style="color: rgb(115, 127, 141); font-family: Whitney, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  ">Poor behavior for a staff member)                                      
This is pretty valid as at the time of Eric's demotion from media I defended him when he was demoted by ALM (Owner) I did misbehave and such. But think about it this way, how is it fair for someone who isn't even head of media or whatever to demote them because they're owner and have all the powers and no-body can stop them.                                                                                                                </span><span>

yeah no there was way more besides this. Kid let his power get to his head &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "streamers and referees abusing their rank" You might want to recollect the data you have there sir, a person with this rank joining for less than a minute to check out what's going on or to see if its the server they belong to. I quite often do it to see which servers are online and which aren't. Abuse is when you move people out of teamspeak channels without permission, kick them, tell people they can use community servers when the owner clearly said you are not allowed to, and respond "I don't care" when someone confronts you about it. Kicking people over and over for "leave" because you have your little mod powers after they have permission to stay. Also sneaking around in PM asking the leaders to tell players to leave because you don't want them there. I was probably kicked by you three times all abusing your permissions.<br><br><br>L

Just so you're aware, your staff warnings and demotion were not decided by one single person alone. The entire Senior staff team discussed and reached this conclusion together.<br><br>I'll post more in a bit to outline anything you aren't clear of, like the first warning - which if I recall correctly I explained why you had it when I gave you the warning.

Okay, let's just start off by saying I was not there for any of the situations, so this response is based off what Ryan has stated.<br><br><i>"</i><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><i>(</i></span><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(115, 127, 141); font-family: Whitney, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><i>Using community servers as scrim when told not prior)</i></span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><i>&nbsp;I originally got this warning as Mapdev.

What's the point in moving a Map Dev warning? It's a Mep Dev warning for a reason, why would you make it a moderation warning? This was the final warning in his demotion, and honestly it feels like a pretty big stretch...

I'm in the mood for a little banter.<br>Don't get butthurt, just being blunt honest here.<br><br><span style="color: rgb(115, 127, 141); font-family: Whitney, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">1. Using community servers as scrim when told not prior<br></span>Well honestly I don't see why you have an issue with this from the mapdev warning going to a general warning.<br>You were mapdev, got a warning for doing something wrong, and retired later for your own reasons.<br>You then later got Moderator and broke the exact same rule that you knew already was wrong as a&nbsp;<b>moderator</b>. It would be a story if the mapdev warning were for something completely different like talking rudely to someone, but you did the&nbsp;<u></u><u>exact same fucking thing</u>. Also shows how much of a "good role model" you were as a moderator. You enforce the rules and tell people the rules, yet you break it and expect nothing bad to occur!<br><b>Sarcasm if you don't get it</b>.<br><br>For the refs or streamers abusing their powers, they were only spectating correct? What's the issue that they look. If they decide not to leave, then cool for them, but don't go using your moderator powers to resolve your own personal issues. Not every team has a staff member that can kick people from scrims.<br>What you should have done was go and get an Official/Senior Staff to get the person to leave, and whilst waiting, you get evidence that you were asking him/her to leave and him not doing anything, and then reporting him/her to one of the head officials to deal with him/her. Him abusing his power does not equate to you using your power to deal with another&nbsp;<b>staff member</b> abusing his/her powers.<br>It was not affecting you in any way that the person was spectating at that moment, so it probably didn't need to be dealt with instantly.<br><br><span style="color: rgb(115, 127, 141); font-family: Whitney, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">2.

Giving an admin total power works if the admin is reliable and doesn't let that power go straight to his head like a little toy given to a 3 year old.

What's the point in moving a Map Dev warning? It's a Mep Dev warning for a reason, why would you make it a moderation warning? This was the final warning in his demotion, and honestly it feels like a pretty big stretch...

<i>Actually</i> this was his first warning I believe as mod.<br><br>The final reason he was demoted (3rd strike), as stated, was poor behavior as a staff member. This was comprised of several different actions that he did not just one individual.

Some of your behaviour on the forums was rather questionable for the past little bit. You also need to remember that Avicus isn't a democracy, the admins, especially the owners (Austin and Keenan) get the finally say. So if you did something to piss either one of them off they can remove you, I know it's bias but it's their server.

well yes, but the owner of the servers name is not that, its&nbsp;HeyIgotrhythm, which to me is no problem, like seriously people are not like "oh I'm not going to play here because of the admins username is that" The senior mod, Crazy_ then should change his name too because he is really crazy and that doesn't set a good example for the server!!!<br>{tag=dafrozenblaze} Well yes, but there is nothing wrong with the username.

A username based off of a song from a Disney cartoon =/= a username based on an appreciation for a sexual act.

yeah no there was way more besides this.

I quite often do it to see which servers are online and which aren't. Abuse is when you move people out of teamspeak channels without permission, kick them, tell people they can use community servers when the owner clearly said you are not allowed to, and respond "I don't care" when someone confronts you about it. Kicking people over and over for "leave" because you have your little mod powers after they have permission to stay. Also sneaking around in PM asking the leaders to tell players to leave because you don't want them there. I was probably kicked by you three times all abusing your permissions.<br><br><br>L

You're judging someone on their ign? Now that's quite pathetic.

it's not really. You could judge someone pretty well based on their name if it's a stupid name.
