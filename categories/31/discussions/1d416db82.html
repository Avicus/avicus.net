<b><br>Where is our advertising?</b><br>Our advertising efforts have been slowed down, and stalled due to other things. There was a small discussion in slack between a few staff members, and it seems that advertising, officially, isn't happening as quick as we hoped. However, there is a possibility of getting multiple Portuguese youtubers with anywhere from 500 subscribers to 20000 subscribers, based on individual contact. Finances is always a consideration, and as for such a big risk to pay a YouTuber, it would mean sacrificing padding we have to prevent falling in a dire situation. We may offer "Famous" ranks to those wanting to record that have a large amount of subscribers. We encourage everyone to donate to keep us running. Nothing confirmed for the above statements.<br><br><b>Where is our donation perks?</b><br>We had a senior staff meeting a while ago pertaining to perks for donating. While an update isn't yet released on this matter, we have encouragement to get further feedback from the community and implement it. This is one of our highest priorities to ensure that the server is financially stable. Some perks that have been mentioned have been considered to having been in development, and some have not yet been discussed. We encourage more discussion for all ranks for what they should include.<br><br><b>Where is our shop sale?</b><br>Via the dev site, from word getting out on twitter, and among other things, we now know that there is a high probability of a 30% off rank sale when we re-launch the website. This was an idea a while ago for a few others, and this is a concept that we are likely to try adding to the server.<br><br><b>Where is my interview results?</b><br>We are currently compiling as many results as we can. Most, if not all, of the interviews have been recorded and are pending further results. We will try to get back to you as soon as possible with a verdict reaching whether or not you will receive junior moderator. There also are possible changes in how the junior moderator rank may operate. Patience is key.<br><br><b>When will we get more devs?</b><br>We currently do indeed have a few community members interested in taking on the role, but it comes down to if Kylo believes they are worthy of being promoted. We have to sort out things first between developers that may make the process time consuming, and it all ends up on evaluation for if they are good enough to handle all the responsibilities given to them. It is unknown whether or not we will be adding new developers, but help seems to be welcomed.<br><br><b>When is blocklag going to be fixed?</b><br>There have been <i>many</i> variants of how blocklag may be fixed, and with each one came a bit closer to fixing it all together. With the commits and supposed statements about it, there could very well be a full patch for blocklag once we move away from 1.7 and the plugins all update like how they are for the Expo server.<br><br>This post may be updated with more information. If you wish to talk to me, you may do so on TeamSpeak. Alert a moderator to forward it to me via slack, and I will log on if I can to help. More information coming Tuesday.

This post isn't meant for hype, and it's actually made to pretty much prevent that. Hype has been a common factor in the community not trusting staff, and the outcome either being delayed, uncertain, or not happening at all. With transparency for the statements above, we hope the clarity solves the misconceptions.<br><br>EDIT: Yes, that meant to be italicized. Fixed.
