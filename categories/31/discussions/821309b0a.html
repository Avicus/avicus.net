Announcement - Head Map Developer
by
<a href='/users/Ogrey.html' style='color: Gray'>Ogrey</a>
<small>January 26, 2015 at  4:01 AM UTC</small>
</h1>
Hey guys!<br>During the past few weeks, the Map Development team, along with the Administrators, have discussed the possibility of having one out of the seven Map Developers chosen to lead the team, or, more precisely, manage it.<br><br>So just like Fluenza_ manages the Staff Team and Aversively manages the Community, the Head Map Developer will be in charge of managing the Map Development team. It will have to watch over the other Map Developers and make sure they are working efficiently and correctly, and also attending map development issues accordingly.<br><br>Each one of the Map Developers (ParaSpider, Evocal, itaity, ScriptingCookies, MonsieurStar, Slicorn, and Zedther) and the three Administrators (IvyCode, Fluenza_, and Aversively) have casted their votes on a poll, that would determine, by majority of votes, who would become the new Head Map Developer.<br><br>It is my pleasure to introduce myself as the new and first Head Map Developer of the Avicus Network. My work consists, as previously mentioned, to watch over the other six Map Developers, so in case you, the community, or other Staff Members, have some sort of discrepancy regarding a Map Developer, you can contact me so we can come up with a proper solution. I want to say thank you to everyone, specially my fellow Map Developers, for giving me your trust. I have been given the opportunity to lead something big and I'll make sure to do my best so everything regarding map development becomes more efficient and organized.<br><br>If you have any questions, recommendations, or any sort of comment regarding the other Map Developers, you can contact me via&nbsp;<b></b>Skype (<b></b><b>evoclaws</b><b></b>), or if we happen to meet in-game, feel free to talk to me (unless I'm away for some reason! hehe)<br><br><img alt="" src="http://cravatar.eu/helmavatar/Evocal/100.png"><br><b>&nbsp;" </b><i>nise men</i><b> "</b>

We were directing attention mainly at the veteran map developers, Evo and I, since we've both been mapdevs for around a year. With all of our experience, the map developers voted for candidates and ultimately, Evocal won.<br><br>I'm not mad. I'm not upset. I'm proud and happy to have him as a head-mapdev, and he is amazing when it comes to this stuff. I trust him more than I'd trust myself, heh.

I wouldn't think so; head mapdev is to watch over the others. Having 2 would make things messy. I wouldn't say soon.
