Thanks everybody who posted :D after these 2 pages of posts my parents have finally realised why I spend so much time. Just so you guys don't feel left out and don't know why I posted this here it is.<br><br>First of all, I was never a person that too many people liked in life, for grade 7-8 I only had 3 friends all along, but around 1/3 of the way through 8th grade Porky brought me into this community where I felt like a real familly, there are its ups and downs but to be honest, playing video games, making youtube videos and talking on ts or skype is social to me, I am really anti-social but this community makes me feel like I am not. Thank you guys for keeping me happy and thanks for all people who helped out to got my parents to finally understand me and to let me continue with games &lt;3 I have no idea what I would do without you guys or games. It just brings me joy &lt;3

How long do you spend on video games a day?<br>If the answer is more than a few hours then it would do you good to actually pull back a little bit.<br>There is nothing wrong with letting up on your games, your parents are most probably doing this because they care for your well-being.

That is a very good point. I limit my gaming time to about 2 hours a day.<br>If you spend to much time on the computer, it has the ability to "close brain paths". With basically means it can be harder to be creative.<br>It can also lead to problems like depersonalization.<br><br>Oh my gosh, this was like the anti-computer comment. Sorry.
