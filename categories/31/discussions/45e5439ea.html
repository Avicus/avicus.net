Hello, some of you may remember something about an Avicus Maps Page. So far, it seems progression with it has been relatively slow so I did what I could to speed up the process by having a picture for each map. I believe I have every single DTM map and I will continue with the other gamemodes too if needed.&nbsp;<br><br>It took a while to do all this so i hope it pays off :p<br><br>If you are going to contribute to this as well, I suggest you take screenshots with the Plast Pack as it is makes blocks look brighter and cleaner.&nbsp;<br><br>So here is all the DTM maps currently in the rotations.<br>*Please tell me if I missed some.<br><br>Click here --&gt; <a href="http://imgur.com/a/VwE3s/all" rel="nofollow">Album Link</a><br><br>This is the order that I took the pictures in and it should match up with the Imgur album.<br><br><img src="https://i.gyazo.com/ec871872801508711fca4eb6421ba3a5.png"><br><b><br><br></b><b><br><br><br></b>

Maybe make a google doc? It would make it more organized.

I'm not sure how the Maps Page works so I don't know if I should because it might be a waste of time. For example, I don't know whether you can upload a map picture to the page by link or if you can only upload from your computer etc..

Thanks for this Poker Face! &nbsp;Could you do this for other game modes&nbsp;<b>when</b> you have the time because this looked like it took a lot of work. (For the map devs I recognized the ME3 maps were moved to their game modes but mine wasn't :0 no big deal, just letting you know

Hi, so I don't know why nobody looked at jracer15's 300x200 pictures of mine. Was it because it has to be from Imgur or something? Regardless, I have changed all the pictures to 300x200 on Imgur so here is the new album. The post has been updated as well.<br><br><a href="http://imgur.com/a/VwE3s/all" title="Link: http://imgur.com/a/VwE3s/all">http://imgur.com/a/VwE3s/all</a>
