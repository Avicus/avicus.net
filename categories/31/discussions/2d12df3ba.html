Hey,<br><br>This question has concerned me for a while now, but I actually decided to ask now.<br><br>The 18+ chat on TS is, obviously, a place to discuss things not always suitable for younger audiences, even though the younger ones do go there.<br>
<p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px;  ">"You dont need to be 18. But it's more subjective. Anything goes besides spamming, trolling, or bullying."</p><p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px;  "><br></p><p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px;  ">Right, here is what concerns me.</p><p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px;  "><br></p><p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px;  ">I've seen players and staff alike use racial and homophobic slurs, as well as being disrespectful to people with mental/physical disabilities, and disrespect to genders. I think to myself, well, yeah, 18+, but does that give you the reason to act like an idiot and be disrespectful?</p><p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px;  "><br></p><p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px;  ">I guess players let go there, but in all honesty, what are the rules behind this? I'm confused.</p><p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px;  "><br></p><p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px;  ">Thanks in advance,</p><p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px;  "><br></p><p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px;  ">Sky<br></p>

If you're offended then don't go in there.

Disrespect, racial and homophobic slurs and jokes will not go unpunished. We have<b>&nbsp;zero tolerance</b>&nbsp;for it.<br><br>If you see a player <i>and/or</i> staff member being rude in TeamSpeak, gather evidence and send in an online report.<br>Or, you can contact another staff member to take care of the issue immediately.

This has come to my concern as well, so thanks for bringing the issue up.

Alright, thankyou.<br><br>Still is quite saddening that this is happening, however.

It isn't about if <i></i><b>I</b> am offended, it's if others are. And the fact that people would be so narrow-minded as to say such things.

They only make these jokes around people they think can handle it. If you're one of the people sitting in Teamspeak with your mic muted, praying for them to stop then you aren't really solving the problem. I haven't see any mods making these jokes around new users, only around the people they think are mature enough (or immature enough) to understand the type of humor that they like to portray. There is a fine line between jokes and being offensive. When that line is crossed, then you can go ahead and say that it is harassment. Other than that you just have to tell them that it's offensive to you.
