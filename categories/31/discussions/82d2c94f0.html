Hey guys! I pretty much have already left Avicus, but first I'd like to 
say some parting words. This server has been amazing, and it's really 
been more than a server to me, it's been a community. As any senior 
staff member who has read my applications, you know how I preach about 
how Avicus is a great community. Sure there were ups and downs, but it 
was really fun. I remember the old days when I would be on plug.dj with 
Cinnamon Croc, or doing a staff interview for Jozz. I guess I just 
wanted to thank you guys. All of you have made Avicus what it is. I feel
 I did my part to make it better, and now I'm moving on. I'll be on from
 time to time, and I'll try to stay in touch, please feel free to talk 
to me on the community slack, but I think my time here is over. Avicus 
was really fun for a really long time, and I loved being as involved as I
 could. I think my only regret would be that I wish I could be leaving 
with a "Retired" tag, but you know how it is. Being staff was great, and
 I loved working with everyone. Again, thank you... to the staff who 
work to keep the game fun, the devs that make it work, and the players 
who make the server real. Lastly, I would just like to make one MASSIVE 
thank you. Resepignev, you have been one of my best friends on the 
server. We worked together as mods, reffed tournaments, and you made my 
build server possible! Thank you. Again, feel free to contact me on the community slack. I'm not trying to
 leave Avicus in the dust, it's just that I'm not playing much anymore.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a good note to end on, and a reference to <i>The Outsiders</i>, <i></i>"Stay Gold Avicus, Stay Gold"
