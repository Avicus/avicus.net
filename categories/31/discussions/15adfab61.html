Community Q&A + Feedback Survey

</h1>
As part of my promises as an Administrator, tntpotato and I have finalized and finished the "Community Q&amp;A and Feedback Survey." This is an event that will (hopefully) increase some transparency between the community and staff, as well as allow the community to openly provide feedback to improve the Staff team and Map Developer team.<br><br><b></b>How will this work?<br><br><b>Q&amp;A: Instructions</b><br>There will be two components to this event. The first is the Community Q&amp;A, which will take place on this thread. The idea is that the community will ask any questions they have for the Staff team and Map Developer team. For example, you can ask questions such as "When are the next staff applications," "Is there going to be a staff reassessment?" and "Where can I post my map?"<br><br>All responses will be provided by the staff team, including the Administrators, and Map Developers will provide answers to Map Development related questions. All other responses are unofficial.&nbsp;<br><br>You may also provide&nbsp;<b>constructive</b> criticism on the Staff and Map Development team,&nbsp;<b>not aggressive</b> criticism.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Survey: Instructions<br><br></b>The survey is the second component to this event. You will be provided a link to a survey that TNT and I have prepared, where you will answer a series of questions that pertain to Avicus (staff team, map development, server).&nbsp;<br><b><br></b>The responses are anonymous; you are free to provide as much criticism as you like, but remember, please keep the responses respectful.<br><b><br></b>Do not send troll responses.<br><br><b><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1lcsy6mplmWb_TnnGba5KeBhuBqpsLsjShqodYR6ngm4/viewform" rel="nofollow">Survey Link</a></b><br><b><br></b><b></b>All troll responses on this thread will be archived. Failure to comply with these instructions may result in a forum punishment.<br><br>Well, ask away!<br>-TNT and Midnite<br><b><br></b><b><br></b>

You do always have to option to either save your answers in a word document, or doing the required questions, then editing your answers in time. :P<br><br>I designed the survey so that if people do not want to do the long answers, they do not have to. We want the replies to be as accurate as possible, but we understand that not everybody has the time to do the entire survey in one sitting, hence why I enabled people being allowed to edit their response. xP<br><br>Speaking of those responses, I'm liking the responses &nbsp;from everyone so far! In less than 24 hours we've already gotten an amazing amount of feedback about Avicus in general, which we really appreciate! I promise you that this feedback will be considered/listened to. Thank you, everyone! The feedback about the thread/survey itself is also really appreciated, I'm happy that it turned out well. x)

Totally up to you. Made some questions required since those questions are by far the most important (IMO), but leaving some blank is fine. :P

I filled it out but not sure if it was sent through. This is looking really promising that the staff team are taking on board so much from the community! Staff - community transparency +1

A teamspeak Q&amp;A woould be really nice.<br>When Jozz had wanted to implement someone's idea with a few "voices of the community" I suggested a teamspeak Q&amp;A where its streamed as well and Sr's + can answer some questions that they have instead of having a certain chosen group of people to ask for them.
