This is a gamemode where you chose where you spawn. You place the emerald block to set your spawn. Wherever the emerald block is placed, that is where you spawn.<br>Here are a couple of images i scrounged up.<br><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/IKuH6x9.png">There is where it will be in the inventory.<br><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/xfV4LOC.png">1. Place block<br>2. Die<br>3. Spawn where you place it<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When you place it up high like this V<br><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/rwwXbhV.png">If you place it higher than the ground, you will spawn where the redstone block is.<br>If you place the emerald block and then someone breaks it before you die, you spawn at your teams original spawn.<br>Keep in mind this is a gamemode, not a suggestion to every nebula inventory.<br>Pros:<br>1. Easy rushing<br>2. Good for pvping/ kill farming<br>Cons:<br>1. Little harder to defend<br>What do you think?

Sounds like the thingy on COD (not a cod player).&nbsp; But for me, it sounds cool.

Seems interesting, but i think everything is good as it is.&nbsp;<br><br>Knowing me, i have a heavy thing against kill farming so...&nbsp;<br><br>and i have a very&nbsp;<i>tiny&nbsp;</i>peeve against rushing ;)

You can spawn camp with it. Unless you have to place it back down after you spawn on it.

That's why you break the emerald block.

could be easily hidden or placed up in a skybridge so you spawn right in the monument

Seems like part of the strategy of the game to me.<br>I think this is a pretty cool idea.<br>+1

Depends, there would have to be a restriction so that players can't keep respawning really close to the other teams spawns. Other than that, +1.

It should be a level 50 item that costs a lot of points in the nether star.

I don't like it, I just don't think it'll work.<br>It might ruin the gameplay because people'll be spawn anywhere.<br>It could also get abused and would make the initial spawn "base" useless.<br><br>I don't know, people seem to like this idea on paper, I'm just not sure how well it'll do in practice.&nbsp;<br><br>Just my opinion :)
