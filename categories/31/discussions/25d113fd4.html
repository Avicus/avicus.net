Ahhhhh.......just 1 thing because all the staff are completly awesome :D<br>Just( I don;t know how to actually explain that :P)...the Jr Mods are sometimes so happy so they got it, So they are doing they work "too good". I'm not saying it's all of them, some of them.<br>I mean, they are warning all the time, and i think so it will be better, if some of them, who not doing that, will warn on the chat before that.<br>Like :<br>player: I BROKE THE MONUMENT<br>Jr mod:/warn player caps<br>I think they should warn in the chat before that like:<br>Player: I BROKE THE MONUMENT<br>Jr Mod: Player<br>Player: what?<br>Jr Mod: Watch the caps!<br>After chat warning, in another time he will do that, /warn. 2 or 3 warns- Kick.<br>That's my opinion.....Thank's howsie for making this &nbsp;Discussion.

Right now, I believe that the staff is quite efficient in what they are doing, considering that they punish players accordingly to what they have done.<br>Because Avicus now has some new mods, the community will be much more clean and fun, but to further prevent hackers and rule breakers from continuing what they are doing, perhaps there could be a few more new moderators.&nbsp;<br><br>The staff members give appropriate punishments, are friendly both in-game, on the forums, and on Teamspeak 3, which makes players feel like they are part of a great community.<br><br>What I would like to see improve is temp-ban duration. What I mean by this, is that some moderators temp-ban a player for 2 weeks (as an example) for breaking a certain rule. However, some other moderators feel that the player deserves more a punishment, so they temp-ban them for 4 weeks.<br>What I am trying to say, is that perhaps there could be an approximate time-length set for certain rules broken, which would make players relaxed that everyone receives the same punishment and nobody is "favored" over anybody (<b><i>not</i></b> that the moderators are biased).<br>In reality, the moderators do give very similar temp-ban lengths, which is not a problem, but this issue is very minor, and does not affect many people.<br><br>This is just something I thought of because I saw some people complaining about it.<br><br>Thank you,<br>-Porky.

We're looking into creating a set ban guidelines system for all staff to follow. So far it has been quite all over the place with infractions. This is something I can definitely take the blame for.

1 moderator could ban someone for "Team Grief" for 1 weeks.<br>Another one could ban someone for "Team Grief" for 3 weeks.<br><br>Even though they were both banned for the same thing, It might not be the same thing at all.<br>The first punishment could be for simply breaking a crafting table, but the second one could be for spamming tnt all over your base and destroying it all. You can't really tell from the punishment messages so there could be reasoning to the different times.

I think 100% a verbal warning needs to be given before any official punishment is handing out. It just makes sense to give people and opportunity to stop whatever it is they are doing as they might not have read the rules or something and may not be aware of the rules, particularly for new players. I mean the infractions on your profile are forever so that a pretty big deal and shouldnt be handed out like sweets imo.<br><br>The staff team seem great although I have noticed and I thought this was so weird that&nbsp;this happens is when staff are in a game and someone tells them "Oh help I am being spawnkilled!!!" " Userxoxo is spawnkilling me!" everyone including the staff, from what I has seen, just goes "please use /report". Now I have several issues with this:<br><ol><li>If a person is being spawn killed repeatedly then they may not have a chance to fill in a /report as they are trying to survive.</li><li>/report would let every staff member know of the issue which may cause more than one to have to leave their game and come to the match where there is already a mod or staff member.</li><li>As I said there was already staff members (plural) in the match so dragging some more out of their games, in my opinion is just stupid. It takes them away from their game and leaves it temp unmoderated.&nbsp;</li></ol>I feel as though /report should only be used when there is not a staff member already in your game. Its like having someone sitting beside you and ringing them on their phone to speak to them... its just silly and not practical.&nbsp;<br><br>Overall a good staff team but I think that they need to improve on the areas mentioned. Sorry if this comes across as me having a go at y'all as I do think yous do a good job but there is always room for improvement!

Staff not answering /report, I have stopped using /report in game and recorded or screen shot &nbsp;and posted in player reports so I really think that we need more staff members because we are not getting enough staff online at once to get all the reports! even though all of the staff are trying hard they are out numbered by the 400 500 people that play every day.

Actually it's quite the opposite. Most times 5 staff will go to one report, and then all the other reports that came in will be ignored. This&nbsp;<b>is&nbsp;</b>in fact a big issue.

It really is. Sometimes when a report comes in I will type something in staff chat like,"mine" or "I got it", but it can get lost :P

There are no mod points, so there's no need to give out straight punishments for something simple as "hackusating". but if it's hacking, than please, i dont give a fuck who it is, regular or not, go check it out.

I think if it is a minor problem, players should get a warning instead of an immediate kick. If that doesn't work then a kick would me more reasonable.

Hey guys, so being a past staff member I have noticed quite a few things.<br><br>I have noted a couple of things...<br><b>There are 4 (in general) type of staff members:</b><br>Lazy Staff Members<br>Normal Staff Members<br>Super ultra Staff Members<br>Inactive Staff Members<br>Builder Staff Members<br><br>Lazy Staff Members:<br>These are staff that are active, but don't do any reports. These staff members play games all day whilst enjoying the perks and occasionally will ban someone in their game if they are annoying them by hacking or something.<br><br>Normal Staff Members:<br>These are staff that are active, and do moderate but they also play games. I'd say I'd probably fall under this category and so do most other Staff. These staff do go on reports around half the time, and play games another half.<br><br>Super ultra Staff Members:&nbsp;<br>These staff moderate a TON! They are super amazing at reports and barely play. Eg. Jozzy, TheTNTDude, PeachyYas, Jake.<br><br>Inactive Staff Members:<br>They are inactive due to school or other irl issues.<br><br>Builder Staff Members:&nbsp;<br>These staff members spend WAY too much time on the Staff Builder server, often they do moderate but a lot of the time it isn't accomplishing much.<br><br>Now onto the staff in general.<br>We need more staff and for a better efficiency. We also need more admins for Funky as Avicus is very slow...<br>I feel that a tracking system of staff's kicks or bans should be put into place to evaluate some of the great staff that should be promoted eg. Apricot.<br><br><br>Now I also feel that the server loses peoples interest because updates take ages, I know this has been partly fixed by our awesome Map Developers but I feel that the whole server is just way too slow.<br><br>Updates? Slow.<br>Replies from staff? Slow.<br><br>I'd also like to make a suggestion.<br>Each Manager needs their own email account that we can contact them on.<br><br>For those of you who don't know Howsie and Gillette as well as Ivy are constantly harassed by people on Skype. Although I do think they should still <i>reply&nbsp;</i>to Avicus related messages instead of ignoring them.<br><br>Lastly I think becoming a staff member should take a lot less time. It takes AGES to find a response to your application, and then you get denied without a reason but I do think this will improve with more Senior Moderators.<br><br>In conclusion I feel that we need more staff for the server to run efficiently and more systems to manage staff.<br><br>Regards,<br><br><br><br>TortouseMuncher

Well, I saw this one person in game say "PLEASE DONT HACkusate" then he said "oops sorry for the caps" but the mod still gave him a warning. I honestly HATE how some mods use warn whenever they can. I mean, i dont think its necessary to warn someone for having caps on for one message.

It depends upon the length of the message. If it's quite distracting and spams the chat with unnecessary characters, they will receive a warn.

Most are very efficient. I got team killed a LOT in the Walls, and I used /report before it was too late and I died, and like 4 staff members showed up.<br>However, so many appear at one report and the other ones get ignored. I reported someone the other week or so (I have evidence so I'll report them again later, was lazy after uploading the video ._.) for kill aura/forcefield and no one came. :(<br><br>So maybe there should be a maximum of 2 mods at a report at a time, so not too many are at one report and the others get ignored.

Ahhhhh.......just 1 thing because all the staff are completly awesome :D<br>Just( I don;t know how to actually explain that :P)...the Jr Mods are sometimes so happy so they got it, So they are doing they work "too good".

I've actually noticed an increase in /report responses that I'm really thankful for. Thanks! :)<br><br>But here are suggestions anyways:<br>1) Assign mods to gamemodes (if you already don't do this) - this way the mod gets familiar with who is playing during a time period and who may be reported repeatedly for similar infractions; for example - mod is assigned to walls for a 3 hour period, so he/she can identify the players who are getting repeatedly reported and address the issues at hand.<br>2) Immediate mod assignment to a report - I guess in some type of log system, a mod would log which report he/she is responding to in order to avoid multiple mod response.&nbsp; Then if a mod needed help identifying hacks or whatever they could ask another mod to come for support.<br>3) Teamspeak mods - all mods who are online active should be in teamspeak together (not with friends) as a coordinated effort.<br>4) Aligned punishments - punishment should fit the crime, be standardized, and have a purpose. <br>5) Train mods on hacks - each mod should go through a training regarding hacks so they can better identify the hacks in use.<br><br>Many of these suggestions have already been made, but I wanted to show support.

I think it would be so much better if you had four or even five moderators in charge of one gamemode and four or five other moderators in charge of another gamemode. When this group of moderators take action, they will follow the same rules and same way of thinking, so it doesn't accure that one moderator gives one week kick and another moderator just gives 3 - 5 days kick, or even less. When we need to talk with a moderator regarding Nebula as example, we know that, "Oh, I should talk to Howsie or somebody else of these three - four moderators".

Why don't you have messages sent out in the in game staff chat every time someone changes servers? ^_^<br>Like, how hard would that be?<br>Or /respond -name, which would take you to the server that the report came from and then when other ppl be like "oh snap, someone's been reported" and they do /respond, but someone else has already seen it, it sends a message that it's already been responded to so the mod can know dat that's being dealt with.<br>Plus I'd rather not like you to force mods to certain game modes if that's what you're planning. But you know, try to add more analytics to see what problems you have.<br>I've checked the source code, so I know you didn't custom code the graphing, so all that needs to be added is tracking c:

Actually it's quite the opposite. Most times 5 staff will go to one report, and then all the other reports that came in will be ignored. This&nbsp;<b>is&nbsp;</b>in fact a big issue.

What if there was a mod cycling deal where it would cycle through the mods sending a request for a report and if the mod didnt want to go to it they could type /deny and if they did /accept otherwise it would move on to the next mod after 30 seconds but only one mod gets any given report at one time so only one need to go to it.

Right now, I believe that the staff is quite efficient in what they are doing, considering that they punish players accordingly to what they have done.<br>Because Avicus now has some new mods, the community will be much more clean and fun, but to further prevent hackers and rule breakers from continuing what they are doing, perhaps there could be a few more new moderators.&nbsp;<br><br>The staff members give appropriate punishments, are friendly both in-game, on the forums, and on Teamspeak 3, which makes players feel like they are part of a great community.<br><br>What I would like to see improve is temp-ban duration. What I mean by this, is that some moderators temp-ban a player for 2 weeks (as an example) for breaking a certain rule. However, some other moderators feel that the player deserves more a punishment, so they temp-ban them for 4 weeks.<br>What I am trying to say, is that perhaps there could be an approximate time-length set for certain rules broken, which would make players relaxed that everyone receives the same punishment and nobody is "favored" over anybody (<b><i>not</i></b> that the moderators are biased).<br>In reality, the moderators do give very similar temp-ban lengths, which is not a problem, but this issue is very minor, and does not affect many people.<br><br>This is just something I thought of because I saw some people complaining about it.<br><br>Thank you,<br>-Porky.

Most moderators are doing a good job, however, some moderators ban people for hacking (even though they don't hack).&nbsp; The never have hardcore evidence of hacking, they just ban.&nbsp; Same happened to me.&nbsp; I was banned (thankfully they unbanned me) but i never hacking in my life.&nbsp; Just a word to the wise.

What if there was a mod cycling deal where it would cycle through the mods sending a request for a report and if the mod didnt want to go to it they could type /deny and if they did /accept otherwise it would move on to the next mod after 30 seconds but only one mod gets any given report at one time so only one need to go to it.

I love all the staff members here as family. But, there are a few things I guess I'd like to see an improvement on as well.&nbsp;<br><br>Like multiple others have said, I think a lot of staff members only go to reports from players they're familiar with. I find that bias, and a lot of times if one of their friends are breaking rules, they won't punish them because they're their friend.&nbsp;<br><br>On top of that, many staff members don't always treat players like people, some treat them like peasants, and we're their rulers. Well, we're not. We're just like them, we just have the ability to punish the ones that break the rules.<br><br>Other than that I feel the staff team is right on top of things.

That's not a bad idea, but keep in mind that staff are by far not the only biased people. &nbsp;Players typically have even more bias than staff. &nbsp;Plus, players may just vote for their friends as opposed to voting for someone with the better skill set or proper qualifications.

We could have a system of having possible staff members "verified" by current staff and have a selection of 10-50 people to vote for. It would still be biased, but it would fix most of the problems.

Hey guys, so being a past staff member I have noticed quite a few things.<br><br>I have noted a couple of things...<br><b>There are 4 (in general) type of staff members:</b><br>Lazy Staff Members<br>Normal Staff Members<br>Super ultra Staff Members<br>Inactive Staff Members<br>Builder Staff Members<br><br>Lazy Staff Members:<br>These are staff that are active, but don't do any reports. These staff members play games all day whilst enjoying the perks and occasionally will ban someone in their game if they are annoying them by hacking or something.<br><br>Normal Staff Members:<br>These are staff that are active, and do moderate but they also play games. I'd say I'd probably fall under this category and so do most other Staff. These staff do go on reports around half the time, and play games another half.<br><br>Super ultra Staff Members:&nbsp;<br>These staff moderate a TON! They are super amazing at reports and barely play. Eg. Jozzy, TheTNTDude, PeachyYas, Jake.<br><br>Inactive Staff Members:<br>They are inactive due to school or other irl issues.<br><br>Builder Staff Members:&nbsp;<br>These staff members spend WAY too much time on the Staff Builder server, often they do moderate but a lot of the time it isn't accomplishing much.<br><br>Now onto the staff in general.<br>We need more staff and for a better efficiency. We also need more admins for Funky as Avicus is very slow...<br>I feel that a tracking system of staff's kicks or bans should be put into place to evaluate some of the great staff that should be promoted eg. Apricot.<br><br><br>Now I also feel that the server loses peoples interest because updates take ages, I know this has been partly fixed by our awesome Map Developers but I feel that the whole server is just way too slow.<br><br>Updates? Slow.<br>Replies from staff? Slow.<br><br>I'd also like to make a suggestion.<br>Each Manager needs their own email account that we can contact them on.<br><br>For those of you who don't know Howsie and Gillette as well as Ivy are constantly harassed by people on Skype. Although I do think they should still <i>reply&nbsp;</i>to Avicus related messages instead of ignoring them.<br><br>Lastly I think becoming a staff member should take a lot less time. It takes AGES to find a response to your application, and then you get denied without a reason but I do think this will improve with more Senior Moderators.<br><br>In conclusion I feel that we need more staff for the server to run efficiently and more systems to manage staff.<br><br>Regards,<br><br><br><br>TortouseMuncher

I agree with this partly, however most if not all of the staff work their hardest.&nbsp;<br><br>Thanks for stating me as a great staff member. It means a lot to be appreciated personally ^.^

The most pressing issue IMO is the strict rules for the mods. It seems that the staff usually do something wrong, and they just get demoted.

They are strict but that does not mean a staff member will get demoted straight away because of one incident. It takes up to two weeks for a 'recommended for demotion' staff member to be demoted.

Sorry AFK is the wrong word. I meant to imply that they are on their pc, but are just staying on there because they don't want to talk to everyone else. It makes staff seem a bit anti-social. Rather be in AFK then Moderator staff Chat etc.

mod rules are too strict... they should be given WAY more chances... like there were several really good mods, they made a few mistakes.... and then they were demoted D: give them more chances, especially for inactivity or something, like koo, who went on vacation and made a forum post about it, and got demoted for inactivity.... even though he said he would go on it... though he didnt fill out a form... :c

I would like a <b>warning</b> to be given when a player takes more than one set of diamond armor (I don't remember the name of the map with two towers with a chest above c: ) or more diamond blocks than they need. <b>It is team griefing</b> as you are in the way of your team to win without the armor necessary and you never need two sets of armor.

If you take more than one set, you leave the rest where it was. You don't run away and craft a chest that you place on the other side of the spawn, where nobody knows about it. I see this everytime I play this map, a diamond set WILL NOT break during a game, even if you so play for hours. If I get more than one set or two chests or two swords I leave it, same thing when I kill someone and get his or her diamond set, I give it out at spawn, though I have never seen anyone help me out like that.

:/ everyone who plays the match knows about it.... I place a chest in the spawn... and call out who wants diamond armor ;p<br>besides, its a flaw to leave the armor in the tower chests, some games, rushers actually rush to the towers, get full diamond gear... ;p<br>the goal is to rush the tower supply either to your armor slot, or closer to spawn, since the main tower area can be easily overtaken by the enemy team.......<br>and... why exactly are you trying to scold me? :P

I really want to be a staff member but i don't have skype. That isn't fair. I think that you make the application a question answer session with many guidelines. Then, you check the player but you don't judge them by infractions. My infractions mostly came from junior mods and mods making mistakes early in their staff tenures. Then you contact 20 or so people on the forums and tell them that they can accept about 15. Then you have one final test and decide on the new &nbsp;junior mods. If a staff member &nbsp;does many bad things and shows favoritism, they get warned then demoted. This process would be complicated but open to people who don't have skype. Like me

I think for the most part the Staff does a good job. One thing that I would like to put out there is before making harsh comments / drastic suggestions is &nbsp;to please remember that most of the staff are fairly young and have not been moderating that long.<br><br>&nbsp;In my opinion, the best thing to do is operate under some standard guidelines. Formalize it, then publish it. Moderators should not be using personal judgement until they get to the senior mod rank or higher even. The lower / newer mods should have guidelines that can be quoted for their actions, and a very detailed reference document for the rest of us that outlines most known infractions and what will be done if the infraction is found to be true and how the infraction is found true.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;I also think that All moderators should have an allowed and required &nbsp;"tone" that should be used no matter what. Moderators should not have the same freedoms to vent publicly, or to reprimand publicly or accuse publicly and in all interactions be pleasant and non judgmental.<br>Moderators should understand we are part of a very fragile ecosystem. Just like when a moderator leaves and several moderators go with him/her, the same happens for the player base. Every player is a potential source for funding, fun, and social enjoyment and should be treated as such in all aspects. " A moderator should never portray "annoyance" or "disregard" or "disrespect" in any way to any player as that defeats their purpose and forfeits the long term survival of the Avicus network. Moderators should help lift up the community being positive and displaying excitement. When a ban has to happen, do it fairly, following expectations and &nbsp;with respect to the one being banned - then keep on smiling, showing enthusiasm knowing you &nbsp;took part in helping make the server great.

We're looking into creating a set ban guidelines system for all staff to follow. So far it has been quite all over the place with infractions. This is something I can definitely take the blame for.

I agree, as recently I was temp-banned for 3 days, for spawn killing. I believe this is a little 'over the top' and I should have been kicked or warned. I also looked at the mod's account who banned me, and they have been <b><i><u>kicked</u></i></b> for spawn killing <u><i><b>twice</b></i></u>.

I don't want to be off topic but can there be discussion that doesn't always have to do with mods. &nbsp;Don't get me wrong, I think there the best minecraft server staff and you don't get many good staff like this one, but this server doesn't revolve around the staff. &nbsp;What about discussion over new additions or bring in old one, or talk about map making, etc. &nbsp;Just a suggestion :)
