To everyone who may know me, I'm quitting.&nbsp;<br>I'm quitting because well, I've been banned so many times, I know it's my fault, but staff. "Appeal again in 8 months."<br>What the heck?! I am not gonna appeal again in almost another year, for that I am quitting. If you want to talk to me, I will be playing an HCF server called wenjapvp, I will be playing a small kind of dead server called cowcraft in factions/kitpvp, and overcast network. Also, avicus has so many issues I could address but i don't want to make this thread a complaint. Therefore, I am quitting the avicus network. And staff if you're reading this, don't make players appeal again in 8 months if you want them to stay. 8 Months is ridiculous. At this rate the server will die a lot faster and people will move away from mc in that timeframe.&nbsp;<br><br>Bye Everyone and hope you enjoy playing avicus.&nbsp;<br><br>Warmest Regards,<br><br>-Paperwite...

"I'm not gonna appeal in almost another year, for that I'm quitting"<br>Since you were banned for hacking on avicus, I wouldn't call it quitting avicus, but rather "This server is shit, and that is why I was hacking here. I don't give a fuck about how the server goes, cause I'm out".

Are you complaining because we give you guys the opportunity to appeal again in 6-8 months instead deny your appeal and stay banned forever? You are very lucky that you can get unbanned soon, because you asked for pity before. We shouldn't give you the opportunity to appeal again because it's your 2nd offense; so don't come here and start complaining without reason.
