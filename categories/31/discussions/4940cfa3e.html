You are not able to apply or ask, as you are <b>invited</b> to become a map developer. A map developer is a person who extensively contributes to the Avicus Network through YAML creation, advanced building skills, and other miniature things as a community member. To become a map developer, you must follow the following qualities;<br><br>= Be able to work quick, efficiently, and have good roots with the community.<br>= Be able to know how to use Github. This is what the maps are stored in along with the YMLs.<br>= Be able to make markups with little to no errors at all, and show to be able to have ability to fix them.<br>= Be able to regularly work on projects that the map developers set up, such as community events.<br>= Be trustworthy. Once a map developer, you get access to Build, Staff skype chat, and the staff forums.

It just uses YAML. Nothing else!<br>@yoav I personally would like for mapdevs to know how to use github BEFORE they would be promoted, however I was able to teach Evocal and he does fine. I'm able to teach anyone else how to use it for map work.
