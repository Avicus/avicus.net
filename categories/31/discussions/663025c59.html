I dont mean that as an insult, But most of the times I see people making threads or talking about a topic, I see most people who respond to that thread with word attacking, for example, I find no use of this thread, or this thread is useless, or there are many of these threads stop spamming, most times, I , myself, get reply attacks from other players, but most of the times I see threads who get attacked interesting and useful, stuff that should be published, so my whole point of this thread that being verbally attacked all the time makes others discouraged to talk using threads or even use the Avicus Network Forums.

maybe if the entire community "attacks" your thread, its because it shouldnt be there in the first place.&nbsp;<br><br>doing even the slightest look at the front page will let you know what topics are trending rn. having 3 similar topics and then publishing one yourself will obviously receive some hate since its just so unnecessary.

Most of the time people like to think they can jump in on a topic and win server "brownie" points by pointing out someone has said something like that already... Most of the time its these same people that turn a blind eye to the reason for so many posts on a topic and they give excuses for the people that should have already posted officially about the topic or corrected the topic. God forbid you point out a problem that has been <b>ignored</b> for months and months, if you do point it out more than once you will get the spam squad attacking your thread and put on lockdown. Now, if the spam thread is not about Avicus or Minecraft I agree it is just spam and should be somewhere else. But if people are pointing out something Known or not know about the server then it should Have an Official Staff / Owner post that squelches the Topic and it should be made Sticky.

+1 I like this idea, because people should be able to talk freely. The person might just be a newbie.

Just learn and start making reasonable posts. I went through that stage before. Don't worry, I hope you will be more accepted soon!
