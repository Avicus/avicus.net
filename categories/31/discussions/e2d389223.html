I'm having mixed feelings about this. I agree that he did good things for the server, but he retired (twice I believe) and went AFK a lot. I just feel that some ex senior staff members (Jake for example) are not getting the same treatment as the rest of them. <br><br>Hopefully you can prove me wrong and exceed my expectations of you, but we will see.<br><br>Good Luck.

Don't get me wrong, I have nothing again Peachy, but you guys are so unorganized with choosing how staff returns to the team.. Peachy is able to become a Sr mod directly, whereas Jake had to become a Jr and work up. From what I know Jake was a good staff member, so I don't know if this decision was biased because y'all like Peachy. Anyways, I like having Peachy back, but staff you guys need to get organized since this system makes no sense.

There has been special circumstances with a lot of returns. If we feel they're qualified, then they can be promoted. Sometimes, those circumstances are either on their own conditions or on ours.

It would be easier and more fair to have one set of rules, and not keep making special circumstances and exceptions all the time. I'm sure that the majority of the current moderators would like a chance at becoming a Sr Moderator, and by allowing old staff members to jump directly to Sr Mod, you're not giving others the chance to move up. It just doesn't make sense to give a person who hasn't been a part of the staff team for a while the Sr Mod rank right as they return.

It would be easier and more fair to have one set of rules, and not keep making special circumstances and exceptions all the time. I'm sure that the majority of the current moderators would like a chance at becoming a Sr Moderator, and by allowing old staff members to jump directly to Sr Mod, you're not giving others the chance to move up. It just doesn't make sense to give a person who hasn't been a part of the staff team for a while the Sr Mod rank right as they return.
