From what I know, there isn't a set date yet, but applications will open sometime in April or May. This might not be correct though.

We are testing a new "hand picking" method, which will hopefully begin in mid March. Basically, this means that the staff team will be observing players in-game and on the forums who are helping others, and exhibiting the traits of a moderator (without impersonating staff), and we will keep an eye on that player to see if he / she is moderator material. If the staff team agrees on promoting said player, they will be given the Jr Mod rank, as well as be trained like any other Jr Moderator. As for&nbsp;<i>applications</i>, we do not know an&nbsp;<i>exact</i> date yet. Whenever we need more moderators, we'll alert the community. :)

We've just had three waves in the last 5 months.<br>Apps will always be welcome when Avicus requires more staff members, but as Porky said a new way of recruiting staff is going to be implemented and tested soon.
