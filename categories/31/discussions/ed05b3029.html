So I love helping people have fun and especially things I love like Avicus.<br>But apart from donating (Which I have already got plans for) is there any way, shape or form I can help Avicus? I know this is a odd discussion but it bothers me thinking there is nothing to help with, like online chores xD<br><br>So if there is available spots for helping I am always here :D

You can partake in the many events that people host on the forums. Other than that, just try to help other people, hang out on Skype/TS, play in-game, etc.<br><br>Voting at avicus.net/vote will help the server get advertised. Making videos (if possible) is a lot of fun to do and it helps the server as well. Basically, just playing on the server in general helps a lot! C:<br><br>I recommend you join a clan (under the&nbsp;<i>Teams</i> section in the forums.) It'll help you get to know other people very well, and you'll make lots of friends. :D

You said you have plans for donating, that's probably the best way to help.<br><br>If you can build well, making maps is great because Avicus won't work without maps of course! <br><br>Voting is awesome, plus gives you xp!<br><br>Playing and being very active on the forums is great. <br><br>Going on TS from time to time is a good way. <br><br>Talking to people in game and making friends will create bonds and strengthen the community.

Thanks for the ideas :D I will try the suggestions :)<br><br>But the issue with TS is that every time I go on, there is one or two other people on with their microphones muted so I can't talk to them. What is the main time people go on TS in the US?

In the case that a&nbsp;<i>tournament</i> will appear, these clans, or teams, will be the ones who compete against each other, most likely for a prize.<br>Of course, a tournament hasn't appeared since McZone, but we're all awaiting anxiously. Just check to see if a team is looking for applicants, and apply for a team. They'll most likely add you to a skype group to communicate.<br>Clans practice against each other through&nbsp;<i>scrimmages</i>, or friendly matches against each other.<br><br>Btw, the tournament will most likely be Nebula because it's our most played gamemode. Therefore, all scrimmages will be a similar gamemode to Nebula.

Also, not all teams are for the tournament. There are "Fun clans" which are just teams for fun. I recommend these if you're not into the tournament/scrimming kind of groove, but either kind of team are great ways to communicate and make friends :D<br><br>And no problem, always here to help C:
