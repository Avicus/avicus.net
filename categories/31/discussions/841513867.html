We've been discussing this conundrum within certain staff groups recently. Along with the Atlas update, changes in the server rotations are going to be made because of both sheer necessity (changes in what game-modes we have to offer) but also out of the desire to improve the server. We all know that Destroy the Monument (DTM) is realistically the only game-mode actively played.<br><br>Understanding why other rotations aren't played is difficult to narrow down, but I might suggest these different possibilities (or the combination of them). I don't like to jump to the idea that DTM is the "most fun" or simply the "best" game Avicus has. While it may be true for some players, there are other factors contributing to its success as I see it.<br><br><ul><li>DTM is played most because <b>it is the most refined game-mode</b>. It has had the most updates and changes, especially to the maps.</li><li>DTM is played most because&nbsp;<b>it is the most understood game-mode</b>.<b>&nbsp;</b>New players learn what DTM is quickly because it is the only game-mode they can join. Throwback for example is the most active rotation, and it houses almost entirely DTM maps.&nbsp;This ties into the next reason as well.</li><li>DTM is played most because <b>it is the most played game-mode</b> (perpetual). Other rotations are difficult to get started considering the minimum player counts are in place (with good reason). They also don't have the momentum to keep them going. How do players ever get to know and love the other games!?</li></ul><br>We decided to open this discussion up to the forum community for suggestions. We want to know how you would organize the server. As we saw it, there are three options (any other ideas?), though an infinite number of possibilities through each.<br><br><ol><li><b>Mixed rotations:&nbsp;</b>All or nearly all of the servers on the network have a mixture of game-modes. The first map could be DTM, the next could be KOTH followed by another DTM, then CTW, etc. Naming could be back to how it was in the early Nebula stages with Greek names (for example).</li><li><b>Dedicated rotations:&nbsp;</b>Each rotation is dedicated to a specific game-mode. It would be something like: 1 DTM rotation, 1 CTW rotation, 1 TDM rotation, 1 KOTH rotation etc. You would <code>/server dtm</code> or <code>/server koth</code>.<br></li><li><b>Mixed + dedicated rotations: </b>Game-modes would get their own rotation, but there would also be mixed rotations. Note that our player count only gives us reason to have up to 7-10 servers, this would mean ~4-5 dedicated and ~3-4 mixed maximum.<br></li></ol>There are pros and cons to each with the single goal of giving other game-modes a chance. While mixed rotations face the challenge of giving users a potentially more confusing experience (switching games every 15 minutes), dedicated rotations or mixed + dedicated rotations are much like what we have now and may not help to address the goal we have in mind. Mixed rotations would expose users to different games, while dedicated rotations offer a more cohesive experience.<br><br>I typed a lot, now what do you have to say? <b>Do you want mixed, dedicated or a combination of both? Or do you have a different suggestion?</b>

In my personal opinion, i think that <b>mixed servers</b> would be ideal. It's already apparent that dedicated rotations don't work. We have been doing something similar to dedicated rotations for a long time now and it's just constantly Throwback, same map after same map. It honestly isn't fun anymore. When you have played these maps for almost 3 years you will know what i mean. I like the concept of Throwback but honestly, in my opinion, the maps are stalemate and are terrible. I mean no offence to the authors, they were good maps in the past but now they are old and have had their days.&nbsp;<br><br>What I'm afraid about the most is after all the endless work the Developers do with creating Atlas, creating CTF, Arcade, Skywars and many other modules, that people will play them for a few days and then go back to Throwback. I think as a community we need to be more open to new concepts and ideas. &nbsp;Yes i understand that a lot of the old regulars like Throwback, but honestly, we need to try new things. Although rotations like throwback might appeal to the "Old Veterans", we need something that appeals to new players. Mixed rotations, in my opinion, would.&nbsp;<br><br>We use to do a mixture of dedicated and mixed servers and that didn't work either.

FIX THE COMPASSES IN WALLS PLEASe it used to be&nbsp;always filled three servers with about 10-15 people in each game, I think part of the decline was when avicus lost many active players, devs took their minds off games that others don't play as often, so the number just kept decreasing, but Walls is still played by many, I would like it to be what It used to be, with compasses fixed.

Maybe just have a quick play button that sends you to a mixed gamemode server. Or even have a system where theres a set number of servers for each gamemode (like we have now) and then have users rotating through ones that are still in a pre-match state.

I would choose option 3 - both. I believe that both will let each user enjoy what they like, if I like only KOTH then i would play koth only. and if i feel like mixing id go to the mix.<br><br>P.S: ive made so many ctf and koth maps and atlas xml documentation hasnt been added (and/or clearly added) about both of these. could you do that asap so i could xml all my maps, because i heard avicus xml is different to ocn one (is it true?))

I think both mixed and dedicated would be nice, so the real DTM addicts can still play what they want.<br>Maybe a way to make the mixed ones more played, like a portal on spawn or anything like that, just for the mixed mode?

I think the <b>Mixed + Dedicated Rotations</b>&nbsp;would be most beneficial. But how about at least one <b>Voted Rotation</b>&nbsp;so the player majority can choose what map to be played next in the rotation (through a little, well possible big, magical coding of course). It is easy to predict that there may be a gamemode/map that will be constantly played a lot more, but perhaps the Mixed Rotations can change the players' minds on their favoring of maps. So why not, 4 Dedicated, 4 Mixed, and 1 Voted?

I think that there should be 4-5 mixed servers, however the way people choose their gamemode would be different.<br><br>The idea I had would be that there would be 4-5 servers cycling through the gamemodes in a set rotation: DTM--&gt;CTW--&gt;KOTH--&gt;TDM etc. And that the servers would be staggered on that rotation: if server 1 was DTM then server 2 would be CTW and so on.<br><br>Thie way people could always play the gamemode they wanted.&nbsp;<br><br>I also thought that people could pick specific rotations. So they could pick DTM and if server 1 was DTM then it would put them on server 1, and then, when the game ended they would be switched to the current server playing on DTM.<br><br><br><br>Edit: lol, looking back I just realised that this wouldn't work as different games would finish at different times. <br><br>I personally would prefer mixed :)

This may be off-topic, but yeah, they could even add a small plotworld server for mapmaking...<br>People would be able to see other's maps in progress, give them feedback/get inspiration and it would be a lot of fun ofcourse!<br>Also, it would get lots of new builders to help the server out.<br>Again, this may not be the right post to comment this on, but in my opinion it's a good idea :P

First, you have to do - ask yourself a question: would those old maps pass your requirements for new released maps? No? Delete them or allow changing.&nbsp;<br><br>Bring back Nebula as united server (mix DTM, CTW and TDM).&nbsp;<br><br>And so we get one server for each gamemode (Nebula, Nexus, CTH, Walls, SG, KoTH (different amount of hills), CTF, Sky Wars, Arcade, and other new gm?) and few (4-5) mix servers with short gamemodes (Nebula, KoTHs, CTF, CTH and Nexus(?))<br><br>I personally agree with the idea about sandbox area in the lobby.<br>Also make rotations cycled, without server restart in the end, if it is possible.

Personally, I think the player count is too small to offer both&nbsp;<b>dedicated&nbsp;</b><b>and mixed&nbsp;</b>rotations and expect at least one rotation from each style to be played <b>continuously</b>; exceptions during peak times, of course.&nbsp;<br><br>Here are some methods to fix the issue with public Avicus:<br><ul><li>Move away from the&nbsp;<b>Throwback</b> maps, I understand that rotation may hold some of the best rated and most <b>popular maps</b> in the entire world of the DTM gamemode.

Throwback is the most liked because the maps there are old and classic, not because they have good gameplay.

From what I have noticed, people join throwback because it's being played. Players don't want to start their own match since they don't want to spam to get players.

That's pretty much what happens everyday during AEST. If no one is on throwback then they are either in CTH or not on the server at all.

That isn't really the big issue as to why no one plays it. Walls and Survivial Games don't suffer from this glitch yet no one plays them. It's more of a fact that they either can't get matches going or it just gets boring after awhile.

People play Throwback because their favourite maps are on there. Remove Throwback and you will probably see people hating or asking "What happened to Throwback?". You can tell when Throwback goes down people really want it back up

I'm saying a lot of people like Throwback. The reason it hasn't been removed, I believe, is because people like the maps and you don't want to remove maps that people like. I remember Robin trying to get rid of them, but there are always people who are against it.

Yes, and what I'm saying is that there are also a lot of people who have had enough of throwback. If people like the maps then the ones that actually meet criteria can be put into the different mix servers.

I think if you would change the throwback rotations or replace some maps, most players won't even notice... They just play Throwback, because they're used to playing on that server, not because they like the maps.

i actually disagree with this. cth was always popular before this glitch, and if someone wanted to play walls or sg they wouldnt be playing it on avicus anyway. cth is a good gamemode with potential but it needs a bit of attention with regards to kits (tnt and enderman can be abused a lot) and ofcourse the fhg needs to be fixed

i gotta agree with alex, SG and Walls isnt really a gamemode someone would play on Avicus, and considering that the SG scene is starting to die down, might as well remove SG, as for walls idk but thats up to you guys (Sessp and Kylo) if you're still willing to keep it as a gamemode on avicus.<br><br>back to the cth thing, yes i actually missed playing this alot back around a year ago, now it barely has any games happening nowadays, maybe if you can come up with something like idk maybe a tourney that maybe attracts alot of the regulars to try and play for (yes im referring to the regulars who aren't in a team/ dont scrim) and also might wanna nerf the kits just a tad bit

I would "Bribe" players to play other gamemodes. For instance if you look at the stats and see that hunger games for example was the lowest played game this week, you could make hunger games have 2 times the amount of credits and rewards. This way the people who push for credits play more different types of gamemodes. You could even go as far and slowly lower the amount of points gained from the more played games.&nbsp;<br><br>I also feel that getting rid of Throwback and sprinkling all the maps across the other nebula servers would also work well.<br><br>Also having more low key tournaments that include walls, HG, etc would encourage the teams to look for players who are skilled in these games causing the players to learn certain strategies and such from the game by playing them.<br><br><br>I feel like the mixed gamemode is a good idea, but dont integrate all of the servers. leave some how they are (The servers with longer games: Walls, hg, etc.)

Nicely said. <br>I am not bored of the maps, however, I really agree on the idea that we should have rotations. <br>Like this, people can not only enjoy all the games, but Avicus could be a more "well-known" server. <br>When I, and other people film Avicus, it would be great if it could show not only DTM, but CTW, KOTH, and etc. <br><br>But I think that people would enjoy more if we had this rotation. <br>That is my opinion. xD

Heyo because you're a map rev i hav a suggestion.&nbsp;<br><br>Quant00s has 2 monuments, which are basically impossible to get because of the map being a bowspam heaven and the monuments being really far away. Make it 3 monuments like Ternio, like a triangle and make the left and right monuments closer. That way games will be less stalemate.
