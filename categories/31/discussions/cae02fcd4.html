hi,<br>I am writing because I would like to talk about bullying.I am aware that this server is a great server and every member of the community is kind and caring.But...I have noticed that some people have been name calling(could it be bullying?)and ganging up on others.If you are a bully I suggest you stop before it gets serious and turn your self around,any bullying that is seen will not be tolerated and I'm sure that staff member will deal punishment(not sure).Anyway , if you are being bullied please tell me in the comments and I'm sure it will be dealt with.<br><br>regards,<br>endergodx

/report doesn't always solve everything in all honesty, sometimes we arrive a bit too late to see the bullying. As Zoom has said {Thanks Zoom!}



1.Take a screenshot of said bullys bullying player. 




2.Uplaod it to imgur. 




3.File a report on the players.

If you're trying to put an entire group of people to a stop with one thread, it's not gonna work. You've written a little over a paragraph about trying to bring an issue to its knees. Bullies won't stop because you tell them too, and that's true for almost any other real problem you encounter anywhere else in this universe. You can raise awareness, you can submit reports, but I guarantee that the only way to stop someone like this is to let them wake up and stop themselves.

From my knowledge as a staff member, we get multiple reports regarding bullying since it's widely known on how harmful it really is!

Just to put bullying in simple terms... DON'T BULLY OTHER PEOPLE!!! I have had countless friends be bullied throughout my lifetime, including me. It hurts and you feel down like you can do anything. I can give forgiveness for almost anything, but bullying is one of the things that I have a hard time with. It isn't&nbsp;nice to take your anger out on other people, especially some people you rarely know.&nbsp;<br><br>So just to Summarize,<br>Bullying can end peoples lives and it can chase others to feel worse about themselves. If you see any signs of bullying please report it to staff immediately!!&nbsp;<br><br>Regards,<br>Riley :]

Personally, being insulted by a figure made of geometric shapes with 16 bit pixels plastered onto em doesn't make me that emotionally hurt. :P

well say if it was very hurtful it could stop someone playing on the server which I'm sure is a terrible thing as that person can then spread rumors about how bad our community is.

Why don't do people just ignore or face them? It's not that hard.<br>I know the depression counts and that people get scared if they see them but there must be a time in your life where you need to face your fears.

yes very true there,one of the factors of why your being bullied is not standing up to them and being weak.If you stand up to them and maybe beat them you could be known as a tough one and could also befriend the bully.
