Hey Everyone! I was just thinking with a couple of friends about an idea. I know that there are official tournies that will occur weekly from now on, but I kind of wanted to kick things off with an idea for a tourney. Basically it will be a&nbsp;<b>Walls</b> Tournament. There will be 4-6 People on each team, and you will play with 3 other teams for each round.&nbsp;<br><br>Right now I'm just trying to get a general interest level in this idea so that I can start the planning for it soon.<br><br>So,<br>Who's interested?

I'd say 4-5 players per team, 6 is too high and 5 is borderline&nbsp;<br><br>If this actually becomes a thing, please ban certain kits (and maybe let teams do a kit veto to make it more interesting, too).&nbsp;<br><br>I mean, I'd do it.

I would suggest Mini Walls, The Village, Vanilla, Garden, and all 3 Tetris maps for the map pool. I also agree with Springwood as the final.

I don't know if I would suggest a mini map or&nbsp;<i>all</i> the Tetris maps since they all have the same gameplay. &nbsp;Since these games will have teams of 4 I think it could play out like the team with the last 2 or 3 teams standing advance. &nbsp;I advise The Village, The Garden, and another map. &nbsp;Then Springwood being the final map played.

If i had to pick one Tetris map, Tetris Swamp is the best one gameplay wise.

Well those are the only maps with consistent resources and a general lack of OP items that also have good gameplay.
