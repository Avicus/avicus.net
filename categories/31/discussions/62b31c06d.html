A "/staff" command to see what staff is online in the current match you're in.<br><br>Similarly, perhaps a "/staff global" or "/staff all" to see how many staff are on all the servers and what server they're on.

Actually for staff let me give you pros and cons.<br>Pros: you can tell a staff if a guy is breaking some rules<br>Cons: if like hackers are on and they do /staff , they will know staff is on and they go onto a different server to hack.<br>it blows the cover of staff

From experience, I can tell you that most if not all hackers will hack anyway.<br><br>Also, most hackers that come on servers are normally one-timers, if they get banned it doesn't "matter" for them because they never went on regularly in the first place.<br><br>If a staff command was put in-place I think that it wouldn't change much in terms of hackers.
