I wanted to donate to Avicus. I tried donating for emerald($50) with a prepaid card. I went on the shop tab and entered my username. I decided to use Google wallet, instead of paypal. I entered my info and for some reason, the transaction was unsuccessful. I tried again, kind of frustrated and double-checking.Once again, It was unsuccessful. I was wondering why it wasn't working. So, I got my card checked and the balance was changed. I checked the transactions from the card and it said that there were <b><u>2</u></b> $50 transactions from Avicus. After 30 minutes, my rank hasn't been changed. Please help me with m problem because I don't want to lose my $100.

As QFrog has already stated, after 12 hours email support@avicus.net if you haven't received the rank.<br><br><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>You should receive Diamond considering you spent $100
