Avicus was created in the Avicore update which I believe was November 2nd. 2013? Don't quote me on that though.

I think Avicore was around May but McZone was probably 2 years ago.

Well I think it was made roughly 3 years ago when it wasn't called Avicus I used to play it when I was 10 . And my favourite old hub was the hub in the sky with the nether portals I would love to have another hub like that one !

McZone was made roughly three years ago, then evolved to Avicus on November 2nd, 2013. Before McZone, Ivy had a survival server (I think?) called Terrascape.

The server dates back much further than McZone, back when Parapenguin developed the plugin solo.

It used to be McZone, which is why some of the small Nebula maps have McZone as their category.<br><br>However, I have not been on Avicus for a long time, but I guess around 3 years.
