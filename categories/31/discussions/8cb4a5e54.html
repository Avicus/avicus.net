<i>Hey everyone, this is just a helpful little post about dealing with nerves on the day of your Jr Mod interview. I understand some may find it daunting, scary, nerve-racking and more. But these simple tricks will calm your nerves and make it easier on yourself.</i><br><b>[Before the Waiting Room]</b><br>1. Be prompt! Don’t rush in at the last minute, you can just be chilling in a public chat until it’s time. Rushing doesn’t calm you!<br><b><br>[In the Waiting Room]</b><br>1. Take deep breaths. If your heart is racing, and you feel nervous, take three deep breaths. Breathe in through your nose for 5 seconds, hold it for 3, then let it out for 5 seconds. Repeat the process 3 times. It helps!<br>2. (Note that this doesn’t work for all people) If you feel scared, blow gently on your thumb. Your thumb contains nerve pathways to your brain that tell you to relax. Try it!<br>3. Talk. There will be others in the room with you, so why not talk? Don’t blab on about how you’re “going to fail” and “shouldn’t be here”. Talk about anything (appropriate, however ;D) it calms your nerves when you talk. <br>4. Listen to the Admin/Senior Moderator that comes in every so often. They aren’t there to scare you! They will give important information out, such as who is going next, and other instructions. Listen to avoid the fretting of “What did I miss?” afterward!<br>5. Have a glass of cool water next to you. You’ll find that your throat goes dry when you’re nervous, so remember to drink when needed!<br>6. Lastly, go to the toilet. You’d be surprised what nerves do to you, so go to the toilet beforehand! I know I did 5 times!<br><b><br>[In the Interview]</b><br>1. This is very important. You have to remove distractions. It could be that pesky Rubix Cube next to you, or a school paper. Leave it, remove it from your sight.<br>2. Don’t speak to fast! You need your interviewer to be able to understand you. Pace yourself.<br>3. If possible, try to not have tons of background noise. It can be hard for you to hear your interviewer, and for the interviewer to hear you!<br>4. I know, this one isn’t totally avoidable, but worth a shot. Try have a secure internet connection. Nothing is more annoying than dropping out during your interview!<br>5. Be organised. Have things that you might need with you on your desktop/next to you.<br>6. Last, but most certainly not least, be yourself. That’s all you can do. Be honest and be yourself. If you act like someone you aren’t, it only comes back to nip you later!<br><br>Don’t worry if you weren’t accepted. There’s always next time!<br>I hope this helped!<br>-Elsa

Another thing is, just talk in your interview naturally. You shouldn't have to force words out of your mouth. It should just feel like talking to Michael on TS normally. Treating this too formally would lead to neevousness, causing you to mess up. Trust me, I know this from having interviews twice.

Also, make sure to say&nbsp;<b>exactly</b> what you really would do.&nbsp;<br><br>For example.<br><br>Question: How often do you use the bathroom every day?<br><br>What you say: Around 2 times a day.<br><br>What you actually do: Around 12 times a day.<br><br>Sorry, I couldn't come up with any better questions, but you get the point. Be yourself.

A good way to fight nerves is to chew gum.&nbsp; This is a little way of telling your brain that you are in no immediate danger and if you were, you wouldn't be able to eat.&nbsp; However, I don't suggest chewing gum <b><b>during your interview.</b></b>&nbsp; Just while in the waiting room.&nbsp; Also, think of the interview as a conversation with a bunch of people you have played in game with.&nbsp; The only difference, they are asking you questions.&nbsp; Good luck to all those accepted!

I dont understand why you need to be nervous. Why is everyone so nervous? I am never nervous during my interview. To me i just think its an average team speak chat and people are just asking me questions, which happens all the time.

The one thing you shouldn't do is lie. And when I applied the first time, I believe it was Snow who had told us to keep our applications out since they might be able to help us. I had mine open but had to restart my PC and before I knew it, it was my turn. Turns out, snow was right and they actually did ask a question that was on the staff app.<br><br><br>Keep those staff apps out during the interviews guys! Try not to reads it word for word, just use it as a thing to stop your nervousness. :3

I'm gonna add a little bit of advice from me. Be yourself, sound exactly like you want to sound and make sure that you are confident going into the interview. you will be asked some hard questions so just be prepared! I would also suggest studying up on the Punishments list, because that is crucial to how a moderating works.<br><br>Good Luck, and can't wait to help train some jr. mods!

Although I have never been in the moment, of getting interviewed, I understand if you are nervous. Basically, when you are getting interviewed, be yourself. Just stay calm, and relax while answering the questions.

I'm sure the interviewers prefer it on TeamSpeak, so if you could get that, do it.<br><br>However if there is something wrong with you being able to download it, they might make an exception and interview you over Skype. That's how it was when I first applied. You'd have to contact a Sr. Staff member for further confirmation, though.

Nobody is trying to make you mad.<br><br>I simply took issue with your assertion that you were denied "for a stupid reason", because it implies that the application system is faulty in terms of its criteria. You were given a clear reason for denial, and if you want to understand your situation better, think about that reason in a slightly less subjective manner.<br><br>If you think that your denial reason is legitimately false, then please contact a senior staff member.

mhm. that doesn't change the fact that you inserted yourself into something that didn't involve you at all. and you don't know the whole story behind why i was denied, so stop acting like you do.

You cannot be toxic for&nbsp;one week and then&nbsp;next week&nbsp;change your attitude&nbsp;and expect everyone to like you and for you to get staff. To be honest, I wouldn't of accepted you either. I like you as a person, but I don't think you are ready for a position yet. Making shit posts on the forum in the past on how the server is trash &nbsp;really didn't help your running either. You can quit, it wouldn't make you look any better. I've been denied three times. It's a moderator position on a Minecraft server. Sure, its fun and could mean a lot, but its not something I am going to cry about. Just look at your grammar, <b>"so I don't rlly don't wtf r they looking for " </b>this is also something they look at, and if you application looked like this, then it most likely was denied. You need to look and act professional, starting with your comments.

Like Crazy said, there is a difference between being lenient and accepting every application. We're being lenient by accepting more applications than usual and dropping our standards slightly. Just because we say activity is important in this batch, doesn't mean we're going to ignore other character traits important to being a moderator, which are still necessary when we consider who to give an interview and a trial to.

So you are leaving because you didnt get accepted? If you keep this behaviour you maybe wont possibilites un other aspects of your life. You just have to try next time, watching what you did bad and doing something to change It. Dont give up just because you arent accord with the decision of the Staff

Lmfao. You act like you know why i'm done here. Staff apps had little to nothing to do with this. &nbsp;there are so many more factors that are more important and go beyond this server. stop acting like you understand the situation.

Alright, that's enough. You've been asked to stop by a moderator already. You can continue this argument somewhere else appropriate, unlike this thread. Regarding staff application concerns, feel free to contact any senior staff via DM. Consequences will follow if you ignore this, thanks!
