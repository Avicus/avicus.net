YO YO YOOOO<br>Just wanted to let you all know I stepped down from my Administrator position to a Moderator. I will not disclose why, but I plan to release that sometime soon.&nbsp;<br><br>Thanks everyone for your support, even though it's been a bumpy ride. I will work just as hard as a Moderator, and I'm sure it'll be fun!&nbsp;<br>My replacement is due soon.<br><br>Thanks once again,<br>Fluenza,<br>Former Staff Administrator.

Words can't even describe how much you mean to me, Joel. You were there as a Moderator, alongside me. You were there with me as a Senior Moderator while I was still a rank below you, and somehow after how long we've been here together, you stayed next to me.<br><br>The fact that you supported me in becoming Gill's successor, showing me the ropes, the ups and the downs, etc. How late at night we'd stay up just so we could talk.. You mean so much to me, Joel. You have never left my side before, and let's hope that day never comes.&nbsp;<br><br>At this point in time, Joel, I can truthfully say that you are my best friend. I cherish everything you've helped me through, and everything we've done. I'll never forget it.<br><br>Take care, -Jake

You've been my role model ever since I was just a regular, and you were a Moderator. Thanks for everything you've done as an Administrator, for everything you've taught us, for all the help and all the time you've spend on here.

Well, you were very busy as an admin. I guess that's why you stepped down, I know how much work you put in, but I also know your amazing care for the server as well, and I know it must have been hard for you to step down, knowing that you care so much about the server. I thought you were a good admin, personally, always trying to help others out despite your workload. Yes, you had flaws, but don't we all? &nbsp;You did a great job keeping everything in check, but I guess we all need a break once in a while, assuming that's the reason you stepped down. Gl with everything and school, and thanks for all the hard work, Joel. <br><br>Good luck with all future endeavors,&nbsp;<br><br>-Stimulating/ShadowSlayerZ7/Jackson<br><br>P.S.

I think it's because technically Administrator and Senior Mod are known as "Sr Staff", which means they are the higher ups in the staff team and demands more work, which I am assuming Jozz didn't want to be in that area of Sr Staff, but to be Moderator instead. Correct me if I'm wrong, Jozz.

Well I think it's because being an admin and taking care of avicus is so stressful, that he couldn't take it anymore. So he moved down to moderator cause apparently admin was too much.

The main reason why I stepped down was because I had to endure all the community backlash, staff were getting chaotic, communicational misunderstandings and it truly reflected how I did as an Administrator. Don't get me wrong, I loved working with past and present staff members!

Thanks, Fluenza. It was nice having you as an Admin. You knew when to give punishments, you could be serious when needed, and so much more. I really appreciate you're work for the server. Let's see if your replacement will do as great as you did.

Know the backlash I've caused was trying to improve the server (solving issues)/right wrongs I felt had been done (forums ban).&nbsp;<br><br>Know I only wanted the best, even if I did sink my teeth in. It was only because I was frustrated/disappointed, because I knew this server could improve and be something great. Don't get me wrong, you were doing fine, better than fine tbh. You were doing great. I think the only reason there's so much community backlash, is because we all see the immense potential of the server, and are kinda sad because Avi hasn't realized it's full potential yet, and it's taking a while to get there.

I wasn't directing anything at you, so don't feel guilty. It was the players who blatantly disrespected staff, and it did reflect how I did as an Admin. So technically, it was my fault, haha!
