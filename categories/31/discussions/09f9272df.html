Why bother punishing players for saying overcasts ip. Everyone knows what ocn is and if they really wanted to play on it, they would just look up the ip.

Being retired doesn't mean the person leaves Minecraft, probably, that person just got tired of Moderating or playing this server.

They will probably go to OCN since the staff team their are like 14-18 years old. Its much more suitable for them.
