At the moment avicus is basically building a house for a broken foundation.&nbsp;<br><br>So, advertisments are coming to avicus soon? Alright cool, that's great! But there is no point.<br>&nbsp;Every time I join avicus there are these stupid issues that you need to fix, otherwise players will just leave. There is really no point getting players on if they will just leave.<br>To start of with everything, the blocklag is just insane. How is a rusher suppose to rush if he cant jump along the walls. How is he suppose to make good and fast bridges if the blocks will just dissapear? What's the point making the skybridge better, when anticheat thinks you're using macros just because you place 3 blocks fast.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;I'll admit, I have no solution to fix this, because I don't know anything abuout developing a server. But lag is basically a big foundation for a big house. And what's the point building the house if the foundation is just, not working?<br>&nbsp;<br>Then we also got these random lagspikes that appears for no reason (as far as I know). They make players build up a rage, make them unhappy that will lead to being a bad sport. They will leave, it's just as simple as that. I saw a jr. mod type "Relog or just wait it out". We aren't suppose to have to do that, we must be able to have a good gameplay without lag. And this lag appear for everyone, I have a fairly strong pc with a 760 card and still get it.&nbsp;<br><br>Then we got all these minum and smal bugs, some are:<br>CTH fire, why do you respawn with fire? That's just annoying..<br>Fasthit glitch, we all know about this.&nbsp;<br>And there is probably a ton of others. That I can't be asked to find.<br><br>A lot of maps also need improvment or just being removed, even if they are old. By just looking at 50% of the avicus maps they are just too small, bringing a bad gameplay or is just somewhat wrong.<br>Another issues I also have with maps is the regions, people can build out 200 blocks in the void and from there start to make a bridge to the monument (<a href="http://prntscr.com/75wt6e" title="Link: http://prntscr.com/75wt6e">http://prntscr.com/75wt6e</a>). Lately I havn't tested it, but hightlimits (if they aren't fixed) should really be put in to "every" map.<br><br>Ow, and jr mods, don't be Robots. I know it can be hard, I was there once aswell. But just be you.&nbsp;<br>And one more thing, I'm not saying this to make a war, I'm saying this because I want to see avicus improve.

I don't experience no block lag even on bad wi-fi with bad ping! And we know about some glitches and I'm sure they will try and fix them hopefully I'm not sure though for sure! And the maps being old is your opinion against alot others I agree some maps are bad but others like them so Avicus has to compromise!

Here's a list of my problems:<br><br><ul><li>Ghost hitting (for a split second after you die, you can hit someone else, annoying in maps like Zao)</li><li>Block lag (placing and destroying)</li><li>Lagspikes (I can live with them)</li><li>Fast hit</li><li>The fire glitch Robin mentioned</li><li>Compasses don't always work in the pre-game (pretty minor)</li><li>You can take off armor in CTH (ninjas=OP)</li></ul><br>Honeslty these are annoying but I can live with most of them. That being said, I still think they could be fixed.

Actually on almost every nebula map is a height limit, but keep in mind some maps don't need them.<br>Avicus uses a custom anticheat plugin that affects the game almost in no way.<br>I have a pretty bad laptop and I don't get any block-lag, even if I ninja bridge.<br>I also don't get random lag spikes. I only get them, because I have too many tabs in my browser open and they are reloading.<br>CTH fire bug is a minecraft bug on avicus fault.<br>Fast Hit glitch is a client issue, you just have to relog.<br>Avicus has a average player count of 100-200 players daily and why should we have 200-300 blocks big maps when only 20 players are playing on that map?

Alright so, you made some fairs points.<br><br>1. As I said, I wasnt too sure on this with hightlimits. You've proven me wrong.<br>2. It clearly does doe I can't use a icarus and I can't place blocks fast.<br>3.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL7JWK2-SiI" title="Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL7JWK2-SiI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL7JWK2-SiI</a><br>4. I recived a few just this morning.<br>5. Then they will find a way to fix it, because it is a bug.<br>6. They need to fix this aswell.<br>7. I do not think we have the same picture when I say small and big maps.

As in you aren't aware of the issues/missing additions at hand in-game.<br>I've heard so many players claim they have sent you evidence on these issues/missing additions, but nothing has been done.<br>For example, like the time I asked you in TS "When will you be able to invite people to scrim servers", and you replied with "It'll most likely be done by tomorrow", this was about 2-3 weeks ago.

As in you aren't aware of the issues/missing additions at hand in-game.<br>I've heard so many players claim they have sent you evidence on these issues/missing additions, but nothing has been done.<br>For example, like the time I asked you in TS "When will you be able to invite people to scrim servers", and you replied with "It'll most likely be done by tomorrow", this was about 2-3 weeks ago.

I'm aware of many of the issues listed here, I was asking for video of the server lag spikes specifically because I am doubtful of it and no one has sent evidence of that specifically. It might help in the process of fixing the issue, but there's no guarantees there.<br><br>I've been busy with things outside of the realm of Minecraft, hopefully you can understand that.

The server can't impact FPS at all except through entities or blocks. I don't think the server/plugins are at fault here... If someone can verify this happens to them that might slightly change things, but our plugins don't do any things like that so I'd still be pretty skeptical.<br><br>Edit: Also, things are going on in your game while the client lag is occurring.

Things to fix:<br><ul><li>KB: To start with, it's worse than Kohi's. Basically, I can straight-line someone (Hybrid-blocking him) and he would just move 1/2 of a block. Some other times, players get launched over 10 blocks away and getting on another island just like if they had fly or somekind of stuff similar to that.</li><li>Scrimmage Servers: They're a joke. What's the point on using them if you can't play against other teams?</li><li>Block Lag: It was ok till the update but then became a disaster once it was announced. Let's say you wanna rush. If you rush a lot here you should know wall-placing is a big factor for rushers, well then, the only thing block-lag is doing is making us fall off the world everytime making it annoying if rushing is the only thing you like to do here.</li><li>And tons of other stuff I can't think of right now.</li></ul>

Block lag has caused at least 1/10 of my deaths.

This has happened to me numerous times, and I can assure you it's not Client Side.<br>Everytime this has happened to me, I ask in chat if anyone else just had a massive lag spike, and about half the servers responds of a "yes".<br>This also occurs on Rendezvous 3 a lot.

We don't plan to advertise on Avicus, what you mean by that?<br><br>Not sure of any server side lag spikes... If you could report them that'd be good because I haven't seen any reports with clear evidence.

Guys but seriously shut up.<br><br>Report issues at github they will be fixed quicker then.<br><br>Don't just look at what's bad about avicus but also look at what's so great about it. If you are still here you obviously like avicus... Since the update I have not seen ONE thanks to Kylo for all the work he has done and everyone else who worked on it.&nbsp;<br><br>These posts are becoming too frequent and they all day the same things...

Really? Not even one thanks to Kylo? I'm pretty sure you haven't seen the official post about the update.<br>Also, we look at the bad stuff Avicus has because it doesn't let us play correctly/well, so it's starting to get a bit annoying + I think I've seen <b>you&nbsp;</b>in chat complaining about this issues too.
