@Peter Yes, rap with explicit language&nbsp;<b>is</b> allowed<br>@Vobaseball12 We just went really inactive and still are, really just 99 and I are running this until Midnite, Sky and not too sure but Peachy go active as well (we are all on the Plug DJ team). But since 99 can't come and help host this week I will be the host for this weeks event :)<br>@glitchy No :c Too explicit xd.
