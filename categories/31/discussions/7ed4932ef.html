  <h1>Map Developer Policy <small>New! <i class="icon-ok"></i></small></h1>
</div>
As far as I know, we've never had a separate Map Developer Policy to go by. Over the last few days, i've been implementing one with some ideas from the map developers and admins. Some new rules, warning systems and restrictions will be in place as of today. Map Developers are to follow the policy at all times. We will be raising the bar for expectations as well. In the future, don't be suprised if things change around in the map development team. We hope that this improves our efficiency.<br><br>
<div class="page-header">
  <h1>Head Map Developers <small>Map Sector <i class="icon-ok"></i></small></h1>
</div>
I'm sure quite a few people know this already, but a few days ago, timaeusTestified (also known as Evocal) retired from head/map developer. He's worked really hard for over a year now. Presenting new ideas to Avicus and maintaining the map development team to the best of his ability. Currently, there is no one to take his place as the head map developer in the maps sector, so we will be reverting back to one head map developer until we can figure this stuff out. Anyways, thanks for all your hard work, Evo!<br><br>
<div class="page-header">
  <h1>Map Testing <small>Community Event <i class="icon-remove"></i></small></h1>
</div>
Recently, there have been maps piling up on Trello. Soon enough or later, we're going to host another map testing event. This time might be different with a double credit boost + map testing event on a given server. This is not 100% yet, so don't expect too much. In the near future, we will confirm it and make a thread about which maps are going to be in testing for the event. Be sure to stay tuned for this!<br><br>

<b>Credit Boost Idea:</b> On a certain server, there will be a double credit booster implemented into the map testing event. The booster would last until the event ends. It's quite a simple concept. Hoping that we can pull this off.
<div class="page-header">
  <h1>Rotations <small>Throwback <i class="icon-remove"></i></small></h1>
</div>
With some ideas from the staff team, we will be readjusting the throwback server a bit. Removing some maps and whatnot (even though we just had a map reassessment on it). After that is done, we will be removing the throwback server temporarily and re-introduce it every now and then (maybe 1 week per month or so). If you're going to give feedback on this, please don't say to keep a map just because it's your favourite map, or your feedback may be ignored. The main reason we are doing this is because it would make the maps have more of a nostalgic feeling.<br><br>
  <h1>Gamemode Assignments <small>Edited <i class="icon-ok"></i></small></h1>

With the recent changes in the map development team, the gamemode assignments have been changed up a bit. Everyone will now have to manage nebula and one other gamemode. Here's what it currently looks like:<br><br>
<b>- Slyae:</b> Nebula, Nexus, Walls<br>
<b>- Kavinsky:</b> Nebula, SG<br>
<b>- Skyadia:</b> Nebula, CTH<br>
<b>- Zerkk:</b> Nebula, Walls<br>
<b>- Pavlo:</b> Nebula, SG<br>
<b>- Mango_:</b> Nebula, CTH <b>​[optional]</b><br>
<b>- Fluenza:</b> Nebula, Nexus ​<b>[optional]</b><br>​
<b>- steven5703:</b> Nebula, Nexus ​<b>[temp retirement]</b><br><br>
<b>Tournament:</b> Slyae and Pavlo<br><br>
<h1>Extra <small>Tweaking <i class="icon-remove"></i></small></h1>

Lots of people wanted to stop having so much aesthetics in maps and instead, improve the game-play of maps overall. We also agree with this opinion and we're trying to come up with some ideas on how to improve it. In the next few weeks/months, we will be tweaking some maps and trying to make the game-play of them better (removing some aesthetics and such). We hope that you are satisfied with this. That's all for now.<br><br><br>
There's not too many updates at the moment, but if something changes, we will inform you about it.<br>
Thanks and have a wonderful day!

You said you would improve gameply and remove &nbsp;aesthetics, surely you could retain aesthetics as well as improving gameplay in most cases?

Yeah, but not for all maps. Considering most of them apparently lag due to the insane amount of aesthetics.

RIP Throwback. IMO I think that we don't have enough players as it is and if we remove the throwback server for 3/4 weeks, then we might lose even more.
