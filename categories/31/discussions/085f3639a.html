Hey,<br><br>Just wanted to inform the community on the account that the map development team <b>has added height limits to all walls maps</b> excluding <b>Garden </b>and <b>The Village</b>. I want to state a few things below, and if you want to you can ask your own question. Keep in mind <b>we did this due to community complaints about stalematey matches and annoying bases</b>. If I made this change and you guys complain, it's<b> hypocritical</b> because <b>I'm sure most of you know how many complaints there were</b> in team chat on Walls.<br><br><i><u>Why not those 2 maps?</u></i><br>Garden was broken on Build, and was just a void world even after teleporting to the map coordinates. It'll be given a height limit later. The Village download is terribly corrupted, so when that's fixed I'll do a height limit for that one too.<br><br><i><u>Will I still be able to make skybases?</u></i><br>Of course! Just not up to like Y: 200... It depends on the map as all of them are custom regioned, but you can still go up say, 64 blocks up most likely. There's only a few maps where it's really low such as Playground.&nbsp;<br><br><i><u>When will these take effect?</u></i><br>No, not nise update. Now! The height limits are in effect once the servers restart.<br><br><u><i>What do I do if a server is broken?</i></u><br>Then that'd be a YML issue due to my faulty regioning I did when I'm supposed to sleep. Report the YML issue on GitHub and detail it as best you can, and I'll get around to fixing it as soon as I can.&nbsp;<br><br><u><i>When will this roll out to Nebula and other gamemodes?</i></u><br>We're going to do our best to roll it out soon, but there's no guarantee if it'll be in the nise update or not. Could be before, could be after. The map development team has been instructed to do height limits for them, so it's a matter of how much time we have on our plate.<br><br><i><u>Are height limits mandatory now? How do I add them?</u></i><br>Height limits aren't actually mandatory, but they're preferred for smoother gameplay. If you want a height limit removed from your map, please contact a map developer. As for how to add them, you have to make an anti-building region and name it "height-limit" in the YML, spanning from the height you don't want players to build at all the way to 256. If you are not capable of doing this, I am offering to do it for you. HMU. Cuboids are preferred for the height limits, as all current walls maps use them.<br><br><i><u>We hate you, mapdevs.</u></i><br>Ok.

Same, I believe adding this to Nebula maps will just eliminate one way of breaking through tough defense. But walls skybases were, ugh.
