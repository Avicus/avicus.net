i was looking through other peoples profiles and some of the infractions are just plain stupid. Like inapropaite skin, inapropaite username, and inapropaite cape. I mean really? And people on the server calling mineplex corrupted. I'm really starting to think the staff enjoy giving infractions to players. A couple years ago in minecraft when players were given infractions it was because they were ruining the community and the other players gameplay. But nowadays giving infractions is just a game. Let me ask you, does a bunch of pixels shaped like penis bother you? Does it ruin your gameplay on the server?

This is the biggest problem you could ever point out.<br><br>I don't know about you but, naked women skins, penis capes and names like "killallblacks" are annoying and this affects my gameplay, I don't know about you

"Giving out infractions is just a game now".<br><br>Wake up. Minecraft is a game. Everything you do in it is a game. Giving out punishments is not an exception. At the end, it's all just a game.&nbsp;<br><br>On the inappropriate infractions, it's for the younger part of the community. I don't think stupid infractions are a thing but. Every infraction has an explanation behind it.&nbsp;<br><br>What at really is a problem is the lack of judgement before giving out an infraction.

Not allowing inappropriate names and skins is a universal rule across most servers.<br>It will ruin someone's day if they get offended it.<br>All those infractions make sense and are logical.

You'll find quite a lot of people don't really appreciate seeing any form of nudity, racism, immaturity or<br>homophobia on Avicus, especially our younger members, if something inappropriate won't be tolerated in chat, there's no reason why it should be tolerated in nay other form.

In my opinion offensive capes should be allowed, it's stupid. And if you have a problem with them you can easily disable them.<br>However, names and skins isnt something you can really disable.

Offensive names and skins do not refer to inappropriate sexual references solely. It can also cover racist terms, homophobic terms, sexist terms, etc. that can offend other players. If these words and insults are not tolerated in the chat, it is only logical that they are not tolerated in usernames, as they are intended to cause offence and thus they may disrupt the game-play of other players.

For littler kids playing Avicus or any other server, then inappropriate sexual references should be regulated so they don't need to deal with it.&nbsp;<br>As for racist/homophobic/sexist/whatever names those piss me off personally and should be punished.

I do not believe we are being dishonest. It says right in the rules to not use inappropriate skins or usernames. “B1. Your Minecraft username and skin must be appropriate for all ages. Objectionable usernames and skins will not be tolerated.”(Avicus, 2016) &nbsp;I do also believe that everyone knows when you break the rules you will be punished and it even says on the punishing guidelines that are public to the community that it will earn the user a ban or temban depending on what the situation is.

I do not believe we are being dishonest. It says right in the rules to not use inappropriate skins or usernames. “B1. Your Minecraft username and skin must be appropriate for all ages. Objectionable usernames and skins will not be tolerated.”(Avicus, 2016) &nbsp;I do also believe that everyone knows when you break the rules you will be punished and it even says on the punishing guidelines that are public to the community that it will earn the user a ban or temban depending on what the situation is.

Regarding the junior mods, yes there has been junior mods in the past that have been racking up infractions to look good. In reality it does not look good at all to the mentors and the senior staff team. Every junior mod that has been on trial has failed when they go on with that attitude and refuse to listen to one of the mentors when they tell them it does not look good.&nbsp;Yes, I do agree that things can be done to improve the trial system if something like this can happen and it does not look good for the server.<br><br>Calling the staff team corrupt for having the rules is out of line and he did not have proof to back it up. Also if he does have a problem with the rules and/or certain staff members, he is welcome to contact the senior staff/mentors or make a constructive criticism thread that pin points what is going wrong and what should happen with keeping an open mind. Those make the staff listen to the community more than some complaining thread that is seen over and over again.<br><br>You are not being intrusive ;)

Aside from the obvious "it's inappropriate for kids" reason, another reason why this rule is in place is to maintain the sever's brand reputation. If you let a bunch of entitled, racist 12 year olds wild onto the server, it doesn't make for a good image for Avicus.<br><br>Also, if you're seriously questioning why this rule is in affect then that reflects yourself more than it does the server.

As others have said, skins of someone naked don't personally offend me. Though, I'll still punish for it due to protocol. The names/skins I dislike are the ones that are homophobic/racist/discriminatory in any way.<br><br>People take offense to different things, the easiest solution was to make all of these "offensive" skins/names punishable, so it was done. It's honestly not that big a deal. Dont change your skin or name to something offensive and stupid.

None of this personally offends me, but there's no logical reason to change your skin or cape to that. Just make or find a skin that you like and keep it. There is absolutely no reason to have a inappropriate caps or skin. The only reason I can think of would be to troll, and trolling can involve a lot of stuff, spamming, being very rude to people for no reason. (As a troll, because apparently it's funny to make fun of people now?) Now, this could be a friend messing with another friend, that's different, but there's no real reason to have to have someone be offended by a skin or cape. Just keep them away and no one gets offended. Simple as that.
