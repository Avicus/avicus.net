When you do a monthly donation, will you pay the monthly fee until you have paid the full price which you would pay all at once. Like Gold is $25 would you pay $5 dollars for 5 months?

It does keller. For example, Gold is $5 a month, and $25 as a one-time payment.

You would probably have to directly ask funky for a paypal I believe. Otherwise no.

look I know this is the wrong group to chat about my ban but what can I do to get unbanned? You have no idea how much I want to go to this server, yeah I know you dont care but please loook at it from my point of view, I have been banned for months. can you just tempban me if you want for like a month or something. Please not a permanent ban. That is longer then five years. What if I still want to join in five years but I can't because Iv'e been banned for what I think no reason and the people I tell, they think it was not worth a permanent ban. So please tell me how to get unbanned.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Oh and I don't know why you don't believe me. Please tell me why you don't believe my "Story"

If you come back in 5 years there will be brand new staff xd.<br>I'm sure they will unban you in 5 years since you waited that long you are surely trust worthy xd.<br><br>And you shouldn't be advertising other servers on this server xD.<br>It's a basic knowledge.<br>Have fun waiting 5 years if Avicus is still there!<br>If not good luck getting unbanned xd

I wasnt advertising, my dumb brother got on my computer and changed my account info to get himself unbanned, we share the same computer. He asked a mod to unban his other account so he wouldnt have to use mine. so he checked the Ip's and saw it was the same ip so he thinks I had two accounts and that I tried to get myself unbannd. I played on this server with my account like half the time, he was on it for basicly the other half. I have been banned for sooo long and I woud like to finally be unbanned.

Why does your other account have the same name then but without any "_"
