Look everyone, as many of you have been making topics about "Avicus shutting down" Or "Avicus is falling" Please, don't be worried. Avicus isn't going anywhere in the wrong direction. Sometime tonight I will be discussing with our staff team about ways to improve the player count and in game quality. One way that I'm willing to share with all of you is Advertisement. That's one of the main things we haven't really focused on, and no. That doesn't mean all of you run on to other servers spamming our server IP. There are other ways of advertising without spamming other servers. There are ways of advertising our server online, such as on popular Minecraft based websites such as Minecraft forums. We just need to find ways to advertise, and our player count should increase dramatically. So, please dont worry. We'll handle this.

Thanks for letting us know. We should all try to do a bit more to advertise the server.

Just a note, I understand that in saying this you have good intentions, but I don't think having players going about advertising for the network is a good idea. (For example, going onto other servers or their forums and posting the IP makes a bad impression). Leave it to the administration/staff to set up official advertisements on things such as server listing, or perhaps contacting a YouTuber/streamer (or several) about making a video for the server.

I can see where you coming from, but a lot of players also want to help out with getting Avicus back on top. One of the easiest things that you could then do is advertise the server. Yes, I agree with you that if the players go advertise it might come over as unorganised but a lot of people have been at Avicus since the Mczone servers and want to have their share of helping out as well.

&nbsp;The thing is, if players were to advertise in places they shouldn't players start to wonder if this is in any way a good server. What Pants is trying to say is that, if advertisement is done wrong, it will reflect the server badly and do more damage than helping.

I get that. Yes, you need to think about where and how you advertise the server. As I mentioned in my previous comment, some people really enjoy playing on Avicus, have been here for a while and know what they're doing. They have seen Avicus change and the know that the server is on a low all to well. They just hope that by doing a tiny thing, such as advertising, Avicus will be the server that it once used to be.

Like Jake said, the staff would handle this. As a example of Advertising, they could do it on Minecraft forums just like what he said. Avicus players shouldn't worry about advertising, since the Staff are already handling this.

I agree, the staff should handle the advertisment in their way. If you post gameplays on Youtube you are advertising the server in a good way, by spamming other forums, servers and so on with the ip is not a good way to advertise or even a way to advertise this server with a positive outcome. Nobody will join and play on this server if you act like a d***head and spam.

I have a suggestion. On one of my factions server, We had 50 people average.<br>The owner invested in a Advertisement on minecraftservers.net or something like that. We went to 50 average players to 150 average players. It is quite costly, but i think its worth the investment.

only issue with that is that people love factions not as many people love walls or nebula or any other games avicus hasso advertising a faction server is a lot easier than advertising walls or nebula fans
