This post came up to my mind by reading the name of the upcoming update that the server is having.<br>This will sound a bit phatetic so I'm prepared for a lock but, why this name?<br>The "nise" update sounds like something immature and a name no one will get (New players).<br>My point is, can you change the name for something better..? Seriously, it sounds silly.

Is the name commonly known among non-forum users? As I feel the name would only sound somewhat silly to them, besides I found out the joke super fast. Nothing like a little fun sometimes.

Sorta, I don't think the people who made the name really asked if anyone else liked it.

So true xD<br><br>Imo we should just call it the spring update and keep changing the season until it finally comes out.

The 'nise' update really limits it to forum users and it makes our server seem unprofessional.

Agreed...some friends who I play Avicus with that aren't on forums have asked me why people are mentioning the "nise" update :c

I think the name is pretty immature, however, it makes it funny to forum users, for example an update named Avicore 2.0 would be boring, but I think The Nise Update will bring people here out of curiosity and it will be fun, instead of a boring name like every other server, and ivy tries to be unique so I support the name, +1 :D

It's still going to be called Avicus<br><br>@Op I think the update took a bit longer than expected and Kylo simply had to change the name. Don't quote me on that.

The whole "nise" deal is an inside joke that somehow (?) spread around and even more somehow-ier (???) became the new update's name,&nbsp;i never asked for it, but it's kylo's update, everything he codes and stuff, so he gets to name it whatever he wants to i guess.<br>i liked "winter update" better but what can i say hahah, perhaps some people will find it fun, perhaps some people will find it immature, but we can't expect everyone to like something can we?

It was changed from&nbsp;<i><b>"The Winter Update"&nbsp;</b></i>as the developers couldn't release in time before Spring came.&nbsp;<br>Would you prefer&nbsp;<b><i>"The Spring Update"</i></b><i></i><i></i> ?

There were many complaints about the name before the change because some people live in Australia and now it is Summer/Fall there.

I don't think it's necessarily "obvious" to change the name to that. If it's not the "Winter Update" then it's the "Spring update". Anything but the "nise update", because there are a good handful of people on the forums who find it obnoxious.
