There is no way you can access old.avicus.net because Ivy took it down.<br><br>I actually made a topic on this&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://avicus.net/forums/00609ec87">http://avicus.net/forums/00609ec87</a><br>And&nbsp;Yamatzu answered it with a quote from Ivy.<br><i>"What was its purpose? I took them down since I moved some servers around. The old forums weren't going to stay forever, only a few months. They are still available if there is some dire need."<br></i><br>Hope that helps!
