^<br>So basically if we see an offensive name should we report it or does it matter here?<br>An example of offensive names:<br><img alt="" src="http://i.gyazo.com/b67fc8a34dbdc88f3e6f5c7ab754cbff.png"><br>I mean they can change their names in 1.8 so do they get banned for the offending names?<br>Thanks for any insight!

They get banned, I guess if they change their names to something more appropriate, they get unbanned.

We don't allow it, and we give out permanent bans to bad usernames.<br><br>Please report them if you find one.

Unlike other punishments, you <i>can </i>ban evade. Or at least that's how OCN works and it runs flawlessly.

Since Avicus reserves the right to ban anyone, they&nbsp;can ban them. It is against the rules to have a bad name.<br>(BTW the only reason I looked at this thread is because my nickname&nbsp;is dodgy :P)

In 1.8, as discussed in another topic, each player will have a unique code tied to their Minecraft account, so if you attempt to change names and rejoin the server you have been banned on, you will still be banned.
