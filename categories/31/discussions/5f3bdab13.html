Hello,<br><br>Today marks a day where a few things have happened, namely 3; it comes with promotions and a retirement. As early as today, I got a message on steam by Gray (though most of you know him as Astronis) about his position as a moderator and as a map developer. <b>He is taking leave from both moderator and head map developer ranks.</b> This means that he will remain as a mapdev, but the position as head map developer would transfer. He has entrusted me <b>(Tanpopo/Para) to run the map development team</b>, so as so I will try to steer maps in my own way. It's unfortunate that he's going from those, but he is still going to be around; maybe a bit less, however. I want to say that he is a very passionate person and one of the best people that I've ever connected myself with, and this "leave" is for a very good reason. Ily gray. &lt;3<br><br>As well as this (though a thread may be posted soon by him himself), <b>MonsieurStar/FlufflesSub has decided to retire the team</b>. He will no longer be a map developer, but he is part of the family when he got in. As I said in steam, he's in the family but retiring is seen as moving away. He's still with us and I hope that all of us continue to respect him and treat him with the best wishes for what he does in the future.<br><br>So, as a recap; Astronis has retired as a moderator and head mapdev, I am now the charge of head map dev, and Star has decided to leave.&nbsp;<br><br>Post any further questions or grievance below.
