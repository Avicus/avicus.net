I've always thought the punishments a hacker faces is a bit lenient.<br>If you're caught using a hack, normally a temp-ban is issued.<br><br>Why is that enforced? The majority will just come back on once their ban has expired and hack again.<br><br>In my opinion I think that anyone caught using a hack should be perma-banned no questions asked.<br>This would be best for Avicus as a whole. While sending a message to other hackers that using illegal mods is NOT tolerated.<br><br>Why gives hackers a second chance when they go back on and hack again regardless?<br>Why be kind to repeated rule breakers?<br><br>People say temp-bans are issued to give people one more chance but the majority will just hack again.<br><br>Thoughts?<br><br>( I fully respect and appreciate the mods and staff on Avicus, they do a tremendous job and deserve more credit for the awesome work they do.)

it varies on the moderator... most perm ban, but some tempban, and if appealed, it can become an unban or shorter tempban

Actually, we have a set guideline for hackers. The type of hack determines how long the ban is.&nbsp;<br><br>Also, not all "hackers" come back and hack again.

In my OP I didn't say all of them come back and hack again, I said the majority do.<br>People are expected to know the rules. If someone hacks they shouldn't be allowed back on the server IMO. A bit harsh yes but it sends a message that Avicus has zero tolerance for hacking.

Plus 1 , i think you made a great point hackers shouldbe perm banned no questions asked. A peem ban just gives them another oppurtuinty to come do it again. Plus 1 and this is how hackers should be dealt with!

True, and they should have known in the first place NOT to hack but they think it wouldbe funny if they did it anway. Obviously avicus has zero tolerance for hackers but a temp ban just gives them another oppurtuinity to do it again. Like what u said a perm ban shows them that there is zero tolerance for hacking.

Not all of them leave they should perm ban hackers anyway because not all hackers stay away some do come back to hack&nbsp;again. So its better to make sure they DONT come back by perma banning them.

Everyone knows that they shouldn't swear in the chat right? Yet we give you warnings for it, so a Temp-ban to them is almost like a warning.

Well if most hackers aren't regulars then there should be no difference if you give them a perma-ban.<br>Players are expected to know the rules when they come on Avicus. It doesn't matter if you have a change of heart 2 months down the line-the point is you hacked and should be severely punished for it.

Swearing in chat and fly hacking/aimbot etc.<br>Are completely different. Hacking affects everyone in the game and is a much more servere offense than swearing. Comparing the two doesn't make a lot of sense.

Hacking is a zero tolerated thing and players shouldnt do it. You have to come on a server knowing the rules and not breaking them. Hacking is especially the WORST rule to break, it ruins the game for others and just makes it not fun, and some people quit because of hackers. Perm ban them to show them that it isnt tolerated.

Hackers are not banned for week, it's roughly two months for click aimbot which means that if a player was banned for a week they may come back and just start hacking again, but over two months the majority of people will acknowledge that hacks are against the rules and delete them.

The rules say no hacking for a reason, so follow them to be safe. Some people hack anyway and should be perm banned because it ruins the game for others, the hackers dont notice that it ruins the game for people, so perm ban them to make sure they get it through that it isnt tolerated anyway.

Players are expected to know the rules. New or not.<br>Only the minority of hackers change their actions after some thought. The majority however go back on and hack again anyway. Perma-banning will send a message to all players new and old that hacking is not allowed. Temp-banning them is almost like saying "it's ok to hack once because it's only a temporary suspension".

I see your point but its best to get it through that hacking isnt tolerated, you come on a server knowing the rules and not breaking them, hacking is a rule that isnt tolerated. So you DONT DO IT but people do it anyways because they for some reason are amused by ruining the game for other people. In other words hacking should be a rule with a consequence of a perm ban.

Ok well you should get temp banned for a day or two for consquetive swearing. Or for a month for a few pages of infractions, but hacking should a perm ban because people get temp banned and are tempted to come back and hack again to ruin the game for people enjoying it

It's true that hacking isn't tolerated which is why we don't just kick them we are saying "You have hacked therefore you will be given x amount of time away from the server to realize that hacking is wrong." Most hackers just leave after they are banned as well, the server means nothing to them so they just move to another server to hack on while the others who are loyal stay.

You think you get only temp banned for days for hacking? Its a mininal month. Atleast give them a chance to think about it, then the mods can take care of it.

You guys can do your own way of dealing with hackers, if that works then great. I was just putting up my opinion and it became an arguement. Therefore i will stop arguing with the moderators and they can do what they want to.

But that doesn't solve anything.<br>If they move on to another server an hack there then can you say you've truly got rid of a hacker?<br>If temp-banning people doesn't matter because they leave anyway then why don't mods issue them perma-bans if there's no difference.

Honestly, I don't think you trust our staff. They come as fast as they can, the hacker only does very minimal damage to the game. Problem solved, the hackers mostly leave avicus because of the length of ban, and its not like there are 20 hackers in one game constently.

ryan, most people would learn from a&nbsp; tempban, or they will quit avicus and move on to hack on a another server. the same goes for a ban, but they can't get back on, and not all people would know they can appeal, despite the message on the ban screen...

You mods realize that if you temp ban someone they usually will leave to another server, right? Alright so picture this, you temp ban a hacker for two months. Alright he leaves and hacks on another server then another, then another, then another and maybe the mods on the other server dont notice that he is hacking so it will take a bit, maybe a day or two or a week to get rid of him on the other server. Then he decides to check out the servers he was banned on and what do you know, he looks at avicus and logs on to see if his ban had ended, oh and look at that he comes on and starts hacking. If you would have perm banned you wouldnt have to ban him again, but no he is able to get on and hack again! In other words just perm ban hackers!

There has been a lot of talk about this between the staff and most of the time players don't read the rules so currently it pretty much means if you hack you will be temp banned. Perhaps a solution to this is have reminders in the chat saying 'Hacking is not tolerated on Avicus and you will be banned if you are caught,' if that happened maybe we could start delivering perm bans to players...

Im not saying that if you perm ban him here he will stop hacking im just saying that if you temp ban him he will remember that he wasnt banned and come on and hack again. Other severs perm ban hackers to get rid of them for good, its just easier to perm ban him so you dont have to think about it anymore.

I do agree with you completely, in that most people don't usually "learn their lesson" and just come back to hack anyways. If they hacked in the 1st place, most of the time it means they don't care about the server, so why let them come back? However, rules are rules. Since the Sr. Staff made a new punishment guideline, we have to follow it.

I think the rule should be as follows:<br><br>If a staff member has clear video evidence of a player hacking than it is a perma ban.<br>If a staff member bans a player based on what they saw ingame, the video isn't 100% clear or it is a report from a player, then a tempban should be given.

I feel, if someone does hack not once but twice or even more times, there should be a permanent ban already the first time this member was caught hacking. Some players don't really understand the rules and thinks it's allowed to hack if they "contribute" to Avicus in some way or if they make a ban appeal when they get caught. (I'm not pointing out any specific member c:)
