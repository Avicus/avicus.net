I swear, I was pretty high when I saw 400 players. Yeah, avicus is growing! Y'know after it lost about 95% of it's average online players.

Y'know, a couple months ago, during the time of wounded Avicus, the downfall of many players, somebody said: "Later, Avicus is gonna thrive and we're gonna look back, and laugh at how silly we were" (Not exact quote)&nbsp;<br><br>Well, now I think, screw those doubts. Go Avicus :D
