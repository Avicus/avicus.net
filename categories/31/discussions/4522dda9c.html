Hello Avicanucks,<br><br>Now that we are at the figurative eve of Avicus' long-prophesied death, I have something important to confess to you all: I have only been pretending to be retarded&nbsp;<i>this entire time</i>. Yes, that is correct. I tricked you. You have been deceived. It was all a ruse. I have never been mentally retarded, nor do I plan on being so barring any sort of unfortunate accident. You may be wondering at this point, why did I do all of this? What was my grand design, my end goal with such an insidious plan? I did it because it was funny to me. Haha.<br><br>This is also an AMA. To answer your question, roll a six-sided dice and consult the table below:<br><br>1 - You're a homo-sexual.<br>2 - It was the International Jewish Conspiracy (IJC).<br>3 - Go directly to jail.<br>4 - Yes, many times in fact. Not all in a row though, that would be crazy.<br>5 - Hell no<br>6 - See 5, but with an extra "hell" in front.<br>7 - I said a six-sided dice, dumbass. Why do you even have a dice with more than six sides, you fucking nerd.
