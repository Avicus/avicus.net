Both servers are pretty much the same. I saw this thread and decided to share it.Not intending to start a flame war, I'm just curious c=.<br><br><a href="https://oc.tc/forums/topics/56ca6d745f35b97d8500000e">https://oc.tc/forums/topics/56ca6d745f35b97d8500000e</a><br><br>I personally prefer Avicus because I'm familiar with it. But for the couple of times I got temp banned and switched to OCN it was a different experience. It's Nice but small community, with a lot of drama&nbsp;vs Big and tryhard, with it's fair share of salt but also of friendliness, imo.

Overcast is a more polished server that I like for its quality of play and less lag but I like Avicus more for it's friendly, laid back style.&nbsp;<br><br>But I recently got CS:GO and it has stolen my soul; I won't be playing on either in the near future.

Who cares though. Yeah we copied them. So what? It's not like copying has never happened, ever. Plus, it's nice to have two similar servers to choose from, rather that just Avicus or Overcast.

I don't care that we "copied" them :P I'm neutral about this whole debate, but when it comes to them accusing us and hating on us for "copying" them and then making the exact same post they made on their forums.... Why not keep the opinions there instead of having everything re-stated here xd

OCN: way too arcade like for my taste (or at least was with all the tnt wars and shit infused with project ares) + maps way too big and laggy. Also no gapples as basic inv gear in most maps I've played.<br>Avicus: a likable ghetto, dying but still fun

Having played on both servers I have to say I enjoy Overcast much, much more. I haven't played Minecraft in a while but I still go on the forums, and I really think the community and gameplay on OCN is better.<br><br>The gameplay is less laggy, more organized. The maps have nice aesthetics, whereas the maps on here are bland and boring. Chat is more clean and easy to read on OCN too. Tournaments are also more organized, and also maps are more balanced.<br><br>No offense to anyone, but some of the members in this community are annoying, immature, and are way too competitive. People on here seem to compete over the tiniest thing (seeing a thread about how people were bragging about their KB was pretty sad), and generally act like 12-year-olds when anyone talks negatively about them, their team, Avicus etc. I'm really not trying to diss Avicus, as it has it's good parts, but I just prefer OCN over Avicus.

Grasping for arguments is how arguments are formed, the phrase you wanted is grasping at straws. You call someone out for immaturity based off of that person having differing views, effectivley throwing a tantrum. While you say you don't want to start something you follow it up with a vain attempt at humiliation, get a grip.

Hey guys,<br><br>Both servers are great! There really isn't any need to argue so much over here. As I stated before, resentment between both servers is bad for both of our interests. Personally, I enjoy OCN when I get on it. The regulars seem pretty nice, (the ones who come here). I may not know a whole lot of the community over yonder; however, I do know that both communities have their ups and downs. OCN and Avicus are not copies of each other, they are merely siblings so to speak. The original Nebula plugin for Avicus was coded by ParaPenguin, not copied (just fyi). The reasons why Nebula and Project Ares are so similar (in idea) is that they were coded by people with the same objectives/ideas in mind. Anywho, OCN is great, and so is Avicus. I don't see the need for hate from any side of the spectrum. Infact, the Avicus Seniors and the OCN Seniors both share the same goal in furthering Minecraft's competitive nature! As Martin said on the Overcast forums, "<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; ">All the competitive Minecraft networks share a common aim - to push the competitive game forward and get more people involved in playing it.

But the real question is, who are you???<br><br>@OP Agreeing with others, both servers have their pros and cons, but whichever one you prefer is most likely the one that you found first.

OCN is more competitive, less laggy and has better maps. Also their hackers aren't at the top of the community like they are in Avicus, because the competitive scene know them as hackers.<br><br>Avicus seems pretty relaxed though (in terms of staff), and not "hur hur hur we have to do everything like this"

I think when Atlas is pushed (assuming it all goes well (no pressure)) we will have better standard maps (more variation and interesting components). I think we aren't far behind OCN, especially since the player count dropped like ours did months back.

I prefer avicus as most maps on ocn are too laggy (I have always played on a laptop), and some are fairly hard to understand, and 1.9 is a no. Otherwise ocn's fine
