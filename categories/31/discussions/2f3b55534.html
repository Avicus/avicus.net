I don't know why everyone leaves during the school year.. I get that you might be busy and want to focus on your work, ect, but I have hockey practice everyday during the school year, along with homework, and I can still find a spare hour or two most days to come on. Anyways just saying if you like Avicus enough you can keep playing during the school year with a bit of time management.

Could be real life situations that happen, and school just adds more stress. So minecraft shouldn't be a focus during a time like that. But, I'm not sure. All I know is that I ld like to wish you goodbye, and that it's been a pleasure having you here. &lt;3
