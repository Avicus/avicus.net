Ok so right before McZone changed to Avicus I stopped playing for about 2 months and when i came back, a lot of stuff was changed. One of my favorite games was Hunger Games, in fact, I found out about McZone because of HG but now there isn't HG anymore. Why? Plz dont take this as a stupid question or that I'm mad or something like that I'm just curious why. My best guess is that you took it out to try out different games and I'm good with that, a little change won't hurt anyone :)

because people dont take 3 minutes out of their time to look at all the games and see that elimination is the exact same thing with a different name due to some copyright erros or whatever happened with having the name "hunger games"

I've never been able to play Elimination since no one plays there and i don't really think its Hunger Games since it says there can be 75 people in a game.

If I remember correctly, I'm pretty sure it was taken out because pretty much no one played it at one point.<br><br>Then we look at Elimination... Oh well. There's been a lot of talk about adding/removing gamemodes but unfortunately since IvyCode is our only dev atm it will be hard to remove an entire gamemode from the server and add an entire gamemode to the server.

Maybe we could re-name Elimination to Survival games?<br>Then we'd have no copyright infringement and people would know what it is.

Elimination isn't SG, at least not the SG that people would expect, based on other servers.

I know right, dumb decision. HG was the best. I don't understand all this copyright stuff when Elimination is so much different from HG. There were always full HG games too. I think HG should be brought back EXACTLY the same with all the web and in game features.
