So have you found any "big YouTubers" yet for advertising?<br>Last time I heard about advertising was a few months ago, so surely you must've found someone by now?<br><br>Can we get&nbsp;<b>any</b> sort of update?

This is getting nowhere. Instead of developing a new game in SkyWars, we should be worrying about the constant player drop.

Although we added skyqars its really weird, cus if more ppl than normally are in a game, lets say 10/8 ppl will spawn on others islands and also more skywars servers are really needed

Ye. Money is a big issue right now but there are still issues that we need to fix before we get any youtubers playing here. No point advertising if we can't keep new players.

Last I checked, people said this about the transition to 1.8. At the beginning, we were still averaging at about 100-150 players.

20-35 players is nothing compared to 100-150.<br><br>Unless avicus decides to act now and either sell or invest money, it'll be too late.
