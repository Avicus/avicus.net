Me, along with EpicDonutDevour, have come up with a brilliant yet simple defense on Candyland DTM.<br><br>We call it:<br><br><b>The Jelly Donut Defense<br></b><br>It works best in my opinion with 2-3 people, but you could have 1 to however many you could fit.<br><br>Here it is:<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://imgur.com/a/bwGNZ">http://imgur.com/a/bwGNZ</a>

simple, but easy to get the monument with a push. I don't know if your designs are for looks, but their not as helpful

Actually, me and EpicDonutDevour did this defense, and (as full leather) managed to defend off 4 full irons at once, multiple times. ;)

Fashionable but it is very easy to break.

It looks cool, I'll give you that! xD<br>Honestly not much of a "defense," more of a pimped out base to me :P

I would suggest putting glass in a 3x3 square under the monument, so you can see if someone tries to mine it from underneath and it gives it a doughnut look :3<br>Nice job, though x3

If the players were smart, they would have 4 people rush top where the actual people, and then have 2 people rush below and break the monument from the bottom. Not hard, and any team can do this with success

That would be eZ to rush. All you have to do is pillar up in the middle break a few blocks then have full access to the monument with an eff 5 dia pick. Looks nice but it isn't even much of a donut.-1
