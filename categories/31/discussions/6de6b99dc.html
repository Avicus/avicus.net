As a Staff Member, I'm here to help assist you players by punishing rule breakers and provide answers to any questions if you have any. Well to start, I got a few questions for you guys. What opinions do you have on me as a Mod? What improvements do you think I should make and what methods do you think I should take inorder to improve? What's your ideal Moderator? If you have given me feedback, thank you very much and I appreciate it greatly. Thanks for reading!<br><br><br>Edit: Please be serious.

You really lack leadership and I personally think you need to step up. Some of your acts are a little bit on the awkward, fishy humour which doesn't shine off the staff team in a good manner. You're funny sometimes and it helps that you're active.

If you don't like to be Staff you'll be bad at it. Don't force yourself to be someone you aren't and if you are being a Staff member just for the heck of it instead of because you like it and think you are good at it, my honest opinion is retire.&nbsp;<br><br>Other than that I don't have much to say as I don't really pay attention to how good a Staff member is at their job.

Refer to Josh. And like he said with leadership. I think you could be a really good leader, you just don't try to be. You have the potential to be a really good leader, Use it.

I believe that your leadership, hack detection and conduct as a staff member are relatively sound. You have a pretty good sense of humour and despite what some other people on this thread have said, I believe that this makes the staff team more human than the robotic "I only come on to ban people" robots that we are often perceived to be.<br><br>My only criticism is that you're rather naive when it comes to issues both within the staff team and outside of it. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but you should be a little bit more critical when judging people.
