<span>Dear<b>&nbsp;everyone</b>, a</span>s you may well have already been informed, I have decided to retire from the Avicus Team. I was previously a Map Developer here.&nbsp;<span>I'd like to say thank you to everyone for making me feel welcomed in the community and for making it a pleasure to work with everyone. I'd especially like to thank <b>Gray</b> (Astronis), for his amazing talent to teach, and always being there for me&nbsp;:D! Thank you to the entirety of the Map Dev. team also! Lastly, I'd like to thank the members of this server for asking me some sweet questions and being kind and supportive! </span>Thank you all, I have learnt a lot, a loooot, but I'm unable to be active enough, and honestly I just wasn't the best Map Developer out there. I didn't want to take someone's place undeservedly. <b>Love you all &lt;3&nbsp;</b><br><b><br>-Star</b>
