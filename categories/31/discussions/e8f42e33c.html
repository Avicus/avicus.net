Before I start due to the request from a creator of the lobby, please<b> refrain from spoiling the locations of any/all easter eggs, secrets and other fun bits</b>, do however go into detail about what you found. :)<br><br>The new lobby. It sets the tone for what new players can expect from avicus, allows for time wasting and is crucial to providing the immersive and enjoyable experience that servers strive to create. With the new Oh-My-Gah(d) update everything has fallen under analysis from the staff to the maps. However one thing that has escaped the communities eyes has been the stunning new lobby.<br>&nbsp;<br>I don't believe there is a doubt in anyone's mind this new is by far the best lobby avicus has ever had. However there is more then meets the eye. Map creators have supplied the users with hours of crevices begging to be adventured to. I have been exploring the lobby with help from others in the pursuit of secrets. I would like each of you to search for these easter eggs hidden in the lobby and reply back with what you find. After you have given the lobby a decent amount of exploring I'd like you to rate it. Please keep your ratings out of 10. Also feel free to just discuss the beauty of the lobby. Keep all comments positive please. Thanks for reading this and acknowledging the hard work and creativity that went into creating this lobby for us users to chill in. :)

<p>Thanks so much!</p><p>Me and the map developers team worked really hard, and I hope you and everyone does love that lobby. In-case&nbsp;you find any mistakes/bugs or any problems with the lobby, I suggest you to contact a map developer via Skype :)</p>
