Because, this post is only directed at one person, this is not needed. It's not helping anyone at all. You're not gonna get any attention from this if that is what you seek. Btw, it's really hard to get false punishments for the ones you got. Anymore Excuses :D?

i ain't trying to direct this at anybody. I'm telling Avic that I WAS BANNED FOR 1 MONTH.<br>Not trying to be rude to anybody.<br>Also, most the warnings are false because I do simple things like say "lmao" or "fuck" and get warned ._.<br>I do it all the time, and see loads of other people do it, occasionally staff but they don't get warned

If you have a complaint about a staff member than tell a Senior staff member.
