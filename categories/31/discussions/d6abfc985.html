Hello,<br><br>As you know, we've recently just had a throwback map reassessment and we are starting to edit the maps in order for them to have better gameplay. After the maps have all been edited, throwback will be removed shortly after. We want to spread the throwback maps onto the other DTM servers so there would hopefully be a balance in the amount of people in each server.<br><br>The main reason for doing this is so that hopefully more people will get a chance to play on other maps and gamemodes.<br>Although the community will uproar because of throwback's removal, it still needs to be done in order to make progress.<br><br>If you have any questions regarding this, feel free to message me or comment below and a Map Developer will respond.<br><br><b>Edits:<br></b><b></b>Quintus: Replace the diamond armour chests with blocks, make the pathway entrance a bit larger and decrease the amount of monuments.<br>Sandstorm: Remove the saplings at mid and remove the outer ring of the map.<br>UPCOMING EDIT: Remove some blocks surrounding the monument<br><br><b>NOTE:</b> Do not start a flame war or you may get punished, this is your only warning.

*puts out flame* Anyways, I honestly think it would be cool to have the Throwback server's map all spread out, so other gamemodes can be played. The other servers are lonely :c.

Nice idea, not sure how I'm feeling about the big change on Quintus, but anyway this seems like the best way to fix the Throwback issue.

I'm not happy about this but I don't disagree either.<br><br>Also, Quintus's edit was too noticeable and made the map more stalemate imo. My suggestion is add a monument at the back and make the two other monuments closer. Idk how much closer but a considerable amount. It was hard to get a monument on Quintus's to begin with because of the map's bow spam driven gameplay. Please fix this.

Every change made will be controversial. The changes made to Quintus are a step in the right step in my opinion. It influences defending, the old Quintus was hard to defend due to monuments being quite close to the main land. Less diamond is also a positive change since it reduces killfarming and balances the map more. Pushing the monuments right now are easy from the roof,influencing skybridge to reach roof control.<br><br>Whatever changes are made, they will be controversial. We need to move on from these nostalgic maps and focus on newer, better designed ones.

This is an awesome idea! Good job to whoever came up with the idea!<br><br>i have a sug: Can you put some of TB best maps (Luar, Quintus) into the DTM03 rot? I rarely play that rotation. DTM01 and 02 I play quite a lot.

Quintus now has 2 mons, back left and back right. Diamond chests are filled with iron armour and there are 4 diamond blocks in each tower.

It's not that the old Quintus was perfect, but I believe this version isn't good either. If we aren't going to add a monument we should at least make the two other monuments closer. I'd say 5-7 blocks closer to the iron areas, but that really isn't my choice.<br><br>@OP Forgot to say this. Instead of making rende 2 CTW with 2 wools, make it DTM. It was such a good DTM map. But what I'd do is cut it off and make it 7 blocks separated from the main territory.

I don't know why they changed it. The diamond armour never really affected my experience other than kill farming, which doesn't affect the experience much
