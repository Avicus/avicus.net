<b></b><b></b>I've decided to retire from the Administration team and the Staff Team as a whole. There's a couple of reasons as to why, but the main ones were that I had become too busy and that I didn't feel as though I deserved the rank any longer. I had been slacking quite a bit and hadn't been doing much administrative work, and my obligations outside of Avicus began to grow. Recently, my computer broke down, which further limited my ability to do Administrative work, and at this point I decided to hang up the coat.&nbsp;<br><br>I've had an amazing journey with lots of great people here on this server, and many of the experiences I've had has really changed my perception on certain things in life. I'm truly glad that I was able to experience Avicus, and in appropriate fashion, I would like to thank all those who made my experience here memorable.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Biza/Myv:&nbsp;</b>You were my first friend on Avicus. I remember the days where I was still a junior moderator and we made a strip club in the middle of a map. I'm glad I can keep in touch with you, but I'm really thankful you supported me in my journey as a staff member.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Mihan/Aphelion:&nbsp;</b>You most likely will not see this, as you've probably moved on from Avicus, but I want to thank you. You're an old buddy of mine and I still remember how you supported me as a staff member, too.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Arigenn/Ethan:&nbsp;</b>We've done a lot (DJ), and working alongside as an administrator, you had to deal with my shit, and I'm really thankful you stuck through all of that and was so supportive. You're such a kind person with a passion to see Avicus grow, and I really respect you for that.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Newcleus:&nbsp;</b> Aye D god, hope your Korean is a shitton better, haha. I've been through a lot with you too, and it's thanks to you that I was able to get so far as a staff member. I'm sorry I wasn't able to come onto teamspeak for such a long time lol, but thanks for always being a good pal to talk to.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Para:</b> We've had our fair share of memories, and I want to put aside any differences we've had. You're a very good, productive individual and your dedication to this server is unlike any other member. I'm happy that you and I are friends bro.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Posighdun:&nbsp;</b>Salt King, hey. I know we've had a neutral friendship, but I'm glad it's evolved into something else &lt;3 Thanks for all the talks and good fun (and salt) we've had. Always prepare for shit to hit the fan because sprinkle sprinkle!<br><br><b>Maddy:&nbsp;</b>Hey hey couch "potato" (lol) Us Canadians &nbsp;gotta stick together &nbsp;y'know? Anyways, thanks for being an honest friend that I could talk to whenever I needed. You're a chill person and a better friend. Stay classy yo<br><br><b>Greg:&nbsp;</b>Mister November Flame, thanks for some enjoyable times on TeamSpeak and being a good boy. I've had fun building our secret rooms and other activities haha.<br><br><b>Evo:&nbsp;</b>vaporeons is better, Umbreon scrub.! (triggered) Thanks for being so graciously sexy and being a wonderful person to be around. ;)<br><br><b>Snowmobile:&nbsp;</b>Ayeee Mobile, I'm really glad that you were an awesome gal and always said hello (from the other side) to me whenever we were on the server. Stay cool &lt;33<br><br><b>Peachy:&nbsp;</b>I'm thankful that we've been able to bind over the past couple of months. I've enjoyed doing my senior mod duties with you haha. Remember not to be so rough on the new kiddies ;)<br><br><b>Iron: &nbsp;</b>You've got quite a bit of dedication to this server, which is really impressive, but remember to get your sleep and don't stay on teamspeak too long! Thanks for your work!<br><br><b>Atdit:&nbsp;</b>I'm not sure you'll see this, but I want to thank you for the great times we've had together, dating back to my junior mod days. You're a fighting champ.<br><br><b>Sli and Seth:&nbsp;</b>Both of you are bad at showdown, but you're cool people and even cooler map developers. the two notorious idiots and flatties &lt;3 See you both soon!<br><br><b>Riley:&nbsp;</b>Our interests in the same things really brought us together, and although you may not read this,I still want to thank you for the great times we've had. You're a respectable person.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Jess:&nbsp;</b>Being promoted in the same batch as I was,you and I have also gone through some crazy shit together. You're a fun person to talk to for just about anything, and you're a great music nerd.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Princezz_Dubstep:&nbsp;</b>I highly doubt you're even going to read this lol but I want to say thanks for being such a great influence. I really looked up to you.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Andrew:&nbsp;</b>Your knowledge in classical music is interesting and pretty respectable. Stay "classy? :&gt;"<br><br><b>Zedther:&nbsp;</b>You and I also go a long way back. you went through a lot of shit and I watched you grow through all of that. I hope you stay strong and good luck in life.<br><br><b>Jahaj:&nbsp;</b>You were always nice to me, and I was fond of that. Thank you for being such a good person and friend.&nbsp;<br><br><b>resepignev:</b> Thank you for being such a kind soul to me. good luck on all your future endeavours.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Storm:&nbsp;</b>Keep the midnight squad legacy going. I know someday you'll be a better midnight than me xD Good luck in life!<br><br>Of course, I want to thank the rest of the staff team for being such a great bunch of people.&nbsp;<br>I'll pop on the server every once in a while, and I'll try to stay on Teamspeak as often I can. I really wish the best for all of you.<br><br>See you soon.&nbsp;<br>Midnite &lt;3<br><br><br><br><b></b>

Bro, I'm really sorry we hadn't talked. I know you're a good guy from my past experiences from talking with you, but those memories are probably long gone by now.

Midnite, Midnite, Midnite, how should it be described?<br>Well, you are one of the reasons to become a staffmember. The resistance opened my eyes and I wanted to help out. I loved all the slack chats. I hope you'll stay, actually you will stay (because no one can leave Avicus forever &gt;:D). If you need anything message me. You are a great person!
