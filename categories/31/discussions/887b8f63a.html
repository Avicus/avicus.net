It is clear that the topic regarding posts&nbsp;about personal<a class="lhlefgkyii" href="#" title="Click to Continue > by saleprizes"> updates<img src="https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"></a> is a confusing one.This is a problem that i've noticed that Avicus staff has.&nbsp;<br><br>You guys do not follow a clear and cohesive doctrine. I<a class="lhlefgkyii" href="#" title="Click to Continue > by saleprizes"> suggest<img src="https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"></a> that community members help make a clear doctrine for the way punishments and locking posts should be handled.<br><br>Community members who aren't necessarily mature but know&nbsp;<i><b>when&nbsp;</b></i><b></b>to be mature and when to be laid<a class="lhlefgkyii" href="#" title="Click to Continue > by saleprizes"> back<img src="https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"></a>. Staff members will obviously help but I believe that if the community gets involved as well things will get better.&nbsp;<br><br>Make posts inside server feedback titled [Doctrine] (Topic name). Staff and community members can review.&nbsp;<br><br>Staff, if you want the community to respect you more then you'd<a class="lhlefgkyii" href="#" title="Click to Continue > by saleprizes"> agree<img src="https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"></a> with this idea and vice versa for community. This must be a truly egalitarian event where everyone must speak to each other as they would if one another were a player.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><b>WARNING! COMMUNITY THIS IS TO YOU!&nbsp;</b>Try to keep a calm, professional and egalitarian atmosphere. If a heated argument occurs, then you must stop. However, a&nbsp;<b><i>heated DEBATE&nbsp;</i></b>is allowed as long as it doesn't occur with insults or actions to slander the opposing party. <b>Deformation of character is a crime in the US.<br></b><br>If neither player adheres to staff warnings then a temporary forum ban for a day must be given out. <b>Nothing more - nothing less.<br></b><br><b>WARNING! STAFF THIS IS TO YOU!&nbsp;</b>If signs of an argument occur or if an argument occurs then you may not lock the topic. You must warn the offending players to stop because, when you lock doctrine topic:<br><br>#1: You look infrac. hungry or "trigger happy" or "power hungry -- whatever the hell you wish to call it.<br>#2: It won't be fair to the owner of the topic if the shenanigans of two aggressors caused this. <b>Locking a post caused by two or more people is unwarranted and you're thinking of everyone in the topic as one troublesome entity - which is not the case at all so... lay off the cannons and use<a class="lhlefgkyii" href="#" title="Click to Continue > by saleprizes"> your<img src="https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"></a> words.</b><br>#3: Its impractical.&nbsp;<br><br>If a staff member gets into a debate with another player then the arguing staff member mustn't punish the other aggressor. Only staff outside the argument are allowed to warn both to stop. Depending on who started the confrontation, you mustn't be biased. Biased dialogue or actions from staff must be acted upon immediately with a demotion.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>- Zintenka

While I agree with some of the stuff you said, I am quite confident that one of the top priorities of the staff is how they punish, and their image to the community, so they most likely will have discussed this themselves and are working on stuff like this inside the catacombs of the Avicus Staff Slack. Remember, we have a <b>very</b> competent staff team :)

I agree with this a lot. It feels like a punishment a for other people acting idiotic on the forums flaming on your thread for no apparent reason.

You make a very good point. However, i want to create an environment where&nbsp;<i>everyone&nbsp;</i>can speak their minds without the&nbsp;<i>shockingly high&nbsp;</i>probability of getting an infraction.

Yea I was gonna make something like this if it happened more but, thanks for making this! For example, DoctaPop had a topic that only regarded himself yet that post is not locked. However, a post revolving around someone's killstreak is locked. Sure the demotion is "official" or whatever but, you gotta make up your mind. It's either all of them are gone or, they can all stay. Keep in mind that this also means posts regarding someone who needs help with a computer would end up locked. I say that you should allow the "personal updates" but, to a limit which should be further explained in the rules.&nbsp;<br><br>Thanks!

Yeah, the favoritism is real. I remember when i made my leaving posts they were locked 3 times. The 1st time locked for understandable reasons. The other 2 times were unreasonable.

Leaving posts are not allowed; especially if they're temporary.

Yeah, i know. But aside from this, many leaving posts were made with some of them coming from certain members of the community not being locked.<br><br>Explain this to me. Even now, there is a post that directly violates one of Avicus' rules yet it isn't locked..<br><br>EDIT: I stand corrected, it was archived but only after bold members of the community called it out.
