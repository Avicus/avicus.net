It's only for in-game, thought I had it in the title. Doesn't fit, so I'll just add it with this message.

Well alting, has two sides: the truth ( wanting to change) or the lies ( just wanting too break rules agian). Shouldn't they be given a chance? Its a bit too harsh.

Maybe if you weren't a furry you wouldn't have said anything stupid in the first place and got yourself banned.

It's ok to say it if it's in proper context, such as: 'An Avicus IP is skywars.co'<br><br>But don't troll and use it in something like: 'GO TO SKYWARS.CO BEST SERVER EVER' as that will confuse some staff and you may even end up with a ban.
