<p class="MsoNormal">Hi, it’s been a long time since I made a topic on the
forums, so I thought I would introduce a game that I used to play a lot in
history class when I was younger. Hope you guys enjoy, I will be using some of
the answers you give for future reference. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>How it works:</b> You
pick one historical event that has greatly impacted the world. You change
something about the story so the outcome is different (ex. someone dies or
doesn’t).<span>&nbsp; </span>You write a short scenario of
what you think that world today would be like because of this happening/or not
happening. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Topics: </b>The topic
can be almost anything, from the early history, social media, movies, books. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><u>Example-</u></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Event:</b> 75 BC,
Julius Caesar was captured by pirates and holds them off long enough to bargain
for freedom. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Change:</b> The pirates
kill Caesar. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>What our world would
be like?:</b> If Caesar died then we would have no Rome Empire cause Caesar wouldn't become dictator, and pass it on to Augustus. Roman
territory wouldn’t grow without Caesar leading the legions into Gaul and
Brittan.<span>&nbsp; </span>Shakespeare wouldn’t have been
that popular since his most famous plays are based around the life of Julius
Caesar.&nbsp; </p>



<p class="MsoNormal"><b><u>Example #2- </u></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Event: </b>Mark
Zuckerberg the son of a dentist, goes on to study history, business and
comptech, these subjects help him in creating one of the largest social media
companies in the world.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Change: </b>Instead
of studying history, business and comptech, he follows in his father’s
footsteps and becomes a dentist. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>What our world would
be like?: </b>No Facebook, use of technology/social media would be very
different.</p>



<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Format- </b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Event:</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Change:</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>What our world would
be like?: </b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

They helped in WW2 a lot but when it came to D-Day the Canadians held off the Germans up north of France while America went down South and took it like that.<br>In D-Day Britain did help but they mostly helped by setting up the fake army vehicles &amp; all that getting the Germans ready to defend one border of France. Afterwards the Allies (includes Britain) took the rest of France and then they went and took back the countries they lost.

Pretty massive ik but if Canada and the States were unsuccessful in the attacks the whole D-Day plan would have failed.<br>That's why I'm talking more about Canada &amp; the States :P

I feel that if Mark Zuckerburg didn't create Facebook, someone else would have, perhaps under a different name, and that communication system would become highly popular, like Facebook is right now.

I'm pretty sure that he didn't create Facebook alone. Only listed that as one of the examples because he did play a major role in the creation of the company and the overall success of it. You are right saying someone else would have made something similar if he didn't.

From what I know that wasn't just the last few dynasties. Even from earlier on the Zhou one of the earliest dynasties in China was very xenophobic (afraid from outside influences). You could argue that if China didn't share some of their ideas with the rest of the world we would be very different today.

Actual Outcome: Innocent Muslims would die, America would start a lot of wars, Gun crime would increase rapidly, women wouldn't be allowed to work, America would produce so much CO2 that our atmosphere would kill us all and they wouldn't care about it, all other parties would "mysteriously die", people would be murdered for making&nbsp;facts&nbsp;about his name like, "The trump coming out of his bum is more useful than he would be vas president".

trump's thinking is just magical. proposing to kill all muslims because of isis is like proposing to kill all the british because of jack the ripper, proposing to kill all germans because of hitler, proposing to kill all australians because of ned kelly... the examples can go on for ages. (i used historical figures for a reason, too)

Ok one thing that has greatly impacted the world ok I got one<br><b>Event:&nbsp;</b>Donald trump running for president<br><b>Change:</b> He's not racist to everyone that's not white and actually starts worrying about actual things that are hurting the world (ISIS, global warming, education, etc.)<br><b>What the world would be like:</b> happy and free with a president that is fair and follows the amendments about everyone being equal and how the rule of law (rules affect everyone, rich or poor, lawmaker or dentist, etc.)

No, he's talking about cutting it off from Middle Eastern countries, and stopping people who are associated with anyone even remotely connected to terrorism. He mentioned nothing of killing them and will not be kicking them out of America.
