Mods &gt; spambots confirmed<br>This happened around 8PM EST, 1/24/16 on server DMT02. Around a hundred spambots attacked the server, then the mods destroyed them all.<br>I have also heard that they invaded ocn as well. During normal gameplay I listen to a sick remix of Undertale Spider Dance so that's why there's music in the background.<br>tfw not youtube<br><br>The attacker probably leaked a bunch of accounts, then took control of each to rapidly spam messages. It is ridiculously easy to get leaked accounts (just a quick Google search will do), so it's not that hard. But no leak is strong enough to beat the mighty ban hammer.<br><br>I now have more footage uploaded:<br><a href="https://youtu.be/K6-g7fDaELE" title="Link: https://youtu.be/K6-g7fDaELE">https://youtu.be/K6-g7fDaELE</a>&nbsp;(12 minutes)<br>Link to original video:<br><a href="https://youtu.be/2GfRvxUPfz4" title="Link: https://youtu.be/2GfRvxUPfz4">https://youtu.be/2GfRvxUPfz4</a>&nbsp;(3 minutes)<br><br>We will all remember this day... AS THE DAY THE SPAMBOTS GOT REKT<br><br>I have more videos coming soon, dang it slow upload speed.

I don't blame you. I just used a site that uploads a faster compressed video because some people want the video fast. A youtube version is currently processing.

It's funny, because I banned this one guy off my own server, then he tried to come back with about 20 leaked accounts. Luckily I thought one step ahead and IP-banned him :D<br><br>But dang, I agree. I have to give props to the guy, even though he is a troll.
