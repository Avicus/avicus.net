Racism On Avicus

</h1>
Hello all-<br><br>Recently, I have been insulted by some using racist remarks. I have "Japan" in my name, causing the racist remarks. There have been "jokes" made about Hitler, atomic bombs blowing up Hiroshima, and other variants of World War 2 remarks. I believe there should be no reason why I should be unconftorable playing on Avicus just because of my name. I believe there is no substantial punishment for those who are racist, with the only immediate punishment being a kick. This will probably only anger the players and will provoke them to go against other Avicus players. There should be other punishments to deal with racist players. Again, there should be no reason any player should be insulted because of their name or heritage. Something should be done about this. I am not. NOT upset by these jokes, just a little shocked as to what this world has come to.<br><br>Thanks for reading my rant. Please respond with any ideas on how to deal with this issue.&nbsp;<br><br>LET ME MAKE THIS VERY CLEAR: The racism is going on in game, not on teamspeak.<br><br>Kojapan17

Something has been done about this. If you are referring to yesterdays events, those users were both issued bans not kicks. Sorry about the way those users treated you, but when their behavior was reported they were handled accordingly.

Have you got recording software?<br>If this happens again, just record the incident(or screenshot it if it's in the in-game chat) &nbsp;and send it to the staff.<br>They'll get banned.

Most that we can do is remove those types of people from our services by enforcing that rule. Yes we get those types of people but so do many other servers. I agree you shouldn't be treated that way because of your name but when those types of situations happen it's kinda unexpected because you never know when it could happen, but I can guarantee that player won't be walking around doing that on the server for long.

The racism he deals with are way worse then getting called a racist name. I am there to see and I immediately give them a warn for that racism, since I can only do /kick and /warn.

I don't think racist comments should be ignored. &nbsp;Some are saying that kids are young or only fooling around, but most comments are not funny, especially if you are the target. &nbsp;The goal should be to make everyone feel included and accepted on this server.<br><br>At school, they teach kids to speak out to peers about stereotypes and bias, so why not have that be a goal for this server. &nbsp;Sometimes when you ignore comments and say nothing, it feels as if you are approving them.<br><br>Just saying things like, "Hey, you don't need to use words like that", or "Stop please, that word is hurtful", could make a difference. &nbsp;I constantly type in chat, "Be nice", on this server because there are a lot of upsetting things players say to each other and someone should acknowledge that something hurtful or insulting was said in chat. &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>IMO, I think we should all actively counter all racist statements on this server, not only the mods, but the whole community.

We can't change what people type in chat or say in teamspeak, but only enforce the rules when they do.<br><br>Try to ignore these people, they're saying it over a block game and you shouldn't take it too seriously. If it makes them feel good then they're horrible people and won't go far in life at all; let that thought comfort you.<br><br>If you can take screenshots, do. Remember to report any users breaking our racism rules as well.

As someone who deals with racism constantly, I find that most people do not even realize that they are being racist. Also, many people on Avicus do not know what certain words mean; hence, when they see other people use them they assume its fine. However, obviously its not. I find that the best way to deal with such is to report them, try and tell them what they are saying is wrong. Moreover, try to ignore the comments in the sense that you shouldn't let peoples comments hurt you. Slurs only perpetuate hate, and hate can really change how you view others.

TeamSpeak Devs are not here to enforce some social justice idea that you feel we need. We are here to provide the TeamSpeak that is in demand on TeamSpeak while allowing the community to grow. TeamSpeak, is the only service of avicus currently experiencing a rapid growth mostly due to the freedoms afforded on TS. When Nightclubs were easy to get into you guys complained saying that people could wander in there and be offended, we have solved this and given people a clear choice on whether or not they want to join that channel. The forums warriors who continue to get upset over the nightclub's mere existence have only themselves to blame. I have seen every single one of these people in Nightclub channels even participating in the types of discussions that they hate so passionately now (Zintenka got demoted for issuing death threats to me). Zintenka, Snow and anyone else who has a problem with TeamSpeak supporting people's ability to express themselves in the proper environment, I ask for you guys to show me that Nightclubs are not necessary, stay out of them yourselves and challenge the status quo, rather than following in it's path. If the TS Devs see that Nightclubs are now irrelevant we will then discuss removing it.

I disagree a bit<br><br>It doesn't make us look unproffesional. It's just that we have a variety of choices to choose from. If you don't like racism comments, go to a channel that forbids racism.

Like I said, most of my friends are in the Nightclub. I came on to TS to socialize and going to an empty room or a room where people don't have microphones or I don't socialize with is heavily redundant.<br><br><br>And just so you know, yes - it does. Just look at countless businesses that had their customer service and credibility destroyed just because of this.<br><br>Right, because lots of choices in general are a good thing.

They're all horrendous and unnecessary. If you do not like cancer jokes and terrorist jokes then you are a hypocrite.

racism or the use of the word nigga? Becos I'd somewhat understand the latter seeing as it has been used by poets and rappers as a self-referential term, taking a pejorative and making it their own. Kinda like what happened with the word capitalist, only tied to a rather horrid and dark history.&nbsp;<br><br>However, blatant racism is not okay. Attacking someone for being who they are is not okay. The real issue is that people are gonna be mean no matter what, but they'll take to race and the like the fastest because it's what hits closest to home and because things like this you cannot change. IMO, this thread should've been simple. All that should be said is "Bullying of any and all forms will not be tolerated. Players will be severely punished for doing so", because that's pretty much the solution, no?&nbsp;<br><br>Also, only the first paragraph is a reply to you. The rest is more general.

In the OP it is stated that messages were received in-game. However, regardless of that. I think that a TS Dev talking to you privately could describe the nightclub better. Whereas, here we can focus on the main topic. (Racism in-game)

Bro, racism no matter wot is wrong. The TS is an extension of the game due to its nature of being tied to the server. If you believe discussions on racism should be limited to only one part of the server, how can you hope to solve the problem as a whole? Your whole "stick to the main topic" don't make sense, because quite naturally discussion of racism in one form will extend to a discussion of racism of all forms.&nbsp;<br>How long have you been a member of staff? Because quite frankly, it seems you still do not know how to handle proper discussions. It seems you're just uncomfortable talking about the TS stuff and you just wanna shut it down but you're too ashamed to admit it.

To be frank, I hate racism. I hate the idea that people could use words to deface others and cause incredible harm. However, in this case I was wrong to make that comment. I will remove it promptly; however, I am fine with discussing Teamspeak. I just would rather explain privately so it becomes a lot easier to have an open conversation.

I completely I agree, racism shouldn't be aloud in the community as we know it. People come on the server to enjoy them selfs have fun and play with friends not have to be critized by they're race. It's un needed behavior by the people who do it and in my opinion disgusting. I don't want to log on and see stuff like that and have it ruin my day or others days it's not fair to me, it's not fair to them, it's not fair to anyone. Thank you.

Like I said, most of my friends are in the Nightclub. I came on to TS to socialize and going to an empty room or a room where people don't have microphones or I don't socialize with is heavily redundant.<br><br><br>And just so you know, yes - it does. Just look at countless businesses that had their customer service and credibility destroyed just because of this.<br><br>Right, because lots of choices in general are a good thing.

They're all horrendous and unnecessary. If you do not like cancer jokes and terrorist jokes then you are a hypocrite. Simple as that.<br><br>Either we have all of them and be a cesspool server where anyone can threaten to rape and kill your family based on race OR we have a server where crude jokes ARE allowed but ones that aren't so controversial? <br><br>A server where you aren't likely to offend a vast majority of people and then allow big youtubers to come and NOT SAY bad things about our policies.<br><br>I have to ask this, do you guys even think? This isn't an insult but did you guys even think that when a youtuber comes and sees all these things they'd like it? If you thought so then you need to redo public school education.<br><br>Seriously. Come. On.

No no no, I never said I agree with cancer statements and disrespectful comments like this. What I hate the most is jokes like these, someone calling another individual autistic, telling him to get cancer, etc. Yet, it still happens. Talking about racist jokes, I think that the nightclub has a rule about forbidding heavy bullying directed towards someone. So first of all, if someone is being disrespectful to you after you've asked them to stop, report them. Again, you want to talk with people but they're being racist in a racism allowed channel. What can you do? You don't control them.<br><br>Again, I've never seen racism used in a manner to offend someone. I've seen it simply used to joke around with people. What I think should be noticed more are the stupid jokes that people call funny by calling people autistic and shit. Honestly, it's not funny

racism or the use of the word nigga? Becos I'd somewhat understand the latter seeing as it has been used by poets and rappers as a self-referential term, taking a pejorative and making it their own. Kinda like what happened with the word capitalist, only tied to a rather horrid and dark history.&nbsp;<br><br>However, blatant racism is not okay. Attacking someone for being who they are is not okay. The real issue is that people are gonna be mean no matter what, but they'll take to race and the like the fastest because it's what hits closest to home and because things like this you cannot change. IMO, this thread should've been simple. All that should be said is "Bullying of any and all forms will not be tolerated. Players will be severely punished for doing so", because that's pretty much the solution, no?&nbsp;<br><br>Also, only the first paragraph is a reply to you. The rest is more general.

To be frank, I hate racism. I hate the idea that people could use words to deface others and cause incredible harm. However, in this case I was wrong to make that comment. I will remove it promptly; however, I am fine with discussing Teamspeak. I just would rather explain privately so it becomes a lot easier to have an open conversation.

I myself have dealt with racism before in-game, surprisingly not on TeamSpeak though.<br><br>Its sick to think that people can use your skin colour as an insult. There has been one case of racism for me which I couldn't even report sadly. However, since the only way is to report, its best to just stick to that but I really dislike racism and hopefully something can be done to reduce racist comments. (Muting, etc)

When it comes to racism in game, I am strict on this. Using the term 'nigga' or any other types of racial slurs against other people directly, should be an immediate punishment on the player who used the racist language, whether they were intentionally being offensive or not. Saying something similar to 'I am a nigga' should be fine as your stating a fact and not trying to offend someone. However, saying it excessively wouldn't be allowed as anyone would think you're intentionally trying to be racist.&nbsp;<br><br>The current teamspeak rules for racism is fine and seems to be preventing direct racist comments in the cursing forbidden and cursing allowed channels. If you join the nightclub channel, you join at your own risk as you would've typed in the password which means you agree to the rules.

If someone is being racist in game, just report them using /report assuming there's a mod on, which there is most of the time. If not, take a screenshot and report it here on the forums, or message a Mod on Skype or Slack and you will get a response really fast. (The punishment is a 14 day tempban.)

If the punishment is a 14 day tempban... Somtimes there have been cases where someone has been really racist and a mod just warns them a couple times... And they get away free. My point in this forum is to say that I shouldnt have to message a mod on skype because there should be no racism in the first place. Mods should make the effort to immediatly temp ban racist users when they see them. Obviously racist users will have only a bad impact on the Avicus community so they should be punished immediatly.

I will go ahead and remind all of the mods about this, as all cases of racism should be given the same punishment, if you do see someone getting a warn instead of a tempban then just message a mod, as it might have been less serious or a specific situation where a tempban wasn't necessary.
