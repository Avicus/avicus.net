Hello I'm sheamus4414 and I'm just wondering why is everybody leaving this great server it's so fun to play with so much good people though people still get banned for hacking so that might be a reason. I know some people don't find it fun anymore because they have nothing left to prove but stil they can play with some friends but still they have there reasons so I won't judge, I am just curious why everyone is leaving Avicus. No offense just wondering. Thank you!

People leave because they want to do more with their life then play minecraft. Every time a wave of people leaves there is always a thread like this, yet there is no need for one. If you want to find out why they are leaving look at their leaving post.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Locking...</b>
