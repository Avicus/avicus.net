Heeeeeeeeeey and good Morning/Noon/Evening depending on where on the globe you are located :)<br><br>So, In this Post, I am Suggesting a Youtuber/Let´s play rank that Allows any youtuber that wants to upload Avicus Videos, Can do so, And with some facilities that this rank would allow.<br><br>-The rank, In my opinion, If this gets implemented, Should have:<br><br>-A /nick Command. Now, This command can´t be abused or:<br>- You can´t impersonate other players(i.e /nick JeromeASF, Or /nick BajanCanadian)<br>- Your nick can´t contain any offensive, Racist or anything offensive to others. That means, that NaziNigga69 Is not an Allowed nick<br><br><br>Obviously, If this gets implemented, there are some requirements you´ll have to obey:<br><br>- The video has to have at least a quality of 480p and be at least of 5 minutes.<br>- You will have to upload at least 2 videos every week, and At least, One of them with voice.<br><br><br>Obviously, Staff members have to take care about other things to help the server, So that´s why a Physical rank should not get implemented. If this is accepted, Only a /nick command will be implemented to the players that will have this ``rank´´<br><br><br>I have to mention that the Let´s Players should not be part of any of the Staff appointments, just the Normal players ones, So What I mean by this, Is that Let´s Players should not be treated as Staff´s, Just as Normal players.

Why would "let's players" have to have /nick? Players won't pay attention To them unless your a popular youtuber with like 50k +<br><br>Also updated my first post
