Quick Rank Question

If I pay $10, could I upgrade from emerald to diamond for a month? Or would I have to pay $20? I know I can get it permanently for $50, but I'm unsure about monthly subscriptions. &nbsp;Also, will the subscription end at the end of this month, November 30, or one month from now, December 12?

One month from now but I don't know about the first one. If it costs 10 dollars more than you pay for emerald then yeah I would assume it does

Regarding your first question, I don't think it works that way.<br>But if you want to permanently get the diamond rank, instead of paying $100 you only have to pay $50 because you already have the emerald rank. So you get $50 taken off your purchase.

I don't think you can upgrade your rank for only 1 month. I think it needs to be premanent.
