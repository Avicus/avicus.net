In 1.8, since blockhitting was considered a glitch, mojang is going to be taking it out. Also, here's some other combat system updates that are coming.<br>-TnT can now flow in water (breaks certain cannons)<br>-Can't punch the ground while drinking potions<br>-Can't punch when bow is being pulled back<span><br>-Can't punch the ground while eating food</span>

Honestly this is fine by me. Some people "abuse" blockhitting wayy too much. I use it in tunnels and any close combat, but this should force more strafing. Could help reduce kill farming though. I always blockhit with full diamond for complete tanking xD

With 1.7 sprint key, people can abuse block hit by getting insane combos with almost no effort, depending on their skill and ping of course. So it could be used much more offensively in 1.7, and abused by more people.

Although I used block hitting a bit, I got really mad when people would ONLY block hit in PvP. They'd just stand there and block hit. Overall I'm pretty happy about it.

Just a question, but is there some sort of changelog that says blockhitting was removed? Not saying that this isn't true, but I and many others would at least like a bit of official clarification :P

Block hitting is a tactic used in pvp, even if people think it's cheap, unfair, or just bad. It's just like saying strafing is bad and unfair people it makes people win fights. Yes I'm sad to see this be taken out of the game as it is a tactic that anyone could pull out and get the upper hand in a fight. Yes the combos are crazy that you can get but that is because of the combo of 1.7 and block hitting so one of them had to be removed for the insane combo to be removed.

I see lots of people raging at block hitters I get mad too but I do it all the time. Except I don't just stand there and hit I have my finger constantly on the control key so if I stop block hitting I can run and stuff. What I'm saying is run up to a person and pvp as fast and effectively as non block hitters. It's a really good strategy and does involve some skill if you're doing it right like I am. Standing there doing nothing but hitting.requires little to no skill.

I'm pretty sure this is only a glitch, like the sprinting glitch in 1.6.1, there was a huge uproar in the soups community, only to find out it was a glitch which was patched in 1.6.2. I'm pretty sure (and am hoping) this is only a glitch in the snapshot/the first version of 1.8 otherwise no one will give me a challenge like StanMPL anymore :(((

How so? You get close to no movement when you block hit and all you need to do is click both mouse buttons

If it is so easy and has such a clearly detrimental effect on gameplay, why do so few people use it, yet so many people know of it?

Luckily I switched to Normal Hitting Last Week, I got too used to blockhitting... But hitting the floor while drinking pots, NOOOO.

Because they are changing several things that have been in the game for awhile that many people adapted to. For no apparent reason either.

Block-hitting was a glitch, it gave an unfair advantage to those who can get insane combos because of ping.<br>the EULA stopped/is stopping pay to win servers.<br>i get people have adapted to it but because they are used to it doesn't mean it's good...<br>also, I dislike the other changes but they make the game a bit more realistic.

It didn't give an unfair advantage to those with good ping.

Block-hitting haves player with a low ping an easy way to get huge combos (if you can click fast enough)<br><br>The EULA is useful because it is stopping the pay to win aspects in minecraft servers, I was never saying anyone was forced to pay...<br><br>a slight advantage from from ping is fine, when I play au servers I get a ping under 20, it doesn't make too big a difference with moving and strafing but makes a large difference with hits.

build high, I cant say anything much because this is the avicus forums and I don't want to get banned but ping and latency doesn't really effect blockhitting.

Pay to win isn't an issue if you aren't paying. If someone doesn't enjoy the server, I don't see what's so difficult about not playing it. You are incorrect about block hitting.

Although I used block hitting a bit, I got really mad when people would ONLY block hit in PvP. They'd just stand there and block hit. Overall I'm pretty happy about it.

It doesn't however using blockhitting to start, or get out of a combo shows skill and it takes skill to know when to blockhit or not. It has become part of many good pvpers style and just part of the general gameplay if it is removed then i will not be around as much as pvp will become more tedious for me.
