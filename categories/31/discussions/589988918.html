After talking to Fouled we decided to make a thread so we can get some suggestions for the rules page. I ask that the feedback/suggestions you provide are <b>serious</b>. It would help us if you provided some feedback based on the following questions;<br><br>Are there any rules that aren't clear/should be reworded?<br>Any rules that you believe should be removed and why?<br>Any rules you believe should be added and why?

This is probably already well known, but might want to change section A rule 6 so that it states that if it is a ban evadable ban such as innapropriate username or such, that ban evading is technically allowed, since it doesnt clearly state that.

Vouch to remove the kys ban rule. Completely unnecessary and if someone actually does it then they're pretty weak to end it all by taking the advice of someone on Minecraft.<br>A warn or a kick would be sufficient unless they're spamming it, which is obviously against the rules anyway.

1st one: I agree, mods shouldn't punish on scrim servers unless someone is attacking someone to a ridiculous extent. I can see how mods would punish someone for severely bullying/harassing someone and it would be very obvious if this was the case.<br><br>2nd: I don't know how many times I have to say it. There is a difference between being pissed over dying in online lego - "Fuck you you camping shit, you've killed me 5 times, kys" and someone actually trying to bully someone. I understand that it would be terrible if someone self-harmed over mineman, but come on, its the internet... If you can't handle big words coming at you, go play a game where the chat is blocked out so the 10 year olds don't get off the computer and tell mummy and daddy that how to say fuck off was what they learnt today.<br><br>3rd: Admittedly the wording of some policies could be done better, but leaking is pretty black and white IMO

I don't know what you guys have been seeing, but mods are supposed to kick for first offense if someone says "Kys" in chat. We only punish more severely if they come back and do it again, or if it's a more "colorful" message, like "cut your wrists you bitch" or something along those lines.

But it's stupid that people get punished by saying this otherwise harmless message in chat. If someone is actually that stupidly sensitive that they get turned off by a message in an online block game, I'm sorry, but they need help, big time.

Do you think depression and anxiety is a <b>joke</b> Ben? Because it's not funny. Don't you want Avicus to be a safe place for all? I'm not really surprised you would take such a stance since you already have many punishments surrounding toxicity, suicide encouragement, homophobia and being extremely disrespectful. Seems to me like you don't mind oppressing the minorities.

<b>First:</b> Completely agree, it is so dumb, mostly when mods join just to spectate and end up telling all of us to be quiet.<b><br></b><br><b>Second:</b> I think it should be 2 kicks and then a temporary ban.<b><br></b><br><b>Third:</b> If a person leaks stuff, then he definitely should be demoted and maybe even banned because if a staff member was willing to leak things then he probably doesn't care much about Avicus.

To what Devon said:<br>1: I agree, unless it's way over the top.<br>2. No... Suicide encouragement in any way shouldn't be allowed. It's not a joke, never should be a joke, and there is no reason for it to come up in a conversation on Avicus unless it's a mature conversation like this is. I don't see why you or anyone would find it okay to tell someone to kill themselves. I don't understand where it becomes okay to literally encourage someone to take their own life. How does this help you get over your anger? Just yell at them through the computer screen. You can do whatever with yourself, but on a public platform is not the place for that kind of toxic behavior.

In reply to what people are saying about the encouraging suicide rule, KYS is incredibly rude, and as other mods have said, we treat it as severe rudeness, and kick on the first offense.

there should also be a subforum for bug reports, ma<i>k</i>ing it so you have to have a github account to make one is just silly and discourages people like myself from reporting bugs. if <i>y</i>ou're mainly using github to track issues then it shouldn't be too hard to just copy over a few bug reports<i>&nbsp;</i>now and again since the developers do such excellent work

I don't know what you guys have been seeing, but mods are supposed to kick for first offense if someone says "Kys" in chat. We only punish more severely if they come back and do it again, or if it's a more "colorful" message, like "cut your wrists you bitch" or something along those lines.

"<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; ">doesn't annoy anyone"<br>wrong.<br><br>personally, back in the old days, it was very frustrating to have to sit around a server with full teams spamming join team while watching people build crappy little houses or whatnot instead of pvping on a pvp server in an objective-based pvp gamemode. since this happens to be a thread suggesting new rules/amendments, I would like to propose that building houses in gamemodes where building houses is not the main objective of the game (all of them) should not be allowed. Essentially, building houses in the middle of a game is team griefing. If you have two teams of say 15 people of equal skill, do you think the team that has five people building houses will win against the team with all 15 people contributing actively? Although most games will not have people who are all of the same skill, the disadvantage conferred by a lack of numeric equality in the teams cannot be denied, and it's unfair to the teammates of people building houses that they got stuck on a team where team members are willingly holding them back. If people are so desperate to build, there's always this thing called singleplayer, other servers or even scrim servers, and hey, maybe avicus will <br>someday add a build server or something, but for now, for the love of all that is holy, please try to refrain from building on a pvp server even if it isn't against the rules.</span>

agree with the first one for sure. it doesn't state that clear enough for the most part. 2nd one as well, the &nbsp;leader can't control the members. 3rd one, i agree. if things like combat logging and team griefing is allowed, then tactical info and other things like that should be allowed too.

A lot of the time, it's very difficult to judge whether it is a joke amongst players or not. Shy of putting "JK" right next to it or immediately afterwards, there's very little way to tell. That's why it's treated with such severity. Moreover, a lot of the time it isn't directed, i.e. "Myworld6, KYS", and thus anyone in that game could take it personally, which is dangerous and can potentially result in harm to the person who takes it as such.

"The general rule as to how you should click is one button, one finger, one click."
</blockquote>
</div>
Essentially it just means, as a general rule, one button is clicked by one finger and that registers as one click. So as long as you aren't double clicking, ect, whilst you're butterfly clicking then it's fine. I'll try and reword it.

I don't think it should be a warn or a kick, because if a player combat logged, there's no way to know if he/she will be coming back after doing so. A tempban is good, in all honest opinions, so that they know that combat logging isn't allowed. Some players aren't and won't be aware of kicks/warns they recieve offline.

A lot of the time, it's very difficult to judge whether it is a joke amongst players or not. Shy of putting "JK" right next to it or immediately afterwards, there's very little way to tell. That's why it's treated with such severity. Moreover, a lot of the time it isn't directed, i.e. "Myworld6, KYS", and thus anyone in that game could take it personally, which is dangerous and can potentially result in harm to the person who takes it as such.

Players will recieve an excessive infraction punishment if they have 10+ infractions that are kicks/tempbans&nbsp;<b>within</b> the last 8 months. There is some exceptions with players that have 30+ infractions, it just shows they don't learn from their mistakes and are constantly breaking rules.<br><br>Regarding Advertising, we do have the right of freedom of speech, but we have to use common sense on what we can use and what we cannot use. We can't just got to the movie theaters and yell out fire, that's not cool and can be arrested for that. Advertising other servers is prohibited on all Minecraft servers as you are playing on that server for a reason. However, being on a server that is trying to grow itself, advertising other servers don't help our growth at all, it ruins it.

For a long time, people were abusing the staff and the rules by explaining that things weren't explicitely stated. I think that leaving a gap in the rules should be fine. It wouldn't mean that players would have to assume things that aren't blatantly obvious.

luckily for us, this is a minecraft server and not a country of some 300 million people, so in all likelihood it's quite possible to get the rules to cover everything they should and still be short enough to be digestible to the common man.<br><br>while it is likely true that if everyone had "common sense" and "thought before they took action" that no rules would ever be broken, it is a fact of life that we do not live in a perfect and uniform world, where everyone is identical in temperament and culture. as such, in order to create a community like avicus, it becomes necessary for the staff members to define what is allowed and what is not, thus breaking down any neurological or cultural barriers that may exist within people and preventing them from interacting as the server staff desires.

it doesn't really matter if this is in the rules or not, one must assume it to be true on every server that they play on which they do not personally own. adding it would simply make it more clear that in the end, the rules are just guidelines, and if the cruel hand of fate so wills it, all can end if the wrong people grow displeased with your presence.<br><br>if this does get added to the rules, i personally wonder what the community's reaction would be if it is given as the reason for someone's ban.

+1&nbsp;<br>I like the idea of having a set punishment for each rule. Then no one can complain when they get a punishment, it's clearly stated in the rules. The would also help with loopholes, and clarification among staff, and the community. For a while it seems like there has been this weird void of "Well they did this and to me that seems like it deserves this punishment" and that doesn't make a lot of sense. If there is a rule, then there should be a punishment for it. Obviously there needs to be a bit of leniency on some things, like caps, or spam, because sometimes it's an accident, or the reason isn't just to annoy people. Ex: "Join Mix" <b>x3</b> is technecly spam, it shouldn't be punished unless it's excessive, and in that case, it's annoying people. Or the accidental "HI MURPH HOW ARE YOU" when you're not paying attention and caps lock it on. There's a difference between intentionally breaking the rules and actually having a reason to "break" them.

I agree but, it should be more like<br><br><i>"The Avicus Network reserves the right to ban, unban, and kick and user from any Avicus services for any reason without notice, however the user has the right to appeal and/or challenge the punishment on the Avicus Website."<br></i><br>this will be used to cover loopholes and gives the user the ability to appeal their punishment or challenge it &nbsp;when they learn their lesson or they believe it is a false punishment.

A severity system would help with this since the punishment will be based on how severe the rule broken was, and this would remove any excessive punishments like a 1 month tempban for spamming.

1st one: I agree, mods shouldn't punish on scrim servers unless someone is attacking someone to a ridiculous extent. I can see how mods would punish someone for severely bullying/harassing someone and it would be very obvious if this was the case.<br><br>2nd: I don't know how many times I have to say it. There is a difference between being pissed over dying in online lego - "Fuck you you camping shit, you've killed me 5 times, kys" and someone actually trying to bully someone.

I think that the "kys" rule should be a couple warns and a couple kicks and then if they keep doing it then like a 1 day ban, because it's just a game and people shouldn't take it seriously, because most of the time it's over rage.

I don't know many of you personally, and I certainly don't know any of you well enough to know if you are depressed, but there's a point where you have to realize that some people come to Minecraft and video games in general to get away from the bullying at school, or at work, or where ever they may be.

I'm personally not depressed, or suicidal, but I know people that are/were and it's the most terrifying thing to have them tell you that they are thinking about ending their life. It's not a joke, and in no way should it be a joke.

why would you read chat with your 9 year old sister<br><br>tbh a ridiculous expectation

</div>
For right now, while Avicus is trying to grow, I think that anything that can be offensive towards someone, something that could make people leave, or even if chat leaves a bad impression on Avicus should be against the rules. The last thing we need right now is to allow things like "kys" and the n-word. &nbsp;We don't need to be driving people away because of something that is extremely rude and disrespectful is not in the rules.&nbsp;<br><br>Also where did I say that this was an expectation? I simply said that if I would have anything for Avicus right now, it would be a cleaner chat. Believe it or not, chat effects people's chances to stay/leave.<br><br>Also-Your expectation of allowing people to encourage suicide is quite ridiculous as well. Why would a server that is trying to grow allow people to encourage others to kill themselves. It creates a bad environment and leaves a bad impression on Avicus as a whole, as well as the respect you will get from staff members and other members of the community.

I don't. ^&nbsp;<br>The staff team as it is right now, with the changes that are up coming is improving a lot, and we are hoping for a much better year in 2017 than in 2016. Sure, there are some staff that can be inactive at times, or have a bad day with punishments, but overall every staff member contributes somehow, and it works. Yes, there are things that could be better, but things don't just happen overnight. Patience is going to be huge on the community's side of things.

Hasn't been done in a long time. Lots of inactive and bad staff members that could be looked into.

Note taken. We will investigate this, but reassessment is an extent which we want to avoid.&nbsp;<br><br>If you could, please contact me over on Community Slack if you have any staff issues, as it would help us greatly with the process.
