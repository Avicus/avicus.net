I was hugged once in elementary around 5 years ago. I loved it so much and I haven't been hugged since, and usually school is torture because I'm bullied all the time and have difficulty working. Was the best moment in my life actually.

Going on a orchestra trip to an amusement park to perform, then the teacher gave us free time. I went to the arcade and spent my time on this prize machine, where you have to cut the string exactly so that the gift drops down. Well, I ended up winning a MacBook Air for $5.

That's beyond epic. I had a similar experience... but only in the sense that I went to an amusement park for an orchestral performance. Half my class ended up getting lost after the whole trophy distribution ordeal, and we got back to school past midnight, two hours after we were scheduled to return. This was in the seventh grade, by the way. Four years ago.<br><br>Ahh, but that was a terrible experience. More to the topic, my "best moment" was when I purchased Valentine's Day chocolates for the girl I had a crush on two years ago during freshman year —&nbsp;although I did get brutally rejected, she thanked me and said that she appreciated my gesture. Even though we practically never spoke to each other again (I'm pretty sure she hates me now, actually), I felt a slight, albeit brief, sense of belonging knowing that someone valued my existence. Unfortunately, I haven't had that feeling since. Talking to girls is beyond hard.<br><br>And here I am now, doing nothing with my life.

Well i had some cool moments in school.<br><br>It was recently in high school when we vs. a good team in basketball and it was just me and my nerdy friends. There wernt good at basketball but 2 of them were decent. It was a tie 5-7 enemy team. We were playing halfcourt and the opponent tried to drive in the ball and he was 5'11 while i was 5'6. When he layed the ball up, i immediately blocked it and slapped out and my friend luckly managed to save the ball, pass it to me again from the 3-point shot, and i managed to score for the game winning shot :) Very accomplished for me and a bunch of nerds but i respected them.<br><br>Also, there was a time in 4th grade where we played dodge ball against 6 graders and it was me and my best friend only left. The enemy had like 10-12 members and they threw a lot of dodgeballs at us. Luckly, me and my friend managed to dodge them but there was this big kid who threw dodgeballs very fast. He aimed straight for my face. When i blinked, the ball was right there. Somehow, it was like a slo-mo moment where i managed to dodge the ball by movin my body to the side, and countred by throwing a ball back at him. Everyone was like "ooo" and i felt really proud to take down a big guy.&nbsp;<br><br>:)

A couple of the "cool kids" last year were out skating on a pond and then my friend blew a police whistle and they all started freaking out and ran like hell while my friend his in the bush. Lmao&nbsp;<br><br>Another time I was walking being stupid with Splade and I had snow in my hand and was swinging my arms like a tard and ended up hitting the windsheild of a car with the snow. The lady reversed in the middle of the road, stopped in front of up and started saying "you can't do this OK? It's not funny. You can't do this!" In some wierd accent that was a mix between a few accents while her son just sat there and looked like, "Wtf are you doing mom. Omg this is embarrassing."&nbsp;<br><br>She reversed <i><u>in the middle of the</u></i>&nbsp;road, not even pulled over to the side, for like 10 seconds

Jesus, this is a big throwback (cri cri) but here we go....<br>_____________________________________________________<br><br>PGL is a selection of youth hostels in many places (generally forests) around the UK, and in year 6 my year at my primary went there, as has been the tradition every year. But it was an amazing experience and I loved it so much, and I will treasure that memory forever.<br><br>For more information on what PGL do, please visit this website.<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.pgl.co.uk/en-gb/school-trips?utm_source=Google&amp;utm_medium=PAYPERCLICK&amp;utm_content=PGL-G-S-BE-PGL-EXACT-PGL&amp;utm_campaign=Brand+Exact&amp;gclid=CN-O8bOywcICFfHKtAodzRYAKg">http://www.pgl.co.uk/en-gb/school-trips?utm_source=Google&amp;utm_medium=PAYPERCLICK&amp;utm_content=PGL-G-S...</a>

In 6th grade, my school throws an epic party to celebrate our graduation from primary school! It was AWESOME!

"6th grade" and "epic party" are never things I'd thought would be in the same sentence

aah....a few years back, me and my best friend were sitting in the school hall for assemby. And there was some younger students standing up and speaking about these "Homemade, non-toxic" cleaning sprays. Anyways, one of these kids got up and started by saying "And this is my spray that I made. Its extremely toxic, and..." obviosly it was an accident that he said toxic, but me and my friend found it extremely funny (We were quite small back then). Everyone started laughing, but by the time everyone had stopped, me and my friend were still literally rolling on the floor laughing.we were crying from laughter...&nbsp;You see, me and my friend have this thing, where if one of us starts laughing, the other also starts, and we can stop. We just about laughed through the rest of assembly, and at the end a teacher almost gave us a detention.
