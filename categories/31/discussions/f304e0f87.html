Some of the blocks you place seem a little faster than 13cps, that seems kinda sketchy, but nothing that is concrete evidence.<br>You also have some really weird headsnaps - too frequent to be luck, but those just look like good aim as you seem like a good pvper.<br><br>When I was mod, I would have watched you a fair bit as sometimes you look a bit sketchy, but based off that evidence, I wouldn't have banned you and I'm curious to see how that evidence is defended.

0ue, honestly banning people with votes..... lacks evidence of me using autoclicks &nbsp;or whatever. If you think that I hack or do some shit and you just take votes of me hacking or not... really, what the crap is wrong with this server mods. Also, there are no servers for me that have great hit detections. You know why, I live in Japan and when I connect to a far server, my connection through the server is never stable.
