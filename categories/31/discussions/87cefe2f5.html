Hello people!<br><br>There are some different staff teams know in minecraft servers, one does apps, other do hand picked and you could go on like that.<br>But how would you organise a event staff team, You'd have to think about the following things:<ul><li>Ranks</li><li>Communication</li><li>Roles</li><li>Policies</li></ul>There are of course more things you can think of, so: suggest!<br><br>EDIT: this is in no way related to the current staff and will not influence it.
