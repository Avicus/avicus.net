I'm curious how everyone first discovered Avicus. Was it through a friend (viva voce), a server list, a YouTube video, an advertisement, or something else?

I and some friends were looking for a server to record on and (I hope I get tagging right) <img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/888f6c68ddbd43db98898fc528921691?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/FatherHurl.html" style="color: none">FatherHurl</a> and&nbsp;<img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/e34423301b63402f8ace310c1417d44e?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/LemonLime_x.html" style="color: none">LemonLime_x</a> showed myself and&nbsp;<img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/2748cb22eb1e44dbae5ec4c2bc4ece1c?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/Glesmon.html" style="color: #5D5D5D">Glesmon</a> Avicus that they have been playing on for a while.

On the week that I was getting Minecraft, I asked my friend for cool servers that we can play on and he gave me this server. When it came to the day, I went on this server first and had a blast with my friend :D. I never expected to get this far, tbh. I gave my skipp18 account to my mom so she can use it for therapy for the kids she can worked with, so I got this account for Christmas that year :).

Well back when the server was very big, like almost as big as my brothers weight, I saw the server (MCZone) at the time has Survival Games, The Walls and Sky Wars, the 3 gamemodes I was really into 3 years ago so I joined and really enjoyed the server, met some new people and had a great time. Now I am here! Who would've known. xd

The dates on profile indicate when you joined Avicus, and they exclude MCZone. It's pretty dumb.

I was like nine and I had gotten MC a few months back and I wanted to start playing multiplayer and my friend played the game as well. He told me he was "famous" a had a YT channel with over 10k (he was an attention seeker and had low self esteem all through his childhood and I was friends with him because I felt bad for him, and then the popular kids started to pity him and now he's a dick). So he told me this server was for famous MC youtubers and I saw right through him but an argument was pointless because he just wouldn't listen, so I just came on to here and played SG for 4 straight hours. I didn't win a single time because at the time I sucked and was also getting like 4 FPS, but I got better, joined a couple of other servers, and I ended up here.<br><br>i was 9 ok

Found MCZone on a random server list, then saw a bunch of people being hyped for Avicus' release on Nov. 3rd. Stayed up all night to try to be the first one on, but I eventually fell asleep and came on in the afternoon of that day. =')

That's how I found OCN. MeMyselfAndPi has never actually played Avicus, although it'd be awesome if he did.

Even though I'm not new i'll fill it out anyway.<br><br>I had just gotten Minecraft 3-4 years ago, so my friend introduced me to two servers. A server called CraftPimp and Avicus. The guy who introduced me was a randie (cadeknuth21). He is an IRL friend, or well he used to be.

Already did this but I thought I’d give a better explanation.<br><br>My friend and his friend wanted to play Walls. They found this server, then my friend gave it to me, I started playing alot and got really into the server. I played less and less after finding another server, I cheated and got permbanned, I got unbanned and made alot of friends on here, my friend ans his friend arent playing anymore but I still am.

The year was 2014, i had just moved to Devon and befriended a Peruvian Llama rider (if you know who it is..well done). He was crazy, insane and manic, he introduced me to something called teamspeak. I entered, fear in my eyes and followed this mans instructions. He took me to a place called avicus and forced me to talk to the hyped up personality of Merp...A week later i find myself on the actual server playing with OscarElNana (FriendlyModOscar etc...) the Llama rider. I have been trapped ever since, waiting for the Lord Kylo to return and free me.<br><br>I think i took this a bit too seriously.
