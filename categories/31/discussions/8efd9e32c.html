<b>Hello there guys, Ingigo here. Today I am here to ask you a simple question, what is your opinion on Avicus. You might ask me why I am making this Thread, my answer is that I am going to make a review video on servers and I decided to start on Avicus. Just give me some Pros, Cons and Things to improve on in this format -<br></b><ul><li>Pros<b></b></li><li>Cons</li><li>Things to Improve on!</li></ul><b>Also, could you elaborate on your opinion, at least two sentences will do for each one, it will help me a lot. If you have any opinions on Gamemodes and any new gamemodes you want just display them here.&nbsp;<br></b><i><b>Thanks Guys, I will look forward in reading your opinions! IngiOut</b></i>

I wrote this in another topic but I think it belongs here too.<br><br>I can honestly tell you guys what the issue is, we are not allowed to 
have our own opinions and thoughts about anything. If you think of 
something that has been said before and post a topic about it, you get 
attacked with posts about how it has been addressed before, if you come 
with suggestions how something can be improved you are attacked yet 
again. You are even attacked in-game if you're not a "famous" or 
"well-known" player, I know the moderators are aware of this but nobody 
is doing anything about it, that's why Avicus is destroying their own 
reputation and losing players every day.

@Zintenka<br>While I do agree with some MC Zone gamemodes such as CTW and SG coming back, I don't think Sky Wars would be huge.<br><br>Anybody's thought on the current people in the community is an opinion, not a fact.

It's important to note that school has started in the Northern Hemisphere, which will drop the player count.<br><br>Many gamemodes had little to no players on near the end of MC Zone, I do think that SG and CTW should be back though.<br><br>We have some new gamemodes in planning for the future.<br><br>All of the rules are reasonable but should be enforced more lightly.

Avicus has had a big blow recently - there had been a big decline in players. I fell that eventually, RIP. This is very sad, but the only reason people don't want to play this now is because of the lag - and as Zintenka said, we need to bring back the gametypes we loved, and the Moderators, no offense, are too strict on small infractions like spleefing - I got banned for that once. We really need to have a re-think about this server otherwise it may go into meltdown. Avicus is going down, this is such a shame.<br><br>iBiZa :(

NolanDalton. <br><br>You can't really blame it on school or anything like that, we all see how staff is retiring one after another and how players quit one after another. It's not because of school or any other excuse, it's because they don't agree with you guys. How do you expect a new player to stay longer than a month if you don't even give a damn about us? You said it yourself, "People will come and people will go", that's what we are, we are people, not anybody who made Avicus become what it is today.

Was it "because of school" MLGtino was demoted too? I sure do remember that video he made where he explained what really happened and how he got demoted because of a mistake. I'm sure many of us guys quit or retire just because of the fact that we are not appreciated by staff or the owner/s either. I never acknowledged or even felt appreciated by any staff, since day one I was attacked with harassments and threats and when I reported or sent a mail about it, nobody did anything about it, instead my posts was removed because the fact that staff doesn't want to acknowledge the issues occurring on Avicus.<br><br>Will my posts get removed again or<span> am I entitled to have my own opinion</span> for once?

But they need to loosen up and talk like a normal player for once! Maturity is good, but not when you're too mature....When you turn 14, you arent just 14. You are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, etc. I hope to see the staff improve.

You are correct my friend and I do agree with you to 115%, anytime! What about all the players who bought ranks or all the well-known players who actually make Avicus what it is today? I only played one month but I got to know so many great players here and they did make me look forward to play on Avicus. It's players like EricV4, EmeraldSword85, sunrise, glitchy, tel, my worst enemy ironsoldier, and so many more. I do think these players have made an impact on the server and make Avicus what it is today, why would I otherwise be aware of these players when I only played for a short amount of time? It's because of these players Avicus gets good reputation.

I never acknowledged or even felt appreciated by any staff, since day one I was attacked with harassments and threats and when I reported or sent a mail about it, nobody did anything about it, instead my posts was removed because the fact that staff doesn't want to acknowledge the issues occurring on Avicus.<br><br>Will my posts get removed again or<span> am I entitled to have my own opinion</span> for once?

Actually he got a warning for that mistake, but decided to retire after that..

Interesting Opinions Throughout, I will somehow sum this all up and create a video. Hopefully Ivy could see this video and make changes to Avicus. This could be beneficial to the future of Avicus.

its bad<br><br>Essentially, the lag is insane, the ncp is worse then the lag, some of the staff are worse than the ncp, the level of maturity is worse than some staff, and there are so many things that could be improved but aren't, that its just to the point where... like... its just bad. I don't even have a word because there aren't any in the English language to describe the number of problems in this server.<br><br>ok

A lot of people are being honest about Avicus, and outputting their opinions. I respect that, and I agree with a lot of them. I may as well give mine:<br><br><b>Pros:</b><br>- <i>Games</i>: Yeah, most of them aren't played that much, but what IS played, I find a lot of fun. Of course, Nebula is my favorite because it really was an original concept that was engaging and fun, where you could be laid back and have fun with friends or be really competitive with strategies and techniques. Nexus is TDM Kit PVP which is always fun, and Avicade (while a bit unstable) is a great assortment of smaller minigames. There's also Walls, CTH, and Elimination, which I don't play as much so I won't elaborate much on.<br><br>-&nbsp;<i>Community</i>: Some people say our community sucks, since we tend to be a bit immature and we don't take "opinions" very well. I definitely won't disagree, since I see very clearly where they're coming from. However, I think that we still have a fun, loving community. Unlike a lot of servers, you can really develop friendships and have fun with a lot of people. Practically everyone here is nice, and a lot of users Skype and talk in Teamspeak. Even in-game, we like to joke around and have fun through the in-game chat. This is definitely one of the main reasons I still play on this server today.<br><br><i></i><i>- Custom maps</i>: We allow users to build maps and submit them through the forums, where the map devs can put them into the server for people to play on. I believe it's a great feeling to have your map be played by people (sadly I haven't had that feeling yet) and it really helps you interact with the community.<br><br><b>Cons</b><br><i>- Instability</i>: I honestly have to agree with people on this. The NCP and lag on this server get super annoying when PvPing, though I don't seem to experience it as much as other people do. However, I still do get block lag and NCP seems to hate me when I go up stairs...<br><b><br></b><i>- Chat</i>: Whenever I go into a game, there's always things like caps, spam, swearing, profanity, racism, hack accusations, raging, rudeness, you name it. Of course, it's balanced by the friendly talk of the community, but it really gets onto my nerves to see all this crap that's being put into chat. Honestly, I don't even know why this happens, but it seems to happen a lot more than in other servers.<br><b><br></b><i></i>That's all I have for now, I guess...<b><br></b><b></b>

My thoughts:<br>Pros: Avicus has a great 'regular' community. 'Regular' as in the people who are most active both on forums and in game.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avicus has some great staff, and nebula and nexus are 2 great gamemodes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tons of unique maps, and a hard working map dev team, if only 'map' was removed, avicus would be great... with a hard working 'dev' team. ;p<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cons:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Developing is extremely slow, avicus needs like 2 or 3 more devs :P <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Server instability, tons of lag and crashes lately, hasn't been fixed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Low morale, due to the numbers dropping and staff leaving... people are starting to believe avicus is dying... and if the community continues to do so..

avicus has a pretty good community. most of them are supportive and fun and awesome, but the rest are complete shitheads. it seems like there is little in between.&nbsp;<br><br>development is slow and things are "going to happen" aren't happening. some staff leave and come back within a few days. the amount of players is decreasing. some of this is to do with school, but i think we need to stop being in denial and saying that all of it is. a few staff are ineffective at best, and harsh to many players. they need to loosen up. the rest of the staff team is chill and nice &lt;3.

It is getting less attention every time due to the fact that it doesn't serve something new to the table.

I feel like the community is slowing down. No not only because of school but because the players who actually care about Avicus are being pushed away by new "Hackers" that have yet to be caught, immature players over using caps and spamming a whole lot of garbage<b><i><u> I stress that one!!!!</u></i></b>. I honestly cant go one game without someone yelling out some garbage it puts me in a terrible mood and i just wanna stop playing from there on out. I feel like Avicus Staff really need to reconsider some rules and instead of thinking of the future think of the present... Yes, i know the Staff work extremely hard and are damn good at it.

The general concensus is we need a dev that will actually be active and listen to feedback.<br><br>So, I suggest one of the staff get in contact with Ivy and send him the link to this forum and tell him to read it. Tbh if he has lost interest in Avicus and is not bothered deving for it anymore (which does happen) then I think he should just resign, promote a Manager or Sr.Mod to Owner (or just leave the managers in charge) and find a new developer that can take over.

Pros: On Avicus all players are treated equally, it is not common to see a diamond going around and thinking hes better than all the Emeralds, Golds and Regulars just because he has a more expensive rank. Howsie tries extra hard and all the staff try their best to enforce this and make the community as comfortable as possible.

An essay i wrote when asked what Avicus means to me:<br><br>
















It is incomprehensible. An online and in
game revolution of connecting and sharing. Avicus. Beyond the electrifying
games of Nebula, Walls and the other strategic leisures, comes the web of
wonder, worries and wackiness. The forums.

We welcome the new and mourn the leaving,
but all in all, the spirit that hovers around this campaign of friendship is
indestructible.

&nbsp;

Avicus, to me means emotion. Annoyance,
envy, depression and rage. 4 lurking emotions that drive some to leaving and
fuel others to arguing back. This is actually an aspect if my presence in
Avicus. These four emotions, really do spice the server up for me and provide
occasional giggles and rants, it gives electricity to the wiring of the server.
And to top this off, there are the calm, mellow and deep moments of a person’s
life or accomplishment that ripple waves of envy and sympathy throughout me.
This is addicting. I honestly just cannot wait to get on each and every day to
see what’s new with some of our most popular and effervescent characters, and
this just keeps me alive in the posts.

&nbsp;

But the games. Wow. Indistinguishably
attractive games that make me moaning to return for some revenge in walls or to
hear the joyful ‘ding’ of Nebula each time a kill is inflicted. I enjoy
mounting the online statistics and piling the objectives along with the support
of our very own crew to play with you.

&nbsp;

My relationship with Avicus is similar to
that of a rechargeable battery. It will run and fuel itself time and time
again, sometimes getting down or depleted, but new life and energy is
constantly added. We share something nothing anyone on any other server in any
place will share. We can stand as one to fight social topics or scatter as many
to debate and summarize.

THIS, is what Avicus means to me now and
for days, weeks, months and years to come, whether im online or not.

Adding to on to what I said, there are just some members of this community who are so toxic to everyone else. They are becoming bad influences to the people who play on this server. I am not affected by these since I already know very well what is right and what is wrong. I am just concerned about the other people who are going to be involved in all of these nonsense that will happen in-game or on the forums. I've had a couple experiences of BM (bad mannered) people on this server. I think they are immature and ridiculous. However, I am not ready to just diss them. I believe there is a time for change. I've made many good friends, yet I also have made people dislike me even if I didn't do anything to them. I just really don't think that people should be this way to others. These are just my opinions on the server and what I noticed over time.&nbsp;<br><br>tl;dr - To all bad mannered people (I know some won't respond to this), please do something about yourselves.

Maybe new members heard about Avicus and they want to check it out. They don't know the Ip and look in the internet, then they see, the Network has a forum and they want to see what is going on. Now they see the forum, the leaving and complain threads. They also look in interesting threads like this, Opinion threads. Now they are shocked, cuz they see that the players are saing the Network is dying and almost all are complaining about the owner, nobody is playing there and that are some players, that are posting constantly comments. Now a question to you, would you play on such a server? If not, then thats how a potential player would decide. To play on Avicus is a privileg and if you are always complaining, then just don't play on the server. If you want to contribute the server or if you make suggestions then is all okay. Maybe try to code a gamemode and sumbit it to Ivy? I respect your opinions and some of them are right, what I see. And this is mine and it would great if you do the same to me. Thank you.

Get more staff. Amen, I know that taking time is better but what is there to take time!? just open staff apps starting today or tomorrow and close it a week later, and then you can take you time to check. Sorry if I am insulting all the people who check the apps, but opening and closing the apps don't need time, its the checking it and interviewing

I love Avicus, it has a great community and its rly fun, but I don't like how little people there are. I feel like now that school started again, no one is on. The other day, there were as little as 90 people on at one time, causing games on only a few servers to actually run. I hate having only a few choices, especially if I dont like the maps, or if one of my favorite maps is on a server with 0 people on it. I think one way to fix this would be to remove the rule that keeps servers from starting if they ave less than four ppl to a team. You can get two players easy, one for each team, but waiting for eight players is &nbsp;bit of a stretch. I understand that Avicus just can't make itself bigger, but I think it could do more connecting to the worldwide Minecraft community, kind of like OCN does, which is why they have so many players.

IMO, Avicus before was good. I wasn't in the MCZONE days but i heard stories of it. I heard that in MCZONE, the play base was just as high as OCN's player base. I was going to check it out later and i found Avicus. Avicus when i first went there, i first hated Avicus. (sowwy) because of the tensions between OCN and Avicus but i understood about it and i do not blame either side. I forget about the past and move on. The maps in Avicus are not as great. Many map makers still favor aehenistics over gameplay. Some maps have that in Avicus. Gameplay should be top priority in mapmaking but it hsould also go side by side with great design placement. Maps should also not have those extra space's in the maps that make it look "cool"<br><br>Another thing that is a problem about the maps is the size in general. Some maps are just way to huge to be played on which can result in bad gameplay. Make map's a bit smaller and the map's should have gameplay.<br><br>Avicus right now is decreasing IMO. The player base has dropped and it is notciable. I think one way to fix this is advertising of course. Make popular youtube video's about avicus and spreead your youtube channel. That is one way.<br><br>Staff: The taff in Avicus is good. It is way better in Mineplex because they always do their job. However, mods should be on the same page and know what they are doing. this is why i prefer Hand-pick staff rather than apps but Avicus staff is good either way :)<br><br>Gamemodes: IMO, i do not think Ivy is doing anything. Do not get me wrong, Ivy is kewl and all but he hasn't been making a lot of announcement's lately or any updates about Avicus. Ivy should hire more dev's so Avicus can progress. Dev's can help Avicus grow by cool plugins and stuff. Just a heads up! moar dev's that can code! Also, i think decreasing the server's in Avicus would be nice since there is less players.<br><br>The Community: Ok. The community in Avicus is sorta falling apart. Some people blame it on the staff. It is not entirely their fault. YOU are part of the community so that means we each take full blame on what happens in this community. Only you can fix the community. If you see people going away, it is natural for them to go away. IT is sad but we must let it go.

Pros: <br>-Online community seems nice<br>-Nice stuff; cool a wide variety of gamemodes to play, <br>-A relatively large amount of players to play with.<br>-Staff are very helpful, but (see second to last con)<br><br>Cons: <br>-Maps are usually entirely shifted towards gameplay with no aesthetics, or the reverse. Trust me; there are so many maps that do this.<br>-Somewhat of a lack of dedicated staff<br>-The community really is full of a lot of rotten eggs that like to cuss out other players, spam, and generally be sore-losers/winners after every match. I think that the rules should be stricter than it is now. It is what drives some players away. This also includes the fact that staff are not abundant here. For the medium-ish player base of Avicus, I'd say that Avicus needs at least double, if not, triple the amount of moderators it has now.<br>-Empty servers; empty gamemodes. Nobody plays on the other gamemodes. Nebula is practically the only thing that's played, along with a little bit of Nexus. Honestly, I think it has a little bit to do with the lobby. I know you can use the items to get to different servers/gamemodes, but some players like the genuine feel of going to a server board and clicking on the signs. The lobby should be a bit smaller, imo.

I realize we only have Ivy but if we would get more coders maybe the PvP code wouldn't be so weird and messed. Also it feels like there's no effort going towards fixing kits and game modes (CTH kit Scout and Elimination) that I know have been so broke for such a long time. Avicus has potential but I feel as if no one really has strived to improve the server. I know some do really but imagene how this looks from a community point of view. Avicus has great game modes and a great community but it seems like it's all gone to waste. I really love the server but it feels like a sinking ship sometimes...&nbsp;<br><br>EDIT: we need to take a look at who really deserves staff. I mean there's lots of AMAZING staff here but there is one or two who don't really deserve staff and a couple of community members who deserve staff more then them tbh.

More game modes, more advertising, change some of the rules, make the firewall stronger, Make Youtube videos of the server (advertising), Make bigger teams, make modes such as: Creative, Prison, PVP (lets more variety into the server, more players).<br>These are some improvements iv'e thought of that WILL help Avicus, in some ways.<br>Don't let Avicus die!
