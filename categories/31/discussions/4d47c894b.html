It's good that Spart is keeping this going. At least be thankful for that and don't try to create an argument please.

spookz, can you just shut up. on all the freaking post players make you need to reply even after an official reply from a mod, so since you are probably going for mod, i'd recommend to stop doing this.

Okay, I don't want to be rude, but lets stop this conversation. I don't want it turning into a full-scale argument, and just so you know, there is nothing wrong with what Spookz is doing.

It wasn't an argument until you said '<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; ">don't try to create an argument please.'&nbsp;</span>
