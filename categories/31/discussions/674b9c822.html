Well considering it went down with the forums (Server and forums are host together) It might have been a host side issue

It wasn't, it was a mistake by a staff member or someone.

It may have been:<br>1 - A small update.<br>2 - A host problem.<br>3 - A legal issue.<br>4 - Something to do with the EULA.<br>5 -&nbsp;<i>(Insert idea here).</i>

As the right hand of Shrek, the almighty, i know what is going on.<br>We have not worshiped Shrek enough by not building enough shrines, so Shrek is angry at us and as his wrath, he put some downtime on Avicus.<br>Luckily, you have me. I did my best to calm him down, and it seems i succeeded. For now.<br>We must start worshiping Shrek more or this might happen again, but more direly.<br>Best regards:<br>Shrek's right hand

I know, its part of EULA, it happend to my server as well, wasn't letting me start my server until I went into a txt folder called EULA.txt and had to change EULA : false<br>to EULA : True, its just making sure that the servers accept the EULA. Ivy probably didn't know what was going on until he looked at the consol or something.

Its was probably just a small problem with the tech shiz or a DDOS. Either way its sorted now so I dont think it really matters although I must say I am curious.

They might be on the same machine, but just because the minecraft server is down, doesn't mean that Apache shuts down along with it

Most likely a hosting issue, both run on the same servers, and the hosting company must have had some issues.
