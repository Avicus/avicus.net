I personally didn't like the shop items before, only the Spanky Spade. I prefer Nebula to have everyone in equal/relatively equal armor and items.

The amount of diamond blocks was significantly decreased.<br>Opples give you a significant PvP advantage. Making you nearly invincible to just about any player, no matter the armor they have equipped.<br>

Opples are way too OP, no matter when the use of them. You are literally invincible for 30 seconds, and the only way to kill you is to combo you out of the world with knockback. Not very fair at all.

99, you don't have to act this way because you don't like the Nebula shop. I don't think you understand how much work Para has done for the server :/. Fixing the nebula shop isn't the first thing on his mind. He has many other issues that he needs to fix, and we've been fixing almost every one of the bugs that have been reported in order of when they were reported.

Ok finally someone gets why I am mad because "it's staying gone" is not a good answer and when Para said your not doing it right kinda rude. I am sorry if my comments were rude but Thomas Shoe and I don't have a good history.<br>

It's just improved quite a bit. Players are just used to the way it was before. If everything was the same, there'd be no point in updating.
