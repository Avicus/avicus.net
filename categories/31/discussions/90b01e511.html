My Demotion.

<a href='/users/Eteh.html' style='color: none'>Eteh</a>
<small>August 21, 2016 at  4:08 PM UTC</small>
</h1>
<div>I'm making this thread just to address the questions&nbsp;pertaining to my demotion from Moderator.<br><br>So for the past few weeks you may or may not have seen a change in my attitude but I had been treating the Admins somewhat rashly. &nbsp;<br><br>I got demoted for "Immaturity and Disrespect". I do agree on part of the demotion as there were clear evidence supporting half of it but the other half was just not supported with sufficient and strong evidence. I was given a staff warning but after that I felt that I toned down a little but I guess that's not what the admins thought.</div><div><br></div><div>So, you may ask, <b>what did I do?</b> I tried to step up for those moderators, whom was afraid to do so against the seniors, who felt that a change is needed in the seniors by giving them feedback on how they can improve. However,&nbsp;I gave them a tone which wasn't pleasant and I admit that I was a little rash. I just hope they'll consider what I said to them and take out the rash bits to actually realise what's the main purpose of me giving them feedback to improve on the staff team.&nbsp;<br><br>I would also like to take the opportunity to apologise to whoever I have offended or treated badly for the past few weeks.&nbsp;<br><br>I'll still be around, just not in the staff team. Hit me up on slack or skype if you have anything to ask me.</div><div><br></div>

Well there are different ways of giving opinions. Not saying Eteh fell under one of these but here is how I see it. There are people who give opinions and feedback in a calm and respectful manner. Then there are the people who do it in the sense of talking down to them, bashing them, swearing, and such. If you want to give proper feedback you will not be punished for constructive criticism. On the other hand people do get punished for destructive criticism.

It's a shame to see you go. You were a great mod and it always impressed me that you were willing to stand for what you believed was right. Even if you were overruled, you didn't change your attitude towards something, a trait that I respect greatly.&nbsp;<br><br>See you around. =(

In regards to your 3rd point, I put it in bold and quotation marks because I'm basically quoting what he said, and since when did I pick on his English? Since when was I being rude to him?

For future reference, you usually only grammar check people when trying to argue with someone either if you have almost no ground to fight back and you want to try and gain some ground, or you're Andrew.
