no. Bad dinnerbone. Arrows seems awesome, won't do much of a difference because we can already do the flame arrows with flame bows, and I'm sure Avicus won't put in poison arrows. Too horrible and OP.<br>And pls no with the shield, I like it now where we have to actually know how to pvp to win. I'm guessing the shield is for protection... great, another thing that can protect your opponent

I love this idea because then we can have an assassin class for realz! Also then you can have wizards and I doubt they will make the arrows too op... I like the quiver and the shield, it makes it more like medeival times :)<br>All the hate is because people can't accept change. This will most likely make MC a game of more skill because if people master a sword and shield combo... WATCH OUT!

Interesting Ideas and I would like to see how this affects pvp in the future. What if they are exploding arrows that don't harm a certain part on environment. How they will be used in tournaments. How they will be used in pub matches. How it will affect minecraft in general. So many things could happen I get goose bumps thinking about it

I'm really curious to see how the shield mechanics work. I think it will be like block hitting but without the actually blocking, or a substitute to blocking, which would bring up the shield rather than blocking your sword. Also glad so far no new weapons have been added, just made the current weapons more interesting with the multiple arrows.

shields are not a good idea, just use blockhitting<br>quivers are fine, why not. easier for organization.<br>new arrow types might be op, but if balanced well in the gameplay when you are making maps, they could be great.<br><br>i kinda agree that it's becoming a bit complex, all the arrow types seem to go too far, but they often change something about the features before the real update comes out. this is a first draft, it could become simpler. just wait and see yall.

Like everyone else, I'm a bit skeptical about the shield, but I'm open to change in Minecraft and I'm excited to see some new stuff.<br><br>Honestly I'm more afraid of what the bow will be like. What will the quiver be of use for, and how will the new arrows affect the bow? The bow is already an extremely potent weapon, and I wonder if the devs will make the quiver necessary to carry around. Hopefully not.

again, +1... zintenka is saying some good stuff in this thread. imagine being the minecraft developers, never playing pvp so you don't know what to do. of course you ask the pvp community what they want, right? and dinnerbone did. but some of yall are saying to simplify it and some people are saying to make it more complex and add more. the people who are on the reddit thread telling them what to add are the ones getting their opinions heard. don't say it's "more modded". it's still vanilla minecraft. you can say they're making it more complicated, but saying that here on small minecraft server isn't gonna do anything to prevent it.

I don't have a problem with it unless they actually change the mechanics.

I don't understand why everyone's so upset about the shield.<br>No-one even knows how it'll work or how it'll affect gameplay, why do people think it's going to fail based off one picture?<br><br>We have swords and bows, a shield seems like a logical addition in my opinion.

I think a shield will be like armour protection :P. Tbh I never really like 1.8 so this is going to be a hard change....

For the arrows and shield can't we just disable people from crafting them if they are too OP?

"RIP PvP"? I think this will make it more interesting!<br><br>People claim that Minecraft PVP is getting more stale, now it's apparently getting too complicated! I'd love to see some new stuff to add in a variety and I'm even more excited to see what new styles of PVP arise from this new update!

yes. exactly. we need to remember that these will not necessarily be in every single avicus map, the maps that get accepted have balanced gameplay, so this won't ruin pvp unless people make it, at least on avicus.

Ok, you guys aren't making much sense. I do feel iffy about the shield idea, but honestly how does a shield make Minecraft "not simple?" We don't even know how it's going to be used. It could be like bonus armour, or a thing that comes up when you right click, etc. If you think that isn't "simple" then something is wrong.
