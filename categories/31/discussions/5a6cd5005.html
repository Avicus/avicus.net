Alright. I'm here today to confront a certain issue I've been seeing. I would really appreciate for everyone to be more considerate of others' feelings on the server. Don't judge people on their beliefs, their way of speaking, or how they play. Don't say things that could offend them in any way, even if you didn't mean to. I've also been seeing this kind of behavior towards and from staff. Sometimes I'll see staff members being yelled at because someone said something rude, and the staff member didn't say "Watch the language!" although it was one minor swear word. Just because you, a player, said "Don't swear" and a staff member did not doesn't make them a bad staff member. In fact, they could have warned the player using /warn, or decided that this player did not deserve a warn or infraction. Please try to be aware of this too,&nbsp;because staff have feelings as well. Instead of joining in on the bullying, try to defend the player! ^-^<br>Have a great day/night! :)

Let's think logically here.<br><br>Writing this was close to pointless because this only targets a good 90% of the forums, because the other 10% are people who are inconsiderate or not applying for staff.<br><br>This mainly goes along with the new randoms coming online, or just the morons who have no life, no maturity, and no brains. They don't read the forums though.<br><br>so lol

<span>Well, the point I was trying to get across there was that just because a player said that and a staff member did not does not necessarily mean the staff member is bad, or was being lazy. It also doesn't mean that the player was saying it in the right context as well.<br></span>EDIT:<br>@Tino No no I was talking about forum regulars.

IMO, I love when someone say "Hey! it's swearing, no swacherin", but, I hate when the people spam saying "Ha. Dude, your English sucks!".<br>That's my point.

I haven't seen any of this because of not being very active anymore, but I would definitely have to agree with you. Staff deserve tons of respect for working to keep the server nice and fun to play on. Also, try seeing it from the staff's point of view before saying something. Maybe they're tired, getting lazy (not meant to be an insult. Everyone gets lazy once and a while :3), or just don't want to say something in chat because of checking for hackers or any other reasons. Keep it up staff! You're awesome! :D

thank you for pointing this out. staff are doing great jobs, and don't think you know how to do their job for them. they're aware it happened.<br><br>also, thanks for the comment about offending people. i've witnessed very offensive behavior myself and wonder why people are complaining about the minor swears more than the offensive stuff.

I get players thinking I'm not doing my job all the time. If someone says a swear, Mods know how to handle it, whether it's just letting it slide or giving a command warning

I agree but then also kind of disagree at the same time. For the most part, yes you are right staff should be treated better. However, in relation to them using /warn and not saying anything in chat, that shouldn't happen. A verbal warning should always come before using official methods of punishment, as a senior staff member has said before. <br><br>Also there has been a good few times where I was ingame with a staff member who was not AFK, and were so absorbed in the game that they let some pretty vulgar language apparently go un-noticed. It's not really too big a deal as I really just see 1 or 2 staff members doing this so yes for the most part I agree with you.

I can completely understand where you are coming from! However, a verbal warn and the /warn command have the same purpose. Using /warn has a very helpful purpose:<br><br>To keep track that a player has broken the rules and is doing it constantly. If a player has gotten 12 verbal warns, there's no way to see that he/she has broken a rule several times before.
