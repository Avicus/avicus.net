i think that the only way to get more players to come to avicus is to make a promising video about avicus and hope it gets alot of views.

yea i kinda agree but walls lost alot of ppl when the server went down a while back.and now nebula is the only big game we have. i feel like we need a new "big" game if that makes sense.<br><br><br><br>EDIT: walls is starting to grow back but it will take a while before its back like it used to be, it used to be where if there was a hacker or someone breaking any rules then that person would be reported by everyone. now it seems like 90 percent of the ppl hack and you have almost no chance of winning. it kinda sucks :/ i wish i could have my old avicus back D:

I'm starting YouTube so I guess I can help a bit? I'll be making mainly Nexus/Nebula Gameplays and Kohi 1v1s.

Agreed, I would no joke, quit the server if all his fans came pouring in screaming BUDDER and acting stupid.

I disagree that Avicus is "going downhill fast".<br>Also, there have been many similar posts like these in the past.<br>Don't really see the point in making a new one when you could have commented on an existing thread.

At the end of the day it isn't your job to promote the server right? If we all start giving lots suggestions and start advertising server it could come over as unorganised. We just need to look into a appropriate way of coming up with things to add to Avicus and how to promote it.
