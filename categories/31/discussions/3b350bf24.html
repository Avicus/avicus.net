Real Life Name: Juha<br><br>What Is Your Favorite Game mode On Avicus And Why?: "Nexus: There is not much strategy required in Nexus, whereas in Nebula, you must use abstract reasoning in order to break the monument, or defend it. There are a lot of great people in it, a lot of them are easy to get along with and can become great friends, though in Nebula, people tend to yell at eachother a lot. I can easily get kills and kits are sort of reward for my efforts. I can PVP safe knowing my team will back me up if i'm in trouble, which is one of my favourite aspects of Nexus.<br>It doesn't matter if you win or not, what really matters is if you had fun &lt;3"<br><br>What Is Your Hobby Outside Of Minecraft?: "Drawing: I love drawing, it's an inspiration to me, and i've been drawing since I was very young, I am a very good drawer for my age, and I have started to make graphic art on electronic devices for people.<br>Talking to People: I love talking with people all the time, that's why I am frequently on the forums, I also use social media a lot.<br>Sleeping: My favorite hobby, I love sleeping no matter what, it's my favorite thing to do, and I would spend all my time sleeping if Minecraft wasn't around.<br><br>What Are You looking Forward To On Avicus?: "I look forward to the update, I am super pumped for it, and I can't wait for everything to get really awesome!<br>I can't wait for the big community, and the revival of Avicus!"<br><br>What Country Are You From?: "Australia"<br><br>Who Are Your Favorite Players On Avicus?:<br>"jozzmcozz<br>sunrise728<br>avumbaca<br>Awarriorvenom"<br><br>Anything Else You Want To Add?: "I am really nice when you get to know me, and i've been playing Avicus for over a year : 3
