I didn't even notice that, but you're right, there is no possible way capes give players an edge, so it should be perfectly legal.

Erm, I've seen players on chat bragging desperately about their capes before, maybe that's why minecraft decided to shut them down<br><br>and btw, don't get mad when people stereotype you... after all, it isn't as if you haven't done it before

You people...<br>The EULA is around to stop pay2win servers, are you going to disagree with that? It is shutting down the money guzzling YouTube servers that give Minecraft a bad name. There's no need to call it 'stupid' or 'bullshit' when it is prolonging the life of the game you all enjoy.<br><br>The EULA is the best addition to this game in quite a while.

No. How about you think before you say.&nbsp;<br>Go to a server like hypixel and mineplex where 99.9% of their gameplay is PAY TO WIN. Literally on mineplex YOU HAVE TO BE A DONATOR TO APPLY FOR STAFF. Plus the kits there are super op.<br>OCN already has the requirements and people still donate. It's not the death of minecraft servers, you are just a shortsighted person.

Raindrops only provide athsetic changes, which is allowed. OCN have added features to make team stacking harder and have obviously made it against the rules, legal.<br><br>I'm pretty sure when it comes to OCN I know my stuff more than you do.

he might be doing it, but cyrus is right, servers will go down quickly cause all the smart people won't be paying for nothing unless the server is there only life and will be idiots and pay cause they want servers only, I payed to help and to get perks, but without the perks I might have never gotten to diamond due to not getting anything in return while you are acting like eula won't happen and every server will be fine, most people on servers aren't idiots ya know, and if they are their parents probably wouldn't be ecept for that small group who got mojang to enforce eula

You refer to these servers as if they deserve the right to live off the money of small children who don't know any better. The EULA is killing these servers and you should be happy for it. Parents aren't the only people supporting the EULA and you aren't an idiot because you donate to a server.

You're overreacting. EULA won't even make a paper cut in Avicus. It does more good than bad for Minecraft to be completely honest. They did it for a good reason. Just because you don't agree doesn't necessarily mean something is the spawn of Satan.

mhm but natural selections need something to power them all the time, there will be a point where there won't be enough people to donate for keeping a server alive and have nothing in return than being praised in the shop for top donator of month the server will go down, ivy probably pays around 150-200$ &nbsp;a month, I highly doubt ing for no perks will get you to 200$ minimum a month
