Chaos theory is the study of seemingly unpredictable events that are assumed to be caused by a factor that occurs before the event.<br><br>Confused? <a href="https://youtu.be/n-mpifTiPV4?t=25s" rel="nofollow">Watch this</a><br><br>Now, here comes the testing part.<br><br>For a random reason a few days ago I decided to look into node-js, specifically node-minecraft-protocol.<br>After many hour of testing, writing, fixing errors, retesting, fixing more errors, and polishing code, I have created chaos bot!<br>It sounds fancier than it actually is. It's just my character (ALM) being controlled by JavaScript (there's no visual client) performing random actions around the lobby.<br><br>The bot will:<br>randomly walk in different directions,<br>randomly look in different directions,<br>randomly start sprinting,<br>and will even get itself out of a place it get's stuck in.<br><br><br>Anyone who has permission to teleport players, I wonder what'll happen if you TP the player to somewhere odd.<br>My challenge to you:<br>Find the bot in a neat location and tell me about it.<br>It tends to fall down to the bottom so it it's in a weird place down there, or it's somewhere on top, post a screenshot if possible.&nbsp;<br>The bot will randomly broadcast it's location and a link to this topic, (It's on a long delay, so it won't spam.)<br><br>Let;s see what we can find, have fun!<br><br>NOTE: If this is in anyway against the rules, some1 tell me pls.

I think you should increase the time between messages because unless you just took it off the server I think it got kicked for spam and it kinda clutters chat anyways

I'm a derp and forgot to remove a recursive call to the position announcer, to now announces every 30 seconds.<br>Also, it now only has a 1 in 5 chance of staying in water.

Wow, this is quite an interesting concept! I basically thought of this as a given until it was explained to me with words. After a bit of thinking this was just false pattern recognition, I realized that this is, indeed, more accurate than I first saw it to be. From what I get from it, it seems to synchronize with the <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gamblersfallacy.asp" rel="nofollow" title="Link: http://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gamblersfallacy.asp">gamblers' fallacy</a>. Although the article says it's incorrect, I'm still a fairly strong believer in it. Mathematically speaking, if you flip a coin two times, there's a 50% chance there will be a pair of heads and tails, a 25% chance there will be tails only, and a 25% chance there will be heads only. Another example presents itself if you pretend you have a bucket of balls labeled 1-100. The chances you'll pick 100 twice-in-a-row is .01%, but the percentage of picking 100 with another 1-99 is obviously much higher. <br><br>This also supports the movements of your bot. The past events-- say moving left-- affect the future events of making it less likely to move left again if it is truly random.
