Yoo!<br><br>I'm returning from my leave of absence tonight, and jumping right back into my Administrative work as soon as possible. Due to how long it's been since a Community Event has been hosted, I'd like to host another one!&nbsp;<br><br>Because of this, I need ideas. You may throw out a few ideas down below, if you please! You never know, it may be the idea that decides what we do for the next Community Event.&nbsp;<br><br>The ideas discussed down below will be brought up to the Event Committee, and re-discussed there. Let's try to make this a great time!<br><br>Regards, -Jake

I sexually Identify as an Attack Helicopter. Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of soaring over the oilfields dropping hot sticky loads on disgusting people. People say to me that a person being a helicopter is Impossible and I'm an idiot but I don't care, I'm beautiful. I'm having a plastic surgeon install rotary blades, 30 mm cannons and AMG-114 Hellfire missiles on my body. From now on I want you guys to call me "Apache" and respect my right to kill from above and kill needlessly. If you can't accept me you're a heliphobe and need to check your vehicle privilege. Thank you for being so understanding.

Here's the thing. You said a "jackdaw is a crow."Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.As someone who is a scientist who studies crows, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls jackdaws crows. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.If you're saying "crow family" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Corvidae, which includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens.So your reasoning for calling a jackdaw a crow is because random people "call the black ones crows?" Let's get grackles and blackbirds in there, then, too.Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A jackdaw is a jackdaw and a member of the crow family. But that's not what you said. You said a jackdaw is a crow, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the crow family crows, which means you'd call blue jays, ravens, and other birds crows, too. Which you said you don't.It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?
