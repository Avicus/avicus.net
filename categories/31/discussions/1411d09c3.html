<b>Listen...<br></b><i><b></b><br></i><i>We all have some members on this server who is working a little bit with youtube..<br></i><b><i>And,</i>&nbsp;<i></i></b><i>as I know it, Mineplex, a very big server, allows Youtube Channel Advertisement. Why not do&nbsp;<b>That?<br></b></i><b><i>We</i></b><i> have a few players like Ciaan, Eric, Spoook, Jotre, Lego and Murph who has a youtube channel, and if they upload videos on this server and also advertises their youtube channel on the Mineplex website, maybe some players wants to join this server through his/her channel :)<br></i><br>Of course we have more members on this server who has youtube! Just do that and we will probably get some awesome new players to&nbsp;<b><i>Avicus!!<br><br></i></b>btw, It was a pretty while since i was on the Mineplex website, but I think there was a link called "Youtube Showcase"<br><b><i>Show everyone your channel, make like a trailer for this server and lets go! We have probably got some new players!!&nbsp;<br><br></i></b><i>Hope you like my idea! And if you did and have youtube, do this because you're not allowed to advertise servers through the Mineplex website, but I think it should be allowed to advertise servers from a Youtube channel!<br></i><b><i><br>I have no idea about how it is on the Hypixel Network</i></b><i>, but if it is allowed there to, just do it!&nbsp;<br>I think that we will probably get some new players to the server and maybe they tell their friends, who tells their friends, and boom.. we are back on the road again!!</i>

Most of the youtubers aren't interesting to some players from what I've heard. Plus, it gets boring watching a kid put music in the background and kill people. I, for instance, haven't watched a minecraft video for about a year.<br><br>And it's not even about YouTube, or spreading the word, it's the server. The community in-game is bad, the only gamemode everyone plays in nebula, so if a player wants to try another gamemode out, that's hopeless. Honestly, the only youtubers that I think would do this server any good is Porky and Vlad. The rest upload tryhard scrims, kill some people, put music, and win with the other team salty. They upload that every time.<br><br>Again, there's a lot more to take in. Our staff, our community, etc. So once you get some good Youtubers, consider this

Live commentary is probably the most popular recording style on youtube. I'm assuming that's what he means, that having live commentary is better than montages and gameplay with solely music.

Don't be that little kid who advertises on other servers. It's a disgrace for Avicus and its community and a step more into the wrong direction (: (related to the Hypixel server)

Yet you look at people like gaxriexz, danteh and pretty much all the big uhcers, 90% of their content consists of uhc highlights, kill highlights and the occasional channel that does top 5 kills aswell

Hello saaaaam! <br><br>That is also a way to get more players on Avicus. <br>It is not a bad idea. <br><br>I, as well run a YouTube channel.<br>I have started it not too long ago. <br><br>It is not a bad idea, but at the same time, I will say what vladthegreat100 said: <br><br>"We have community creations where you can make a video hub or make a thread for each video that is Avicus related:&nbsp;<a href="https://avicus.net/forums/categories/42" title="Link: https://avicus.net/forums/categories/42">https://avicus.net/forums/categories/42</a><br>Also a thread with most/all youtube channels:&nbsp;<a href="https://avicus.net/forums/discussions/ace02bcd8" title="Link: https://avicus.net/forums/discussions/ace02bcd8">https://avicus.net/forums/discussions/ace02bcd8</a>" <br><br>We can use that for uploading videos for anything Avicus-related.<br><br>It is a nice suggestion though....<br>I hope to see you in game!<br><br><b></b>

Hi NowImTriggered! <br><br>You do have a point there. <br>Therefore, I will tell you something: <br><br>I have noticed the same thing. (it is not just you xD) <br>So, I am editing, and making a video at the moment. <br>Before vacation ends, I promised myself that I would upload a showcase of Avicus (approx. 3 minutes). <br>I will explain two or three things, and make my comment on Avicus. <br><br>Because my channel is not well-known yet, it may not spread like fire. <br>But there is no harm in trying xD <br><br>This is my answer to this comment. <br>I hope this works out :) <br>Anyways, stay strong, and I will see you in game.
