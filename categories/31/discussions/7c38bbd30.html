Question for staff

Since its easier and more likely to get answered here then on Skype. Why does Sho have the "Retired" rank? If I recall correctly its only for staff that have spent 3+ months on the staff team. I'm just curious to know why.

The way the policy is worded, what you said earlier is incorrect. The second part, it appears, is conditional to the first — anyone who has spent at least three months on the staff team is <i>eligible</i> for the rank, but it is still subject to the administrators' decision whether or not the person should actually be <i>awarded</i> the rank. This means that someone can be a staff member for a year and still not get the rank because they are deemed unfit.<br><br>At the same time, this means that a staff member who has spent less than three months is&nbsp;<i>ineligible</i>, regardless of how the administrators feel. By giving the rank to a player who, apparently, is ineligible for it in the first place, one would basically be infringing staff policies.

Yes, you're the one that's wrong.<br>You're able to get the retired rank with the admins consent, however, you still need to have 3 months+ as a staff to be up for the rank's standards.

Wouldn't that mean the first statement is nullified? If the administrators can grant them the rank despite not meeting the time requirement, then it's entirely up to the administrators' preference, no? If so, that leans closer to what people may label "bias".

Yes, Michael and I have been giving most staff members the retired rank despite what the policy says. However, the retirement part of the policy has not been updated since Jozz was Admin. In fact, I've just updated it. It's not a very big deal in my opinion. Players who have taken time out of their day to help out the server do in fact deserve to receive some recognition. The retired rank only appears on profiles. It's a simple little thing that serves only a small purpose. If you have a complaint, message me on Skype. Don't harass Iron.

Okay, the policy says that you must meet the requirement of being a staff member for three months or longer, and then the administrators can decide whether to grant you a "retired" rank when you quit. You're making it sound like everyone else is wrong. You say that it's not bias, but it clearly is. Sho has not been a staff member for three months; why is he an exception to the staff policy?<br><br><b>Edit:</b> Never mind, I guess Peachy just changed the policy.

Write a comprehensive policy, keep said policy from becoming obsolete, and make sure others comply with it (whether or not that only works in theory, I can't speak for, since I don't have full knowledge of the situation as staff do, and, because I'm not staff, this shouldn't even be my business).

Honestly, I know bias is an issue. It is an issue with everyone alive to a certain extent. And we've heard it so many times and we work on it and try, we really do. You don't know what's going on behind the scenes, but we work on it. I already sent you a Skype request, it would be best if you just explain to me what bias you're talking about and provide the evidence you claim to have so much of and just work it out with us.

It's so much more convenient and efficient to simply give the evidence and work out the issue as opposed to doing days, weeks, or even months of watching which would generate even more issues in the meantime.

wow ya'll acting like bias gonna be a big deal in dis lik wtf ya'll think is going on?<br>Guys what gave him the rank probably thought "man, sho did really good as mod and ima miss him, he deserves some recognition so ima give him retired" and did so. It's only biased in that the admins or whatever figured that they mighta figured he deserved the retired rank a bit more quickly or a bit more easily than another player, but that's human instinct and tbh it's all speculation so aint gonna hold out worth a damn in an argument.<br>And damn it if someone wants a retired rank real bad they can just go ask for it, if they were really a good mod then there aint no reason to deny them, admins aint unreasonable.&nbsp;<br>Damn ya'll some petty ass fucks, makes me disgusted to know that ya'll gonna make a big ass forum thread bitchin about a frickin name tag.

It's not the fact alone that you have the rank on your profile, it's the prospect that the staff would act on a whim and against what the written, "set-in-stone" (and obsoleted) policies say — this is almost exactly like what bothered eighteenth-century colonial Americans into rebelling against England, and we can clearly see the results of that. After a couple pages, though, this thread seems to have retrograded into a somewhat different discussion...

Discussion is fine, but for people to actually cause&nbsp;<i>drama</i>&nbsp;over something as insignificant as this is absurd. I'd like to see this thread die down a bit, especially because the man himself has now answered the question.<br><br>I know this is contributing to the 6 pages, but it's just... strange. Very strange, that so many of us feel the need to push this that far. It's a tag, a simple tag. As well, my post never said that you were required to moderate for 3 months to receive the tag. As far as I know, it was actually 4 weeks, and you were required to be a "Moderator"+. Nothing in my thread ever said 3 months. Again, strange.

I'll tell you why it reached up to here. This tag issue involves bias as it contradicted the "tag" rule. As you can see, many people hate that and are complaining about the bias.

Oh...as my heart rushes all I can see is that retired rank. My heart skipped a beat after we made eye contact. It came closer with her blue eyes and fair blue hair. It looked at me and said, "You are never getting me."<br><br>I died the End

Yea I didn't read the thread before posting that xd But again, the tag issue is so insignificant, that I'm amazed as to how it led to a discussion about Bias. How is there bias? It was probably a simple mistake on the staff members' parts, rather than actual bias.&nbsp;<br><br>I still find it absurd that this was dragged on for so long. It's a simple issue, that, really, has already been resolved. I'm expecting the thread to slow down very soon.. At least, that is what I hope happens.

I don't think it matters whether or not the rank has permissions. If there are set requirements for someone needed to have in order to acquire the 'Retired' rank, it shall be determined by those set requirements. From what I see, there is a misunderstanding of what the requirements are. There should be set requirements needed in order to acquire a 'Retired' rank, and nothing should be added unless it's official, so in the future there would be little to no confusion, or nothing dramatic like<br>this. Essentially what I'm saying is, have official requirements that each staff member is aware of, and make no other changes to it especially if it's not official like what I assume happened in this case, so that this whole issue wouldn't come up again.

A majority of the speculation here is over possible bias, not just the main purpose of this thread (Sho receiving a 'Retired' tag despite the guidelines for it saying specifically that it was for moderators whom served the server with their position 3+ months.)<br><br>In all honesty, it's now becoming a bit of a flame war to find excuses to blame the staff team for bias, even if it's not mentioned directly in the statements brought up. It's the same thing over and over, guys. The staff team do their best to ensure fun gameplay for all users by taking time out of our lives to do so. We may have a few hiccups here and there, but that doesn't mean the community of which we serve should start creating huge issues over it. <b>We take all these occasional problems into account, even if it may not seem like it in the perspectives of others</b>&nbsp;<b></b>, but it's rather difficult to deal with them thoroughly with others complaining about it repetetively and losing faith in the team quite quickly. <br><br>Keep in mind that I'm not saying the staff team is perfect. I'm just pointing out some things people may not realise regarding certain topics.<br><br>I also apologise if any statements in this post are considered as rude or offensive, as this serves a different purpose other than hurting the feelings of others.

I understand bias is a human nature, however there is still room to improve, and the room for improvement is endless, as stated before. And, if someone is 'whining' and you claim they don't care about the server, why would they even take the time to 'whine' if they didn't care?
