Well, recently I was being teased by a couple of people on Nebula. I told them many times to stop but they kept going. I reported them about 3 ish times, all separated by like 5 minutes, but no moderator came. The thing is, We need more moderators. I understand that our current moderators are trying their best and I love them for that, but we need more moderators. I just cannot stand these damn people breaking the rules and getting away with it. Especially when it is teasing me. No hate please, and do not start any flame wars or anything about this. I am not hating on the staff at all, I love the staff a lot, they are a big part on what makes Avicus Avicus, but we need more staff.<br><br>-CrafterPete1013

I think rules need to be more heavily enforced that there should be chat filters that don't only filter out spam messages. As for the staff, the amount of moderators is likely to increase as a new batch awaits.

I'm mostly doing reports when i'm online, however, you can always just post it in "Player Reports" if the offense is severe enough for a tempban.

The "player reports" section isn't there for esthetics.

Ya i agree. Avicus does needs more mods cuz of Avicore but a new batch is coming up though. Its the quality over quantity that counts. Also, we can't expect the mods to do all the work. They have worked so hard to keep this community safe and fun. A community should help each other and work together. We should also do our part by recording/screenshotting these rulebreakers if we have the chance to do so because we need to help as well.
