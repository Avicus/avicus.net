Well I was thinking, since people are always comparing servers via pvp skills, community etc... Why not building?!?<br><br>My idea is that comparable servers like The Chunk, Avicus, OCN etc... would elect their best builders. Once all server's builders are ready, they would have 1 week to complete the best possible build they can. This would NOT have to be a PvP map, although it could be if you wanted, it would be to see who has the best detailing/depth and overall building skills! Whoever would win could basically be like "yey i kewl like .... wowwww".<br>So yeah, no prizes :3

There would be a system to apply for it though. Like one post and everyone posts there best work there, then whoever is most liked there gets to enter!

Jeezuz. Avicus maps don't have great aesthetics. Sorry Im laying it down now, but really Avicus does not have great aesthetic maps, other than some Awarrior, Evo, Hyperscale and a few others (too lazy to name). I do agree that we need some more gameplay though, just saying its not like we have top quality aesthetics and no gameplay.

I would love to see an event like this take place! However, I certainly agree we should hold one within the Avicus community first. As Mooch mentioned, it would take a lot more effort to make it happen between multiple servers.
