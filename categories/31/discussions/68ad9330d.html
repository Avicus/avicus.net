Trying to fight Dylan on Clay Wars with sessp.<br>That damn guy kept tunnelling every time after he killed me, I could never find him and he'd pop up out of nowhere and backstab me time and time again.<br><br>Oh and I met Sess for the first time so that just made the moment even better.

When I broke the 5th, remaining monument on Quintus and the defenders Jotrexwiz and HaloGuardian didn't notice lol. I was just standing there breaking it while they were building their defense. Another memory, of course, was when I got asked if I wanted to be Junr Moderator, which was something that I didn't expect to get.
