I don't remember when, but quite a while ago all the normal commands/actions (ExampleUser fell out of the world) changed to some sort of pirate speech thing (ExampleUser walked the plank) which is a bit annoying so I need help getting rid of it.<br><br>Also this is just on avicus for me.<br><br>Does anyone else have that?

I turned mine off. Just go to languages and change pirate talk to English

I've tried that before and it's only on this server so it can't be the languages.

It is the language, like seth said. Avicus has a translation system. If recognise the language that your game and translate the ingame messages in this language.<br>You can contribute to that system, if you are a native speaker of that language:&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://avicus.net/forums/be886c0c6">http://avicus.net/forums/be886c0c6</a>

I had this issue too, but what I did was I changed my language settings to "Engligh (US)" and it worked perfectly

Yeah I have English CA and it's pirate. Not that it matters much, though. I kind of like it.
