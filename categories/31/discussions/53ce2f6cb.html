You know, today is a weekend day, Saturday, the most playable day of the week for this dying server. And you, dear staff, doesn't moderate it in this wonderful day (it isn't anymore). There is hackers and mad kids party, and no one stops this shit. It ruins pretty everything.<br>I think, someone deserves a demotion.

I gotta say this is the first time I agree with you. They really need to ór be active, ór get more staff.<br>The weird part is that some staff told me they don't need more staff, since they already had enough, but this clearly proves the opposite.<br>I think they should open staff applications asap and promote more than 2 players like normal... <br>There's enough fish in the ocean...

Okay, here goes:<br><br>1. Work: People have Saturday shifts, so they can't moderate.<br>2. Homework:&nbsp;Homework and other school/college tasks always take priority.<br>3. Asleep: Self-explanatory.<br>4. Hobbies: Some people at this time are partaking in different hobbies or clubs, e.g. swimming.<br><br>Unfortunately, many of us can't prioritise Avicus over these things, which are very important. Yes, we need more Eastern staff. However, short of handing out the moderator rank to every Eastern player whilst ignoring their work ethic, there's not much we can do.

I don't know how the situation is going right now since I haven't been on for quite a bit. What I'm sure of is that Moderators are people and they have lifes. Exams are coming up in Spain and pretty sure in the rest of Europe.

We are fully aware we have a problem regarding covering all time zones - in this case especially AU. In terms of consistent in-game moderation this is were the problem is we're not going to deny it.&nbsp;<br><br>Now you're probably sick of hearing the same blab of 'we're working on it.'<br>But let me assure you now from the bottom of my heart , the problem will be fixed as soon as we are ready.<br>We need and have been updating docs/formats tirelessly to prepare to fix this problem ; it will be fixed.<br><br>More info will be given when available.<br>I thank you for making a post regarding this problem , it's important we communicate to you guy's and although you could argue we should of made this post first. As i stated we are working to get the right foundations in place.<br><br>Consider this an early notice :)

I always hear this excuse: "We have our own lifes" and etc. So every staff member can just say, that he has other deals and not to perfom his duties. And what's the point of you being a moderator?

And I'm very sad to see this.<br><br>Players don't care, what happened behind your screens. Don't get me wrong, I don't try to blame or smth, but you must be online everytime, when someone hacks (or there should be an anti-cheat blah blah blah...). And what you shouldn't do is to tell people what happens on your side of the screen. I know all the reasons.<br><br>If there are no online mods, it is mean, there are not enough mods. If there are enough of them, it means, someone is sloth.

And there is usually at least one staff member on during American timezones. However, EU mods have theirs coming up, so it means we can't get on much.

Actually that is an incorrect statement. There are lots of times that no American Staff are on.<br>Also specify EU next time then. The original comment you quoted was regarding all staff, and you had continued on by stating "Avicus" and not EU staff.<br><br>Big differences.

I assumed that because I'm from an EU time that it would be fairly obvious. My apologies.<br><br>If there aren't many mods on at American times, then I agree that that is an entirely different issue and the mods who are in-active should be spoken to. However, expecting a mod to be on at all times to ban hackers is unrealistic.

Where did you hear that? We have final exams at the end of each semester. For me at least, I have final exams the week before winter break in December and on the last week of school too.<br>Edit:&nbsp;<br>I have 3 more weeks left of the Semester before winter break, so that gives me 2 weeks to prepare.

One of the main problems I believe is that there is a lack of new players who are qualified for this position. Back in the old days, there would consistently be new people to fill in the spots of those who retire. As of now, the moderator team is full of people who have been moderators for years who have found new hobbies and such adding on to less moderation on Avicus. With the declining amount of players, there really isn't many people left who could become a moderator.&nbsp;<br><br>I for one believe that I am the least utilized moderator who is not on leave. On the weekdays around 8-10pm Hawaii Standard Time (The usual time I'm online), there is nothing to moderate to. Avicus has 0 players online at this time more often than not.

From my knowledge, a lot of the staff team that are Americans have their exams in February and May because their school year starts in September. I'm going to assume that your school starts before September which is why you have your exams that early.

School for most Americans starts in August or September the first semester ends around the middle of December with finals being that week. That means most American mods have &nbsp;finals coming up with 2 weeks to prepare. Our second semester ends in may or June with exams generally in May. State testing occurs in April.

Actually you'd be surprised how many moderators actually would keep back to allow the Jr's to get reports and how many mods would actually be asking like 5 times if anyone else wants to get that report.<br><br>Yes there were guns trying to get the reports, but the majority of the time we would try not to.

I am surprised. Parts of 2014 involved only getting a few reports while being on for around two hours.

I believe that someday in the future, whether it is tomorrow or days, months, years to come, the people who wasted hours upon hours, days upon days, will realize that this is just pixels and they never achieved anything. Why? I don't know. Was it worth it? Probably not. I mean, let's look for a job and say you can pvp and do 13cps, I bet you, you will be the first candidate for the position, <i>without a doubt</i>.

Really, why?<br><br>Nvm, I give up now.<br>It will never be solved. It is super sad for me to see, how my favorite server dies, and I can't do anything with that. And nothing helps. Very very sad.<br><br>If this thread is just an&nbsp;eyewinker for someone, let it be so.<br>Lock it, please

I fully agree with Crimson here, we all have lives, we just use them for playing Minecraft, like the fucking staff should.

The server dies and so does the activity of the staff members :/

I totally get that staff has more important stuff to do, and I respect that, but that still makes it a good reason to demote. It's not like there are only 12 year olds and inactive players. There are enough fish in the sea, you just have to put more effort in trying to catch them.<br>Instead of whining about there not being enough staff, try to become one yourself.<br>Instead of telling players that staff is busy, accept more/different players and demote the inactive ones.<br>Ofcourse, people have lifes, but does that mean they can be staff without helping the server?<br>Just tell them to apply again when they got time again.<br><br>Being staff should be something hard to get, something people should love to get. Not a rank you can have by not helping the server at all.<br><br>Hope this helps... Just my opinion :P

This is a problem that has a lot of elements combined to cause the inactiveness. Sadly, it is not a problem we can fix in the matter of days. We are creating ways to improve the staff team in all fronts as well as activity and the plans we have should start taking place in the next coming weeks.
