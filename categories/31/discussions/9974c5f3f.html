Hey guys,<br><br>So this was a defence set up that we made on Campi Erbosi. Thanks to Jozz, Mango, Jakesandobal, Zedther and Dylan (I'm sorry if I missed your name, so many people helped that I can't remember them all, just tell me and I'll be sure to add you.) It took us around two hours to make and the other team haven't done well at breaking our defences.<br><br>Heres some screenies xD<br><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/YXzuql8.png"><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/0RbRnD7.png"><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/Ov2WoBw.png"><br><br><br><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/6UEbEg9.png"><br><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/1j7Akm9.png">

Don't worry Jozz, after I finished this thread I took a look and it was all cleared up, it looked so majestic.

You should never cover a monument with a block that isn't transparent, use glass, glass panes or iron bars instead. <br>How do you defend your monument if I put ladders on your pillar up to the monument and slowly climb up behind?<br>You shouldn't use pressure plates on the bottom either, it takes just a second to destroy a pressure plate and pillar up to your monument. You should use slabs instead, wooden slabs if you have the possibility to do it. <br>How do you stop me from destroying two crafting benches while I'm shifting, on your wall of crafting benches? <br><br>No, this was not a good way to defend your monument, especially not the best way as some people said. I'm pretty sure someone who skybridges (EricV4 xD) would destroy the monument easy too.

It is almost impossible to defend against skybridgers, and I wouldn't call it the best but still a good defense

As I was testing the defence there were some pretty easy ways of getting it so it was based on aesthetics (kinda) but you could sky bridge or pillar up the front wall then make a little bridge to the monument. It also would of been there if we had defenders :/
