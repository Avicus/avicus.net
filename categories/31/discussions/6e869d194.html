Hello Avicus.<br><br>Just a little heads up about punishment guidelines since they do affect the community. The senior staff looked into a few rules that came into the question in the last month and has decided to change the how the moderators will be punishing those who break these certain rules.<br><br>Racism and Homphobic slurs will be counted as the same type of punishment. This means racism will have less of a harsh punishment for first timers and homophobic slurs will have a harsher punishment.&nbsp;<br>Old:<br>Racism-14d temp ban--&gt; perm<br>New:<br>Racism/Homophobic Slurs- 5d tempban --&gt; 7d tempban --&gt; perm<br><br>The term "Nigga" has left the classification of a racial term and is now classified as a swear word. The same rules apply for swear words and obvious use of the term to try to get around the racism rule will result in a racism punishment.&nbsp;<br><br>Have a good day.<br><br>Rules take place starting in a week.<br><br>I can't put things into Announcements &gt;.&gt;

Thanks for changing the rules slightly. I did think it was a bit harsh to ban then for 2 weeks.

In that context it would be counted as swearing. The only time that would be counted as racism is if you used it in a racist context to replace the N word ending in R.

'Nigga' is often used as an alternative to 'nigg*r', and thus it should be classed as what it is; a derogatory slur intended to offend a person based off of genes that are outside of their control - swearing does not meet this criteria. Players may take offence to this slur, so giving it the same punishment as swearing is preposterous.

If the community is dissatisfied with this decision, we will offer more of a lenient punishment for the term but keep it to make the server community friendly as well.

The logic behind it is that we are not going to be as harsh with the word as in the past. We will still be restricting it and there are talks right now about it.

So you're making an exception for one word? You might as well make racism less severe as a whole and give it the same punishment chain as swearing instead of making exceptions. It just looks weak otherwise.
