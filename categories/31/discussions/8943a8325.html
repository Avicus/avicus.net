Hey guys!!<br><br>Senor here. So I just came up with a cool game idea. A lot of people have these "guess the" games, and I thought, why not make one up! So yeah! Mine is called&nbsp;<b>guess the animal!</b> Here is how to play!<br><br>How to play:<br><br>I'll say an animal's characteristics, or a sound that they make, and you guys have to guess it. When you make a guess, just put your answer down, and make up your own question! Here's an example.<br><br><b>My animal is black and white and eats lots of bamboo<br></b><br>Let's say I'm the person responding. I would say, "<b>Oh, It's a panda!"</b> Then I would make up my own question!<b><br><br></b>Do you guys get the whole scheme of the game??<br><b><br><br><br></b>Ok so here is the first animal:<br><b><br></b><b>I live in the ocean, and I like to eat sea urchins. I'm very cute, and i like to sleep floating on my back! What am I?<br></b><b><br><br></b>Hope this idea was fun!
