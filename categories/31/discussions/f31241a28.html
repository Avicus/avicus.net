So I have the IP to avicus on my server list. Two to three days ago, I noticed that the server said "can't resolve host name", or it tells me it's an "Unknown host". The problem has been going on for a while now and the same problem has also been happening to my friends. I also noticed that everybody else is still chatting like everything is normal. I was wondering if there is a new server IP or did I miss something? Please let me know! Thank you

Same thing. The IP(s) you aren't using don't work anymore afaik.<br><br>If you haven't used avic.us, try that.
