It doesn't appear that your question was archived, it doesn't has the little cross symbol. Maybe it's a bug..

Peter (Posighdun) kept my thread unlocked incase of further queries, but it seems it auto-disabled the ability for the author to reply, but didn't archive the actual thread itself. They dev team know about this and hopefully are on the case!

We have a web panel. All they have to do is check a box that says "Enable author replies".<br>Doesn't really require an "on the case!"...

I mean my post is two days old and has 60 views surely someone could have replied. Hardly professional.

It shouldn't take over three days to click a box. Might need to remind them.

It's not archived.<br><br>It only says its archived is so nobody other than seniors can reply.<br>The thread is also open to everyone. Not just staff can see it which shows the 60 people that have opened it. I'll try to respond tonight to your thread. This was a Dev thing. Nothing that seniors can really fix :v
