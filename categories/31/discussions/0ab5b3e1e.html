</h1>
There are four teams of 4; they square off in every gamemode on this server, and the team who wins the most games will be crowned the Avicus Allstar Team!&nbsp;<br><br>=====================================================<br><br>Round 1: Control the Hill<br>The competition starts with a round of CTH.<br><br>Round 2: Nexus<br>Some good ol' kit pvp.<br><br>Round 3: Elimination<br>A free for all, while still fighting for their own group.&nbsp;<br><br>Round 4: Nebula<br>Teams team up to fight another team of teamed up teams. <b>:O </b>For example, Red &amp; Blu vs Yellow &amp; Green since there's only 2 teams on Nebula. Both teams earn a win if their Nebula team wins.<br><br>Round 5: Walls <br>The final round: Walls. It all comes down to this (unless one team has already won 3 of their games <b>:P</b>). The winners will be declared the Avicus Allstar Team!<br><br>========================================================<br><br>So what players would represent the Avicus Allstar Team?<br><br>I know one would be Tarheelkiwi, because it's Tarheelkiwi and who doesn't know about Tarheelkiwi? &lt;3<br><br>Oh, and there's me, of course. <b>;)</b><br><br>Who do YOU think would represent it?<br><br>========================================================<br><br>This is just a suggestion. Personally I think it'd be pretty fun and interesting.<br><br>Edit: I use the word "team" a lot.

Holy crap nice idea man!<br>For the allstar team i would go:<br>Sunrise728 - PVP veteran, practically immortal in 1v1<br>JKawesome - Another great PVPer and essential for Nebula, with his rushing skills<br>Polar_Express - One of the greatest Avicus walls players of all time, extremely handy for the walls part<br>and i dunno, a few more amazing PVPers :O

<span>I'm gonna be 100% honest and as serious as physically possible with you.<br><br>This is a good idea if executed correctly. But the problem is that trying to make this into something that isn't a disaster is damn near impossible.<br><br>1) Where the hell are we going to choose the "best" players? We can't have community or staff vote because practically everyone is going to vote for their friends or someone within the top 15 or 20 on the leaderboards. Let's face it, a good portion of people up there aren't the greatest souls living on this planet (some others are, not saying everyone up there is "bad"). Picking players is going to be a combination of bias and players running on about "why wasn't I picked???". That's why we have Avicus teams, that way everything is fair and even for the most part.<br><br>2) Who's gonna host this? Where is all of this going to take place? I'd rather we put hours on end into developing an actually tourney rather than something else of inferior caliber.&nbsp;<br><br>3) Many people I'm sure (me included) have thought about this before. But before we suggest something too boldly, must must take a step back and ask ourselves... why? Sure it'll be fun, but why not just play the game? Why make something only x amount of "famous" Avicus players can enjoy rather than play on a well developed server with loads of other people? I mean if you want a private match, you'd might as well be asking for a YML plugin. Anyways if we want to see the best Avicus players play against each other, wait for the tourney and the two teams in the finals clearly, and fairly, make themselves the best players on Avicus going against each other in a game.<br><br>Now this does bring up some interesting things. Tourneys in other gamemodes? Hell yeah I'm all for that. I'd love to see a Nebula TDM tourney. But for the most part, I'm just putting in my feedback.

1. I think instead of choosing the "best" players, as you brought up, people could just sign up themselves. That could eliminate a lot of the controversy over people not getting chosen for this.&nbsp;<br><br>2. I didn't actually think about hosting. It didn't seem all that complicated when I thought about it.&nbsp;<br><br>3. Now that I think about it, something like this does seem like a lot, but I just thought making something like this would make things a little interesting and competitive.<br><br>All in all, you're probably right about something like this being a bit much, but tourneys do spark interest in my mind and probably a bunch of others as well. Implementing something like this could spice things up a bit.

Ivy was asked about it during the stream and he said that he never claimed they were being removed.
