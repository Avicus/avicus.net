<div>Hello,<br><br>I have a question for you.&nbsp;Do you think Avicus maps need improve? (game-play wise)<br></div><div>If you do, would you be able to leave behind old favorites, just because they are not up to standards anymore?<br><br>Lately, we've realized that whenever we try to improve maps, you guys end up yelling at us because your favourite map was removed. But isn't that the sacrifice of wanting good quality maps on Avicus? <b>Changes are necessary at times.</b><br><br>The choice is up to you, think hard.<br>And please keep a calm environment on this thread.</div>

I don't think change is needed though. Newer maps usually lag a lot and are unliked ;--;

You don't need to replace anything that is not broken.<br>Yes we can change and remove maps but the problem is that your removing the good maps that everyone likes and keep the ones that aren't as good. Maybe it's best to have a batch round and have a poll with the communities favourite maps and just take the ones out that are "under the necessary amount of votes" to keep.<br><br>It will let you know what maps the community likes and which ones you should take out.

Think of it this way:<br><br>New players join a game of Quintus and they know nothing about it.

I'm not a big fan of Quintus either, but in the end many of the older maps aren't like Quintus where you can kill farm 24/7. If there was a problem will kill farming than I'm pretty sure Quintus would have been the first map you would take out xd.

I think the Throwback server should stay the same (I don't think Ternio should have been taken out to get "fixed", I really liked to play on that map and like you said, you can't please everyone so why change it anyway?). As far as the other rotations, there should be a way to rate maps otherwise you're never going to get anywhere. Some new maps are good and some aren't, but you guys won't know unless you get feedback. Also, just because a map stalemates doesn't mean it's bad, for example, Vesper, one of my favorite maps was taken out for this reason :c

A lot of the new maps are repetitive and boring and ununique, but removing them is the worst possible decision. I believe instead of removing maps, the map Devs or creator should attempt to improve the map before it get removed/left alone/etc..

+1 I think the map devs needs to work with the map creators a lot more have better communication. &nbsp;If there are fixable issues with a map, talk to the creator to get them in order. &nbsp;I do like the idea of the throwback server coming every once in a while because it seems everyone likes them because people know the map well. &nbsp;Maybe the map devs should make a post for map makers on what are some&nbsp;<b>tips</b> to make good gameplay for DTM since there is an issue with new map being bad.<br><br>Don't know too much about Nebula but I know a little on making improvements :D

For one, I think most, if not all maps in Throwback rotations should remain just as they are and not potentially "improved" or changed at all. This is because that single rotation was made precisely for&nbsp;<b></b><u>nostalgic</u><b>&nbsp;</b>purposes. By changing the map's composition and/or attempting to improve it, from whichever issue you may consider it harbors, you kill off the nostalgia it grasps. I'm not saying you ought to keep maps like Rapture or Titans which play simply horrible, to say the very least, but I don't really see much of a reason to edit Ternio now if it's been that way ever since Avicus was seemingly eternally stuck with the Christmas Lobby two years ago. I can understand if you attempt to fix Quintus, for obvious reasons, however other than that map, which seems to be generating quite a lot of controversy for a long time already, should be altered in any form, unless it's YML-wise features/enhancements, which are to my point of view very convenient in most cases and don't bring in any discrepancies between map developer and community member.<br><br>This being said, I would also like to point out how the Throwback rotation, and ever since it was addressed as MCZone rotation, is the one which gets played the most out of any rotation in the entire network. Sure, I think I get an idea as to why you could be trying to "rearrange" it, however, don't you think the rest of the servers need more attention than the one that gets played the <u>most</u>? It seems to be that there's little to no complaints regarding the Throwback rotations. And usually, when complaints arise, I reckon you're experienced enough, as I've worked alongside you all for quite a long time, to raise up points in favor or against said complaints. Because not always points brought up by a single or a rather small group of people are the ones that will most likely benefit the entire community as to what concerns the changes that would happen if said request was taken care of without thinking of possible consequences.<br><br>Back to the point I raised before, I think you should employ more effort in attempting to shape-up what are other rotations, which I know you're working at, since you're handling the Map Reassessment, to hopefully get these to gain more popularity. You seem to be giving some sort of "special treatment" to the Throwback rotations, much to the displeasure of many community members who complain about their favorite maps being brushed off the board like they're ancient dust that no longer server any purpose for the sake of renewal and variety. Because if you haven't thought about it, keeping a small fragment of our maps for a nostalgic-only rotation is indeed variety itself.<br><br>Now, what I think you should do is: refrain yourselves from editing any or as less Throwback-exclusive maps as you can. Only do so if it is urgently necessary, say, there's a whole thread with a salty array of miscellaneous regulars complaining about how Quintus' killfarming ruins their day in so many ways they can't even bother to list them all because of the anger that boils their blood until it becomes crimson smoke emitting from their ears. Focus more on editing/changing the maps that are on DTM rotations, or even the CTW ones, because trust me, some, if not all of the CTW maps need some serious rework. Again, I'm not one to talk since I hardly know enough about CTW maps and its compositions but if I recall correctly Robin brought up a zillion of points about how our choice of CTW maps was unamusing to say the least.<br><br>So, in other words, I don't think Throwback needs much re-work at all, so I don't really see why you keep editing its maps over and over. You can't please everyone so leave them just as they are unless you're 100% sure it's a change the majority will appreciate or is simply something concering a dire situation that must be taken care of at once.

Ok, I got an amazing idea keep the new maps I don't care about them, but on Throwback give it ALL THE MAPS FROM MCZONE AND OTHER STUFF "ALL". You saw how I emphasized "ALL". Do that! ¿Por Que? DONT CORRECT MY ¿Por Que?
