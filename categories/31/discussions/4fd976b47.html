im sick of this!<br>i killed a few people and they started accusing me of hacking BIG time.<br>I know this happens everyday, but I'm trying really hard to interact with people and meet new friends but its pretty god damn hard to do so, when 3 different people are screaming "OPTOBAT hacks!" or "opto what hax u using?" its disgraceful.<br><br>EricV4, you were playing in one particular match with me when this happened, so ask him if you think I'm lying or whatever.<br><br>And yes, for christ's sake i DID to /report about 4 times on just 3 people and you can bet your ass not one mod showed up. Thats not a diss, I'm just saying, i was left stranded with a community full of people not knowing whether i "kill aura" or "anti-knockback" on our own server!<br><br>Please, I'm asking you publicly from one player to another to stop accusing me for whatever reason, i DO NOT hack. You know exactly who you are.<br><br>If you still think I'm a hacker, just ask some of the guys who've seen me play, such as EricV4 or MiningFlamingo, or just go to my god damn YouTube channel.<br><br>Thanks, have a good one

But you are a Hacker!, joke. Sometimes they only make a joke. For exsample I write in the chat "99 hacker! :D". He understands the joke and write "uhh nuuu, no ban plz xD" And if they mean it real, just make a forum report with the screenshots.
