Hey guys C:<br>If you didn't know, I was extremely busy the past 2 weeks because of a bunch of "classes" I had (architecture, programming, etc.) And they were a lot of fun, I must admit, especially C++.<br><br>However, during the whole thing, I really missed this place. I'm not sure why, but Avicus was one of the only things I would think about. I wanted to record, to play, to be with you guys (in a non-creepy way,) but since I got home at 9 and was extremely tired, I just couldn't muster the energy.<br><br>The first day of C++, I was so desperate to play that I managed to get the password to the WiFi in the campus and play on a laptop. Someone caught me, but thankfully I didn't get in too much trouble. However, the energy and stress that built up inside me just... disappeared. There's something like Avicus that I've never felt before. Not even in school do I feel this... sense... of family and friendship.<br><br>School is starting in about a week. I've never felt more unhappy to see school start so soon. I felt like I haven't been in Avicus long enough. I wish I could just wake up every morning and play here. Unfortunately, school and other things are getting in the way, and I guess, those are more important in life. I can't just push off school in order to play with you guys, as amazing as you are, school is just a requirement in life that I must take. School will also most likely kill my chances of becoming a moderator, but my life would probably be 10x harder being a mod and going to school at the same time, anyways.<br><br>All in all, I never realized how much a community of Avicus was before this. Sure, I was active on the forums and in-game, but this... this is something different.<br><br>Thank you everyone &lt;3<br><br>- Cin/Croc/Cinny/Cinub/CinnamonToastCrunch

Yep, the amazing games and wonderful community doesn't help much..<br>Also, school is starting for me, too, and I'm actually quite happy to get back to real life. I love this server and community to bits, but real life is going to have to be better, sorry, guys. But really, this server probably has the best community of all big servers like this.. it's really awesome. I can totally understand the feeling of wanting to be on again once you were pulled off. I'm glad you have those feelings towards the community.. as soon as I saw that AMA/greeting post, I knew you weren't just any regular c:
