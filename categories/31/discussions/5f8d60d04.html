Hey guys, It's baz here and I just wanted to bring up how about 10ish minutes ago I was banned on Avicus for hacking... Here is the only proof I managed to gather that I was not hacking (because I was not recording at the time I was playing) and I really hope this is enough evidence to get me unbanned?&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etF_IVWsiKg&amp;feature=youtu.be" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etF_IVWsiKg&amp;feature=youtu.be</a><br>Furthermore, I have no reason to hack as I am 1 lvl away from approaching prestige 3 on nebula and I have Gold rank, so there is really no reason why I would want to hack? Also, Avicus Is the server I dedicate most of my time to and have spent a very long time playing. So if for some reason I did want to hack, Avicus would by far not be a server I would do it on. &nbsp;I would really appreciate if someone could get back to me because I'm starting to get worried I might get banned forever :( without me doing anything wrong.. Thanks for reading ~Bazookalokigh
