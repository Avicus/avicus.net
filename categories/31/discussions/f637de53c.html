Disgusting Bias in Staff Conduct

</h1>
For a long time, I have been the oldest semi-active member of this server. I have been a member of this community for well over five years. Unfortunately, I am not active on the server itself due to time constraints from my studies.&nbsp;Luckily though, I care enough about this server to stay active on the forums and discord. I have loved to see this server prosper in the past, and I still try to do whatever I can to make this server a better place for players.&nbsp;<br><br>When I was Admin, there was no bullshit. My policies were made so that favortism was abolished. I never made a decision based on my opinions or feelings; I only used the rules provided for&nbsp;<i></i><i>everything</i>. This ideology may sound cold, but it worked. It proved that the staff team didn't show bias or favortism towards players for any reason. And, if someone was caught giving players preferential treatement, bending the rules, or (in other words) being a terrible staff member: they were instantly demoted.<br><br>I understand that with changing Senior Staff, polcies change. But, there is <b>NO REASON </b>for favoritsm to be shown in <b>ANY WAY</b>. Recently, I was told that a player was cheating during a tournament. I was around when the first tournament came on the Avicus Network. I was the original "Community Manager." I wrote the first set of rules that were used. And in any scenario, a player caught cheating would result in an instant permenant ban and a disqualification of the team. Seems fair, doesn't it?<br><br>What excuses can the current staff provide for letting hackers win the tournament? There isn't one. &nbsp;There is no justification for rewarding cheating. Yet, somehow favortism got in the way of justice and let the cheaters win. The Officials say its more complicated than what we know... How so? It seems pretty simple to me: A player cheated- according to&nbsp;<i>The Rules</i> the team should have been disqualified- but they weren't- and they won the tournament (which included my money).&nbsp;<br><br>In my opinion, the "Officials" need to be discplined for this. Not only should they be demoted (I know some stepped down, but they shouldn't be allowed to "retire"), but I think that this clear breach in protocol calls for a temp-ban. Disgusting behavior needs to be punished, and letting people off with a warning only promotes bias and shitty staff conduct. In a more outward approach, who on the Senior team is responsible for overlooking the Officials? If there was no one, that should be fixed <i>immidiately</i> so that idiodic mistakes like this don't happen again. I don't know how competant Admins/Seniors could let something this atrocious happen.<br><br>Some of you may be asking "Why do you care? You weren't in the tournament. So what did you lose?" First off, I care about this server. And <i>anyone</i> who cares about it shouldn't allow cheaters to win or the staff team to be <b>biased/trash</b>. Secondly, I generously donated $20 dollars to this tournament. I saw the opportunity to be generous and hopefully help Avicus grow. But, my money ended up in the hands of cheaters because the staff in charge are biased idiots who don't deserve to be on this server. I want my money back, or I at least want it to go to someone that deserves it.<br><br>I wontder what else people have gotten away with since I've been gone. I feel sorry for the community that has to live with this constant shit. Best of luck to everyone.<br><br>And please, leave your opinions below. I wasn't there when this autrocity happened. I only know the most basic facts.<br><br>If you read this, thank you for listening to my opinions and logic,<br>Max

1. I am sorry if it wasn't all officials. I don't know exactly how this happened. I only meant to talk about those that went against policy.<br><br>2. Wow. That is ridiculous.<br><br>3. Well the official team decided to go&nbsp;<i>against</i> protocol for one specific team. You favored them over the rules. That is the definition of bias.

First of all, it was your problem if you donated money.<br>Second, where is the negative behaviour? I don't see it anywhere, they just have taken some decisions which community criticized and didn't like.<br>Third, why a temp-ban? There isn't any reason for banning officials because the vote was a decision of em, which doesn't involve the community. If they think that they have made a big mistake they can retire like PieZ and Cyclops have done.<br>Fourth, as anybody can see in this post, you put yourself if like you were the best that happened to Avicus and when you left, this server has become shit. Then come here to solve it, and don't blame other people when you are just in your house studying and doing other stuff. Many staff from here (including myself) is studying and have a lot of things better to do than playing this game to get blamed for every mistake they can make. We are humans, not robots and we can take bad decisions sometimes, but you can't blame everyoneâ€‹ just because it affects directly to you.<br>Fifth, were is the favouritism? I don't see it anywhere, they just take a decision and things have gone like that. PureDogs wins and they get the money. I have never seen during the tourney any official helping a specific team to make them winners. So don't talk about things you do not even know.<br>Have a nice day<br>Henry

1. Then I'll stop donating. Thank you Mr. Referee for showing that donors aren't appreciated.<br>2. They went against their policies. Which in and of itself is misconduct. Making an exception for a team that cheated isn't exactly a good way to break policy.<br>3. Then it will show that staff can break their rules, let cheaters get away with stuff, and face no punishment.<br>4. I was not the best thing to happen to Avicus. Not by a long shot. It was in decline when I left. I'm pointing out the inconsistencies. Since I have left, there have been a few things that just don't make sense to me. So I either try to learn the full story or point out the problems. I understand that staff make mistakes, I was a Moderator at one point too. But I paid for my mistakes and took responsibility.&nbsp;<br>5. The favortism is in the fact that the team clearly should have been disqualified, but wasn't. The officials are making a post about the reasoning behind their decision soon.

I often feel like some staff members are trying to look away from people hacking, because they know and like them. There are many active players who are hacking, but not as obvious as others. As a player, you sometimes see it, like when you walk behind someone and he doesnt know and accidently toggles his killaura onto you etc. But even if they are reported, they aren't always banned. What I am trying to say is that there were many other players hacking, but not being catched.

Gill is mad that some of the Officials allowed Pure Dogs to win. If you see in Tazz's post, he explains everything on what happened. In the rules it explains that if a team has a player cheating, they will be disqualified, which obviously did not happen. He's even angrier that his money went to a team that cheated their way to victory.

I don't appreciate your egotistical "fact" about how good you are. It is not in the slightest his fault, and he has a right to complain about how the money distributed. The prize pool this time around was a bust, but I would honestly blame the officials who let the rule be voided. Also, the officials individually can express their opinions, and some have already. This proves how divided the official team is, and how there was no "official" statement but rather each official is now displeased with each other. Some haven't even tried dealing with the "many problems", actually. One of them hasn't even made a public forum post in 28 days.<br><br>Also, you realize that refusing to apologize for such a harsh comment you made unless the officials tell you to doesn't look good on you, at best? I'd imagine you'd have some sort of moral compass before making an irrational decision to just let the officials take care of it so you can get your final word out about how it's someone's fault for donating?<br><br>Put yourself in his shoes. Would you like your money going to a tournament where (regarding the facts we have currently) one official decided who wins?

Gill is mad that some of the Officials allowed Pure Dogs to win. If you see in Tazz's post, he explains everything on what happened. In the rules it explains that if a team has a player cheating, they will be disqualified, which obviously did not happen. He's even angrier that his money went to a team that cheated their way to victory.

I don't appreciate your egotistical "fact" about how good you are. It is not in the slightest his fault, and he has a right to complain about how the money distributed. The prize pool this time around was a bust, but I would honestly blame the officials who let the rule be voided. Also, the officials individually can express their opinions, and some have already. This proves how divided the official team is, and how there was no "official" statement but rather each official is now displeased with each other. Some haven't even tried dealing with the "many problems", actually. One of them hasn't even made a public forum post in 28 days.<br><br>Also, you realize that refusing to apologize for such a harsh comment you made unless the officials tell you to doesn't look good on you, at best?

Being screenshared doesn't mean anything if you don't have probs that confirm that he was hacking/autoclicking during the tourney. Screensharing is only to know if you have those programs and to be careful with that person. Not more.

I often feel like some staff members are trying to look away from people hacking, because they know and like them. There are many active players who are hacking, but not as obvious as others. As a player, you sometimes see it, like when you walk behind someone and he doesnt know and accidently toggles his killaura onto you etc. But even if they are reported, they aren't always banned. What I am trying to say is that there were many other players hacking, but not being catched.
</blockquote>
</div>
Catching the hackers isn't always the easy part. It's more likely for a hacker to let his toggling slip when there are no staff online vs when there are. And even then, sometimes a 2 second clip isn't enough to actually ban anyone off of.

The difference is, those are two entirely different obligations. You have part of your basis for the argument as an opinion that directly contradicts part of the ruleset, which you're supposed to enforce. You claimed you were a ref for a reason, yet you fail the obligation to understand the basic rules of the tournament itself. Therefore, by defending yourself, you state an activity issue against dev_revs for not streaming every match yet you felt the need to point it out, even though you just said you're not saying anything about that.<br><br>You don't need to call someone close-minded and remind people that you may have forgot something, because it's apparent you forgot and you personally are bringing up something against him that is to do nothing more than try to hurt his reputation as a media. You're not representing the staff team properly, and every post you make is not helping the situation. If you want to help the officials, then please talk with them first and see how you can clear up the situation rather than dig a hole further that makes the tournament look even worse by showing how poorly a referee can act.

I may not have much ground to stand on because I've been inactive and just recently I've come on again.<br><br>But this seems like a common sense thing to me, a rule was broken - specifically hacking - yet some officials allowed the cheating team to win.<br><br><b><u>Now in this circumstance, these are obvious things to do:</u></b><br><br>- Strip the biased staff members' ranks and temporarily ban them. Perhaps perma since they abused something so important and big.<br><br>- Punish the cheaters and ban them FOREVER. No appeals. GONE.<br><br>- Temp-ban all team members who weren't cheating. By not immediately calling for a suspension and expulsion of the team member, you allowed this to happen. This is your fault as well.<br><br>- And leave the Officials who voted against the win alone.<br><br>And to the Referee who said that it's Gill's fault for donating, you are a very bad representation for the Tournament staff team and I honestly hope you get your rank stripped or suspended.<br><br>Your unapologetic behavior and your disrespectful response for something that is so obviously&nbsp;<i><b>right&nbsp;</b></i><b></b>shows that you might not be qualified for any staff member position. I will ignore the fact that you didn't know about that rule, everyone makes that mistake.<br><br>Perhaps in future, double and triple check the rules before making such a post. You've left a very bad impression on yourself.<br><br>And saying something that could potentially discourage players from donating to the server is probably not a very smart idea as well.<br><br>If I buy a phone charger that is expected to work but it doesn't... then I have a right to be furious. Wouldn't you be?<br><br><b>My final gripe is that I'm unable to give this topic a Like... or a thousand.<br><br>EDIT:&nbsp;</b>I've read more into it and I have to disagree with not allowing the people who realized their mistake from retiring.<br><br>Owning up to the mistakes and bad decisions you made is part of the path to being even more human.

The amount of threads, posts and discussions on this whole topic is ridiculous. The officials set many rules, many simple rules to follow, no rules that really should have been broken. We (the community) have received many comments from the officials about this scenario, but does it really add up? Cheating is one of the easiest rules to follow, yet this huge drama was created from it. This little topic should have been like every person who has cheated in the tournaments over the years, a simple ban, a simple disqualification, but why isn't it like this you may ask? To be honest I don't know, who even knows? Apparently they "weren't sure" but they still managed to ban him. Many people thought Zaoki cheated, that is why he was screen shared. After 2 and a half hours of screen sharing, they finally banned him but the team wasn't disqualified. Like most teams would, they defended Zaoki&nbsp;and said: "he didnt cheat!1!1!11!". I'm not sure why the conclusion was made of not disqualifying the team, and the fact that this tournament had money involved it honestly just a huge fucking scam. The fact that people donated money that was only to be given away to a team that broke a rule, but won bias over their side is crazy. I just don't understand why they weren't disqualified, why this got so far. I don't know anymore. Please get new officials, new medias that actually live stream. please just fix all of this shit.<br><br>Thanks

Could be worse, I could be mod again.<br><br>On-topic: Haven't really been keeping an eye on Avicus, but from what I can understand the officials knew a team was using a modded client but refused to DQ them allegedly due to the influence of a senior, enabling them to win the tournament. I shouldn't need to point out how stupid that is.
