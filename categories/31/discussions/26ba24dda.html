Right, we had a recent staff meeting where a vote was made to bring back the staff spotlight on the forums. I am glad to say that it is back and will happen every month!!!..... maybe....... Well anyways, I would like to introduce&nbsp;<b>SnowSX3</b>.<br><br><b><u>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is your username in minecraft and what is your favorite game on Avicus?</u></b><i><br></i>Sup Mates!<br>My name is SnowSX3.<br>My name is a combination of Midtown Madness 3 and the SSX snowboarding series.&nbsp;<br>The “S” on Snow is capitalised to represent the first “S” in SSX<br>The “SX” is the rest of SSX and the 3 comes from Midtown Madness 3.<i><br></i>My favourite gamemode on Avicus has to be the Walls, great team-based gameplay comes from it!<i><br></i><br><b><u>2. What are you most excited/obsessed over at the moment?</u></b><br>I just got my hands on WWE2K15 so I’m playing through that at the moment.<br>I’m probably most obsessed with Avicus currently, I’m on it Moderating and playing everyday.<i><br></i><br><b><u>3. Where are you from?</u></b><br>New Zealand.<i><br></i><br><b><u>4. Are you in school, or do you have a job? </u></b>&nbsp;<br>I’m currently in my last year in high school.<br>I also have a part time job at a hotel.<i><br></i><br><b><u>5. Who or what inspires you the most in your life?</u></b><br>I don’t try to emulate other people, I just try to be a better person day after day.<i><br></i><br><b><u>6. How do you contribute to the Avicus as a staff member?</u></b><br>I am very active as a moderator, every time I join Avicus I’m always Moderating.<br>I always help others and respond to questions quickly and efficiently.<i><br></i>I’m also not afraid to say what I think, if I think something’s wrong, I’ll speak up about it as opposed to just sitting in the background while the problem gets worse.<i><br></i><br><u><b>7. What are the most common questions you get asked while moderating or managing?</b></u><br>"How do I apply for Mod?"<br>"Can you ban soandso? They’re hacking."<i><br></i><br><b><u>8. Anything else you want to mention?</u></b><br>I want to thank the community for giving me the massive amount of support I received on my way to Mod. It meant so much more than you think. Thank you guys.<i><br></i>Also, my Skype’s “SnowSX3” if you have any questions regarding Avicus, flick me a message!
