I thought, you've started using slack to get money from advertising this platform :/<br><br>Register somewhere only for chating with community of stagnating server.... No, thanks<br>Use common platforms. Discord may be that one. But not for me.

It probably took me half an hour to figure out how to do anything on slack and then I couldn't figure out how to add someone or whatever, it doesn't make sense. I like discord but it tends to break on me and then the sound stops working so I end up using Skype anyway.

Because the Slack admins decided to set rules so that people do not get harassed, offended, etc so everyone can have an enjoyable time. If someone cannot follow those rules, they get deactivated as we want to keep the platform a nice environment for everybody.<br>It may not be an official platform, but we still want some sort of standards.

Discord. <b>Why?</b><br><br>Discord does not require users to be added in but has a join link instead. You might be asking me: <u>CAN'T THAT BE SPAMMED INPUT???</u> Yes, however the Teamspeak method of making sure users <i><b>register themselves with a in-game player</b></i> will make sure people do not spam users into the Discord server. Also, Discord also has a anti-spam function which will stop most spam attacks. Bots are also very useful, and can help manage the discord server too. Everything<i>(Mostly) </i>you could do in Teamspeak and Slack can also be done in Discord.<br><br>-<b><i>Input</i></b> :)

so you looked up when they were founded and such on wikipedia, such great facts that completely back up your argument that they aren't in financial trouble. except, it's difficult to tell what your argument is... are you saying that everything is gonna be cool with slack because they've been around for a while, or because they're new and hip? either way, historically, companies that have been around for decades have very suddenly gone bankrupt, and of course new companies (especially internet ones) go under every day

Slack receives money like all other businesses... Sales, traffic, donations and sponsorship.

Ok, want facts.<br>April 1st 2016, Slack Technologies announced that they raised $200 million while the company was at a worth of $3.8 billion valuation. (Valuation - Estimate or Determined market value of a thing ; Definition from the Merriam Webster Dictionary)<br>Continuing from this, in February of 2016 Slack Technologies announced that they were on the pace to generate a total of $64 million in revenue. (They would finish off with a + $64 million).<br>Around the time of April 1st, Slack had 2.7 million active users which approximately 800 000 are paid users. (Minimum $8/month/person ; Maximum $15/month/person)<br>Even if companies go down many times, especially internet ones,&nbsp;that can easily be said of Discord, so please explain to me how Discord could not be one of those companies&nbsp;as well. I&nbsp;also I find it slightly funny how you are attempting to use that against Slack since it can be the same outcome to Discord.<br><br><u>References:<br><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/slack-just-raised-another-200-million-round-and-its-now-worth-38-billion-2016-4" title="Link: http://www.businessinsider.com/slack-just-raised-another-200-million-round-and-its-now-worth-38-billion-2016-4">http://www.businessinsider.com/slack-just-raised-another-200-million-round-and-its-now-worth-38-bill...</a><br><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/valuation" title="Link: https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/valuation">https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/valuation</a><br><br><br><br></u>

reminder that these so-called "valuations" are nothing but guesses since slack isn't a publicly traded company<br>also reminder that revenue&nbsp;≠ profit, all we know is that they made "around" 64 mil (another guess), no idea what their operating expenses are like and how much money they took home at the end of the day<br><br>and just for the record, i dislike both slack and discord equally. i would prefer to just use irc but tragically that seems to be a sinking ship since it's no longer hip with the kids. the only reason i mentioned jumping ship to discord might be a better option is because they have like ten times as many users as slack so it'll probably have a little more staying power

Reminder that the definition of "valuation" is a Estimate or Determined market value. So their market value at that time was either exactly 3.8 billion or an estimate of 3.8, which the word <b>"estimate"</b> is by definition in the Merriam Webster Dictionary is <b>"to judge tentatively or approximately the value, worth, or significance of"</b>, and if you want it more in depth, the word <b>"approximate"&nbsp;</b>is by definition in the Merriam Webster Dictionary again, "nearly correct or exact" which means those so called "guesses" you say for the valuations is a very close or exact number to 3.8 billion.<br>And for the revenue/profit thing I got a definition mistake there, but 64 million is still a lot, and I'm 100% sure and is common sense that no company would have their valuation rising if they were not making profit at all.

shocking that the king of dictionary-pounding got a definition mistake, haha<br>anyways, i suppose i'll have to expand on my point about these "valuations". as i said before, slack is not a publicly traded company, so these "valuations" are pretty much just what all those sneaky VCs are willing to pay for a part of the company, and as a result the so-called "valuation" is not based on the company's current assets or revenue, it is based on how well all the VCs think it's gonna do in the future. of course, everyone knows how far along we are when it comes to predicting the future (remember the election?), not to mention that VCs have been wrong in a big way in the past, and specifically about internet companies (remember the dot com bubble?) if the valuation is rising, it may just mean that there's less of the company for each VC to grab so they gotta fork over more for it.<br><br>i'm sure many people will agree that 64 million is a lot, but it's important to remember that it's just revenue, not profit. if we factor in employee compensation, it shrinks pretty fast. the average salary in california for software developers is 100k, and if we assume that to be the average salary at slack (which it probably isn't, considering that not everyone who works there is a software developer, but then again san francisco has an extremely high cost of living so the salaries are likely higher across the board, and we can't forget that there's probably quite a few executives making significantly more) and multiply it by the number of employees (700), you get 70 million in employee compensation alone, not factoring in other costs such as equipment and whatnot.
