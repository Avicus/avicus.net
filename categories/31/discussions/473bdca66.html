If you wish to appeal your punishment, then please send your appeal to support@avicus.net. Keep in mind you most likely will not be unbanned due to the fact that it is your account, and it is your responsibility. If someone "gets into your account and installs hacks", in this case your brother, it will probably not suffice. Change your password and do not give siblings your account information.

You are responsible for your own account. And i <b>HIGHLY&nbsp;</b>doubt that that your brother did that.

Your account, your responsibility.<br>It's like saying "OH, since my dog got loose and mauled your dog to death, it's not my fault, since my DOG did it, not me!"&nbsp;

Sucks then. You should start logging out of Minecraft to avoid this happening in the future.

Go to avicus.net/staff and find a manager, find their skype, then add them on skype. Or, just use your email :P<br>And, you could protect your mc account with a computer passcode :P<br>

We've all heard this story dozens of times... Please refer to what NolanDalton said, and refrain from making topics like this in the future.

As much as I agree with the others, I do kinda feel sorry for you if your brother did do this and if you aren't lying. But it's simple, you have to make sure he doesn't get a hold of your computer :L
