I am sorry Sli, but the fact that the only people who have been accepted are staff is biased, I do not yell biased in every direction I am mature when I'm arguing. I think about almost everything I write and I like having fun.<br><br>:)<br><br>PS: later I will write a page long application, okay?

You realize that Aerosmith was accepted into the team? And Aerosmith doesn't have a rank, does he? Also, it's their team and they accept whoever they want. Adding on to that, all of the map devs are great builders, that's why they are map devs, and they were accepted into this team for a reason.<br>EDIT: And Grapesmoothie, too!
