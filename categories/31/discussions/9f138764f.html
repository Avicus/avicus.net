so i've been thinking through the past several minutes and then i came up with a theory on how server running and control should be run. I've developed a method of moderation and administration that is like a government and police force. The moderators act like a police force standing by and occasionally engaging in conversation but only really stepping in when truly needed. And the admins will act like a constitutional republic where the admins create rules and the people decide on them and only the admins can overturn the opinion of the people while the senior mods act like swat teams and military only really stepping in incredibly urgent situations. This is just a theory on how i think administration and moderation should be implemented im not saying this should be implemented this is just my belief. keep in mind this is not just based off of my experience with avicus mods this is from my experience with moderators and admins on other servers along with this server

i mean that the system should be more like a republic where people vote for the rules we already have somewhat of a voting system in place for mods and admins but there should be a way to vote for rules

The amount of trolls on Avicus is overwhelming. Also, voting just wouldn't work out considering 9/10 of the server don't even know the forums exist, so it'd be a little hard for us to get the entire community's opinion.

like i said the admins should be able to overturn the peoples decisions if it will result in a massively negative impact also too solve that problem there should be one mandatory vote for every user before they go into a match

What would the point of community voting be if admins overrule the vote?

i mean if it could destroy the server basically if people vote for hacks to be legal the admins could over turn it

I really don't think this would be a good idea considering that as Badger said, most people would just click randomly to get into the game and 90% of the players wouldn't take it seriously.

We need better staff. The system you gave is legit how it is now except no voting. We have so many trollers on avicus that it probably would end up with the worst decisions and then have admins over rule it every time. Waste of time... It has been proven avicus may live either way courtesy of me testing some shit out :3<br><br><img src="https://i.gyazo.com/4039803360e7853c1858dbafa74587bf.png" title="Image: https://i.gyazo.com/4039803360e7853c1858dbafa74587bf.png">
