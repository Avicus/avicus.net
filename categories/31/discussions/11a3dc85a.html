For me, I was influenced into buying the game after seeing Minecraft merchandise everywhere, noticing several kids in my year level buying it and other things in society. Best $20 I've spent so far.

Well I was at summer camp (don't ask) and my friends there were talking about minecraft so once I came back home I gave it a try on my computer playing the Demo Version. Cool part was there was this glitch before 1.4 minecraft that let's you have infinite demo time even though it says you have two hours.

About 2-3 years ago, my 2 closest friends started talking about it but I didn't show much interest. One year later, my cousin let me play it on his iPod an I got hooked, that same year my school gave iPads to all 8th graders taking Algebra and I used it to play Minecraft in class. Later in the summer, another friend and I finally got the PC version.

Me and my friend Jon(BloB_Gaming) went to our friend George(SBMous)'s house and they said we should play some Minecraft. At the time, I had no idea what it was, so I was allowed to borrow a spare account. We started playing survival and I have been hooked ever since.

Now, I was at my friends house(TheCampingRushe), and he is just like, I will go play some Minecraft.<br>I had no clue what Minecraft was or what you did on it. My friend was playing on Avicus, but back then it was skywars.co. He gave me like 1 minute on it, and I shot someone with a bow(best shot ever). Ever since then, I have been addicted to it. I got it on my birthday 2012, back in I think 1.6.2. Since then, Minecraft had been a good game. I quit it in early 2013, but got it back late 2014. I now think it's my second favourite game.

I started watching Minecraft around summer of 2012 (april) and i was just in my room playing w/ my Lego race track then i heard my younger brother laughing so much in my parents room so i went to check and saw he was watching a Minecraft LP by KingDaddyDMAC (whom today i still kinda watch) and after watching a couple episodes i started following his LP series, then i soon decided i want to try it out myself, i tried telling my parents&nbsp;to buy me the game but they wouldnt, so i started out w/ the cracked version, got into building then i started pvping around june 2013 when i found a server called Craftrealms, played their famous PvPWar and started from their, soon after i started watching Survival Games when i watched an SG vid from Grapeapplesauce (whom i still watch for fun) then i started watching and subbing to really good Pvpers (SG, Badlion, Kohi, Factions, Mini-games, etc.) and after 2 years since i started watching and playing the game, i finally got my acc which was bought by my friend since i made him 3 Custom PvP TexturePacks (yes i do TexturePacks) and yeah!
