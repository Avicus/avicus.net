Feel free to speak in your first language. :)<br>And if you've been denied twice, I'm sorry but you probably wont get it &nbsp;a third time. Read the stickied threads in the staff app sections on how to "applicate"

If you need help making your application into proper English, I can help, but I'm not sure it's allowed..

Asking in the forums for help with your application isnt fair too others. Please remember it is your work not the work of others with their tips and trick. Everyone including me who is getting reviewed did not need tips or tricks. Please consider this. And BTW good luck with your third application!

You asked at least 10 times to check your application when a Moderator was Ingame, but if it was jozz or a Senior mod, it would be at least 15-20

Asking for help in the forums will make Moderators think you aren't prepared yet, try to be more creative, don't hurry, stay calm, that always helps!<br><br>I don't think a third time works anyways, but, the best of lucks for you!

Just be patient corey, last time applications were open, most players had to wait over 1 or 2 weeks to get a response.
