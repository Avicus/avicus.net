So as you can see I have lost my emerald rank, I had it when I left and now when I come back it's gone.&nbsp;<br>I was told to find the receipt of my emerald purchase, but it was so long ago and I don't know how to find it.&nbsp;<br>Is there any chance that the sheer fact you know I used to have emerald could get my emerald back?&nbsp;<br>Thanks :)

If you used Paypal, look in your account at the transactions.

As rese said look at the transactions.<br>Or search in your email you used to make the purchase using the keywords "paypal" or "avicus" and see if you can find the receipt that way.&nbsp;<br>Good luck

I didn't use an account, I used a prepaid credit card, so I hope I can just go by trust code, because I did have an emerald rank.

I totally remember you having emerald, I'll look through any of my views that I recorded with you to see if I can find the Emerald tag next to your name. :D
