<b>Note:&nbsp;</b><i>This is not a hate post aimed towards Avicus or IvyCode in any shape or form. Please try to read it in my own eyes and not take it as an insult. I am simply stating my opinion.<br><br><b></b></i><b></b>Hello there Avicans,<br>Today I am going to be discussing somethings interesting.<br><br>Firstly let me talk about the Demotions.<br>Avicus is a business and sometimes some staff don't really benefit the server so they have to be "taken out" or demoted. Its that simple, and it makes perfect sense.<br><br>Secondly let me touch upon the subject of the community thinning out slightly.<br>So recently we have lost many forum members, but thats there choice and you have to respect that.<br><br>Thirdly let me discuss Avicus' "originality". Avicus is not original, most if not all the games can be found on other servers. I don't find it cool, Avicus advertising as all original when most everything can be found on other networks:<br><br>Nebula on: SB &amp; OCN<br>Walls on: HP &amp; MP<br>Elimination on: Tons of small networks<br>Nexus on: OCN &amp; any KitPVP server<br>Control the Hill on: TC &amp; any KotH server<br>Avicade on: TCN<br><br>Fourthly,&nbsp;<br>Staff members receive little to no recognition from Avicus its self, the community often thanks them and that is greatly appreciated by all the staff.<br><br>I really do believe that this all can be fixed, and I really do believe in Avicus.<br>Thank you for taking the time to read this post, feel free to share your opinions below, correct me if I'm wrong! :D<br><br><i><b>Extra:</b> I have the deepest most strong respect for Ivy who has put hours and hours everyday into Avicus.</i>

1. Umm....ok....<br>2. Whatever. I'm still here.<br>3. Jesus, someone else who thinks that. And you forgot to slaughter Avicade for this.<br>4. They don't expect to be rewarded. They volunteered to help us. They didn't do it for firework trails.

I respect your opinion and agree with most of your points apart from originality,<br>we have very original maps and many of the gamemode a have been copied from us and the ones we have "copied" have been tweaked and improved.

Although I've only been staff on Avicus for a very short time, I expect nothing in reward. I try my hardest to collaborate with fellow staff members in making Avicus the best it can be. I expect nothing in return.

<span>Thirdly let me discuss Avicus' "originality". Avicus is not original, most if not all the games can be found on other servers. I don't find it cool, Avicus advertising as all original when most everything can be found on other networks:<br><br>Some of these game modes are only found on a few servers, also, part of the reason Nexus was removed was because it was unoriginal, but it didn't matter because the community loved it so much.<br><br></span>Fourthly,&nbsp;<br>Staff members are not rewarded (I may be wrong), no pets, no trails, no classes. A staff member puts hours into Avicus and are not even rewarded a tiny bit. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Moderating is a volunteer job, and rewards like these just distract you from actually moderating.<span><br><br></span>

You all have very strong opinions and I respect that.<br><br><br>But I don't think Avicus should be advertising as "original" then.<br><br>I understand that being a staff member is a volunteer work but you are technically helping funky. Its like doing hours of work and not getting rewarded even if it was a tiny bit of respect or thanks.

We do need some more originality. No matter what the facts are, the games here are not original enough to be uniquely original.

<b>Avicus and the way it advertises that it's original.<br></b>I 100% agree with this.<br><b><br></b>In fact, I hope avicus adds un original gamemodes. Who cares if other server's have them? As long as the gametypes are fun to play, and has a good community, it's awesome.<b><br></b><b><br></b><b></b><i></i>PS: I still find it hard to take you seriously with that troll skin ;_;

Avicus made some of these game modes themselves so they are original l. Walls started on avicus properly and so did nebula. Avicade has gamemodes that aren't on other servers. I agree nexus is not original but the avicus touch has been added u disagree a lot with this post and I don't think I will ever change disagreeing with it as avicus is my fav server and nothing will change that

@subzero<br>None of the Avicus game modes are original, whether Funky coded them or not. The game itself is not original. Control the Hill is Control Point on the Core, Nebula is a smaller version of Project Ares, Elimination is everywhere as HG, Nexus is just a fun TDM, The Walls can be found on multiple servers, MCZone was just one of the first to have it on a server, but the game was already well known. Avicus is not original, but it is well coded, and is well designed.
