Simply just put down your favorite or <b>which do you think was the best Anime(s) of 2015 and say why?!</b><br><br>Note:<br><ul><li>everyone is entitled/open to their own opinions</li><li>NO SPOILERS!</li><li>no arguing, profanity, and harassing of others (most especially saying weeb, even for those who don't watch anime)</li><li><b>strongly no saying of Boku no Pico</b> (inb4 DaGoldBrick sees this post :P)</li><li><b></b>if the anime started in 2014 and finished in 2015 or it had a another season after the previous year, the include (S2)</li><li>FOR THOSE WHO DONT WATCH ANIME! YOU ARE FREE TO IGNORE THIS POST</li></ul>Now my fav Anime of 2015 was Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry, mainly because of the action in almost every episode, as for the animation it was pretty sick! (props to the studio <i>SilverLink and Nexus</i>), the story was also good, as for the characters i like how they made Ikki looked OP but at the same time, something would prevent him from being way OP, also loved Stella (my new waifu xD, and not cuz shes the<i>&nbsp;1st Girl</i>) because she too was also a strong character, and the romantic comedy around the two of them together with the other characters made it fun to watch, and also one of the best Harems ;)<br><br><b>#Intetsu #IttoShura</b>
