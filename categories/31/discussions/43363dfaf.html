So hey most of you know me(I hope :P) and let's just say I haven't seen eye to eye with some staff members you know due to past experiences ;). But I'm here to see what life is like for you staff members and how you do deal with complaints/fights on Avicus.<br><br>Tell me all your details ;). I'm hoping this will be a long list seeing as the amount of staff members on this is insane! :D This includes:<br><br>Mods, Sr Mods, Jr Mods, MapDevs, Admins and others if I've missed any out! <b></b>

Im on my phone too, but usually for mods, we will get on, go to a report that escalates to an arguement between two people, help them work it out while also trying to coordinate with other mods so you don't blow the cover of someone who is spectating a hacker in the same game. Then, while you're talking in staff chat, and typing a long message, the person starts flaming at the other, so you have to leave staff chat to deal with that, but leaving the chat means we start to become uncoordinated. Then you have the people who start msging you how they feel like they're the victim, when they did something wrong themselves, so you have to explain to them how both sides were upsetting the other while bringing the other person into the loop, and also being respectful of their privacy, because all of this is going down ingame. Its all kind of stressful, but that's what we're here for, and we wouldn't be mods if we couldn't handle it. Thanks for reaching out to us, and let us explain oyr end. :)

Mapdevs manage the maps and rotations on the server, so a normal day of a map dev would most likely be:<br>-Building maps<br>-Helping someone build a map<br>-Helping someone with YMLs<br>-Doing our own YMLs<br>-Accepting/denying maps<br>-and Testing maps

I'm glad you're curious! I'd be more than happy to inform you as to what they do, how they do it, and why.<br><br><i></i>I've never been a <i>Map Developer</i>, so I'd ask one of them just so I don't give any false information.<br><br>As a&nbsp;<i>Junior Moderator,&nbsp;</i>it's basically a trial rank. You are entrusted with this rank when your Staff Application gets accepted, and you pass through the Interview Stage. The role of a Junior Moderator is to perform the basic acts and duties as a Moderator, however with limited commands (to prevent abuse) however abuse is still common with the /warn and /kick commands. Your goal as a Junior Moderator is to prove yourself worthy to the Moderators+, and help keep the server safe.<br><br>When promoted to full <i>Moderator</i>, you are now entrusted with the /tempban, and /ban commands. Yes, theee types of infractions can be appealed if needed. However, they're not made to be messed with; along with the rest of the commands given to you as a staff member. The whole point of even applying for staff is because you have the willingness to assist when needed, or even when you feel it's the right thing to do. You as a Moderator are a role model to the rest, in setting an example to be a well rounded player and to not break the rules. You can also be chosen as a mentor for the upcoming or current Junior Moderators, to show them the ropes and what to do/not to do.<br><br>Moving along to <i>Senior Moderator</i>, this is a higher rank which is much more difficult to achieve. As a Senior Moderator, you're entrusted with the ability to appeal infractions, perform web-bans, and have access to the support email. In order to achieve this rank, you must first have been a Moderator with at least 4 months of experience (at least that's the way it was when Jozz and I were Administrators) and be a highly efficient addition to the team with the willingness to work hard, and set the tone for the rest. There are interview sessions for Senior Moderators, so it is in a sense, quite difficult to achieve this position. However, moving back to the abilities: In accessing the support email, you are one of the very few people who can use the /appeal command in game, if a player has been punished and you feel they have the right to be "off the hook". However when you are appealed of a punishment, we usually think of that as your last chance. If you are punished again for a similar or more severe reason, you will most likely be banned permanently. Regarding the Web-Bans, this is used when a player(s) has accessed the forum and is abusing it in a variety of ways. (You can check on the rules to find out what those are) but that's basically the role of a Senior Moderator. You are also able to conduct Junior Moderator interviews. From applying for Junior Moderator being the interviewee, you are now the interviewer. You also have the ability to have a say in who gets promoted/demoted throughout the promotions and demotions process.<br><br>[EDIT] And apparently a current staff member has corrected me in saying, there is no longer a divided Administration system. That's the way it was when I was around, but obviously things have changed around a little bit since I left. My bad. I'd just ask one of the current Administrators and take their word for it. &nbsp;<br><br>I wrote all of this on a tablet, so I apologize if some of the spelling was wretched. Overall, though, I hope this helped you out, and gave you a decent viewing on the daily life of an Avicus Staff Member!<br><br>Regards, -Jake

Well apparently refs are staff, so my time in-game pretty much consists of: Playing, telling somebody what a ref is, playing, telling another person what a ref is, going on ts, telling another person what a ref is. Is there any way I can have a shortcut to the definition of a ref?

Indeed I was! <br><br>Don't worry about it, I wouldn't consider it to be nosy at all. And yes, I did resign. At the point of retirement for me, I had been a staff member for almost a year and four months. I figured I had served my time to the server, so I resigned and passed my position down to Dutchis.

I always wake up pretty early in the morning and take the morning shift of reports while sipping on some coffee, then around the afternoon I'll take a break and play as long as reports are being taken care of by other Mods, then more reports, more playing, and I'll get on teamspeak, and late at night I'll take a few reports, watch netflix, sleep, and repeat. Sounds kinda boring, but I enjoy it :)
