Hi peeps, so I got demoted from official for being inactive and I guess that means its time for this post. I was gonna retire after the tournament to focus on school, but the other officials decided to give me a little head start on my half yearlys.<br><br>Now I'm sorry if I forget you, I still love you but theres so many of you who I've had awesome times with.<br><br>Cacal: I'll still be semi active in skype to fuck around with you, but I love all of you, past and present - except Ingigo and Eteh,<br><br>Officials: Thanks for promoting me in the first place, you guys do a great job. Good luck Tomqss, you should do well.<br><br>Media people: You guys are cool, I could always rely on you guys, well at least a few of you. You were the best bitches a boy could have *sniffle*<br><br>Rilo: You may not read this, but you are my fav squeaker, After I finish school I promise we will continue our journey to Global Tazz master Guardian Eagle Elite together.<br><br>Cammy: Despite some of the stupidity within the staff team half of the time, you are one of those guys who gives me faith in people. Even though you're younger than most of the other staff, you are way more mature than basically all of them and actually use your brain.<br><br>Devon: I loved working with you. You have amazing potential at commentating and I always could count on you with media things. Really nice guy, thanks for being awesome.<br><br>Robo: Thanks for being a good friend. You were a really chill guy who always cheered me up on bad days.<br><br>Okiba: You have always been such a cool guy. You may forget that you have a mouth at times, but you're still an awesome guy to fuck around with - no homo.<br><br>Snow: You were a really good role model for me when I first got mod. Hope you do well back in the staff team. Just one more thing - Lunacy doesn't cheat.<br><br>Greg - Chill guy, really fun guy to be around. If you aren't half asleep, you always brighten up the people around you.<br><br>TheOriginalMad: Forgive me for my sins my god.<br><br>Flo: Really chill guy, had some good times with you.<br><br>Borrah: Really good player and really chill person.<br><br>Sagrevyum and Ethernal Cross: Whenever I was bored or stressed, I could always count on you guys to cheer me up by playing some minecraft. I always had so much fun banning multiple players from your teams for using multiple different clients.<br><br>Team Home people: You guys are just really nice people in general. Any time I played with or against you guys or was in TS with you, you were really chill.<br><br>Posighdun: You were a really cool guy back when you were senior mod. Now you're a not as cool admin and you run a team with some questionable people. Get well soon.<br><br>Keenan: None of this would be possible without you, thanks for starting this server all these years ago. I hope that you will one day bring prestiges back and get some youtubers to revive the server (You have to spend money to make money)<br><br>Anyway go ahead and ask any questions below, I'll try to answer them.

I don't know you that well, but I've been on Ts with you before and you seem nice. You're also a pretty good player.&nbsp;<br><br>A few Horizon players took part in the map testing day last week. A lot of people say that some of them cheat, so I had a look at a few of them. One of them is kinda blatant and I put a question mark over another one.<br><br>I base my opinions on people I don't know that well on what I do know of them, what they're like on the forums and what others say about them.
