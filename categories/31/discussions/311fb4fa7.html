The only infraction I don't understand is advertising. I think you should be warned in game, then tempbanned for ten days or so. If they get caught again they are warned next time is a ban and if they do it again, they get banned.<br>do +1 if you like the idea.

I don't think advertising should be an instant permanent ban. It should be a warning or a kick immediately, and a permanent ban if they do it a second time. However, the severity of the punishment is decided by the staff member and it is up to them to consider the factors of the situation and deal a punishment they believe is just.

I generally, if it was said by blatant mistake due to lack of knowledge on the rules, will tell them to be careful with mentioning an ip, and if they do it again I will, unfortunately have to ban them. People who spam it in capital letters saying free op deserve no such warning.

Yes, I agree. A ban is too serious-- later they might learn their lesson and won't advertise anymore but can't get back on. I think a kick isn't serious enough-- I could see the person who advertised getting back on in a couple minutes and doing it again until someone bans them. A temp-ban is going to be the best because it's a mixture of the two. You have time to learn your lesson and you can still get back on and have fun (:

If the player advertising is intending to drive people away from Avicus to his server, like:<br><br><i>"Hey guys, join myserversip.domaingoeshere, staff needed!" </i>or<i> "drop party at myserversip.domaingoeshere!", </i>then is should be perma.<br><br>If it's a mistake like:<br><i>Player1: What's the IP to that server?</i><br><i>Player2: Oh it's myserversip.domaingoeshere.</i><br><br><br>Then it should be a tempban. Unfortunately, this is only my opinion and the rule states that mentioning an IP in chat is a perma, so I've indeed banned people for the second example I gave.

A lot of advertisers just spam the heck out of you with their Ip.. They obviously don't want to play or care about being banned..<br>If a mod catches them and they tell them to stop, they'll be like "Oh, crap" and say "Ok." Then, they take a break and come back to spam you once again. If you don't ban these types of people, you just give them a second chance they'll take advantage of. If they say an Ip once in chat, however, I don't think they should get any sort of punishment unless they're persuading you to go on their server.
