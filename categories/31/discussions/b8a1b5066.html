So I was recently temp banned for a reason that I do not believe was necessary.&nbsp; So this guy keeps trying to kill me in nebula and he finally kills me.(targeting). Then he says, "f**k you". Docta pop says please be respectful to other players. Then I defend myself by calling him a try hard.Docta pop temp bans me when the other guy was targeting, using profanity and being disrespectful. I admit I shouldn't have defended myself but this should not have resulted in a temp ban.

I think you have to right to defend yourself, but if it's offensed a staffmember he has to punish you, cuz you were disrespectful.<br>However to appeal your temp ban send an email at support@avicus.net.<br>Good luck!<br>EDIT: Maybe try to contact Pop via skype and&nbsp;apologize...

If you believe you were punished unjustly, email support@avicus.net or contact a senior staff member privately. Even if it only lasts a day, if you feel you didn't deserve the tempban, appeal it so that it won't count against you.

Tbh, "Tryhard" does require a tempbban, even if you say it to defend yourself... Its more offensive than saying "f*ck you". (In my opinion). On MCSG it happens so much its not even funny. But as everyone else is saying contact pop, or appeal ;)

I don't see targeting in the "Rules".&nbsp; I get targeted a lot in Nexus.&nbsp; If you are saying it is against the rules, I am very confused. :3
