Update regarding inappropriate language

</h1>
As you may or may not be aware, the rules have recently been slightly altered. The reason I'm making this thread is to clear up any confusion about the use of inappropriate and offensive language in-game.<br><br>The first rule on&nbsp;<a href="https://avicus.net/rules" title="Link: https://avicus.net/rules">https://avicus.net/rules</a>&nbsp;under 'General Etiquette and Behavior'&nbsp;now states:<br><br><ol><li>Maintain a casual and positive atmosphere at all times. Inappropriate or aggressive language, regardless if it is directed at someone or not, will not be tolerated. Be respectful of all players. Harassment, bullying, rudeness and excessive swearing is strictly not allowed.<br></li></ol><span><br></span>This primarily speaks for itself. In the past, players have gotten away with swearing non-stop simply because they weren't directing their remarks at any particular player. The updated rule explains that this is no longer a factor, and players who continuously swear will be warned or punished. Avicus has a community that vastly varies in age, and we want to make it a&nbsp;positive experience for everyone.&nbsp;Staff will still be somewhat lenient however don't expect to get away with it&nbsp;if you're being too inappropriate.<br><br>If you have any questions about this topic feel free to post below.

Then are we allowed to swear once or twice? I think there should be a little leniency if there isn't already.

Does it include staff members as well? Or are you allowed to bypass this rule?<br><br><img title="Image: http://i.imgur.com/cu0HRIq.jpg" src="http://i.imgur.com/cu0HRIq.jpg">

See this is where the system breaks down. What is a swear word? What isn't? Some people consider it swearing, some don't.

Swearing is instinct for&nbsp;<i>speaking out loud</i>, not typing in chat. &nbsp;It's for this reason that we have "Cursing Allowed" and "18+" channels on TeamSpeak.

Thanks for this, Mango! Many players has been swearing, not directly pinpointing anybody, and when I tried to tell them to stop, they argue and state that it isn't an offence to swear. Hopefully less players will swear ;)

i actually see where you're coming from on this, but it is kinda instinctual in chat as well.<br>some ppl type so often and with a lot of swear words (not just on avicus) that it is instinctual. everyone has different instincts, personally i have a habit to type "shit" when i die because i type so quickly and don't really think about it.<br><br>however, you can try to stop the habit. self control is a thing for most ppl and you gotta learn to use it. just really try your best not to swear in chat, but for me its hard because whenever i type there's usually a swear in it and it takes less than half a second for me to type a swear word and send it
