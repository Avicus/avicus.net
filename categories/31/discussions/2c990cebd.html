The forums are a place for this, though. Plus, people pretty much stopped using the support email when it took 6 months for a single response. Don't know how good or bad it is now, though, at least within the past month, but it's still more efficient to ask here.

The public forums is definitely not the right place to discuss a private infraction. <br>As a former Administrator I expect you should know this fairly basic fact..<br><br>Contacting the support team is the best way to ask, and even if the Sr staff are slow at responding then there are other ways you can contact them. <br>Private messaging in game and on teamspeak are two good ways. Also, finding them on Skype is also beneficial.<br>Or, you could even create a new discussion in the "appeal an infraction" subforum, considering it's relevant.<br><br>But you are well aware of this, obviously..

lmao, for someone who types so much you dont appear to be able to read. People only go to support if they want to wait forever; I still have a few unanswered emails to support and kylo's private after 6 months. Staff also don't make their skypes public or wont accept random requests. Finally, the APPEAL an infraction page is clearly not the place to ask, this section at least isn't defined and therefore is far more appropriate of a place to put this post.<br><br>As a former mod, I expect you should know this basic fact..<br><br>But you are well aware of this obviously..<br><br>You look more like PuddleSX3 after that roast m8.

Like ronan said, no one really uses support, since they have faster and better answers on the forums. But Ronan sucks at roasts so don't listen to him

That is soooooooo much slower than going on TeamSpeak. Trust me, I applied for developer and I didn't get a response for more than a month.

By your own words, support is slow. By posting it here he not only got a response, but it was also quick. You're wrong. Also m8 a roast aint "cool" its hot. :)<br><br>The skype thing: yeah, some do, a lot don't in fact off the top of my head: alm eako and frosted all deleted me on skype once they punished me. Mods arent accountable for their actions on avi and certainly not on skype.<br><br>Support is the only publicly available method of handling of an appeal related conversation.
