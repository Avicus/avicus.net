Dudes i know this is just everyones opinions and i respect that however these kind of posts are cruel and result in people feeling unliked and left out. All interviewees have a good chance also i think you have worded the post wrong. It says who will make it through to the interviews well there is a list of those people somewhere but i can't seem to be able to find it for you. However i assume you meant who will make it to jr mod? So could you archive the post to avoid upsetting people? Thank you.
