Well Atlas is coming in with a new hub...<br>Why fix something that they would have to I'd assume contact Funky to upload to the map to the hubs, and then have the server reset when a new hub is around the corner in Atlas.<br>And from what Staff that are high up or may even be helping create the update that they are saying there is a high possibility in August.<br><br>You don't come for the hub, you come for the game. If it were a permanent hub for a long time, then yes, fix it, but the hub will be removed in a bit.

But it was requested since spring, and leaving this for several months is quite unprofessional for a server. Now you can say "in a few days/weeks/whatever will come Atlas and it will be fixed anyways" but this actually just shows that you're lazy
