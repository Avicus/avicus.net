Discussion Starters are back again guys!<br><br>Despite being away from avicus, I would still like to communicate/say hello through the forums! So let's get to today's question! Lately, I've been asked a reoccurring question, which is, Who is your modern day idol? Like who do you look up to most in your life? Your answer could really be anything! You could say that your idol is some famous movie star, or some athlete who is always on the headlines! My idol in my life is Andrew Luck. For those of you who don't know him, he is plays quarterback for the Indianapolis Colts. I strongly consider him my idol, because of his discipline, and his values of promoting hard work, and doing your best.&nbsp;<br><br><b>&nbsp;Who's your idol?&nbsp;<br><br><br>&nbsp;</b>Love you guys &lt;3&nbsp;<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>SenorSombrero

My idol would have to be my dad. He was the one who got me into programming in 6th grade, and supported me all the way through, giving feedback on projects and websites that I'd made.

My dad and Roger Federer.&nbsp; My dad taught me how to become a pro tennis player ( now its time to practice and train ).&nbsp; But I have watched so many videos of Roger Federer to see what the best in the world look like.
