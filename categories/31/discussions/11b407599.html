</h1>
Recently, there has been a huge announcement on both servers regarding an official merge, making a single, big, competitive PvP server.<br><br><a href="https://www.badlion.net/forum/thread/107194" rel="nofollow" title="Link: https://www.badlion.net/forum/thread/107194">Post on Badlion</a><br><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kohi/comments/4gywwf/the_future_of_kohi/" rel="nofollow">Post on Kohi</a><br><br>I'm personally for it, since they are transferring over the knockback and hit detection from kohi for PotPvP since Badlion has acknowledged that their setup for it is atrocious :v Although, they are keeping the rules for badlion, which means no more chill chat anymore from the kohi side ;-;<br>Also, those banned on badlion and not on kohi will have to show they are an active kohi player to get unbanned when the merge happens, but the other way around is a free get out of jail card.<br><br>There's plenty more of information on the posts, just thought I'd spread the word, and want to see what you guys think.

This is a good but bad idea. I feel that the communities are better separate because the players are badlion are more relaxed and more chill. Where as the kohi players will not be as relaxed and calm. Another big problem is that I bet more than half the practice2 players will not play the merge. Most of kohi cheated on badlion due to it being worse and it not having a very reliable anti-cheat. Even with the "jail free card" I do not believe this will work.

Just read the posts.<br><br>From what I see Badlion will be keeping their chat rules so I do believe that there won't be chaos in the chat. The people that are the more boisterous ones will most likely be muted while the ones who are constructive about this won't be muted.<br><br>I think that this is a boon for them, imo.

After reading more, if you are banned on kohi but not on badlion, you will stay unbanned.<br>If you are banned on badlion but not Kohi, you have to show that you're active on kohi to get unbanned, otherwise you are stuck banned on badlion.

If you are not banned on Badlion, you will be fine once the merger is complete. We are using the Badlion punishments once it is completed and anyone that is banned on Kohi but not on Badlion will be able to play.
