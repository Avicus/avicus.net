Out of everything on Avicus, the one thing I'm fearing are the AviPeeps. I've seen many many many people complaining about people making leaving posts just for attention, though this isnt excatly true. I've been gone for a total of 13 days and I have a feeling I need Avicus. I've had this server for an extremely long time and it was foolish of me to think it was time for it to go. I am literally afraid to come back because 85% of Avicus to me is about the community and friends. What would the point be for me to come back only for everybody to think im an attention seeking loser? I would only have 15% fun and 85% of my friends gone. The reason I made this post is because I want to see if this will&nbsp;<i>actually&nbsp;</i>happen. I need the AviPeeps to either hate me, or like me/ not hate me.<br><br>P.S.<br>I know I should've thought my leaving through. But we learn from mistakes.<br><br>P.P.S<br>My sister has been logging on and playing, so that's why my profile only says Last Logged on 4 days ago.

It's fine. We are ok with that. I said that people who come on the day after are bad, but you, you at least tried. You tried to stay away. I failed almost right away... I'm kinda a hypocrite.&nbsp;<br><br>Some people will hate you - My advice? Ignore them.<br>Most will welcome your return. I missed u on the forums. :3

<span><i>What would the point be for me to come back only for everybody to think im an attention seeking loser? </i>You decide if you want to come back or not, but it's your decision. Honestly, this is even more of an attention thread asking whether you should come back or not and how you're afraid of everyone hating you, but you = you. Do whatever you want.</span>

Eh...i feel like the communtiy is me....not sure if that was to be mean or what, Para lol. Anyways,&nbsp;<b><i><u>WHY WOULD I BE SEEKING ATTENTION?!?!</u></i></b><i></i> I'm like one of the most unknown users in Avica. .-. Im pretty sure if i wanted attention I'd have attention. And be famous and overrated. I'm nothing like that. (Imo)<b><i></i></b>
