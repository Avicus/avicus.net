Hey guys, it's JJ here. And today, I am considering renewing the Avicus instagram! I have though about this for a while now, but now I need your guys' ideas about this. I wouldn't run it alone, and I would probably give the password to all staff (somehow), and certain others we all know. The name of it would be&nbsp;<b>avic.us</b> because 1) It's not taken, as "avicus" and "avicusnetwork" are, and 2) It's the server IP.<br><br>Ideas? Thoughts? Hate? Let me know!

I'm not hating or anything but to be honest I don't think the server Administrators would give permission to do this. It would have to be with an Administrators permission.

This is why I posted this. I have my ipod ready to go when the account is to be made, but I'd need to set everything with the officials first. :P

I think it would be a great idea, but the staff should definitely help you run it. Maybe I would follow if it was revived…<br>BTW you just got me. I was just about to post about this...

If you create an Instagram account on behalf of the Avicus Network, I will request to take it down... I have done it before. Social network applications (Facebook, instagram etc) will be run by the server Administrators and the Administrators alone.&nbsp;<br><br>Actually, I had to laugh at the timing of this thread because Jake and I were talking about creating an Official Avicus Network Instragram. Yes, it is planned to revive the Instagram for the Avicus Network<b> #SELFIES4DAYZ</b>
