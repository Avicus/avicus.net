Hi. It would be much appreciated if you took some time to just fill this out. It's a form to give feedback on the two social media outlets, Facebook &amp; Twitter, that Avicus currently uses. Feedback will be used by the Social Media team to try and improve on what we're currently doing.<br><br>Please be honest when filling this out.<br><a href="http://goo.gl/forms/Jx7tByn8Nr9bSZkN2" title="Link: http://goo.gl/forms/Jx7tByn8Nr9bSZkN2">http://goo.gl/forms/Jx7tByn8Nr9bSZkN2</a>

We don't really need social media pages.<br><br>Avicus is such a small community and it's reflected with how little community interaction occurs on these pages.<br><br>I think it would be much more beneficial to have a weekly or bi-weekly update thread here on the forums than to have 3 different social media pages that no-one checks.<br><br>By having a dedicated update thread on the forums, it'll be able to reach a larger audience composed of the entire forum community.<br><br>As opposed to having a Facebook page with 5 active members and only 1 like per post.

There is the Community Update thread, though I'm not really sure how frequently those come out.<br><br>I believe that social media, if used right, can be used to reach a new audience, and attract more players towards Avicus. It also allows some of the community that don't often check the forums (but may check social media) have a chance to give input on threads that social medias may put out (such as Para's Sky Wars thread).

Using Social media to attract attention to a wider audience could work, but the reason why it isn't is because of the complete lack of advertising the server has.. and this includes social media.<br><br>From my point of view, it looks like all the social media pages are more focused on talking about small updates and less focused on actually reaching out to more players.<br><br>And let's be honest, not even the regulars check the social media pages that often. <br><br>By looking at the very small size of each social media page, you can see that Avicus' social media is not the draw when it comes to reaching out to newer players.<br><br>Excluding the server, the website and the forums are the draw, not the minuscule social media pages.

pretty sure more memecraft pvpers check server websites more than social media pages but hey! That's what I think!&nbsp;<br><br>why focus on fucking social media pages over voting/ACTUAL MINECRAFT SERVER WEBSITES instead of out of the line "Facebook". I understand that it could be used for "KEEPING UPDATES IN TRACK" but the only actual things that can be used are the forums and Twitter. Not tumblr. Not Facebook. Not Instagram. Those 3 are stupid and should not be used to help "promote the server".<br><br>Heck! How does one promote servers via Facebook/other social media sites without growing a good player base via other minecraft server list websites.<br><br><br><br><br><br>lol

Jesus mate, you came out of the gates quite quickly with that one..<br><br>But I agree with you.<br>Take the Facebook page for example, <br>I never understood why we ever had a Facebook page in the first place, <br>because no-one wants to interact with it using their personal FB accounts and even less people will go out of their way to create a public account simply to keep up with a tiny AVN page..

Oh sorry didn't see this till now. The Social Media team has taken the responses and we're going to try and improve what we're doing with the feedback we got. A lot of you said you check Twitter more than Facebook, so we want to be using Twitter more often, and start being active with it again.&nbsp;<br><br>I personally want to start spreading more awareness towards both Social Media platforms, and get more people involved in terms of sharing, liking, and re-tweeting. One plan I have, is to start posting some community content. Stuff like montages, videos, or graphics/art.

The server isn't big, not well known, etc. It doesn't need a social media page lmao. No one would care<br><br>Utonium boy up there made a good point. Stop promoting this server/keeping updated on it over social media. Follow what he said. He's one of the few staff members that have good ideas and a clue about what they're doing.<br><br>And no, there is no hate directed towards you Crazy
