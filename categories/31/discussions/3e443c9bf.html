&nbsp;On the two of my favorite Minecraft servers, both had a huge change that just kinda pushed me away, or just had a feature that bugged me way too much. One of those servers was far too laggy despite purchasing a new computer and it didn't have enough features to satisfy me. Thus I went back to playing a server I found in my server list which was MCZone. But it was Avicus now so I began to enjoy the server, up til now. It was a server i enjoyed purely because of it's leveling system with prestige and the 'ding' you get when you killed someone. (Silly I know) It also had DTM which I found super exciting and because no other server had this cool of community and features, I played on. Up until now when 2 years of work and satisfaction, went down the drain. I actually didn't mind it, but the change of the ding seriously bugged me for no apparent reason and the removal of prestige has seriously grown on me to the point I can't fight without feeling a little sad. (Alright I am super pedantic about things, and I'm more of an RPG-er). <br>&nbsp;Toppled with things to do with friends and school and an up rise to get a better life by sleeping and eating more, &nbsp;I'm starting to slowly waddle away from Minecraft and into my life as I am soon going into high school and I have to create a resume and etc. Funny how I once said that I would want to become a Mod on this server when i grew older and more mature, since I don't see that happening now. With all these things happening at once, and the constant down stream of interest for Minecraft like the new features, I have finally decided to drop this game. Despite it being the most fun I've ever had with friends I've met, I just have to drop the fish back into the sea.<br>&nbsp;Last reason being, I want to be more serious about gaming. I honestly can't see how you can introduce yourself as a gamer when you say the game you play, is a game about building and fighting with blocks and using a gaming mouse to play such a game. &nbsp;<br><br>I never thought I would actually start disliking this game enough to drop it. So I basically want to thank everyone, especially the staff and friends. Although I was never super active on the forums and went on Teamspeak at all in fear of giving everyone ear cancer, I had hella of a blast of a time!! I may return whenever I'm totally settled with life and not having much problems, but until then, I'm gonna disassociate myself with anything to do with Minecraft.<br><br>Note: Is this even in the right section? xD <br>"IT'S REYN TIME!" +1 fish for you if you get that.<br><br>Warbry/User_1673 Waddling off. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ᴬᶰᶦᵐᵉ/ᴹᵃᶰᵍᵃ ᶦˢ ᶜᵒᵒᶫ ᵃᶰᵈ ˢᵒ ᶦˢ ʰᵉᶰᵗ⁻⁻

I remembered Warbry as that guy on Instagram, setting up a server with another girl that plays minecraft and trying to appoint staff members. Correct me if I'm wrong, Warbry but your name sounds very familiar xD
