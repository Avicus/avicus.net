A while back (for some reason) I purchased a pet pack for the lobby. This was, I believe, around 2 or 3 years ago on Christmas. Seeing as the pets have been removed, do I get reimbursed (not sure if that is the right word) for the money I paid? Or do I get nothing?

I feel like time shouldn't cancel out any payments? Pet pack was 10$ so just 2 sets of keys would be cool with me TBH.

But you aren't buying it as a product. It's a donation towards the server, you can't just ask for something else a year later. Its the same if I bought you a cookie 3 weeks ago and you ate it, now I want that cookie back because I had feels for it. You can't really give it back and there isn't any point in replacing it cause its just a cookie... Same with the pets and key.<br><br><br>Edit: sorry about my cookie example. I'm half awake eating oreos in bed.

You should be able to get it back, but it's a bit unreasonable. Imagine you bought a shirt. 3 years later, you still have the receipt and want to return it. You haven't worn it once, yet you want to return it. I'm pretty sure no store will accept any item returned after 3 years. Avicus is like a virtual store. You probably won't get the 10 dollars back, it will most likely be counted as a donation:

Your guys analogies are missing the point, he doesn't want to return his pet for a refund. The pet unexpectedly expired... As in it died, and he wants compensation

Avicus doesn't offer refunds full stop, so there's not much anyone can do.&nbsp;<br><br>Also, as 99 mentioned, buying perks is less about paying for said perk and more about supporting the server by donating.
