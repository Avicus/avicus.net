Heey schmenni here,<br>I'm so sour, because the players of Quollcraft had stolen my Map and some other maps from Avicus Network. It's very important that Funky/IvyCode do something agains this stealer !<br>I know this can be&nbsp;advertising, but you can look at this ripoff ! (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://quollcraft.net/">http://quollcraft.net/</a>). I can remove it everytime :)<br>Pls help me, I did a post on their forums, they deleted it :/ and I send them an E-mail. <br>I don't know what I can do ... :(

Also, please stop vandalizing his forums/server. We're supposed to be mature and civil.<br>On a side note, Marks was punished over there for stealing maps and he has been punished here. Quoll told me to tell you he didn't know.

Alright. This is not really something to take lightly. You have some one stealing so much from us, and we don't do anything about it? Like damn. We need to do something. We can't just leave it. What if it becomes a popular server like mineplex or something. How would we feel? Not happy. Plus, why are some of us mods on that server? I don't understand. They completely steal everything from us and then you help them by being a moderator? I can't understand. We need to stop them.

I agree. "We're not copying Avicus!" Total BS, "I have a copy of the server lobby, what do I do?", "Quollcore, Quollcraft 2.0", same rank names and images, stealing maps. They didn't even TRY being a server, it's a compilation of servers. They have a game called "Blitz" and I'm not too sure that OCN will be happy.
