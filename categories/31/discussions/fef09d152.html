The title pretty much asks the question; but I keep coming on TS and looking for people to talk to (sometimes while intoxicated), and no one is on. Is very depressing. I'm just wondering where everyone is.

A lot of people who I use to talk to everyday on Teamspeak no longer goes on. <br>If I weren't a Mod, I would do the same. It's constantly empty these days. Not really sure why, it just kind of happened.
