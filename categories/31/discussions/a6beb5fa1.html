Buster said that she might be gone, not for definite and the way she was talking to me today, it seems like she is only leaving for the holiday and she will be back after the holidays!

How did it happened then? I don't know if someone would hack your account just to steal a map. It would be more then that. Maybe it was just to get you banned but they also made a forums account on QuollCraft? Even if they did hack for that they wouldn't take the time to give you a profile picture and all. Soooo...

On the other side of that thought, i wouldn't make an account just to steal a map, if you click my profile on Quollcraft it says that i joined may 9th and the last time i was active on the server was may 9th.<br>I've never even seen that website until&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://avicus.net/zaidms0987">zaidms0987</a>&nbsp;posted the link.
