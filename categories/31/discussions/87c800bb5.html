Hey guys,<br>dodgy here.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; I would just like to say that I am quitting Minecraft for ever. The reason is, is that It just got real boring. I was one interview away from getting Staff. (Assuming I passed of course) I don't know what happened. I just got real bored. I have reset my computer to factory default to get everything off. I wish everyone the best of life, and remember... life, school, family, friends comes first. Again, I wish everyone the best of luck.<br><br>Keep Swinging<br>- dodgy

It feels like everyone who's leaves always does something really stupid like resetting there computer or some shiz like that. I've already kinda left but I don't go doing something so I can't go back it it once in awhile.
