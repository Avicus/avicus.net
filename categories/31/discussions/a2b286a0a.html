They should be allowed, but only in a section about 'personal info' or some stuff like that. The forums are getting overflowed with all these personal posts, put them in a different area of the forums, not in the recent discussions, and people who are interested in the lives of other players can look in that section.

No, those are allowed since they do not accentuate the "name change" part as much as the "AMA" part.

I do not like any of these types of posts except the demotion and leaving posts because i feel it is necassary for people to know if someone is leaving or the reason behind a demotion.

How about people who return after a long time? Are they allowed to make an Introduce Yourself "I'm back" post?<br><br>It's self-centered, but I think it's nice to see members come back after they've been gone. Of course, leaving posts are frowned upon, so I'm not sure if returning posts would fall under the same category.

I think all of those are ok. As long as it has to do with Minecraft/Avicus. On the other hand, threads that ask for a reply on a sensitive/personal topic aren't so bad, as long as they're appropriate, necessary and not too personal.

Demotion: Yes.<br>Leaving post: if it is a perm leave.<br>Personal issues: I actually really like this type of post. keep em mate.<br>Personal achievements: Honestly, it depends. If someone just got like 20k kills or something no. But if someone gets something more huge like making a highschool sports team or getting accepted at a good college it can start a good discussion with people that like that kind of stuff. If ya don't like to read those types of post then you don't have to click on the thread.<br>Name Changes: no. Just no.

I think they should be allowed... But to a certain extent.<br><br>If they are meant for selfish purpose such as boasting, etc. then no.<br><br>I like reading demotion, leaving, self-achievement, etc. posts because they show a player's personality and what they're going through.

When we are at it, it should be punishable to spam your youtube content on multiple posts. I understand if you have <b>ONE</b> main "hub" where you post all your videos and everytime you upload a new video. <br><br>You don't need ten different posts for the ten different gameplays you upload, like Top 5 and so on.

There's no reason for you to bring me into the situation, you have already told me how you feel so please stop! I know your talking about me because I am the only one to do Top 5, also it is really rude to talk about people behind their backs.
