Folks,<br><br><ul><li>I just wanted to give everyone a quick heads up on the walls maps. As most of you know towering to the world height of 256 and making a skybase was a problem on walls. To fix this problem we had to do some research, do some testing, and have some trial and error before getting it to work. Due to all of our fiddling and changing things, some of you got stuck at spawn, or find that some maps allow you to build and others do not. I think we got most of this worked out now, but some server may still not have completed the needed restart for the changes to take place so just keep that in mind. I want to thank everyone that helped with the testing, and endured through the learning.</li></ul><br>Thanks again<br><br>Let me know what I can do to help.

You can build up to Y:190 on Knights tower(Think it's the map name) since the tower is high up
