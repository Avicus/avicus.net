Seen as April Fools is done in most of the world, I have decided to post a thread explaining what has gone down on this faithful day.<br><br>As I think you all know, changes that have been announced today have just been a joke, for example the <a href="https://avicus.net/forums/discussions/d4489451c" rel="nofollow" title="Link: https://avicus.net/forums/discussions/d4489451c">big announcement thread</a>&nbsp;and the Removing all Throwback maps thread. (The <a href="https://avicus.net/forums/discussions/3cf3e9cff" rel="nofollow" title="Link: https://avicus.net/forums/discussions/3cf3e9cff">Atlas Update thread</a>&nbsp;is not however.)<br><br>The Senior and MapDev teams had their fun, so the Mods decided that we wanted in on the action and along came the Mod vs Senior battle. Some of you might have noticed the punishments page is filled with staff punishing staff, and that is why.<br><br>It all started with Greg banning Peachy, this led to his ban and demotion, which started the whole episode. Mods from far and wide (and Greg) got together in a Teamspeak room, and after we found out that they were planning for Donald Drumpf to takeover the server, we started banning all of them! The Seniors were taken aback, but they had the Admin Panel on their side, and unbanned themselves, but to no avail because the mods outnumbered the Seniors greatly, and kept banning them. But with the help of the Panel, they started to remove all of our Mod ranks, and give us Junior Mod instead. With our ban powers stolen from our grasp, Tazz had a brilliant plan of kicking Iron from Teamspeak, which led to him getting banned. Soon we started kicking the Seniors as soon as they got on, and they had no chance against us! But fellow mods started to turn against each other, kicking each other left and right, which gave enough time for the Seniors to start banning us, until our numbers were very small, and we, defeated.&nbsp;<br><br>In the end, 5+ pages of infractions, and all of us banned, you would have to say the Seniors won, or did they? If you look at the punishments page, they are going to have to get rid of all of those infractions. (Fun time)<br><br>Also, Peachy and Spookz ended up with the <a href="http://imgur.com/a/XKNH8" rel="nofollow" title="Link: http://imgur.com/a/XKNH8">most infractions.</a> Congrats guys!<br><br>Pictures of most of the punishments can be found <a href="http://imgur.com/a/kmDeB" rel="nofollow" title="Link: http://imgur.com/a/kmDeB">here.</a>
