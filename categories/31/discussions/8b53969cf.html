I was playing Avicus today, and the rotations landed on a map called Divines, which I have played many times before. Only today, however, did I realize that the teams are named after gods from Runescape! Saradomin was a good god, and he was seen as a valorous and chivalrous knight, where Zamorak was a demon god and a very dangerous one. It was a blast from the past and I felt like going back to Runescape (but then decided against it because its actually shit.)<br><br>I was wondering how many other Avicus players played on Runescape before getting into other, similar games. How many of you once called Lumbridge home? Or frolicked through the fields just south of Varrock, sporting your rune plate-legs, and green party hat? Do you miss battling Lesser Demons way up in level 40 of the Wilderness? Or farming cash from giants and goblins around the evil mansion?<br><br>I feel like I should go back, to this gateway-game that I once played. We could even make an Avicus clan, and participate in clan wars, or do quests together.&nbsp;<br><br>Anyway, that's all. Just a little nostalgia for the day.<br>-higger, AKA Peri207 (on Runescape)
