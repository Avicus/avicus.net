I remember at the last spawn hub, there were ton's of secret rooms, like Killerby22's quiz, the minecart rollercoaster, the remains of the junior lounge and the many many secrets inside the fishing hole. &nbsp;I was wondering if people would start making them again because there aren't any in the hub right now.

Before Avicore was released you could parkour to get to the top of the hub.<br><br>I don't think there is any lobby secrets.

In the old map there was a huge giant secret under the spawn, its just that there's no entrance. &nbsp;If you could go 3 blocks under spawn, you would find the secret library thing.
