It wont come out all at once.<br>For example, the new staff colours were apart of it but obviously, the whole Winter Update wasn't released then.

We do not release dates for updates. As we get closer to that day, we may decide to announce it. <br><br>Besides, not even Ivy knows when it'll release.

<i>"Phail IMO ivy needs to know"<br></i>You can never make a deadline with development; especially when Ivy is busy with life. We want to make sure there are no bugs upon release too. <i><br><br></i>

Yeah exactly what you said. Sorry for my english, i was meaning not to know the exact day for the update, the "deadline" as u said, like when its the last date, he is busy with life also, so he should put a long deadline like for 1 month/week? i think there are no really bugs except fast hit glitch and the colors, and the developer is the most important thing since you already have all the plugins to all the new gamemodes.
