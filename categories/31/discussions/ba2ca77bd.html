Hey everyone!&nbsp;<br><br>Today, Necromancy scrimed Xenarch. They didn't seem to do justice to the great oppourtunity gifted to us by Avicus to create teams and scrim others. They abused this opportunity and ended a match just before we were about to win. We (Necromancy) lost the first match which was Wahiz CTW. We chose the next match as Senex Scrim. They kept changing maps and finally got to Senex. I would also like to point out that We had 1 sub, while Xenarch had 3 subs. The Senex match was close, but when they realized we were mining their monuments, they quickly ended the match. We called them out on this, and said that we would take the win for the round. We were obviously upset at this abuse but we stayed calm. We said specifically that we would take the win since they ended the round without our permission or any warning. The subs for both teams stayed out of the argument that progressed. There was also a bit of "salt" you might say, from some players from BOTH teams. Both teams were guilty of letting the idea of competition take precedence over the idea of having fun. There was also a bit of anger coming from Fauin in specific as he had been kicked from Necromancy. He was being particulary rude. I would like to point out that Fauin was kicked from Necromancy because he was subbing for Xenarch when we were scrimming them. Normally, we would not be angered by this but we were a player down and Fauin refused to join us. This proved that Fauin had absolutely no care for Necromancy like I and the other players of the team do. I pointed this out to Fauin when he called out our team as being "trash" and saying other fairly negative things toward us. I pointed out the reason why he had been kicked and said to settle the argument in a 1v1. I agreed. We joined Crossfire (just Fauin and I) and we fought. The first round he did win (which was close might I add). I agreed to the loss of the first round without any argument. Then other players started joining in and when Fauin and I tried to fight again, Ryiley started hitting me as we were fighting. I still killed Fauin however. This happened a couple other times where I would have to 2v1 which apparantly still counted. Fauin was being extremely disrespectful and saying "ez" or other phrases which only escalated the argument. When I won, I simply said gf. When Fauin lost, he blamed it on his bad ping.&nbsp;<br><br>This post was simply meant to show other players what abuse looks like. I am upset with the way the great scrimmages Avicus offers are treated. I just hope Fauin and other Xenarch players (and players all around Avicus) will respect the server and other players more and play fairly. I will also attach a video when it has rendered giving evidence of all of the stated facts.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;If you have something negative to say to me, please refrain from saying it at all. If you have any ideas of how to prevent this, please by all means state them below.&nbsp;<br><br>Thanks,&nbsp;<br><br>Kojapan17 (armoredkoja)

Alright, stop shitting us. We never said at 1 point that it was our win. We ended the match because we had 3 players and you guys had 6, not because you were about to win. I don't get why this whole post was made, because you guys are making the whole situation big.<br><br>AND WTF, you "stayed calm" Both teams were equally as salty like what the fuck bro,&nbsp;<br><br>The fact that you are calling us out and calling Fauin out specifically is actually a really shit move of you.&nbsp;<br><br>"W<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; ">e joined Crossfire (just Fauin and I) and we fought.

I actually agree with most of your claims here. The only thing i don't agree with is when you say "We ended the match because we had 3 players and you guys had 6, not because you were about to win". I don't agree with this because you never gave us any warning whatsoever. If you gave us warning, we would have had time to respond. I pointed out Fauin specifically because he was being disrespectful and was being rude to Necromancy. I am not trying to get you banned for anything, you actually seem like a decent guy, I just wanted to state the facts.&nbsp;<br><br>Thanks for your response,&nbsp;<br><br>Koja

Yes, both teams were going at it, a bit too much WHICH I AM GUILTY OF AS WELL!. Again, I pointed out Fauin in specific because I didn't like the why he was acting, specifically towards me.
