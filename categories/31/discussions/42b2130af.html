Hi. There is a post saying "guess the next staff member" so why not a "guess the next mapdev" post?<br><br>Note: Para told me to make this<br><br><br>My List: Polar_Express/Merlinmaster/Zedther/Trexdomobutter<br><br><br>Don't vote for yourself!<br><br><br>Taken from Next Staff thread:<br>I want to start by saying that this should be kept serious and mature. I would like this thread to be somewhere where the community can give their input on who they feel would do well in a Mapdev position. Just give your recommendations, don't bash on other people. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions. Seeing as their was a thread similar to this before Avicore was released, the presence of one shouldn't be a problem, assuming that everyone behaves like they should. So please do.&nbsp;<br>So, who do you think will be the next Mapdev?<br><br>A few guidelines:<br>Please do not suggest yourself<br>Please do not say rude or antagonistic things about others' posts: if you disagree with something, be mature and keep it to yourself<br>Please support your recommendations. A few words will do.

itaity and AwarriorVenom were the third and fourth Map Developers promoted in the Avicus Network.<br><br>Currently, itaity is still working alongside the rest of the team while AwarriorVenom first quit, then came back, but was demoted afterwards.

Alright, let's get serious here. I'm gonna give my honest opinion now!<br>Also, keep in mind this is merely my opinion, yet nothing official or confirmed.<br>The following people I am about to mention are not organized in a specific order at all.<br><br><i><b>-- Polar_Express</b></i><br>He's one of the two Walls adepts I've got to meet until now (the first one being itaity). While his personality may be stubborn at times, he'd handle the rank quite well and I can smell good results coming from him, because there are already some fantastic Walls maps from him that have unique qualities and amazing features, every single one of them. All of his maps offer different gameplay styles that innovate and add more variety to Walls.<br><br><i><b>-- Merlinmaster</b></i><br>He has a really organized and impeccable building style, he's been making maps every so often and has shown to possess true Map Developing potential. His attitude is something he should work on a tiny bit but I can tell this could be an opportunity for him to change as a person for the best. He'd be a good choice as he brings up unique concepts in Map Making, and he's been bringing up pretty neat gamemode ideas lately as well.<br><br><i><b>-- Slicorn<br></b></i>He's been improved since last time he made a map. I can appreciate the sharpening of his building abilities in both aesthetical side and gameplay side. He offers a nice attitude but has also his downsides, anyhow, he'd be pretty efficient and hard-working, since that's one of his brightest qualities. He's a pretty good choice and he's been working good with maps lately. You can easily work with him when it comes to map making and he'd ensure you a fun time, trust me.<br><br><i><b>-- Zedther</b></i><br>Lately he's been showing off what he didn't in the past: Map Developing potential. I was truly impressed when Para first mentioned him, but now I can understand why, as he is actually a pretty good builder and he knows how to take feedback properly. He seeks ways to improve, as well, and his easy going attitude is pretty helpful as well. He's very active and his time zone is rather... interesting. I'm pretty sude he'd be a nice addition to the Map Developing team, so I also vote for him.<br><br><b><i>-- sweeeper<br></i></b>This guy works by the shadows. His building style is flawless and he is full of ideas and new map styles. His ability is truly impressive and he takes his time on making maps to make sure the finishing touch is worth it. His attitude is pretty friendly and he is capable of understanding what the word teamwork means on all its forms. He has been working a lot lately and I have seen it with my own eyes. He'd be a great addition to the team.<br><br><i><b>-- SweetMango</b></i><br>This guy is an exceptional builder. He knows what he's doing when he builds, and even though his map count is the smallest out of everyone, building Dredmor is enough for him to be considered for the position. He's very trustworthy, his attitude is pretty cool, he's very mature, capable of working efficiently, active, his time zone helps him, too, and he's already a Moderator, he pretty much knows what teamwork is and how to communicate around other Staff Members. I swear, I will never forget how fun it was to build Dredmor with Mango and Koo. Mango's boss.<br><br><b><i>Chill and Cool guys I also like:</i></b><br>-- Zintenka<br><span>-- resepignev<br></span>

Thanks for all the nice comments - you are correct I can be stubborn - but I have chilled out some :) <br><br>I think anyone that has put a map into rotation should be considered and I don't know all of them, but whoever gets the next spot will be great. I vote for Murph_The_Cat as she is really nice.

I will not give any names, I just want to say that as a map dev, your playing time is drastically reduced. You are always nervous and you always feel like you have something other to do then playing on Avicus.&nbsp;<br><br>I personally didn't enjoy the feeling. <br><br>If you are hardworking and you are extremely determined to help the community, then fine, you go girl. You are a great fit for the rank.<br><br>I wasn't anyways, the maps back then were awful and I didn't feel like accepting any of them. I got way better meanwhile aswell... The maps now, are just... no... I just can't look at them.&nbsp;<br><br>Im getting a bit off point here, but I wanted to say that im done making maps. There will not be a Sandstorm II. Anyone can go on the thread and use the map for anything.<br><br>&nbsp;I've gotten to a point where making bad maps hurt. I moved to creative building.. I took SpicyTunaRoll9's advice from a long time ago...<br><br>Since I have a bit of experience as a map dev, I can pretty much give my thoughts on who should be the next map dev with a bit more accuracy.<br><br>I feel like this person should be, <b>Polar_Express.<br></b><br>Although his map making skills do not impress me (BASICALLY THE REASON WHY I WAS CHOOSEN AS A MAP DEV EVEN THOUGH, ACCORDING TO ME, I WASN'T A GOOD FIT.), this person would be great fit for the rank because I sense he is not going to quit Avicus anytime soon. He has also mastered the YAML of the Walls, which is basically the hardest YAML to completely understand. His Walls maps also have a great shape and size for a Network such as the Avicus Network. They also all have something unique gameplay wise.&nbsp;<br><br><br>Im not trying to sound superior in any way.
