So, I was reading the avicus.net/rules and I found out that the section 1, point 7 said:<br><b>"</b><span><b>If you are not a staff member, do not impersonate or act as if you are a member of the Avicus staff".&nbsp;</b>With this, I would like to ask you, why does the majority of the server says things like: "Don't hackusate in chat, do /report instead" or "Don't swear" if they aren't even mods, I admit I've done this and I already stopped but I need to know if I'm right or not.<br>Help?</span>

I don't think telling someone to "use /report" is considered impersonating staff. I'm pretty sure that rule is aimed towards people who say "Stop hacking or I will ban you." or pretend that they have full staff permissions and such.

Impersonate is basically saying "I am a Admin, do as I say" whilst you're not.

Then I think it should be highlighted in the rules.

If you say "do not accuse others of hacking" or "Please use /report", that isn't impersonating staff.<br><br>Like pelp said, impersonating is when you pretend that you are a staff member, saying that you'll ban them or something like that.

What about threatening the person that you have a mod friend who'll get them banned?<br><br>Does that fall under the impersonation category?

Chances seem limited, so I would doubt it. I've seen it happen multiple times on various servers.

I wouldn't recommend saying anything like that. I wouldn't be surprised if some staff punish for it.

That's practically "scamming", since you are just trying to scare them, and you are lying.

Then you should just get your "moderator friend" to actually come on and observe the rules breaker instead of saying that you have a moderator friend.

As everyone said, if you are trying to pretend that you are a staff, that is impersonating. I think it should say in the rules because I think some people don't know that.

As most people have already said, saying "I am an admin, I will ban you." Is not allowed, since it is staff impersonation.<br><br>On the other hand, saying things such as "Please do not hackusate." And other things along that line are allowed. Players are allowed to tell people the rules. There is a fine line between staff impersonation and trying to help our players in general. But most of the players, including me, that try enforce the rules do not intend to act as staff, but just to help out the server.
