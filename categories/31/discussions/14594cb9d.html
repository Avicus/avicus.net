I have two infractions.......both which I don't agree with. I already discussed the first one, but the second I did not. <span>Cinnamoncroc gave me a warning for hackusating. I was definitely calling hacks in the chat, but in this case the person DID hack. I reported him, and even they admitted they had hacks. I asked the person to leave the server but would not agree. I tried to get more people to report to call&nbsp;more attention.They were banned later, but I don't want these infractions to count against me. Is there a certain amount of infractions for a perm ban?<br><br></span>

Hello, PSul!&nbsp;<br><br>Now, accusing others of hacks in chat is strictly&nbsp;<i>not&nbsp;</i>permitted, under&nbsp;<i>any</i> circumstances. The reason of this is because if the suspected hacker actually is hacking, you can cause them to turn off their hacks, and we don't want that! We want to punish the hackers! Just keep silent in game, and use /report! If a staff member does not answer your report in game, file an online report located in the "Player Reports" tab on the lefthand side of the forums. if you believe you were falsely punished, you may email support@avicus.net regarding the issue. :)

Even if the person&nbsp;<b>was</b> hacking, it's against the rules to accuse other players of hacking, or telling others to report someone. But, if you do believe your punishment was unjust, as Snow said, contact support@avicus.net.
