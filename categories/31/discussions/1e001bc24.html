Hello Everyone,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am here to ask a question which I haven't asked for a couple of months but what happened to avicus. It got so inactive lately?

not lately. Around about 1 year ago, avicus dropped its population to 150 average, then we went even lower then that to 70-100 average, and then it was like 5 average now its like 70-80 average. This mainly was caused by issues with the staff team and like glitches in game. Also the omega update made avicus go rip, well partially.

^What he said, hopefully ATLAS will fix some of the issues, and there will be more of a reason to play. I still wish prestiges or something like it would come back, but it doesn't seem like it is ;c

Nope, this was before we got famous. We were like every other server, we only had 30 dedicated players until we released Walls, which was what made us famous.

HG came after walls, unless HG was there at the same time as factions. If I'm correct, it went from factions (old school factions OP), to walls (where you typed in the ip and it instantly put you in a walls game) to your own individual lobby where it was Walls and SG and Skywars (maybe something else? idk), then the sandstone lobby with the secret room you had to parkour to below. The list goes on and on after that, but I mean, I don't think HG/SG was around til the indivudual lobby.

I think Atlas will be revive the competitive spirit with new gamemodes, however anything such as 1.9 will completely destroy the player count.<br><br>Besides we're rising again, just slowly. :)
