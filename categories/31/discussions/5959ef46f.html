Hey guys, I recently thought of a great idea where very week on a Saturday I will put a question in a post that you answer (Don't use to much personal info, and remember you don't HAVE to answer) .&nbsp; So this weeks question is:<br><br><h1><b>What has been the scariest moment of your life so far?</b></h1><br><br><b>M</b>y answer:<br><br>I was staying in Turkey with my brother and sister, in the same room in the summer. Me and my brother are lying in bed when all of a sudden my sister comes in and turns on the light. I lay for a bit, looking round the room. My brother was staring at me. He suddenly has fear in his eyes, and starts to scream. My sister screams to. They run out of the room. I leap out of my bed and over my brothers bed as fast as I could, to save my life. I have never been so scared. Turns out my brother thought I had been possessed by the devil and I had demon eyes. (kden)<br><br>Tl;Dr<br>&nbsp;Brother and sister scared of my eyes, I get scared to, scariest moment of my life.

Scariest moment of my life? Having a&nbsp;Spontaneous Pneumothorax while attempting to walk home by myself. I ended up fainting in a bus stop on the side of the road and then walked back to school to get help... not exactly the best day of my life and every breath hurt. Pretty scary being by yourself and having no clue why it's hard to breath and your chest hurts. Luckily within a month my lung had expanded and I was all better!<br><br>E: Whats happened to my beautiful skin! I seem to have a white head...

Oh how convenient, last night I had the scariest time ever. Was laying down thinking about life when suddenly the vent started airing out, well air. I wouldn't have minded it if it didn't sound like a bloody ghost constantly breathing out "<i>Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah</i>."&nbsp;<br>After a few minutes it stopped and then I heard a squeak as if somebody was stepping on the ground near my bed (which happens on a nightly basis) so then I start freaking out a little. I continue on trying to sleep when for no flipping reason I hear a loud "CLINK!" as if a spoon moved from within a cup. In my mind I was legitimately freaking out, because in my computer area there was no spoon or metal that could have made that sound. As if on cue the vent and foot steps sounds start happening right after the 'clink'. I reach for a nearby Ipad and start watching some Huahwi when 'IT' happened. No more internet...Which left me to listen to the terrifying sounds. Luckily I had my 3DS by me so I could play Loz Oot but I ended up staying up til 5 because of it.
