Hello guys! Iv'e been having some issues lately while playing on the wonderful walls server! Here's how my problem goes down: My friends and I were sky basing and we were pretty determined to win. having full iron, we felt pretty stacked. Then all of a sudden I get knocked off! The walls didn't even drop! Is this against the rules? I'm quite discouraged, this has happened about 2 more times after this incident. Please can we make this a rule?<br><br>- thank you, hope this concerns some of u avid walls players :D<br><br>p.s: is this the right category??

If you were shot off, that already isn't allowed. ^-^

Ok here is what you do, say you are recording this wall match. &nbsp;So if someone is attempting to pull a fast one, you have it "on tape". &nbsp;Or you could really record the match just in case. &nbsp;HOMIE OUT!

Oh sorry Midnightbeats! I was shot off by arrows! Of course some guy was using magical powers and threw me off my base!
