^<br>Out of the 4 unique seasons; summer, autumn, winter and spring, which one is your favourite and why? :)<br><br>For me, overall i think i enjoy summer the most (closely followed by spring) because (In Australia, where i live) it is consistently warm and i feel more free, like i can stay inside and be cool or just run outside and jump in the pool and hang out with friends, not to mention the long school break..<br><br>But what about you guys? Every season has its features :)

I love winter &lt;3<br>Because sometimes I convert into illuminati seeing my window if it's going to snow fall, but it never snows ;l So I am illuminati, so I love winter! Okay...

I really don't care. In Hawaii, the tempature range is basically 60F-90F all year long. The only time I feel Winter is in the Fresh Produce area in Costco xP.

Winter, the days when you get up for school and it's icy cold but there's no wind are awesome, and also all the good sports start! Spring and Autumn are okay but summer is just too hot for me.

There are no seasons where I live. The weather changes all the time. Last summer, it was mainly foggy and all sunshine in the winter. I'd say fall/autumn though, when on occasion it's really windy but the sun is still shining and the leaves fall. c:

Well in Minnesnota there are only three seasons: winter. (Dec- Mar), pre-construction season (Apr-July), and construction season (Aug-Nov). So I would say pre-construction season, because I love rain and I love to listen to rain storms and thunder really entrigues me. I also love the smell of Rain!
