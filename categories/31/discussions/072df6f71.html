Hey guys, i guess this is a question for both mods and the general public, but anyways, I've been remembering some of the old maps from past times, like Halycon, Volcano (i think its called) and a few others, but the thing is, i actually KNOW why most of the old maps are gone, like Halycon had to go from similarity with an OCN map, but anyway why exactly did Mystic disappear, i really liked that map, and it just vanished without &nbsp;trace, so if anyone knows why please comment<br>- Thanks - OPTOBAT

I think they were removed because an Avicus player didn't make Mystic, Volcano and Fantasy the server payed Hyperscale to make them. <br>@JK Ravaged was removed because the map maker wanted the map for another server.

They were removed because they played poorly. We made several tweaks to improve them, but they didn't quite work.<br><br>Ravaged was removed because a secondary author submitted it without consent of the first and the first didn't like that it was submitted here, so it was removed.

Most maps are being removed due to gameplay or copyright from OCN.

Volcano, Mystic and Fantasy offered poor gameplay/were rushed quite easily (we don't want 5 seconds long matches).<br>Halcyon was removed due to it being too similar to Dynamo from OCN.<br>Ravaged was removed due to it being submitted to our forums without the permission of the first (and main, I suppose) author.<br>Teres and Wasteland were recently removed because they didn't offer the best gameplay (Teres having these OP bows and matches being just unbalanced) and Wasteland having complicated gameplay with just one monument.

Tell me why we can't just fix the maps instead of removing them from the rots and never putting them back in?

I'm saying that if you remove a map from the rots just because of some flaw in it, why not fix it and keep it? I mean if there is an issue with the map wouldn't you find it when it's first submitted or during testing?&nbsp;<br><br>Just like when we asked why Nexus was so late. "Lack of maps". You already had maps, but they just needed to be improved to fit the standards. It's like when you buy a really good computer, then over time new parts and accessories come out. Are you gonna trash your PC, hard drive and everything, just to spend $3,000 for another one? Honestly I wouldn't. I'd just upgrade what I think needs to be updated with new parts to save me a mountain of cash. If you have a map that people have once enjoyed, do you want to just take it away and spend loads of time working on a new one to replace it? Or you can spend literally less than 3 days fixing it up to appeal to the interests of players.

Actually not much people enjoy the maps removed, so they're out. If we ever find a way to make them "better", we will add them back.
