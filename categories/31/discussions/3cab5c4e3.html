I think a really good idea would be to let non-staff help with threads which break the rules.<br><br>So I thought maybe being able to report spammy threads could help the forums be under control even more (not that they aren't already). Then the staff could look at it and then it would be easier for them to lock threads.<br><br>Do you like this idea? Just a suggestion because sometimes there are so many duplicate threads (i especially get annoyed when someone copies my original post), i just want the thread to be locked!<br><br>It could be a sub-topic under REPORT THREADS.<br><br>The only problem would be people spamming it. But there are always spammers :(

1. You can take a screenshot for evidence and post in the report section if you think someone is breaking the rules in the forums.<br>2. There aren't too many posts in the forums per hour so catching rule breakers here is easy.<br>3. I'm going to talk to Ivy about this, maybe he is already doing it.<br>Thanks for the post!

That or a report button on each thread itself, and we could see all of them. That would be amazing!

Can't you already do this?<br><br>As in [online] reporting the player that made the thread and explain how the thread is not appropriate for the forums with a link to the thread?

You can report threads right now using the "Player Reports" tab. All you have to do is link the original thread in your report. However, I think a separate tab for this would be nice. It'll make things more organized. I really do not think this is necessary, though. One tab for reports would suffice.

What would differentiate "Player reports" and "Thread Reports"? I mean sure, one would be for reporting players and the other for reporting threads. They both serve the same purposed, and it isn't difficult to link the thread in a post...<br><br>Besides, having too many opinions on a particular thread could be chaotic.

Ok I get it now. But it would be nice for player reports and 'thread reports' to be merged? So you can do all the things you could on a separate threads report but on player reports.

If I understood correctly, wouldn't that be equivalent to not changing anything, and just reporting threads in the "Player Reports" section? Or just name the subtopic to "Reports".

Maybe a tag system like the one at the team section. Instead of free Agent and so, Server and Website?

I think that a "Flag" button should be put next to the original post of a thread so it can be clicked to show it has been reported as inappropriate for the forums.<br><br>Edit: Basically, a report button.

Yes I see your point. Just as&nbsp;<b>@Straightened</b> said. So for spam, inappropriate, bump etc.?<br>Cool.
