Hi, I was just looking through some videos, and I saw one on Avicus which was played on the map "Halcyon".<br>I was just wondering, why was it removed? Was the gameplay not good? Were there other maps that replaced it?<br><br>Thanks,<br>-Porky.

I really didn't like the gameplay that much because off the very limited iron and diamond plus the monuments were really close to spawn which caused really long matches.

It was removed due to it being too similar with an Overcast map. I've been trying to contact said OCN author, but I haven't had any luck with that so far.

If you contact him successfully, and he gives permission, will it be added back? This was one of the best maps in my opinion. Great for PvP, rushing, and defending.

I agree with this. I found myself knocking way too many people into the void, and I found myself getting knocked out of the world too :P<br><br>This map is also easily kill-farmable if a coordinated team rush is set up, so making the paths bigger and removing the diamond would probably be better.<br>I really do hope this map gets added back in. It was one of my favorites as well :)

Diamond armor doesn't really make that much of a difference in this map, since you can easily knock people off. Some say that it's hard to get to the monuments because it's right next to spawn, but perhaps you bridged from the wrong place. Why not bridge from the top of their spawn?
