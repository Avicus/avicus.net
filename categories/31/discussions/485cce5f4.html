*sigh*<br>You still did it... it's your fault for not reading the rules or making attempt to try and find them. It was even plastered on the forum to not publicly accuse players of hacking and a rule is a rule, regardless of if you read them or not. As for accusing players of hacking, the player may realize they've been caught and turn it off trying to be "sneaky" and saying someone hacks globally will potentially make them turn it off due to suspicion of them being recorded or caught by staff. If you wish to appeal an infraction, please email support@avicus.net with your username and a little appeal message.<br><br>Read the rules here at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://avicus.net/rules">https://avicus.net/rules</a>.

You kind of accused the player of hacking, and last time I checked, accusing people of hacks in chat is against the rules.. :P
