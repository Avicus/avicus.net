Hiya everyone, I don't recall a forum thread of "Role Models", so I decided to make one! Title explains it's self. <br><br>So who is your <b>Role Model</b>&nbsp;in Avicus? :D

There's been a thread for "Avicus Idol," "Who you look up to in Avicus," and "Avicus Inspiration.." Lol. But anyways.<br><br>I look up to <b><i>Evocal</i></b><i></i> because he always seems open to others, he's very genuine, works hard, creates amazing maps, and isn't afraid to speak up. He is quite active in the community and is very friendly to new players and old friends :)

There's only one person I look up to, this person has shown character, priority and inspiration.&nbsp;<br>Who is this person?&nbsp;<br><b><i><u>Jozz. '<br></u></i></b><i><u></u></i><u></u>Hands down, Best Moderator Ever. He is the only one who has ever responded to my reports and told me to give me a nice feeling. Not once, not twice, not thrice, but flipping 12 times. Seriously, how is he not Sr. Mod yet?&nbsp;<br>Every time we play together with some other people, he always "brb's" to go check on reports.&nbsp;<b></b>His gameplay is less important than reports. That shows massive character. His strength as a Mod is really showcased as he responds to reports and tells the reporter!&nbsp;<br>Always and forever,<br>#JozzforSrmod

Hayden. He is the most inspirational person I've met on Avicus. He was one of the people that helped me the most to stop playing MC, and start making the most of my life. I've always looked up to Hayden, and he's made me a better person. ily Hayden &lt;3

It has to be jozzmcozz. He is one of the most dedicated and friendliest mods. Every couple of minutes he says "brb got to check on reports". He is one of the few mods that ever respond to my reports and he is always there as a friendly help. If anyone ever deserves senior mod it has to be jozz. He is never too serious or too immature.<br><br>He seems to have the inability to loose his cool, no matter what the situation which is something most of us lack. He is also a fantastic player, both amazing at pvp and helpful to team mates.&nbsp;<br><br>Because of this, it has to be jozz.

Im going to have to disagree/agree with everyone here.<br>Jozz is IMO the most active mod, but that isnt all that it takes to meet the requirements for Sr.moderator.<br>But besides that, jozz told me something the other day that broke me apart.<br>Im not allowed to share what it is, but for that reason, I look up to him.<br>I remember way back when, he ALWAYS looked up to me.<br>I was like his mother or something, and I watched him flourish, he then overcame me in both PVP and moderating.<br>And now I look up to him<br>He also motivates me, non stop, 24/7

Ugh shut up, this isnt the "who do you like" thread its "who do you look up to" and if nobody looks upto you &nbsp;begging for votes and being some annoying parasite to a thread will not help. Nobody dislikes you, but nobody looks up to you because you havnt done anything that makes people want to. Most people listed in this thread are staff and those that are not are either very skilled people who have shown off their skill to he person saying them or they are people that have helped that specific person with some problem.&nbsp;<br><br>@gibbo thanks :)<br><br>@OP i dont have anyone on avicus that i look up to, but for my life i look up to Rami Ismail. Hes an independent games developer with company Vlambeer, a two man company, and he has done more to help the gamin world than anyone else i can think of. He created the Indie mega booth and still helps run it, he is a massive activist against sexism and against all forms of discrimination both in the games scene and in life. You can check him out on twitter @tha_rami.&nbsp;<br>One thing i also love about him is that he is dedicated to his fans. He will answer basically any question that he can, respond to tweets, and he has an ask.fm account which he answers many questions on daily. He has shown me a lot of ways that the world can be improved, and had private conversations with me on some of it, and he is what made me the activist person i am today.<br><br>@australia and their bs refugee crap that they are doing: Holy hell stop (sorry for offtopic but what the hell australia)

Nobody dislikes you, but nobody looks up to you because you havnt done anything that makes people want to. Most people listed in this thread are staff and those that are not are either very skilled people who have shown off their skill to he person saying them or they are people that have helped that specific person with some problem.&nbsp;<br><br>@gibbo thanks :)<br><br>@OP i dont have anyone on avicus that i look up to, but for my life i look up to Rami Ismail. Hes an independent games developer with company Vlambeer, a two man company, and he has done more to help the gamin world than anyone else i can think of. He created the Indie mega booth and still helps run it, he is a massive activist against sexism and against all forms of discrimination both in the games scene and in life. You can check him out on twitter @tha_rami.&nbsp;<br>One thing i also love about him is that he is dedicated to his fans. He will answer basically any question that he can, respond to tweets, and he has an ask.fm account which he answers many questions on daily. He has shown me a lot of ways that the world can be improved, and had private conversations with me on some of it, and he is what made me the activist person i am today.<br><br>@australia and their bs refugee crap that they are doing: Holy hell stop (sorry for offtopic but what the hell australia)

No one at all.<br>Half of the community disgusts me through their bias towards the regulars and hate towards others. If a random posts a post explaining why they disagree in a ranty way it's guaranteed a response of "don't start a flame war". If a regular does it people say "lol" and other things.<br><br>After hearing what some of the higher up moderators do and seeing what I do I lost pretty much all respect for the staff team here, excluding some staff members I've talked to.

I'd have to liisstt.... Iz, LuckyTiger, Crazy_Clownz, Boss,&nbsp;Killerbye&nbsp;and Pinkyice. There's most likely more I'm not thinking of but its late. These guys taught me that pvp wasn't all just about killing people who would rage and try to get back at you for deaths. Grace_Starshard was the one that introduced me to MCZone which actually got me into pvp so I gotta add her into there as well. Nitai for being one of the few people my age that plays on the server and being so friendly. And xcrunner67. That guy is the sole reason why I became an above average archer/sniper to begin with. I wanted to be as good as he was.

"<b>Just because someone has a shiny banhammer and authority, doesn't mean I have to look up to them</b>"<br><br><b></b>Well that "shiny banhammer" keeps this server running smoothly, it allows normal players like yourself to enjoy a hacker free game. No you don't HAVE to look up to them, but it's not a bad thing to do. Mods take hours out of their own free time to help out this server. I think that's something worth looking up to.

"<b>Just because someone has a shiny banhammer and authority, doesn't mean I have to look up to them</b>"<br><br><b></b>Well that "shiny banhammer" keeps this server running smoothly, it allows normal players like yourself to enjoy a hacker free game. No you don't HAVE to look up to them, but it's not a bad thing to do. Mods take hours out of their own free time to help out this server. I think that's something worth looking up to.

To be quite honest, about half of the games I'm in, there is a hacker. The last time I saw them banned, with my own eyes? Today, xPokemonMaster. Before that, 10 days. (Technically 3 days, but I was out for a week on vacation.)Either I'm joining all of the wrong games. (I play on MC Zone servers a lot, not sure if that is a reason.), or I'm not seeing banhammers go swing.

I look up to princezz_dubstep a lot because of how kind she is to the community! Although we only talk a bit on Skype she always makes you feel like you guys have been friends for a while. I hope some day I will be as nice and selfless as she is &lt;3
