Hey Guys, I really need your advice.<br><br>So, I have this massive spot on my arm which is hurting me like crazy.<br><br>So, I don´t know what to do, since, If I go Downstairs to get something, they´ll probably tell me off for being awake so late(nearly 3 in the morning here), and i don´t know what to do.<br><br>The only thing that i have on my room that can help me out is A bit of water and Skittles.<br><br><b>PLEASE HELP, IT HURTS A TON</b>

Tell them there's pus. That is a surefire sign something is wrong.<br><br>"Just go downstairs," would be the best answer.

Scream. If they don't listen, keep screaming until they meet your demands.

Eh, wouldn't say that is the best idea but if your parents don't want to help you about your injury I would call 911... Ask for an ambulance to bring you to the emergency, when you tell them your injury say that your parents wouldn't want to listen to you because you were grounded... It's not reason to ignore your son, if you believe it's getting really bad I do recommend calling 911 for medical attention unless you live near a walk in clinic, then walk outside and walk over to that clinic, they should be open 24/7.
