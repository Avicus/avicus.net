So, I have been doing some thinking.... What would you like to see? Would you like to see a community event where we do a UHC? Both community and staff would take part and it will be mixed teams. Depending on how many people take part, we can have teams of 2 up to about 20? (Remember this is a work in progress so give your suggestions.) We want to do what you would like to see. So tell us &lt;3<br><br>-Ya boi tel

Random teams is a good idea, as it'll force players to work with people they normally wouldn't team with but I think now and then, players should be able to pick the teams.

An event would be cool! But earlier today when I was playing elimination I had an idea of uhc as a gamemode for elimination? :O Can it be pls? I heard elimination was going to removed, I dont want that. So just improve it with more gamemodes like uhc, and possibly merge it with survival games?!?

Random teams would just mean awkward silence. Give people like a week in advance to rally a set number of team mates so everyone is able to enjoy themselves.<br><br>Nothing worse than being randomly placed on a team where everyone is silent but you :c

I think random because Sethskye says, some teams could be too OP and for people who aren't on teamSpeak (like me) could feel unincluded in the challenge. I think 4 players to a team if they have to be picked

Mmm, I think this is a great idea, BUT we need to have sign ups. Skype or some way to talk efficiently and privatley is a NEED, and people who can't do that can be on special teams.

Yes, add a UHC gamemode, but give everyone compasses after ~30 minutes.

That would make finding players a bit too easy...<br>Maybe a shrinking world boarder? This would force players to get closer to each other without ruining the fun of running into them by accident.

Just a question, how would this work? Would it be a minigame on the server? Do you keep playing non-stop until one person/team left? Would it be it be a certain amount of time a day?

Avicus is starting to look like Badlion and OCN, I like it even thought I don't play OCN because I'm banned.<br>I think this UHC should be made and you should add some plugins into it like for example, if someone logs of or times out, then he can join again (If he hasn't died nor the UHC has ended). Also, you should put a time-line 1 week before the UHC.<br>But.. now talking about the communication, if we let people choose their team, probably, their would be a big army full of people in TS, but.. if we make random teams, there would be a silence in every Skype call, TS room, etc so you should find an answer for this.

I feel people like me would get not that good teammates and we would lose fast, so we should definitely randomly assign teams.

I personally don't like chosen teams, it can turn out to be unfair most of the time like others have stated before.

Right so I guess we will do random teams and we will put all the names of players attending in a document and then pair them up to decide the teams. Other gamemodes will be implemented such as "SLAAAAAAAAAAAAVVVVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEMAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRKEEEEEEEEEET" :P

Would this be hosted on Avicus, or on an external server?

Survival except with no natural regen. In order to regain health you either need to make regen, health pots or eat golden apples.

I like the idea of a UHC. To make it more interesting I think instead of default world generation have a map with custom terrain, structures, biomes. Just to make things more interesting. :)

The idea of having random villages with villagers w/ custom trades sounds nice. Like trade 20 gold or something for 3 gold apples.

This sounds like a really good idea. I think that the best way to do an ultra hardcore would be to install a mod that creates clans and you can add people to a clan. That is just my personal opinion, but I think that clans would be the best option so you could know who is on what team.<br><br>Here is a link to a clan mod incase you are wondering..<br>link:&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/simpleclans/">http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/simpleclans/</a>

Maybe a poll on the Forums, where you can join/create your own custom group of four players?
