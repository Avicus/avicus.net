Where is Ivy, or any mod currently incharge of Avicus, the server needs to go through maintenance, many players are unable to login due to lag and bad connection, these connection and glitch issues should be addressed Asap, or else the player count will start decreasing.

Well, as I saw from other posts, people are rarely able to login once or twice a day and are struggling to login, So this is serious for the server to continue, Idk if these posts are spam but the more the community complains, the faster the mods will have to come up with the solution

The problem here is that Ivy is too busy or doesnt notice the server is down which is why it goes down for hours which is not good for business so to speak. Just another reason why a dev is needed.

Because there's a button that you can click and all the lag is automatically solved. The staff are aware of this issue, I'm sure the map devs are working their hardest but ivy is inactive -.-

The problem is not that " The staff" knows about it - "this is spam". The problem is " No official Sticky Post on the State of Avicus from someone that matters. The Hub goes up the hub goes down, no post... We lose lots of players over a long period of time, no post. We are not updated to accept 1.8 clients , no post, we got game modes that dont work correctly, servers that are off line, and a huge lack of communication, and people are posting about it. Thats whats going on. Spam would be posting the same thing over and over "AFTER" an official statement from someone above that of a Mod. This problem is not going away, saying its spam is useless and just like "spamming" wont solve the problem, doing nothing and being silent wont fix it either.

Polar, Please calm down :c, the staff knows but they can't do anything about it since they are NOT a dev. And with 3 devs it still isn't enough,they cannot fix the server lag, and they all have personal lives so they can't work 24/7 on the gamemodes. And to end off Ivy is the only person who can fix server lag (which hasn't really showed unless its timing out ever 3 hours). But Ivy has a life. From what I understand he is going to college/university next year so he can't dedicate 24/7 or even 12/7 since he has work to do. 11th and 12th grade are the most important grades of someones life since that is when they choose what career they will go through and live with the rest of their life. So please calm down and get suck in all of the info I put up there. The staff are not here to help with gamemodes, and server lag. They are here to prevent the community from breaking apart and for the server to die in a hole cause of hackers.

Avicus has put itself in a deadlock type situation. Avicus has one developer. They need more, but they don't have enough money to pay for more developers, unless they want to work for free. When they had the money to do these things, they didn't use it wisely to spend on developers.&nbsp;<br><br>So now what?

erm, yes you do .-. We can rant all we want but it won't bring ivy back this instant to fix the server lag, it won't get the only dev who can actually work with the gamemodes fix the gamemodes right now. All we can do is wait and hope. That is why everyone is getting mad. Because a lot of people do not get the point that making these posts are useless and are just spamming the forums. Because these posts&nbsp;<b>DO NOT</b> help in any way, shape or form.

The posts help people deal with the fact that they could be losing a server they love. Posting and venting is helpful.

I care if people spam because I am an active forum user... I am active every day. And why contact avicus support? then you are just spamming the senior mods + email adress where people appeal. If people are sending the glitch's and everything to the email then many people's appeals would be lost. I know there is a site for appeals but I don't have it right now. I will leave now cause I see no one can change your point. But one last thing. If people are posting about the fact that they could lose a server they love everyone willl be really stressed out, spamming the mods if the server actually going to go down therefore putting more stress on the staff then they need. And by telling people to stop is not spam since people are gonna be reading it and will learn <b>NOT&nbsp;</b>to post it.

While I do find you, Polar, at times impatient and slightly over-dramatic, there is no questioning your love or dedication to the server. I do think most of your points are indeed valid however the sad reality is that these threads indeed do serve no help and this is why:<br><br>Ivy, who is the only person that can deal with the major issues, rarely visits the forums anymore so he probably won't even see these threads anyway. The only people that do see them is the staff and players and since neither of them can do anything really in relation to the big problems outlined, it is pointless and fustrating for everyone to see this threads as we know we are unable to do anything to help.&nbsp;<br><br>That said, I have been told the high staff are looking for developers perferably for free so they are not being idle. It is really a matter of either, looking our for potential devs yourself I.e taking it into your own hands, or just being patient and riding this rocky journey out but making the same thread over and over again is not the solution

<br>No matter what position you take, if you on the forums typing, and defending one view or the other ( or even worse - no view because that's the type of person you are,lol ), your not playing the game, and most of us are not playing on Avicus because Avicus drops us, or laggs us, or the server hub is down, and yet no one is communication apart from us. So say what you will. but the facts are what they are.

<br>No matter what position you take, if you on the forums typing, and defending one view or the other ( or even worse - no view because that's the type of person you are,lol ), your not playing the game, and most of us are not playing on Avicus because Avicus drops us, or laggs us, or the server hub is down, and yet no one is communication apart from us. So say what you will. but the facts are what they are.

Polar, what exactly are you accomplishing? Sure, the server needs maintenance. Whats your suggestion on how to solve it?&nbsp;<br>(And don't just say Ivy and Devs need to fix it.)

Avicus needs a serious adjustment. &nbsp;Other servers don't get the over complicated problems that this one gets. &nbsp;We have just one dev where the server isn't even his priority anymore. &nbsp;The reason for spam is because there is no definitive answer for the issues. &nbsp;Everyone got other things to worry about. &nbsp;Someone needs to look at all of this and say 'We need to change some things around here.' &nbsp;So I agree there is a constant spam of this but there's a reason for the spam. &nbsp;You can deflect any comments over 'there's no one ever on the server', or 'there is serious lag issues' &nbsp;but just saying 'stop complaining about it' only makes people free will to speak their minds that more harder. &nbsp;I know there busy but like I said, a <b>definitive</b> statement that issues are being worked on,<b>&nbsp;</b>not answers saying 'Don't worry about it.'

The posts help people deal with the fact that they could be losing a server they love. Posting and venting is helpful. The fact that you "Think" it is not is just an opinion, and you are welcome to have it, but you in now way should say they have no impact. And to Suggest they stop is also just Spam, because it does <b>not help anything</b>. &nbsp;Also, why do you care if people spam? This is not your server, your not a Mod, and your just here like most of us saying what is on your mind. I hope more people speak their mind. &nbsp;I hope people are going to the &nbsp;Contact Avicus link and sending info there. I hope people are doing whatever they feel is correct to Help the server stay alive.&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://avicus.net/support#contact">http://avicus.net/support#contact</a>

i have to agree with vlad. the spam is unecessary and is not, contrary to popular belief, helping anything. at all. telling people to stop spamming is not really doing any damage, but it's telling them that they shouldn't be doing that. spam clogs up the forums, people can't see the actual important posts. when there are like 20 posts on the page that just say "avicus is dying!!11!" and not saying what to do, it's not helping. telling people to "send info on what to do" is a waste of time and also spams the staff.. the staff know what to do, and they're doing it. change takes time.<br>and your argument that "you're not a mod!" is also stupid, they're telling people that spam isn't good, not punishing them for it and regulating it.<br><br>you can't just "say stopp the lagg!!" and try to create little protests. i'm not saying all is fine, but i'm saying you don't know that the staff are in fact working.

I have no thoughts on how to fix it. All I know is it needs fixed. I am not the one that was making all the money off of the server when it was doing well, but I am one that donated.

hahahahahaha<br>okay so first off, you say i should get off my high horse, and yet you're the one who, throughout this comment, complains about me donating. some people are less fortunate and can't afford that, so thank you for that! really helps.<br><br>saying that someone cannot support a server if they haven't donated is one of the funniest things i have read. there are literally so many things you can do from just playing a few games to making maps to talking on the forums to applying for staff. just to name a few. i'm not saying that these topics aren't important, i'm saying that there shouldn't be so goddamn many of them. they're all the same. they all begin the same and they all end the same. i know that they're trying to fix the server because <b>i read the posts that staff make</b>. i have read posts like this where the staff replied stating that lag fixing is in the works. updates are in the works. there are posts that say that there are new minigames coming. instead of bugging the staff about adding new maps or making surveys that are obviously aimed towards the staff trying to get them to speed up the process are useless. besides, it's an unspoken truth that a lot of people who donate just want the perks. would you have donated 50$ to help the server?? think about that.<br><br>tl;dr: get off of your high horse.

actually, surprise! you don't have to be a donator to tell people they're annoying and are duplicating posts.<br><br>not saying you have a problem with supporting, i'm saying you are being very rude and judgmental to people less fortunate than you. not saying i am, but if someone can't donate, you don't have to come down on them. common sense.&nbsp;<br><br>i don't know what the best thing to do is. i'm just a player. but stop acting like you're higher than everyone else. just stop, it's tiring. it's a minecraft server, we'll move on from this, you just have to be patient and not bug the staff. if you bug them, they're less likely to do this. you're just worsening the state of the community by doing these things, and so are contributing to this.

Avicus is just fine. Ivy is in high school , and when your in high school you know how to get things done. Avicus has more money than it knows what to do with. Avicus is going to be rocking awesome player numbers really really soon. Don't worry about anything at all, just log in on Saturdays , forget through the week , no one is on anyway, so set Saturdays as Avicus day. Just remember the direct logins , as the hub will most likely be off line.
