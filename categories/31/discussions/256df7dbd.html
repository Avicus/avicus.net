I&nbsp;bought Emerald Rank&nbsp;a little while ago. I have played for like an hour and a half on the server and it still wont recognize me as a Emerald member. I do not know what to do.&nbsp;What&nbsp;info should I give you guys to get it?

Ranks take their time to arrive. Your Emerald rank should be arriving in 2 days or less, if it doesn't arrive after 2 days, you can email support@avicus.net or contact a Sr. Staff Member via Skype.<br>Keep in mind you should also have the mail confirming your purchase, so you can use it as proof just in case something goes wrong.

It can take a while to get. I've donated to other servers and it took 3 hours once.

When I bought my Emerald rank, it was receive it instantly. &nbsp;But I have heard of other users having troubles receiving their ranks. &nbsp;So just be patient and listen to what Gray said.

Actually it is easy to do.... Because it's automatic..... Sometimes it takes a while to process.... And sometimes it gets stuck, and that's when a person has to fix it. That's why some people get their rank instantly, and some don't. &nbsp;Most of the time It automatically appears.

Looks like you mistyped your username. It gave the rank to a non-existent "michb222000".
