I still have no idea what we can and cannot do. I like cross teaming so knowing what isn't allowed would be nice. Thanks!

From what i heard you can "cross-team" e.g build houses with friends from other team etc as long as it doesn't give advantage for any team. thats what i heard recently dont quote me on this since im not entirely sure

I'm personally fine with it if there is less then 10 players on a server and majority of the players are fine with it. If not, then I give everyone a verbal warning to stop cross teaming; I also give a verbal warning to stop when there is more players that are joining.

You're letting down your team and helping the other team. Even though we are a tight community, the whole factor is to beat the other team, each round. Therefore, cross teaming totally ruins the game factor.

You state you are personally fine with it which is a problem. You are kind of blatantly saying that you are fine with players breaking the rules if there are minimal players on. I understand that you may think its okay but its against the rules

Yes ik, but sometimes there is a server with only 5 members on and they all are building houses, however, I always warn them that when a random person comes and join, to stop it. Some players do not have access to a scrim server like others.

I can agree with this actually, no point trying to be that typical just trying to fight my own side person. Your argument makes perfect sense. It was because we have never had a problem with it in the pass and it is just abit of fun. Again it was all situational and as much as the logic seems weird their's a lot more sense to it at the time then there seems.<br><br>As i said though i can agree this can just make it sound confusing, i'm going to bring it up in sr staff chat and get a more firm grip on what we allow and do not i'll ideally get it posted here after.<br>Thanks &lt;3

It'd be nice if, before cross teaming, we could get a verbal warn. As you said, every situation is unique and we'd like to know if we are breaking the rules before getting punished. Make it so when a player appeals the punishment regarding cross teaming that if he wasn't given a verbal warn the punishment must be appealed. I'm saying this on a player's perspective, one that enjoys cross teaming but would like not to get punished. It'd be very useful.

If by cross teaming you mean helping the other team to win by breaking apart your own defenses or blocking off your own teammates, that should not be allowed.<br><br>But I don't think somebody should be punished for not attacking a certain player, they're not really actively helping the other team win. And building houses together is no real harm either, is it? You can say you're not helping your team by doing that, but if that's the problem then wouldn't building houses altogether need to be banned? I don't think being a productive teammate has to be <i>required.&nbsp;</i><br><br>They'd probably be attacked while building houses together anyways. It seems like a dumb thing to punish for.
