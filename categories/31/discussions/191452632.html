<h3>Atlas Updates<br></h3><h3><span style=" font-weight: 300;">CTF, scoreboxes, wools, objectives and monuments have been completed. The map devs are hard at work to translate over to the XML code for maps, as well as helping to make maps for our new gamemodes. The map developers are making departments to help organize themselves. Testing servers will be made soon, once more progress has been made on the update. Keep updated with the updates on our revisions page.&nbsp;</span></h3><ul>

</ul>

<h3>Mentoring Returns<br><span style=" font-weight: 300;">We have re-added mentor to help with junior moderators.

<h3>Possible server partnership</h3>

<p>Avicus could possibly be pairing up with another server network in order to strengthen the two communities. More on this will be released soon. Avicus will not be merging, but rather they will be organising&nbsp; events, and connecting to their communities. </p>
