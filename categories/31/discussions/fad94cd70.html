If you've been a long-time player of Avicus, shouldn't you know the forums are not a place to make an appeal?&nbsp;<br><br>Send an email to appeal at&nbsp;<b>support@avicus.net</b>

Wow  you donated O.o A really good reason for being unbanned :O I would suggest to write that is another appeal email. Then you would get unbanned! I wish you luck. Another good thing to get unbanned is sending the same email every hour, to make sure that the email don't get lost and they will see your email. Good luck. Edit: Another forum post would be good too, then the staff see, that you want to get unbanned. :)

Just be patient. It takes them some time to reply. Making a topic about it won't really speed it up. If anything, it might decrease your chances of getting unbanned.<br><br>Another thing I noticed is you saying you donated and thats why you should be unbanned. Thats just wrong. If a player donated, that has nothing to do if they break rules. Doesn't matter if you are Gold or Diamond or just a normal non.ranked user. The chances and rules are the same.
