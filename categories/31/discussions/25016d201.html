ok so i said hax after someone killed me i never said there name or anything but i still get a waring i am starting to think that some of the new staff are abusing there commands so /warn /kick but the person that warned me was [Removed] and i dont understand why i got a warning for saying hax i know you can get a warning for saying mrme hax or something like that but not for saying hax like EVERYBODY ELSE. i cri because i am probley gonna be banned soon becuase im getting warning left right and center when im doing what normal players do.&nbsp;<br><br>Mrme2298&nbsp;<br><br>p.s. this will be sent to support.avicus.co.uk or something like that

Do not publicly accuse players are hacking. Straight from the rules

Just because everyone else does it doesn't mean you should.<br>As cole said, publicly accusing players of hacking in global chat isn't allowed. What you said was very closely related to that. Always use /report.

Are you going to make a forum post every time you get warned?<br><br>It takes like 3 pages of infractions to get a least a tempban(depending on the infractions)<br>and you only had received a few warns.You are far from even getting a tempban for excessive infractions.

Accusing other of hacking in public is not allowed, hence you got warned<br>Please do not make forum posts for every infraction you get. People explained you why you got warned, however you keep saying "all I saied was hax". Thats' exactly your mistake, you called hacks in public, which is NOT allowed.

Accusing others of hacking is against the rules.<br>Even if you didn't specify who you thought was using hacks, you still should not hackusate in chat.<br><br>"All I said was hax"&nbsp;<br>That is a punishable offense. <br>I suggest you re-read the rules so you know in the future.<br><br>Also, if you think someone is hacking, you can use /report and a moderator will come and deal with it eventually.<br>Even though you might know this already, it appears you need reminding.<br><br>One more thing, every time you get an infraction, you post it on the forums. <br>Please stop this habit.<br>Send an appeal or contact support.<br><br>The community is fed up with your whiny threads about your infractions.
