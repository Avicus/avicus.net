Right, seeing that I've been asked multiple times in-game why was I demoted, I decided to make a thread about it. First off, obviously I was demoted. Did I deserve it? Yes. In recent weeks, I took my rank for granted, acted immature. I wasn't working at a high enough standard to be representing Avicus. For those who don't know, I was demoted for immaturity and rudeness. Right now I'm regretting it. If you didn't know already, I am MrExecutive_, I am extremely grateful for the chance to be able to serve Avicus with the background I had. And to blow it the way I did really hits me. People trusted me, forgave me and believed in me. Thank you for everything guys &lt;3. (I'm not leaving Avicus) If you have any questions just post below.

I don't know what happened but I agree the incident on OCN was also&nbsp;immature&nbsp;but I have left it behind me and I believe in you, as I said on Skype. I would say you learned a lesson, don't f*ck it up when people count on you and you will do great&nbsp;:)

Do I think you deserved it? Yes. The way you acted on TeamSpeak that time was below Moderator standard. Even when I told you to stop you continued. Putting that aside, I may be willing to forgive you if I see a change in attitude.
