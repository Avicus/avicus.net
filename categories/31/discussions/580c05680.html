<div><span><b>Introduce yourself (4 or more sentences)</b> Hello, my name is Koja. My name is Kochan irl and I live in Manhattan, NYC. I have been in the staff team for about 6 months. I am half Japanese, half American so I travel to Japan a couple times a year.

</span></div><div><span><b>What are your hobbies?</b> My hobbies include photography and playing music. I play piano and drums, and I play jazz in the school band. I also do art (making prints as well as graphic design).

</span></div><div><span><b>What are you most excited/obsessed over at the moment?</b>  &nbsp;I'm excited to make new maps and to hopefully make the map dev team active in fixing bugs and adding new maps to the rotations.

</span><span style="color: rgb(37, 0, 49); font-family: Whitney, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  "><b>What interests you the most in life?</b></span><span> I'm also looking forward to the school year (I guess) even though I have terrible classes the first quarter &gt;.&gt;

</span></div><div><span><b>What music/art/media do you like?</b> I like listening to all kinda of music. I listen to a lot of R&amp;B, Jazz and pop. As for art, I like old photography, especially of NYC.

</span></div><div><span><b>Where are you from?</b> I am born and raised in NYC. My dad is from Long Island and my mom is from Japan

</span></div><div><span><b>What’s your favourite thing about moderating?</b> My favourite thing is helping people, whether that means showing them how to submit a map, or getting rid of hackers.

</span></div><div><span><b>What’s your most memorable experience as a moderator?</b> Damn there are so many. I guess one would be when a chat spamming hacker came on, where there were about 30 accounts just spamming the chat all at once. It was just PieZ and I so we just had to keep banning and banning lol.

</span></div><div><span>P.S. I'll put a link to some of my photography and a video of me playing drums if you are interested</span></div>
