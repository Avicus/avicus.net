Title says it all; the implementation of BBCode and signatures.<br><br>BBCode is a way that makes formatting forum posts much richer.<br><br>For example, you could make text larger with [size=200]Large Text[/size], or make things in colors like [color=red]Red[/color] or to make hidden text to prevent spoilers.<br><br>Also, I'd like to see signatures implemented to give everyone just a small flair.<br><br>Opinions?

The thing with signatures is that they occupy a lot of space, but it's not a bad suggestion.

+1 to bbcode, but i think markdown would be nicer<br>-1 to signatures, they're a little pointless and spammy

If BBCode was ever implemented, I'd easily be able to make a guide towards it c:<br><br>But I'm not too sure with the signatures idea. Some players may put in excessively large images or even inappropriate ones in theirs, and there is no current messaging system on the website to advise them to remove such content if we have no other way of contact to them, so that could make things sketchy.

I'd say BBCode is probably a good idea, considering the friendliness use to it and the fact it's, like, everywhere on forums and websites. Sometimes I'd like to put emphasis on something or make posts more detailed like for importance, but it ends up not being as good as what BBCode could do.&nbsp;<br><br>About signatures, I think that isn't exactly something necessary.

Signatures would be cool if they didn't take up much space.

Signatures are a bit spammy, IMO. Especially when the posts are shorter than the signatures or the person posts a lot on one topic. They don't really seem useful.

I like the signature idea. Better way to let people know who you are.

Maybe for BBCode, no for sigs.<br><br>I'm pretty sure the concept of a custom forum rather than using a pre-made software rather than MyBB or XenForo is because we don't need all the extra shit that MyBB comes with, because it's a small Minecraft forum.<br><br>Maybe to BBCode, but our current&nbsp;WYSIWYG is pretty good already.<br><br>Sigs would take up space and ruin the simplicity of the forum, so no.

BBCode could be good, but signatures are a tremendously huge -1
