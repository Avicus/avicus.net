Hello&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;I wanted to share my person top 5 favorite DTM maps, most of these are classics and have been on the server for a very long time. Also, remember that this is just my opinion so please do not hate on me for liking a certain map you may not like. Lastly, fill free to comment below your personal favorites. I also apologize for some grammar errors that you might see since I'm writing this late at night.<br><br><br><br><br><b>5. Frostbite<br></b><br>There are so many things I like about this map, it may be because I love where the monuments are placed and that it can be good for rushing or defending. I personally prefer maps with the availability to have iron or diamond gear due to defending being easier so it does make me like the map a lot more, I also think the tree is a really nice touch.<br><br><br><b>4. Dust Devils&nbsp;<br></b><br>Many people love this map and also some hate it, however I personally think this map is great, it is a decent size, I like the mountains surrounding the map, I also like to defend and like how it's at a nice place making it easy to defend even though it's annoying sometimes for rushers, depending on how many players are participating in the match<br><br><br><b>3. Quintus&nbsp;<br></b><br>Some of the longest games ever have been played on this map, it's truly a fun map for when I'm both defending or rushing, it's perfect sized, love where the monuments are located and I just everything about this map<br><br><br><b>2. Halcyon&nbsp;<br></b><br>Everything about this map is just great, the size is good and it's also a good overall gameplay. I find it really fun to defend on this one, like the other maps on this list<br><br><br><b>1. Rendezvous&nbsp;<br></b><br><br>I've never ever heard anyone say bad things about this map, it's just amazing, the gameplay is great, the monuments are at a great location that's all I can really say it's a great classic map that almost anyone loves, what else can I say&nbsp;<br><br>In conclusion, most of the maps are fantastic and these 5 maps are my overall favorite maps to play on, although my description on why I like these maps are a little brief, you can still see at least one reason why I like these maps. Please comment below on your top 5!&nbsp;<br><br><br><b></b><br><br><br><b></b>

I dont like maps because of Nostalgia. But many of the old maps have basic concepts which often provide good gameplay, nowadays it is harder to find a good playing map which has a different layout than older maps
