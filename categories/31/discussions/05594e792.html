If your email has not been replied to in about a week, I'd recommend you appeal again. Emails can be easily lost.<br><br>Staff members will not pardon you due to a forum post. It's how the system here works.<br>

You have received 3 infractions for hacking, chances are at least 1 of them was right.<br><br>E-mail support@avicus.net to appeal, or contact a manager on Skype.

The staff can't just ban you on the spot with no proof unless they saw you in game. So just get Gill's or Ben's Skype and ask if they have proof of you hacking. If they saw you hacking in game that could just be a mistake. But now if they proof they can ban you on the spot once they see it. So I would just ask them for the proof...
