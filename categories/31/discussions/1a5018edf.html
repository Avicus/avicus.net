I really think that server owners should get together and make an agreement , like for instance...<br><br>A regular on OCN gets temp banned for trolling and comes to Avicus and trolls and doesn't get banned. <br><br>Servers should united against unlawful players. May be an agreement can be made for example, if a player gets banned on lets say a server that is united with this server and comes to this server he or should get banned. It sounds harsh but unlawful players should learn that they cant just come to a server and do the same crap over and over again.<br><br>Post down below on what other things that Servers that are United can do too help.<br><br>Think of it as the UN of Minecraft or the EU of Minecraft.

There is a thing called fish bans.<br>I'm not 100% sure how it works, but if you report someone that's been breaking a rules and report them to fish bans, that player will be banned on a ton of other servers too.<br><br>Don't quote me on that though.

No thanks, there are a bunch of servers avicus players as well as I hack on some times or grief on, if so we would get banned on other servers too if that would happen which we like. Hacking/griefing on another server doesn't mean we will automatically do it on other servers as well, it depends which servers you like.

yeah, i think once you're known as a staff member on a server to ppl, you shouldn't be breaking the rules on other servers... and you shouldn't even if you're not known because ppl might come on to avicus and be like "woah hey that mod was the one that broke all those rules on my server..."

Yeah man, its an awesome, justified idea and I'm pretty sure this does happen with small chains and webs with servers, where people get banned for whatever reason on one server, and word gets around through the servers, so that the player continues the punishment on other servers, to prevent further bs.<br>Awesome idea though, there should be like an official uniting between more servers kind of thing :)<br>+1, great idea!

I don't like it. If people want to play the game, then let them play it. You can't take away a persons right to have fun just because they went around causing chaos on other servers that have little to no relation to each other. It's more or less a server choice rather than what actually has to happen. If you want to ban someone who hasn't done anything on&nbsp;<i>your&nbsp;</i>server, go right ahead.&nbsp;<br><br>Like I said, keep in mind that this is a game. We're not a server relatively based off of competition (until the tournament). It's not our affairs, therefore I think it'd be pointless to get involved.<br><br>This all being said, I can think of a few exceptions:<br>A) Player key loggers/account hackers. Those should be banned simply for the safety of a server.<br>B) Advertisers. Essentially, these aren't people who want to play the game. They want attention through taking advantage of other servers.&nbsp;<br><br>Thats really all from me. I'm not discouraging us from doing this but I think it's just kind of silly.

I agree 100% with you in everything said except for the advertisers and the keyloggers, not every person advertising a server or sending keyloggers &nbsp;doesn't play the game, they're more likely people that just need more players in their server because of the lack of members in the respective server or because he/she just wants the server to be known by more people, now, with the keyloggers, all they do is bad things as with the things they get from the keylogger, all they do with them is ruin the crap out of them so basically, this isn't the way to bring people to the server as they're taking advantage from another community to benefit theirselves, this is not fair at all so a ban should be made on every server except for the server being advertised, now the keyloggers.. not much to say, they're just bad to everyone so a ban in every server should be fair aswell just for the security and safety of each user.

Btw thats such a bad idea...<br>If someone saw you on a server hacking and then a staff member on Avicus they are going to automatically assume we have hackers as staff.

What if someone was banned wrongly for something they didn't do? Would they get banned on both servers as well?

Some players really do not care for certain servers, which is why they would hack. However, they may care about another server and stay clean on it.<br><br>It just seems like this system wouldn't really work.

-1. Personally, i used to hack on Mineplex &nbsp;a lot (before they had the anti-cheat update). I dont want to be banned on a server that sort of become part of my life just couse i was making 9 year old cry on a crapy server with lazy devs and horrible pay-to-become mods. &nbsp;<br><br>Porky (above me) sort of explains what i mean.<br>Further more, lets say OCN and Avicus make this sort of agreement. Now OCN can ban every body who plays on Avicus from their server, and all those people cant play on Avicus any more.
