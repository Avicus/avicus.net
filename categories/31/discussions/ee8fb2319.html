Ok I have a question and so you know this is not an appeal I just have to know about how it works. So I got four day temp ban for profanity and yet as you can see in the photos below everyone else gets 1 day or a few hours ban. Now since this was a forums report there must be a video and I would ask if possible if I could see it just to know what I did wrong. When I was in game me CrafterPete and MLGPorky were fooling around in chat not being mean to anyone else but as joke towards each other. Anyway if any staff could comment below with the reason why mine ban was 4 days would be very helpful and if you could send me the video thanks.<br>-99<br>Just some examples<br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Ua3m6Rh.jpg%5B/IMG%5D" alt=""><img src="http://i.imgur.com/QXzuegx.jpg%5B/IMG%5D" alt="">

Punishments vary on the level of how badly you were breaking the rules. Also, you could get a longer tempban if you had been punished for the same reason before, thus fairly receiving a longer punishment the next time.

I am not trying to make a big deal here or anything but, he wasn't saying much, and you got someone nice like himself, and you temp ban him for 4 days? Now, you guys may know this guy DRmom678 and he is the true definition of profanity. All of his infractions are profanity and caps and things like that, and he is WAY worse than 99250, yet DRmom678's longest temp ban was only for 2 hours. I don't understand.

Darn, I hate it when unfair things like this happen ):<br>Maybe the mod was in a good mood or it was a different mod than the one who punished 99 and (s)he felt like profanity wasn't that big of a deal. I don't know, I hope the mods didn't intend to treat this person unfairly... Also, what exactly did 99250 say and what was the situation? Let's try to be mature and use this as information, not just a bad thing to say.

I think I left when this happened, though by the looks of what we were doing and stuff were not that bad enough to result in a<br>4 day temp ban.

What he's trying to say is that if you've broken the rules multiple times, you'll get punished longer because the mods are concerned if you're punished for the same length each time, you'll just get back on break the rules, be banned again, repeat.&nbsp;<br>Also, if you're <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o12NFK3WB0M">badly breaking the rules</a>, you're punishment will be longer than if you're not breaking the rules as badly. Example: if someone says "F*ck" in chat, they might get a short ban. If someone spams "F*CK YOU" in chat, they'll get a longer ban because they were acting more severely and being worse than the person who only cussed once.

Weren't you making a strip club? That is not appropriate on avicus because we try to keep the community clean for all ages. It really depends on whoever punished you and how bad they thought it was. I may of only temp banned them because they said a few vulgar things compared to something else.

If you're being immature to that kind of level then you should be temporally banned for a few days in my opinion.<br>Maybe a staff meeting should be in order so that all staff deal the exact same punishments?

Well tbh i feel bad for you guys because the punishment is just really unjust and harsh. I didnt see anything what's wrong with the pics that you've posted and also what have you guys done with "profanity" that you were temp banned for 4 days. There are many others out there who are even using unpleasant words including those people who are cursing one another or cursing themselves that weren't temp banned for 4 days or more. This punishment is bullcrap no offence

First of all, when was this a damn strip club? Plus, 4 damn days for this little amount of profanity. Like, damn.<br><br><b><i><u></u>EDIT:<u></u></i></b><i>&nbsp;</i>So, let me get this straight. So, you temp ban me and a few others for profanity while we were just making a base that wasn't even supposed to be a strip club, the only thing that involved profanity about what we were doing is the fact that we had to keep our leather pants off, which really shouldn't result in a 4 day temp ban. BUT, you would only temp ban this one kid DRmom678 for only 2 damn hours and he did much MUCH more that what we did. This is completely stupid. I understand that different moderators have different feelings on what punishments they gave they should give to someone, but this is just stupid. This is not an appeal, but I hope you can understand.

He is one of the strictest, I agree! But it does teach people a lesson thou like if he bans someone for 1 month, they will learn their lesson, ask for an appeal...

I have emailed support@avicus.net and sent the same message to AviGill on Skype last night hopeful I get a response. Even if I don't get unbanned I hope to get the ban removed from my infractions.

To be honest, for all the people saying it depends on whether the mod is in a good mood or not, most staff don't give punishments depending on their mood. For example, if I'm happy IRL and someone is hacking I'm not going to tempban them instead of perm banning them. Same goes for most infractions. Also, Emerald may have a different opinion on what the punishment should be for profanity.

The moderators shouldn't have certain feelings on what certain punishment should be given to some one for what they have done. Say some one repeatedly spams "F*ck" in chat and a moderator feels that it is necessary to temp ban that person for only 1 day. Someone could also spam "f*ck" and a different moderator will feel that it is necessary to permanent ban that player. That is unfair, and is basically what is going on now. There need to be specific punishments for what people do, not what the moderator feels should happen.

I agree. We need a strict set of punishments for every mod to follow.<br>Here is another example. I report someone for hacking on the forums. Nolan decides to perma-ban person. Then I post another report for hacking of the same kind, and alex decides to temp-ban 1 month. If we had a strict set of punishments, then no one would get lucky because they got a lenient moderator. Or no one would get unlucky because they got a strict moderator.<br>(not trying to bash alex, he is cool.)

We aren't robots.... I went on this server where mods were forced to enforce rules that were discriminating to people who weren't English and so I would not enforce those rules. We are human beings so we do have our own opinions but maybe a bit more clear template of how we should punish is in order.

Well, we aren't telling you to ban Spanish people. But the sign didn't say any thing about a strip club. (Although I will admit, Kool Kids Klub was a bit offensive.) Plus, do you really think 99250 is worse than some of the swearers you have seen before?

I will have to disagree with you. Before Avicore, I rarely saw a curse word since it would not let them do it, so people did not bother cursing. Now, people are free to curse as long as they want until a mod comes. Why cant we have that old system back, it will be just as effective if we have that and if mods could enforce.&nbsp;<br><br><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/c7NJRa2.gif">
