<div>Have the streamers been trained? By that I mean, do they know what an skybridge is and how they work. Do they understand how certain things can make a defense better. Do they understand how pushes are organized. And do they know how mainly pvp works.</div><div><br></div><div>Have the streamers also been taught how to talk properly with a good flow, meanwhile at the same time keep it interesting and make some kind of advertisement for avicus at the same time?</div>

Easier said than done, considering no-one on Avicus is experienced with professional commentating.<br>However I do agree with you, this can be nothing but beneficial for Avicus as a whole.

To be honest, I was more wishing the first part would be more "considered".

I think the commentating part is more just having people who are experienced, I commentate but I am still learning. even though i'm still learning, i'm WAY better at commentating then when i started, its just a matter of doing it and getting experience.<br><br>I do agree with the first part, i was gonna volunteer for media but i'm clueless when it comes to CTW and i'm still green on DTM.

I can help cast the games if someone wants, but I need to learn what a skybridge is first.

Streamers need to be able to follow a match and know what to follow and what is important to stream.
