I think gameplay is the first concern, but of course, aesthetics is important too, you just can have a 200*200 dirt platform and place it as a map, you need to have somewhat pleasing and acceptable aesthetics and good, useful terraforming

aesthetics are in the eye of the beholder, but everyone can say what is good gameplay unless you don't know how to play. It should be gameplay then&nbsp;aesthetics are an added bonus

I've seen Cow say that they put gameplay before looks.<br><br>Keep in mind though that, that doesn't mean you can ignore how a map looks. IMO Aesthetics are just as important and it is possible to have a good looking map that plays well.

Gameplay is really the first concern? Then how come when we posted our Coliseum map Everybody said "More Aesthetics and bad gameplay" even though it has GREAT gameplay. Why don't we have like these "Map Testers" Who play the updated map and actually check for Appealing Gameplay?

From my experience as a multi-server map maker I have seen that not only gameplay and aesthetics are needed, but also some of the following things.<br><br><ul><li>Size</li><li>Lag (as in stained glass and stuff like that)</li><li>Height</li><li>Land, void, and height area</li><li>Mobility (not that many decoration fences)</li><li>Theme relation (No random or weird appealing maps)</li></ul>

just because gameplay &gt; aesthetics doesn't &nbsp;give people an excuse to start making terrible looking maps. Coliseum was pretty badly designed as many people pointed out and lacked a lot of debth and detail. It needs to fill in both things well and since it might have only filled in the Gameplay and not aesthetics then thats why people were telling you

They do.. but maps that are frankly just ugly, are not fun to play on. For example, your coliseum map (not saying its ugly) does not really feel like a coliseum so the players won't get into it or have that much interest in it as opposed to a really detailed accurate colluseum map.<br><br>Its all about the experience why playing on the maps and aesthetics is a big part of that .
