Don't give me all this EULA bullshit like it's still even existant anymore. If avicus needs money, add more donor perks, as far as I can see diamond and emerald are complete rip offs.

I agree with this. There really isn't anything special about the donor ranks, apart from a fancy tag.

Regardless of your personal opinion on it, The Avicus Network abides by EULA's policy. <br>That's a closed case, so we need to keep that in mind when discussing perks.<br><br>I do agree though, that we need to increase the appeal of our perks.&nbsp;<br>Now, how we're going to do that is a much harder question to answer.

What would be cool is if players can buy "armor" for use only in the lobby. Maybe have regulars able to buy dyed leather armor with credits while donators have access to all types of armor. Basically, some fancy clothes for the lobby. Plugin-wise, you would need to make it so that players do not lose their armor after the lobby restarts. The gold chestplate from completing parkour would be an incentive for non-donators. However, we don't want some full diamond people running around so, I suggest having only helmets and boots as options for donor perks.<br><div><br></div>

Lol all ranks are rip offs now.<br>Gold &amp; emerald are a certain amount of months only.<br>Not worth purchasing any of the ranks. But if needed tbh diamond is worth the most.<br>In a year diamond &amp; emerald have the same amount that you pay but diamond has more perks (barely) and you still have to pay more after that year.<br>Gold is simply bad. In a year you pay $10 more than emerald &amp; diamond and it has the smallest amount of perks.

I don't know, but I heard myself it was scrapped and to be honest it's common sense. When they got bought by Microsoft I heard in the subreddit that Mojang wanted to reinstate it, but when you're bought out by a billion dollar company you have to make rearrangements and they never got around to it and eventually people were saying it was dropped and was swept to the side due to no updates, and they aren't enforcing it in the first place and won't for a long time, if ever.

I agree.<br><br>The ranks right now are awful, in my opinion. Credit boost is cool, ended chest slots is kind of useless since nobody needs that many, the TS channel is ok since lots of people go there sometimes, joining full teams isn't really even athing anymore.<br><br>I don't really have ideas for this, but I support it,

When Microsoft bought mojang, mojang's EULA idea was never passed, thats why larger servers that are pay 2 win are still doing what they have been doing for years. EULA was scrapped as he said. :P

- Whatever we currently have<br>- Kits (small ones that don't completely destroy gameplay, but just make it a little more interesting)<br>- Exclusive tags, badges, trails, and other cosmetics that only donors have access to (overall just higher quantity of cosmetics, some of which would only be available to donors.)<br>- The ability to use any colour on signs (why not, it'd be neat)<br>- When you first get the rank, you get&nbsp;<i>x</i> amount of credits. Ex. Gold would get 1500 credits upon first entering the server, Emerald would get 2500, Diamond would get 4000. Of course these numbers could change, but it's an idea.<br>- Talk in chat with colours (Lobby only)<br>~ An alternative to this is to have the option to talk in one colour all the time. (Diamond would have access to all colours other than dark, unreadable colours, while the other 2 have access to less). That way, we don't have people that talk in those unreadable colours. Idk, that can be figured out.<br>- Have the option to have a different colour name (Ex. Diamond players have access to all colours other than dark blue, black, and other unreadable colours, while the other 2 ranks have access to less. This would be lobby-only)<br><br>There's been discussion about some other ideas for donors, so I won't mention those. Some of the ideas that people have given here are also rather neat, and I'd love to see some of those ideas implemented as well.

Just no colours. Colours in chat and in names are confusing, annoying for the eye and makes the server look unprofessional.
