Everyday on this server, I see people raging in chat "HAX0R U N00B GET A LIFE BAN BAN BAN BAN BAN STAFFFFF MEMEBBER COM TOO ME ME ME ME" and when a staff member takes their time to come and check on what you're reporting about, usually no one's hacking, but even if they are, the staff punishes them and still not a single thank you from the player.<br><br>Or here on the forums, more recently with Storm and Robo's demotion.<br><br>I was sad too, as Storm was a good friend of mine and even though I didn't talk to Robo much he was a good person and a great staff member.<br><br>Now, most of us have reacted in "Why was he demoted? Tell us!!!". That is personal information that only will be shared if the demoted staff allow it to.<br><br>They were demoted for a reason. Avicus has amazing staff and wouldn't demote out of randomness.<br><br>So, anyway, I'd like to say, for all of Avicus and it's players,<br><br><b>Thank you, Avicus Staff, for your hard work to keep this server healthy.<br></b><br><b></b><b></b><i>-Zach</i>

You can go to the <i>Teams</i> section of the forums (Under "Community" in the left Navigation bar) where you can make a forum post, which will then create your team essentially.<br><br>On Topic: The staff team is incredible on this server, better than any other server I've been on to.

Send an E-Mail to support@avicus.net, if they haven't responded within a week, resend it. If you somehow haven't gotten a response (even when you did resend it), contact a manger on Skype.

Try and contact a Manger on Skype, as they will help you. Appeals can get lost with the hundreds of E-mails they get, so it's very possible it could get lost.
