I'm cutting straight to the chase, there are no clear rules around what topics should be allowed and not allowed, and IMO, the moderators in general are playing it too by the books and going overboard with the locks and archives recently. An Example is Zintenka's leaving post, it was locked, yet for example, mine was actually more suggesting it'd be temporary and was more "self-centered" than his, yet his is locked and mine is left alone.&nbsp;<br><br>All I ask is chill out, like holy...play it less by the books and don't look at all those technicalities. Prestige 1 and 15 posts were allowed from my knowledge, yet they are now locked.&nbsp;<br><br>The idea is, get some actual guidelines and chill, holy fing...it feels like mods lock EVERYTHING now. Play it less by the book and try to look at the situation at hand.&nbsp;<br><br>This isn't a trash talking post, just a post for clarity and to share my opinions.

This is what I mean, it seems like from the staff perspective that threads can only be seen in one light. If someone got Cancer or had to get surgery, or if someone is leaving in general, would you lock their post for being self-centered? &nbsp;<br><br>2nd part...Let's face it, the mods have been on a locking spree for the most petty stuff and it's pissing the community off, the staff's decisions are so robotic now tbh. I'm not saying don't enforce the rules, just don't act as if the rules on the website are the equivalent of the bible, lmao.<br><br>1st part...Once again, that single-minded approach that I mentioned before, that everything has to be by the rules and black or white. I made a more self-centered leaving post and it wasn't locked, his was, first prestige threads were said to be allowed weeks ago, now are being locked. Im guessing a lot of the community is confused about this, and I wanted clarification.

<b>Did we discuss this?</b><br>Yes.<br>Therefore, @_Phyre you cannot generalise Avicus for being "unorganised" and accusing the admins of doing jack shit. IIRC, they're the hardest working staff members currently - and you obviously don't pay attention to their work...

Issue is the same as the thing with spawnkilling, every mod seems to have a different interpretation of what it is. In this case lockable or not, so I want a general outline across the board. Because there is obviously a disconnect here, how the locking all of a sudden changed without an announcement and how certain posts that deserved to be pocked didn't get locked and posts that should be.

Ah yes, regarding the spawnkilling issue... the map devs were going to add redstone to where spawnkilling would be punishable. Not sure if they are continuing this..&nbsp;<br><br>Not every moderator is a robot, and you have to agree with me on that one. You can't help it when a staff member takes their role seriously.

Yeah, I'm just saying you can take your job seriously and be non-robotic at the same time, like Juano when he was Jr. Mod. He stayed connected with the community VERY well and was chill and did his job and took it seriously. I'm not saying take back your desicions, just it is possible to do so.&nbsp;<br><br>I'm glad to hear there is some stuff being implemented to clarify boundaries. As long as the chasing back into spawn is fine, OK by me, unless you're making the coding so they can't enter that area like OCN.

Look man cut the crap. If Zinteka was making a leaving post he should have just made a leaving post. But he snubbed the staff and the community, and shit like that just ain't excusable. You dont wanna see that pop up on your forums, you dont want them to be toxic or nothing. You know why it seemed like technicalities? Why it seemed like Midnight was stretching it? He was defusing a situation which was bound to spiral out of control; you cannot just have a discussion when there is so slanted and hostile a post as that leaving post. Midnight made a very smart decision that was trying to clean up the forums. Don't criticise him for doing what he thought was best for the community just cos it was a friend's post he locked. These forums are meant to be fun; if you wanna bitch about stuff do it to the staff, cos at least then you'd be somewhat helping them solve problems, instead of whining out loud.

Tbh I've snubbed staff way harder in other post a that took way longer to get locked, he was stating an opinions, which he has every right it have. I've offered a way for the staff to help themselves, and this isn't about him, it is just a point out of many examples. Tbh, that thread was not instigating flame and was not being responded to with any negative feeling, so idk where you get this "defusing a situation that was bound to spiral out of control" when it never was in the first place and there were no signs of such happening.

We have recently (a few minutes ago) restricted locking and archiving to Senior Staff members only. Hopefully, it will help in making the forums a more relaxed and fun place. However, I'd really like if we cut down posts that reiterate what others said, especially negative ones. I'm not directing that at you, just my general opinion.

Yes, definately, thank you. I feel like there should be less negative posts, this was just for clarity and trying to let the staff help themselves. I'll take hate, I'm trying to help more than anything and a lot of people were complaining about this over skype pm and in group chats, etc. If it caused flame, it was indirect, I was trying to be more assertive and I get assertive when I feel there is something that can be improved on.

I'm usually the nice guy on this server, but today I'm not. This post is pretty silly stimulating. Seriously. Why do you just assume the mods are robots who just lock random posts? You know they lock certain discussions for certain reasons right? There are rules on this server, look at them. The moderators, and the rest of the staff have done a wonderful job managing avicus. Just think about all the great things that the mods have done for you! Some<br>mods just let flames burn forever on the forums. Don't just scream at them about locking posts. Just realize they have a purpose. There is is a support email dude. Use it to complain. Not the forums.&nbsp;<br><br>I hope you understand my concern for your actions, and for the way you are treating the wonderful staff of avicus!!

You know they lock certain discussions for certain reasons right? There are rules on this server, look at them. The moderators, and the rest of the staff have done a wonderful job managing avicus. Just think about all the great things that the mods have done for you! Some<br>mods just let flames burn forever on the forums. Don't just scream at them about locking posts. Just realize they have a purpose. There is is a support email dude. Use it to complain. Not the forums.&nbsp;<br><br>I hope you understand my concern for your actions, and for the way you are treating the wonderful staff of avicus!!

I never yelled or got butthurt, Srs are hard to reach due to their workload and I've had staff members agree that the locking is a bit too robotic and with the recent changing to locking permissions, I'm guessing they see some sense in this. I'm not assuming so either, I've seen posts locked robotically time and time again and I have reason to say so.&nbsp;<br><br>So look at the logic beind this "retarded post" before you say so, because I've had a lot of people agree, and actually I've been getting people saying so over Skype pm and in group chats countless times. So a lot of the community is apparently retarded?

Tbh I've snubbed staff way harder in other post a that took way longer to get locked, he was stating an opinions, which he has every right it have. I've offered a way for the staff to help themselves, and this isn't about him, it is just a point out of many examples. Tbh, that thread was not instigating flame and was not being responded to with any negative feeling, so idk where you get this "defusing a situation that was bound to spiral out of control" when it never was in the first place and there were no signs of such happening.

Ay bro we got different understandings on that then. It wasn't trying to instigate a flame war but shit happens man, and it was bound to happen if he hadn't locked it.

Look man cut the crap. If Zinteka was making a leaving post he should have just made a leaving post. But he snubbed the staff and the community, and shit like that just ain't excusable. You dont wanna see that pop up on your forums, you dont want them to be toxic or nothing. You know why it seemed like technicalities? Why it seemed like Midnight was stretching it? He was defusing a situation which was bound to spiral out of control; you cannot just have a discussion when there is so slanted and hostile a post as that leaving post. Midnight made a very smart decision that was trying to clean up the forums. Don't criticise him for doing what he thought was best for the community just cos it was a friend's post he locked. These forums are meant to be fun; if you wanna bitch about stuff do it to the staff, cos at least then you'd be somewhat helping them solve problems, instead of whining out loud.

I aint being logical? <br>Bro, you talkin about the staff and community in such a rude fashion wasn't needed. You was snubbing them.

I ain't telling you to lie, but some shit you should just keep to yourself.&nbsp;<br>You can be all idealistic and shit about "wanting to speak the truth" and all that stuff, I ain't gonna argue about your personal views. But the way you talked it dont seem like you cared much about other people's feelings.<br>"<span>players banned on avicus being banned on TS, robotic-like and cold mods, and the faults on the players' side is simply too much to list."<br>Tell me how that part was needed. Just say "The community wasn't welcoming and I didn't feel comfortable with the environment." If you truly wanted to say goodbye, to truly be respectful to Avicus and its community you wouldn't have been so harsh, you would've just said goodbye and been done with it.<br><br></span>
