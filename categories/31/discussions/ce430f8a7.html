So I've soon on peoples profiles that they got friends, and I couldn't find a button to request people. So adrianosborne told me they are working/developing it. Is there any date that this friend system will be back? I would really like to know tho I can't msg people 'n stuff in-game.

It might take a while because the developer of the server (IvyCode) is currently busy with his high school work. Once he gets more time he can get that on.

You could go onto the old site (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.old.avicus.net">www.old.avicus.net</a>) and friend request them there.. THen they'd have to accept from there too... But yes, it should be back soon, I hope, however I haven't heard anything regarding it lately.
