I am making this thread to clear things up with&nbsp;my time as a moderator. I have been demoted for quite a while now and I am only talking about it now because I need to get it off my chest. I am also wanting to let people know so they don't go around telling the wrong information. So here goes nothing...<br><br>When I first applied for moderating, I had really no idea what I was getting myself into. When my application went to the next stage and on to the interviews I was over the moon! During my interview I used common sense which ended up me getting the Junior Mod rank. I was so happy about this I even told my parents! At first I was taught everything I needed to know and if I had anymore questions I was to ask a fellow staff member, and that's what I tried to do as much as possible. <br><br>There were multiple times where I was the only mod on and I couldn't ban people so I had to contact someone, record the hacker and wait for the mod to arrive and ban them. I did good enough in my trial, good enough to be promoted. This is where my decline started, I just started doing things differently, and it wasn't in a good way. I pretended I couldn't record so others did and I just became lazy. So lazy that some people of the community noticed. I got a warning pretty early into my time as a moderator but for some reason I didn't really take it on board.<br><br>This shows because for the amount of time I was mod these were my infractions dealt:&nbsp;<a href="https://avicus.net/infractions?page=1&amp;staff=Tynvale" title="Link: https://avicus.net/infractions?page=1&amp;staff=Tynvale">https://avicus.net/infractions?page=1&amp;staff=Tynvale</a><br><br>I just kept declining and my life started declining too, both were just getting worse and worse. At this point I finally decided to do something and I took a leave. With this leave I hope that both my life and my moderating would improve. I hoped that I would get that spark that I had when I first become part of the staff. I didn't state a day that I was going to come back because I didn't know how long I needed.<br><br>They day I thought it was time to come back I found out I was demoted. At first the natural reaction you would get hit me and I didn't react to well to the situation. I complained, and I complained, only digging the hole I was in deeper. When I questioned my demotion I was told that it was because of inactivity, a lot of people didn't agree with it including me but I have come to the realization that being active in-game isn't being active as a mod. And this is where I messed up, I want to come back to the staff team to tie up loose ends, I understand what I have done wrong and will try my best to improve as a whole..<br><br>So the main reason I made this a public post, even if it's all about me. Was to explain everything that happened and to show that I want to something about it. Once again I am sorry that this is all about me but feel free to leave your opinions below, all I ask is that a flame war doesn't start and if it does I will archive it.

Tyn, your immense honesty has always stood out from you, and in this post it has truly shone. Despite this post, though, I honestly think you didn't do too bad of a job serving your time. You were cooperative and did very well with teamwork based punishments, IMO.

I think one of the hardest things about being a Moderator is maintaining that spark you had when you first got promoted to Junior Moderator. <br>You just get so used to being a Moderator, it becomes the norm. <br>That's why it's difficult to maintain your true passion when Moderating.<br><br>Taking a break when you did was probably a good choice Tyn. I guess it was just bad timing how all the events unfolded after that.

I think you did a great job at moderating, yes you did slack of a bit but you can learn from that.<br><br>Thanks for being honest Tyn :)
