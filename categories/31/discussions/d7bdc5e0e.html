I was playing survival and I didn't know how to do anything. I was just wondering around until night arrives. I looked at a creeper and thought it was friendly :P. I was also playing with my brother Skye (skyecool19) and I saw an enderman. I punched it and got rekt. I told him to watch out for the black guy (Not to be racist)

1) Built a little dirt hut 100 blocks away from my spawn<br>2) Got killed by a zombie<br>3) Sobbed because I didn't know where my house was<br>4) Remade a house at my spawn, after my friend told me that that was the best thing to do.<br>5) Continuously got killed by mobs<br>6) Learned that Peaceful mode exists<br>7) Learned that MC Wiki existed<br>8) Learned that Classic Minecraft existed (this, being about 4-5 months later)<br><br>Between 7 and 8, I made a giant mine, with a large staircase going down to bedrock (it was about 17 blocks wide), built a little tower with all of the blocks in Minecraft (although bear in mind that this was in Beta 1.7), and a giant mobfarm &amp; foodfarm.

1) Was on Creative mode because I didn't know that there was a survival mode<br>2) Tried to build a house in the water on a tiny island (idek) and I thought it looked really cool even though it probably looked terrible<br>3) Since it was an island and I was a nub I kept on falling into the water which would then take me ages to get out of<br>4) Once it was night I saw a island inhabited with zombies and I almost had a heart attack<br>5) Alot of times I would enter the house and see holes in the house and hear explosions but I had no idea what creepers were or that light prevents mobs from spawning, so it kept happening!<br>6) And finally, when I was done playing MC in a day's work, the next day I would try to rejoin the world but then Oh look! The map wasn't there, because I didn't know that you were supposed to save! (Then this happened again, and again, and again.)

1. Started in Minecraft PE<br><span>2. I thought I was good and then I convinced my dad to get me Minecraft for my birthday (I think he regrets this part a lot xD)<br>3. Spent about an hour trying to figure out how to place and destroy a block... And move forward (I hit random keys until I found out, I felt so happy :') Danngg I placed a dirt block!)<br>4. Messed around with my controls and eventually got used to it.. That's why I have opposite controls today :P<br>5. Watched a crap ton of Minecraft videos<br>6. Went on those Minecraft server lister websites and added a lot of random servers... <br>7. Found Skywars which lead me here :) &nbsp;</span>
