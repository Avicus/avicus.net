I know that the Bugs are being fixed and all but Its just a discussion i wanted to have on how the community thinks would help benefit the server.<br><br>And also Really? 200 Players in the Weekends? When i'm online there is 50-125 players online now(both weekdays and weekends)(Right now there is only 29 players on avicus) and If we do advertise we can have other gamemodes filled up which equals to players playing these new gamemodes which also can mean that some players can finally drift away from DTM and play a different gamemode. All we ever do is DTM and its boring.

people want every gamemode to be something different than what they've seen before with players they can harass, staff they can exploit and plugins that wont detect mods, but they don't want to get harassed or exploited or lose because someone is hacking. they'll kill their teammates and whine when their teammates kill them. they want an easy way to become staff just so they can have the power and the respect of other players. why should they play here if they can get the same thing with easier exploiting and more players and more rewards for donating elsewhere? it sucks but it's true for the most part.

People are panicking for no reason at least imo. Tbh this is majorly a kids game and since kids have school now numbers will drop people will quit and players will panic. I could see numbers rising back up in the summer and people praising it as the boon of all their hard work. However, increasing avicus' popularity can only help. The only thing I could see being done to make avicus more popular is more events, and maybe more time put into big decisions like the 1.8/1.7 debacle.

yes but also people have been saying those same arguments for a long long time. last summer the numbers didn't get better and they probably won't if we sit around saying "the numbers will get higher"

I think avicus have the money for advertising. The amount of people who have donated and i doubt it costs that much to host a server that gets 150 at peak times (from what I can see)

At least my dad is better than yours. He has been helping me grow and learn since I was born. He actually cares about me. What about your dad? Does he work tirelessly like my dad in the military (who is currently away for 10 months on a boat)?
