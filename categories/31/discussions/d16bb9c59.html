I heard swearing is allowed, but mods are punishing differently when someone swears...<br><br>If someone dies and then says Fuck, will that result in punishment?<br><br><br>what if someone is saying obnoxious immature things like "IMMA FUCK U TONITE!!1!1! WOO" would that be a punishment?<br><br>Thanks and bai

I pretty sure you're allowed to swear, as long as it's not excessive or directed at another player. Therefore the first situation shouldn't have a punishment. However, if the player said "f*ck you" to the person that shot him into the void, that would be a different case. And unless they person is spamming it in the second situation, I'm pretty sure they would just get verbally warned. Again, unless the punishment system changed, to my knowledge, this is what would happen.

Swearing shouldn't be allowed .&nbsp; If you want to swear, do it out loud or to yourself.&nbsp; You don't need to type it in the chat.&nbsp; You are telling everyone you are angry and a bad sport.&nbsp; The mods need to enforce the swearing punishments.

Swearing is tolerated as long as it is not excessive/spammed/directed at someone. Hope this helps.

Your second example would warrant at least a warning. The first one would not. Reason? The first one isn't directed at anyone and is reasonably mild. The second is directed at someone and is vulgar.&nbsp;<br><br>This is my stance on it anyway.

Swearing a few times is fine as long as you don't say it excessively or direct it at someone meanly.

I don't know. &nbsp;I really don't feel it should be moderated unless excessive or directed at another player. &nbsp;Swearing is bad, sure, but It's also unavoidable. &nbsp;Mods can't be everywhere, and its a risk you take by using da interwebs.

Swearing isn't a offence until you abuse someone. Swearing casually is allowed. Abusive swearing isn't.
