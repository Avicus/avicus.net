I recently found today a bug or something (not sure) on multiplayer and single player, where when you click f3 and b at the same time it will bring up hitboxes onto mobs,items and players, would that be allowed? since it is not a client modification or a hack, I didn't add anything to my minecraft xD<br>here is a screenshot of it<br><br><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/V5MGV0f.png"><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/9i7WSE8.png">

It's a part of vanilla Minecraft, so it's fine.

Umm, I know someone got banned for getting a hit-box hack, so I'm not sure..<br>I just wouldn't do it because it's pretty pointless and might result in trouble.

I don't see why it wouldn't be allowed. It's a part of vanilla minecraft and doesn't give any superior advantages (can't see through walls), so I'm guessing it's allowed.

This is allowed.&nbsp;<br>As long as you are not using this within a hacked client, there is no rule against it.
