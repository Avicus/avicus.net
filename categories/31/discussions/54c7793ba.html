What's up you Swedish Mountain Lions,<br><br><br>Avicus has gamemodes&nbsp;that all have a map after map after map- which we'll call the <b>Avicus Style</b> (<i>yeah I know about Lifeboat/OCN but nvm</i>)-&nbsp;which I am not at all discouraging, but what about branching out to a different style?<br><br>Whenever an SMP opens many players flock to it and spend countless hours daily just playing. Why? Well, it's because it's a break from the Avicus&nbsp;style which has become unnaturally&nbsp;tedious and extremely repetitive for many players. Yeah, I know they shortly die after a couple weeks, but imagine having a maintained gamemode&nbsp;similar to an SMP at Avicus? Lots of groups/clans/factions would form - *COUGH* <b>COMPETITIVE TEAMS </b>*COUGH* - sorry for that, I've been diagnosed with noscrimitus.<br><br>I'm hoping ideas more sophisticated than<i> "</i><i class="">uu hh hh</i><i>&nbsp;FACTIONS!!1!1!!!!11!!!</i><i>&nbsp;lololooloololololol xDDD"</i> can arise. I'm thinking a PvP team style gamemode which has exclusive perks for donator ranks, however, nothing outrageous that destroys gameplay. There are prestiges&nbsp;you can climb up&nbsp;and raids of massive fortresses or underground bunkers that are created by MapDevs and Builders which have insane loot and exclusive items in the middle for the first team/clan/faction to get. They would be huge events with pre and after parties to get more of the community involved. Some items would be banned and only accessible from those raids. I could continue for hours...<br><br>I'd really like to play something like that. Tell everyone your ideas below!<br><br><br>Peace

I'm just telling you (experience), a SMP world gets veeeeery big (file size too) and to control such a big world will be hard too, but I like the concept! +1
