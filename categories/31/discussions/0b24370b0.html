Ingigo's 'Hacks'

</h1>
Hello<br><br>I am here to tell some of Berzerk that Ingigo does not cheat.<br><br>So, on Monday evening Ingigo was scrimming for us. He was trialing and after the scrim, we screenshared him. This is our new routine when recruiting new members now and this will continue. The reason for this is because we do not want to be DQed again. I am very knowledgeable on the topic of ghost clients and therefore I was the main person screensharing Ingigo. We checked every single one of his mods in detail, and in fact, he uses 1.7.2 and there is literally no ghost clients for that version. We also checked all of his versions, and the only one that was in his Minecraft was 1.7.2 which was clean. All of this time, he was still on Avicus so therefore he could not have logged off to change anything. We made him type commands in Single Player, nothing, we checked his controls, nothing. We even checked his USBs to see if he ran his Minecraft off of a USB. The only possible ghost client he could be using is an injection client and no actual Avicus player has ever heard of one. Ingigo didn't even know why we checked his mods and shit, let alone could he be using a ghost client of that sort.<br><br>Furthermore, we checked his mouse program and all of the buttons were default which means he has no macros. He had only one profile and that was completely default which conveys the fact that he has not changed anything. Also, he had no autoclicker program on his computer and his recycle bin was not empty so he hadn't deleted anything that was in there.<br><br>Please, stop hating on him. I understand that he is really phishy on Avicus, but he is legit.<br><br>Thank you<br><br>Tazz

If anyone on Berzerk has sent messages 'harassing' him then I don't know about it, I'm pretty sure we were just curious.<br>Instead could you stop harassing Berzerk on the forums publicly? Thank you.

It's actually remarkable to think he hacks.. Nonetheless, he takes no KB on AV, and I've seen his clicking speeds with my own eyes (IKR!) and it's pretty damn mental.

Avicus seriously needs to fix their KB as well, I heard there was a plugin to fix Knockback, try that out eh Avicus or Javi, code it ^.^<br>Maximum CPS is 15, but jittering on minecraft is 13CPS as I can't do 15 constantly.

I think it's a little excruciating to be calling out all the Berzerk members when a handful of us don't think he hacks. Most members had a chat yesterday with Dan (Ingigo) when Jiphy added him to our chat briefly, however...This topic really isn't needed. And I apologize for the accusations going around from some of my team members.

Pretty sure everyone accuses players of hacking sometime in their life. I was accused for using autoclicker by Insidia when all I did was jitterclick. Nobody is perfect. Nobody knows who the hacker is. We can't somehow teleport behind the player irl, watching every move they do in-game.<br>Plus this post isn't allowed. It's just spam. You could've just contacted one of our team members to pass it on to the rest of the team. Who said we Harassed Ingi? (If one of our team members Harassed you Ingi, We are sorry).&nbsp;<br><br><br>(I'm sorry if there are some mistakes in this. I just woke up and it's 7 in the morning &gt;.&lt;)<br><br>edit: Not all of Bzrk thought he hacked. It was just a handful of players who thought he had anti KB but it was just avicus KB. When I first met him, I thought he hacked but when you get to know the player, it turns out they are just better than you.

Actually it's just because of the 1.7 compatibility, it's already fixed in 1.8+. So when we go full 1.8 (hopefully very soon) it will be entirely fixed :)
