<p>It's just sad, it's just a shame. I worked like a slave for this network for my 8 maps and a hub, and all they do is removing all the secret places I made in the hub with my heads, and putting their secrets <b></b><b>with their heads instead</b>, they could've at least adding my head to one secret.. wow.. good I got a credit for making the hub at least.</p><p><br></p><p><b>EDIT:</b> Just noticed no one has even said thank you in Skype for making a hub for them..</p>
