Heey resepignev here,<br>Well, all of you already noticed that there are many lobby secrets.<br>Maybe some of you already found/know some.<br>If you have screenshots of them post them below.<br>but make sure you don't say where the secret is so everyone can explore the hub by themself xD<br>Here are all pictures I already found.<br>I know that I didn't found all of them yet, but I think thats quite a high number of secrets.<br><br>

<p>It's just sad, it's just a shame. I worked like a slave for this network for my 8 maps and a hub, and all they do is removing all the secret places I made in the hub with my heads, and putting their secrets <b></b><b>with their heads instead</b>, they could've at least adding my head to one secret.. wow.. good I got a credit for making the hub at least.</p><p><br></p><p><b>EDIT:</b> Just noticed no one has even said thank you in Skype for making a hub for them..</p>
