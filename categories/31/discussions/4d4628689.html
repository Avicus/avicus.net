Hello Everyone!<br><br>The Seniors and I are happy to announce a new feature today that will make credits useful on a new platform, TeamSpeak!<br><br>That's right, you read that correctly, you can now use credits to create temporary channels in TS!<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/9BYrc8X.png" title="Image: http://i.imgur.com/9BYrc8X.png"><br><br>Just message the bot <b>!tempchannel&nbsp;</b>to get started. Once you run the command a second time to confirm, a channel will be created, you will moved, and be given administrator privileges in that channel.<br>These channels are set with a time limit, but have no fear, you can extend the channel up to as long as you want (at a price)!<br><br>The pricing structure is as follows:<br><br><table class="table table-striped table-bordered">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Rank</th>

<th>Creation Price</th>
<th>Initial Time&nbsp;</th>
<th>Creation Cooldown</th>
<th>Extension Cost</th><th>Extension TIme</th>

<th></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>

<td>Diamond</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>
30m
</td>
<td>3h</td>
<td>1,000</td><td>10m</td>


</tr>
<tr>

<td>Emerald</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>15m</td>
<td>3h</td>
<td>1,000</td><td>10m</td>


</tr>
<tr>

<td>Normal</td>
<td>1,000</td>
<td>10m</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>1,000</td><td>10m</td>


</tr>



























</tbody>
</table><br><b>NOTE</b>: If your rank is not listed here, you fall under the "Normal" pricing structure<br><br>We hope you enjoy,<br>Stay Tuned!

My reaction to this was "What the fuck?!"<br><br>I'm trying real hard not to be toxic but that's pretty fucking difficult after reading that, but why would people spend credits like this when:<br><br>a) They can just chill in a public channel<br>b) They can just chill in a team channel<br>c) They can just join another TS<br>d) They can just use skype instead<br><br>Can time please be spent on more useful things, IDK, like getting the playerbase over 30?

If Teamspeak had the player count it had 1.5 years ago this would work pretty well.<br>I like the idea but TS is so empty there's no point in having it at the moment.

You don't enforce team channel camping anymore. I can't believe you guys went a did an already bad idea when the only way the idea even worked slightly was when I was enforcing team channel camping.

responding to this because it's the most response I read regarding credit shopping.<br><br>You guys complain that you want better items in the shop. Maybe suggest some instead of complaining about the shop. We need your ideas to improve the shop. We can't think up of anything so maybe if everyone starts suggesting new items for shop (or donor perks that don't break Eula), we can consider them.

I agree with everyone here. Why work on a platform that no one goes on. Every time I am on TeamSpeak there is no point because there is hardly anyone on.

Which is strange, considering Discord is a very good platform that IMO combines the good of Teamspeak &amp; Slack (It's been a verrrry long time since I used slack, so I may be wrong but isnt slack a mostly text based program?) to create something beautiful.

It does lack certain features in which I will agree discord has, but switching over community slack and staff slack is unnecessary work, which most likely will lost members from the community slack.

And why not mister Moderator?<br>it has great features, oh sorry discord can't do somethings that TeamSpeak can do.&nbsp;<br>So what I think personally it's better it's Skype and TeamSpeak combines and in my opinion it's great. As you know I am currently using to host the Avicus Discord and it's going great.&nbsp;<br>Just my opinions not going hating on TeamSpeak (well I am).

This is not true. Also, Discord is a much better replacement for community slack and maybe staff slack. I don't think you've actually seen what it looks like. Why would we keep Slack, when Discord provides better and advanced features.

I couldn't care less who you are or what you've done. That plays no part in this conversation, just like how I didn't bother to share who I am or what I've done.<br><br>Actually from that single comment I&nbsp;despise you even more.
