I'm unclear on if permanent leaving posts are still allowed or whatever so if it is I do apologize and feel free to lock or whatever.<br><br>So if you haven't figured it out I am leaving. Despite the fact that I was a very quiet moderator and I doubt more than three people will care. But anyway I have decided to leave with a traditional post.&nbsp;<br><br>So my name is Matthew in real life, I started Avicus when it was still MCZone under the name Trans4rm2me. I was a quiet person and wasn't very involved with the community until later. I later joined the forums a few months later, although I wasn't very talkative person. I started making friends and two come to mind when thinking about this,&nbsp;<b></b><b>Lunax564&nbsp;</b>and&nbsp;<b>Jakesandobal</b>. These were two people I always looked to play with on the forums. Refreshing their player page to see if they were online. Jakesandobal invited me and Lunax to join his, and what I call today my, "family". With "family" referring to my clan Cacalmarin. When I first joined them in the clan I was greeted with welcoming hands and I immediately knew I was welcome there. Later on they would always support me when I applied for staff and would always comfort me when I felt down. Talking about staff though, I applied for staff twice. The first time I didn't have a working microphone so I couldn't fulfil the requirement. The second time I was interviewed by&nbsp;<b>Peachy</b>. He played a major role in helping me work my way to moderator. I also remember being assisted and mentored by&nbsp;<b>Avumbaca</b>, a fellow clan member and a really good staff member at the time. As a moderator I will admit, if you said "who is the best moderator?" to yourself I bet you my name is far from coming up. I was always there and I always would support anyone who needed help, but I was just viewed as the mod in the background. I later left the staff team for a bit until returning believing I could make time to help. But as usual I was wrong. And I had to leave the staff team and after lots of thought I have decided to write this.<br><br>Just a quick thank you.<br><br>Lunax564 - Was a good friend too me. We were welcomed to the clan together and although we are not as close as we used to be I still respect you.<br><br>Jakesandobal - Was also a good friend. Always had a joke and I always loved being around with him.<br><br>Avumbaca - You were amazing as a friend and I remember you were always supporting me in everything.<br><br>ParaSpider - Although I don't talk to you nearly as much as I used too, I still remember when we made a few maps together and that time and you were a great person to talk to.<br><br>Peachy - Helped me get to moderator and always supported me on the staff team<br><br>The Messiahs - Never forget the messiahs. ;)<br><br>Staff Team - for being staff yey<br><br>Cacalmarin - For being my family&nbsp;<br><br>kthxbai<br>~Trans4rm2me, TheServant, JolteonMessiah, Joltz_
