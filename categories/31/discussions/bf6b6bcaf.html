Hello!<br><br>So recently some unexpected changes have occurred within the staff team; I am going to clear up any confusion anyone may have and sum up what happened.<br><br><u><b>Promotions</b></u><br>&nbsp;- <i>Fouled</i> and <i>I</i> have now been given the opportunity for the <u>Manager</u> positions, as the previous Managers (Newcleus and Iron) have unfortunately retired from the staff-team; I have assumed the Community role and Fouled has assumed the Server Development role (more to be explained in the future).<br><br>- <i>Edans</i> and <i>Javipepe</i> have been promoted to <u>Senior Moderator</u>.&nbsp;<br><br>- <i>GrapeSmoothie</i> has been re-promoted to <u>Senior Moderator</u>.<br><br>- <i>VenomousViper</i> and <i>Edans</i> are now our new <u>TeamSpeak developers</u>, (following the retirements of our previous Managers).<br><br>- <i>VenomousViper</i> has been promoted to <u>Moderator</u>.&nbsp;<br><br>- <i>Sho </i>has been promoted to <u>Moderator</u>.&nbsp;<br><br><b><u>Retirements/Demotions<br></u></b>- <i>Newcleus</i> and <i>Iron</i> have retired from the&nbsp;staff team.<br><br>- <i>SirCyaniide</i> has retired from the staff team.<br><br>- <i>FrozenSolstice</i> has been demoted from the Moderator position due to inactivity.<br><br>- <i>TimaeusTestified </i>has retired from the staff team.<br><br><b><u>What's to come?<br></u></b>We are looking forward to keep making Avicus better, and you should definitely expect more changes in the near-future for just improving Avicus as a whole. We want to ensure that you the community are satisfied and we will strive to do our best to achieve proper community and staff-relations, fix server issues, acknowledge suggestions and much more.&nbsp;<br><br><i>Thank you for understanding!<br></i><br><i>~Side note~</i>&nbsp;<br><br><u>LOVE YOU TO EVERYONE WHO HAS RETIRED RECENTLY, YOU'VE ALL BEEN GREAT TO WORK WITH &lt;3.&nbsp;</u>

Have fun being expected to live up to your predecessors, no pressure. First of all don't bother with a server development Manager, it's a waste of time; instead change it to a staff, but both of you suit community so you're a bit stuck there.

you were supposed to represent the avicus network seeing as you were a higher up. look I don't know what shit goes on in your life maybe it's some personal sad stuff who knows but at least inform us in some ways - you gotta be open to the community so we can try to help you or something or at least make the situation easier (depending on what it is). <br><br>this isn't pointless crap. imo if you do decide to be staff again i don't think you should get it because you'll basically retire and do the same thing you have done twice before and avicus does not need people retiring and coming back because they're contradicting their actions.&nbsp; I am absolutely not directing any hate towards you but I know you have been good in the teamspeak side so I appreciate that.

you were supposed to represent the avicus network seeing as you were a higher up. look I don't know what shit goes on in your life maybe it's some personal sad stuff who knows but at least inform us in some ways - you gotta be open to the community so we can try to help you or something or at least make the situation easier (depending on what it is). <br><br>this isn't pointless crap. imo if you do decide to be staff again i don't think you should get it because you'll basically retire and do the same thing you have done twice before and avicus does not need people retiring and coming back because they're contradicting their actions.&nbsp; I am absolutely not directing any hate towards you but I know you have been good in the teamspeak side so I appreciate that.

No hate? Now that you realize you're wrong you're trying to play nice. I didn't have anything sad happening- I'm tired of some things going on in the staff team and Iron wanted to retire as well, so I did with him. I also have a job, school, and a life to be successful in. I'm free to retire if I want, and I was a Senior Staff member for 6 months, longer than most current staff. All of your reasons are totally wrong, as my life is my life.<br><br>Get a clue.

So then answer me this - you were tired of being in the staff team - why did you join in the first place? You should've known that from the start what you were about to take on smh.

Why you complaining that he retired, he contributed to the server and knew he would retire at one point. he came back as he wanted to help out even more and probably knew he would retire shorter then the first time but he would still be helping out the server. who knows he might come back again in the future and contribute more to avicus

Why are you trying to cause a scene out of nothing? Oh well... he retired. In fact, respect what he has contributed to the server and leave it at that.

They are starting an argument that is not needed on the forums, and can use Skype if they want to continue arguing.
