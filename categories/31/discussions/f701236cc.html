EULA Change: Experience/Leveling/Prestiging

Hey everyone! Sorry we are a little behind on the EULA changes. We are working on them as quickly as possible. A more "official" update will be posted soon enough.<br><br>For now, I have one major question to ask all of you players: <br>Would you like for there to still be leveling? <br>As of now, prestiging is purely cosmetic, and I would like for it to stay that way. This would allow donors to continue having their same perks. The only major difference would be the fact that leveling up wouldn't give you the opportunity to get kits (therefore leveling up faster is purely cosmetic). We would also add more prestiges, along with more stars and other symbols to show off.&nbsp;<br>Also, this would allow everyone to keep their current level that they worked hard to get. There would be no resetting levels, which is my ultimate goal seeing that people have put hours upon hours into getting their prestige 5.<br><br>Comment below whether you would like to keep leveling, or whether you would like for it to be tossed. Your opinions do count! So please be specific on what you want!<br><br>Thanks,&nbsp;<br>Max

Keep it<br>EDIT: (Be specific)<br>Maybe kits for all, and maybe donators could change what symbol they want for prestiges, like /symbol and words show up, like heart, smile, star.<br><br>/symbol heart<br>HoboMaddy♥: Hello<br><br>/symbol smile<br>HoboMaddy☺: Hello<br><br>/symbol star<br>HoboMaddy*: Hello

I'd recommend having kits be rewarded from a set number of kills.<br><br>Add 5 more prestiges at least. Keep the donor boosts.<br>The whole prestiging thing is pretty unique so definitely keep it around.<br><br>Just my 2 cents :P

Keep the leveling, of course; that's actually one of the things that keeps me coming back to the server. "I'll quit for the day after I level up once more in Nebula..."<br><br>And, even though I'm only a nominal first prestige, I'd love to see more added... preferably at least five more, as many players have been suggesting, bringing the total number to ten. Having a customizable prestige symbol seems like a pretty neat idea as well&nbsp;— you should definitely put that into consideration.

Hmm, Maybe to make this server stand out, Just leveling up (Like mooch said) Get at least 25 kills in a game and get awarded a 5 durability Diamond sword, with enchant such as sharpness 5... 50 kills etc.<br><br>Killstreaks! : Maybe a certain kill streak, for example, 10 kills = Potion effect Regeneration 4-5 etc. or 15 kill streak = Strength 2 for 1 minute... But its totally up to the Users to vote on and the staff if they want this :P. Good luck on EULA!

Not all kits will be available all of the time. Don't worry about that.<br><br>If we were to take away the donor bonus, then we would most likely reset levels completely because donors used their increase leveling to prestige quicker. We have an alternate system of unlocking kits being made.

Not all kits will be available all of the time. Don't worry about that.<br><br>If we were to take away the donor bonus, then we would most likely reset levels completely because donors used their increase leveling to prestige quicker. We have an alternate system of unlocking kits being made.
