Hello community, Juano here.<br>I'm making this post mainly for the amount of complaints the staff team has received since the devs released this new update called "Omega", so I'm here to clear things up and make you understand why did the developers do certain kind of stuff the community disliked.<br>First of all, I need to say the update (For me) has been great, I really like the gamemodes and the maps are awesome (Just try to start making them smaller because we're not 1000 players). The forums are awesome and easier to understand for new members so, good job devs! Now to go on, I'll explain you why you shouldn't complain about the server being fully 1.8 from now on as that's what everyone is basically complaining about.<br><br>1. 1.8 is not that bad as you think, you need to give it a try. You'll get used to it through the pass of the time and you'll understand it's mechanics and new features on how to improve your FPS/PvP strats/etc.<br>2. I was told by Peachy Avicus would be updated to 1.8 anyway so.. better to do things quick than waiting more time.<br>3. Most of the plugins were 1.8 so unless you want the majority of the new plugins we have right now to go, you'll have to deal with this version.<br><br>Those 3 reasons are enough to make you understand on why did the devs choose 1.8 for the server.<br>I hope some of you (Not everyone) understand the effort the devs put into the server, someone told me they spent over 5 months doing the update possible.<br>P,S!: Hope this is the last post regarding the server because the forums are getting spammed with hate and posts like: "OPINIONS ON THE UPDATE?". It's really annoying to see a site that's supposed to have interesting topics being full of spam.<br>That's it for this post!&nbsp;<br>Regards,<br>Juano.

<p>Well said Juano.</p><p>And you gotta know that you cannot stay in 1.7 forever, we will have to change eventually following all the other servers. :)</p><p><br></p>

Thanks for saying, but I still preferred 1.7.

Ata boi Juano! Great thread and very well thought out! It does take some time getting used to 1.8 but in sure that most of us will be able to transition smoothly.
