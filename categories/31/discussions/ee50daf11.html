Is the shop overrated?

Hello guys, i was checking the store because i was interested in donating, but i saw there is some overrated prices (for me).&nbsp;<br>I know every network owners deserve the reason of why set that prices, and sometimes we know how expensive is afford a network like this. But it think the prices are a little bit high for some latin american users.<br><br>For example, if you are mexican and want to buy the Diamond Lifetime package you have to pay <br>$89.99 (without discount) = 1800 pesos, you must be rich to spend that money in a cubes game, i mean you can buy a lot of things with these 1800 pesos. Otherwise, with the discount will be $53.99 = 1080 pesos, is still a very high amount.<br><br>I'm not here to compare networks or anything like that, but just, check this;<br>Hypixel, a 30k online players have a really accessible shop, they use Paymentwall, you can pay with any payment method and their prices are really accessibles. So to be honest it worth pay $18 - $70, and basically they are always on discount, so the prices are always like %80 off discount and the prices become to $6 - $30.<br><br>Anyways its only my opinion, if you agree or disagree just tell here and we can discuss it friendly!<br><br>-Coded

Well that's kind of a loaded question. Yes, there are prices that people may view as overpriced, but you have to look at what the money goes to. Hypixel has thousands of players buying ranks, so they don't need expensive ranks, since money keeps flowing in. <br><br>For Avicus, the ranks are more expensive, yes, and I'll be the first to admit that I'd be a little bit reluctant to spend $89.99 USD for lifetime diamond, but the fact is that the prices reflect the cost of running the server. I'm not sure if there is a good way to fix it.

They are really similars but overpriced is more like set a high price for nothing, and i mean overrated is because they set a high price because they think is the value of the perks

Perhaps they should drop the price a little, and add more features.

So why don't try to set a considerable low price to let players buy it more?, if you sell it in large quantities you can have the same winnings.

Maybe that would work, but I don't know. Prices for ranks used to be this high during early Avicus and McZone, but I do not know how much the prices affect rank purchases. In theory, cheaper ranks means more sales, but it does not always work out like that

The cost of buying a permanent rank is pretty high, but its always been the same for the last few years. Ranks don't give enough features anymore to remain the price they currently are. Should be lowered a bit or add more stuff for the ranks.

I agree, 89.99$ makes around 300 dirhams (currency in my country).<br><br>&nbsp;I can buy a decent mouse with that amount.

People are like "oh donate to the server if you want to join full games" I've donated to servers before, for useful perks, nothing here I would enjoy using.

You can its just if the player max is like 40 then like 5 donators&nbsp;can join making it 45/40. You cant join because there needs to be some form of cap to stop the server from totally over flowing

Again, this works&nbsp;<i>in theory</i>, and only to an extent. At some point the correlation of lower prices and high purchases weakens. If the prices right now can support the server (can they?), it is a risk to change it.&nbsp;<br><br>Don't get my intentions wrong, I'd like it if more people felt comfortable buying ranks, but I want to be able to see this discussion from all angles

Imo keep the prices or just lower them by ~10% but do more sales. If you advertise sales in game, more players are going to buy ranks because they always wanted one and they're cheaper for the moment.
