Alright so I have been talking to staff about a nebula tournament asking questions ect. In january I was told that they had started work on a layout for the tournament and it would be announced soon. Then I was told it would be soon after avicore was realesed and it has been quite a while since that. I'm getting bored of waiting seeing as the last avicus tournament was a year ago. This last time there was any discussion on this I was told it will be announced soon and that was almost a year ago

Hey,<br><br>Things are currently being worked on heavily by the Tournament Committee and we are starting to pick up after the inactivity. We finished the applications, appeals, map pool, information, selection, and all the other writing involved and got over a meeting yesterday on Teamspeak. The tournament will hopefully be happening soon, and we just need some time to work on it; Ivy has to release scrim servers and update the site before any of this happens. Don't pressure us, please.
