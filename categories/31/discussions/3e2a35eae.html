Rotations...?

Recently a lot of new maps are being released and I wanted to know what happens to those maps if they're accepted. Do they get added to a certain server, or do they get added to a list of random rotations? Also does each Nebula serer have it's own rotation list? If so can someone leave a list below? Thanks for the help :)

When a map is accepted it goes through a testing phase to determine whether it is worthy enough to be in the rotations (by having good gameplay and a pleasing look) or not. Once it goes through the testing phase it is put into a certain group of map rotations (Either Large, Small or MCzone, in Nebula, the rest of gamemodes have only one set of rotations). Here you can see a list of the current map rotations:&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://maps.avicus.net/maps.yml">http://maps.avicus.net/maps.yml</a>

Do the large rotations switch off with the large ones every time the server restarts?

</div>
Every time a server restarts it is given 15 maps randomly from their respective rotation lists, for instance, every time Apollo, Cronus, Icarus, Luna and Tellus restart, they are given randomly 15 maps from Large Rotations (Let's say, Justice II, Alpha Complex, Curabitur, Candyland I, Senex III, Rendezvous I, Rendezvous III, Abandoned Park I, Sandstorm, Siege, Unix, Wonderland, Yellowstone, Zao, Arizona), however, if the server restarts AGAIN they're given a random different set of maps, from the same rotation list of course, so they could end up being like this (Justice III, Siege, Diamond Shore, Haunted Hallows, Unix, Bleened Rings, Senex II, Rendezvous III, Rendezvous I, Candyland II, Abandoned Park II, Sandstorm, Wonderland, Sandstorm, Senex III).<br><br>Same happens with the rest of Nebula servers, but that with their respective rotation lists:<br>Nebula01 - Nebula07 = Small Rotations<br>MCZone01 - MCZone03 = MCZone Rotations

Yeah, I do live in Ecuador and I've always been living in here :P I've actually never gone to the US or any other countries at all. I learned English by playing videogames at a very young age and setting their default language to English, let's say I kinda self-taught it to myself :P With the occasional help of a dictionary, too...

Yeah, it is up to date (and it updates quite constantly), Windmill Plains is between Unix and Wonderland, on Large Rotations (They're organized alphabetically)
