[Suggestion] Staff get /vanish

Staff should get /vanish (Only in spectator mode or hubs), so often to me it happens when players say 'Hi Lego' when spectating. I think it would help out a lot. Please leave opinions!<br><br>-Lego :)

But then wouldn't staff members be more disconnected from the community in-game-wise than what they already are?

No, because this is only when taking reports. And, I disagree with you saying that we're "disconnected".

Oh please.<br><br>Sure some staff members camp up in their staff lounges on TS, but other than that this server has some of the friendliest and approachable staff I've seen.<br><br>They actually give a shit about you unlike other servers where they only want your money.

I think Kylo stated multiple times that /nick would be a complete pain in the ass to code (70+ hours)<br><br>Nickname plugins are easy af, but it's linking it to the Avicus chat system which is binded within the plugin.

How would the staff using /nick be like OCN exactly?&nbsp;<br><br>Many servers have a disguise command for staff when they're moderating.&nbsp;<br><br>I think /nick would be better than /vanish

I think /vanish could work. However, it would not make sense if it were to be applied to the lobby. If one used /vanish all the time for&nbsp;<i>any&nbsp;</i>occasion then moderators would get criticized more and players will feel like moderators are inactive.<br><br>@Alekpower, what is your problem? You used to be a mod and a good community member. What happened?

They'd probably only be allowed to use it when dealing with a report. Otherwise it would count as abusing.

Mods shouldn't have /vanish because then players won't know if a mod is in a room or not. /report would be used too much. I bet it has been considered and denied. Avicus is a friendly community, and eeveryone should get to see everyone. Also, /vanish doesn't just make a mod invisible, it takes their name from the game. For example, there name wont be on tab, you can type tab mid-way typing their name, and you can't msg a mod when wanting to talk to them privately. /nick would be worse, for one, msg would be more confusing without /realname, two, typing /realname then msg would take longer. and three, we would recognize some of &nbsp;the mods on the forums. Sorry mods!

/nick only changes a Moderator's name in-game, not on the forums.<br>Also, /nick should only be used temporarily when a Moderator is taking reports.&nbsp;<br><br>When a Mod isn't taking a report, they'll change back to their original name. So the confusion (if any) will only last a few minutes at the most. So you shouldn't have to worry about contacting a Moderator. Even if they are /nicked, they'll be back to normal in a few minutes.<br><br>But considering we currently don't have /vanish or /nick, you don't have to worry about it at the moment.

I know it wont change their forum names, but the difference between ign and forums name will cause confusion. Also, why put the moderators through extra work, and cause chaos for everyone else for a few minutes. Also, if I'm wrong, then everyone will know your nicks, and It will defeat the purpose.....

Doesn't put the mods trough extra work. In fact, it gives them a break l0l
