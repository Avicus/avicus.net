I've been absent for quite a while lately, and if you saw my last forum post, you'll notice I have a job. Along with that job I also have school, and track and field which is starting next week. As much as I would like to play with you guys and make everyone mad by bow spamming them, I simply do not have the time to sit down and do that lately.&nbsp;<br><br>Unfortunately for me, I won't be enjoying this server as much as I used to. You may see me on rare occasions, but not on a day-to-day basis like in the past.&nbsp;<br><br>Sees y'alls laters,<br>Shrimpy<br><br>G'bye.

Hope you have fun with your job. Once I get a job my plan is to save up for PC parts without my parents knowing, building the PC secretly then bringing them home and having them be like: "ANUUUUUUJ!!!!!!!!".
