Hey guys,<br>dodgy here :3<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So as you can see by the title I might be quitting Minecraft. I am partly doing this because we never got around to doing my interview. But I don't care about that anymore. So, tomorrow imma be doing an Avicus &amp; TeamSpeak Party, which will make me decide weather I should leave or stay.<br><br><b><i></i></b><i>When: </i>Tomorrow at 12 PM PST<br><i>Where:</i> Avicus TeamSpeak &amp; And server!<br><br>(I will also be on both right now!)<br><br>Thanks For Reading,<br>dodgy :3<br><br>(P.S. Don't make a comment saying "Don't make leaving posts"

Someone that REALLY didnt care about Avicus and would REALLY be quitting wouldn't make a post about it because he still cares about the persons on the forums and hes afraid of leaving them not knowing...<br><br>(If that makes sense)<br><br><br>:P<br><br><br>Sounds like a cool party

Im not going to say "dont make leaving posts"<br>im going to say dont make a post saying you MIGHT be leaving, thats just sounds like you're looking for attention, maybe keep that part to yourself and continue with the party?
