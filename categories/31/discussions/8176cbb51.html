Unfortunately, we have decided to cease current operations and close the Sky Wars server from the network.<br><br><i><u>Why is this?<br></u></i><b>1. </b>Low Play Counts - The server was not active enough to warrant keeping the game.<br><b>2.&nbsp;</b>Competition - The server offered substantially less than any other server with Sky Wars.<br><b>3.&nbsp;</b>Failed Monopolization - Our monopoly is objective-based games. When mixed with Sky Wars, it didn't work out.<br><b>4.&nbsp;</b>Lack of Continued Development - Sky Wars is hard to dedicate to, and the project requires a lot of work to keep it not stale.<br><br><u>What will happen to it?</u><br>It is likely that we may go with the original idea (the secondary result from the old polls) <b>to add it into Arcade</b>. However, it will be known that it will lack a lot of features and just be more of an Avicus thing mixed in to add Arcade variety. It will not go into Frenzy as a last resort to revive Frenzy, either.<br><br><u>What can I do about this?</u><br>The decision has been made, and we will not reverse it at this time. I have talked to an administrator as well as held a map developer vote, in which we all determined that the game mode would be removed.<br><br><u>What did you learn about this?</u><br>I am now head map developer, and I will advise against projects that are not priority. I will also advise against projects where the primary goal is keeping players rather than getting new ones that also keep players, because keeping players with a suggestion as such is not a long-term solution to our player count problem. We will continue further with objective-based games such as DTC and work further in that direction, which Avicus is mainly for. This doesn't mean we won't experiment with new things, however.<br><br>Other games such as Frenzy will be evaluated for player count, and whether or not anything else can be done with it.

Advertising wasn't very good in the first place, if you expect to put out a new gamemode and have it played regularly, you need something special like a double coin week on it or something to get the players started.

If you want players, your not gnna put in a game that exists on tons of other servers, especially while there's hypixel which has hundreds maybe even thousands of hours of work put into it with all its perks and kits and 4 different modes there's also mineplex and many many many other servers that have the game, what made them think that skywars was a good idea. Why would they come play on here while they could go play on a developed server... I've never understood this decision

I am not sure if I'm in personal support of Arcade. The community seems to like it but we've already added community requested games like Sky Wars, Survival Games, Arcade, and KoTH but nobody seems to rally support for it. We're pretty close to a democracy when it comes to selecting games to add.<br><br>The only issue is that Arcade didn't work the past few releases, so I'm not expecting it to do well this time considering player counts and that it's a completely different concept to the network. Other servers have the same if not completely better Arcades with stats and leaderboards and good builds meanwhile we would have a LOT of work to do if we wanted to have a good arcade.

KoTH? &nbsp;Wat KoTH? &nbsp;There is 0 (!) maps for KoTH on the server. I played them only in beta testing. Wtf? Where are they?<br>Maybe you put some into rotations? Or build some? Cause it is super strange to have gamemode and have no maps :/<br><br><i>Where is my candy?</i>

<i></i><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><i>The community consists of like 30 people.<br><br></i>I can list more that 30 active community members that I've been calling friends for a long time. I agree with most of what you said but the communities opinion is more important than any other. If the community hates the server they aren't going to stay... For a while Avicus staff have given the communities opinion very little say in anything. Look where that got us. A lot of people left because they didn't like the way Avicus was being run, not listening to the community, and just overall lack of updates. We have a new, and very good developer now and some of those will (hopefully) be dealt with soon, but until them we just need to be patient.&nbsp;<br><br>There may be different parts to Avicus, and different 'groups' of the community but in all we all are apart of this server and contribute in some way. Before Atlas there was really two "communities" within Avicus. One being the DTM/Nebula community, and the other being the Walls community. We were different, yes, but we were still all a part of the same community, the Avicus community. Most Walls player enjoys Nebula and plays it on a regular basis. There are some that don't but 90% of them do. I'm pretty sure that you were meaning that the community is small, meaning nothing with the exact number but I needed to 'rant' if you'll call it that. Lol Anyway thanks for reading! xD<i><br></i></span>

You're telling it how&nbsp;<b>you</b> see it. We still have players, so we're not done yet. If you're just going to keep being a pessimist, then take it somewhere else. It's not constructive in the slightest.
