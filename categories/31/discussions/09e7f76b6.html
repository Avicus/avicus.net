Hello!<br><br>Recently, I've been missing DTC maps, they just haven't been around and I think we should bring the gamemode back to Avicus. Your feedback is appreciated, and answering the following questions would be very helpful. From the answers, I can use them to develop maps and maybe future events can be DTC based.<br><br>1) What kind of DTC maps do you like? (DTC or DTC + DTM?)<br><br>2) Should we include TNT on our DTC maps? (This will lead us to adding diamond into the maps.)<br><br>3) For Public or Tournament? Also, how should the gamemode be reintroduced?<br><br>Thank you ! Also, please give reasoning behind you answers, and don't troll, this is a serious thread.

<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">1) What kind of DTC maps do you like? (DTC or DTC + DTM?)<br></span>It depends, i like the DTC + DTM maps with tnt, like with two monuments and the main core<br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">2) Should we include TNT on our DTC maps? (This will lead us to adding diamond into the maps.)<br></span>Yes, you should include tnt, is fun doing cannons and it good to watch. also plays like doing a cannon quickly to break the monument is A W E S O M E<br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">3) For Public or Tournament? Also, how should the gamemode be reintroduced?<br>For tournament it would be great, idk how should the gamemode be reintroduced, but the official should get like an idea to do it.</span>

I'm sorry, but every Avicus attempt at DTC has been rather poor in terms of maps, and I don't trust that the community understands enough how to develop the meta on this server. I would rather go to Stratus to play DTC, because that has been a continuation of 5 years worth of maps, tournaments, and meta development.<br><br>One builder taking on a project to reintroduce DTC without prior map developer discussion won't happen.

1. DTC+DTM. I don't like maps with 1 objective, it makes them become boring and stalemate faster.<br><br>2. I quite like TnT in DTC, but only on certain maps. I don't understand why a tnt map NEEDS diamonds, like you stated. Tnt maps work fine, mostly even better, without annoying diamonds.<br><br>3. Public, but better den before. Previous attempts, instead of slowly adding DTC there were 4-6 DTC in rots all of a sudden.<br>Just add 1 or 2 DTC maps, and swap those for others every week or 2 to keep everyone interested.
