As an avid member on the forums, I feel I should create a thread wondering what games or spotlights you want to see on the forums. My main focus is to boost the player count on this platform and I'm willing to host certain things you guys may not be comfortable with. Write down below what you are looking for and I will possibly pick a few and decide to start them, cheers!<br><br><br><br><br><b><i><u>List:<br></u></i></b>

1. Some players say, may want a certain forum game. But they don't want to personally run it. Therefore I proceed to take their idea, credit them &amp; run it by myself. Therefore we have a good idea actually happening.<br><br>I'm not looking for feedback, I'm looking for ideas, the ones I won't use are either trolls or I already have too many.<br><br>This is personally an effort by myself but I hope to encourage the staff team &amp; community to help me increase the player count on this platform and being the forums alive.

I think what the forum lacks is content. I don't think adding random forum games can fill this lack of content however.

About the "Meet the Player"i want to say that i started the Meet the Beaner threads because i don't like how DaBader and Arigen do their interviews, always the same questions, and i try to change a few questions to don't get bored the players.
