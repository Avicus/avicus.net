I suggest legitimately looking for Devs. <br>Even if you promote it as free casual experience. <br><br>We need more Devs, considering the only active one just retired.&nbsp;<br><br>Active and consistent development is more important than any advertising project.

I'd have to agree with Snow. No one wants to come to a server with no active Devs,&nbsp;<b>very</b> few active staff at all, along with lots of glitches. If I was looking for a server and I found Avicus I wouldn't stay. There is never a Dev on, which from a new person perspective means no development is happening what-so-ever. <br><br>Player count has been increasing slowly, so that should not be a top priority. Keep doing what ever we are doing there.<br><br>Developing and updates should be faster. There's been many glitches that are brought up in topics all the time and nothing gets done about them, and now with the most active Dev gone that is going to be even slower.<br><br>Staff activity... I have no clue why so many staff are inactive, but that's going to be brought up in the staff meeting already. I know I don't see everyone online because of timezones but I'm on &nbsp;most of the day for myself. This includes the beginning and end of a few different time zones and 99% of the time I'm on alone or with one and sometimes two other people. I know school is a pretty big factor with activity along with just life in general, but from what I see the active staff that I see everyday or almost every day are myself, MyWorld, Junr, Abusive,PieZ, Para, Badger, and Prodigy. For having 32 staff members (including Seniors and Admins) that is sad. (Those are only ones I know are on everyday or pretty close to it. There are probably a few that are on but I just don't see.)<br><br>Now onto things I know a lot of people are curious about and things I've thought of:<br><br>-Rules.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*There are a lot of "rules" that aren't in the rules.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*There are also a few rules that don't make a lot of sense. For example the gap between names and chat behavior. You can't have a name that isn't appropriate for all ages, but chat is allowed to be vulgar and sometimes it can get sexual. I understand certain things but if there's a rule for something it shouldn't be allowed in other ways. It just doesn't make sense.<br><br><br>(I will add more as I think of them.)

I'd have to agree with Snow. No one wants to come to a server with no active Devs,&nbsp;<b>very</b> few active staff at all, along with lots of glitches. If I was looking for a server and I found Avicus I wouldn't stay. There is never a Dev on, which from a new person perspective means no development is happening what-so-ever. <br><br>Player count has been increasing slowly, so that should not be a top priority. Keep doing what ever we are doing there.<br><br>Developing and updates should be faster. There's been many glitches that are brought up in topics all the time and nothing gets done about them, and now with the most active Dev gone that is going to be even slower.<br><br>Staff activity... I have no clue why so many staff are inactive, but that's going to be brought up in the staff meeting already. I know I don't see everyone online because of timezones but I'm on &nbsp;most of the day for myself. This includes the beginning and end of a few different time zones and 99% of the time I'm on alone or with one and sometimes two other people. I know school is a pretty big factor with activity along with just life in general, but from what I see the active staff that I see everyday or almost every day are myself, MyWorld, Junr, Abusive,PieZ, Para, Badger, and Prodigy. For having 32 staff members (including Seniors and Admins) that is sad. (Those are only ones I know are on everyday or pretty close to it. There are probably a few that are on but I just don't see.)<br><br>Now onto things I know a lot of people are curious about and things I've thought of:<br><br>-Rules.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*There are a lot of "rules" that aren't in the rules.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*There are also a few rules that don't make a lot of sense. For example the gap between names and chat behavior. You can't have a name that isn't appropriate for all ages, but chat is allowed to be vulgar and sometimes it can get sexual. I understand certain things but if there's a rule for something it shouldn't be allowed in other ways. It just doesn't make sense.<br><br><br>(I will add more as I think of them.)

</div>
Just regarding staff activity, Senior Moderators and Admins have other responsibilities than moderating the server. Sure it would be nice to see them on, but at the end of the day they are there for server management, not moderating. That's why you are on the staff team.

Well, quite a few of the staff members on there are on LOAs. It's not an excuse - there should always be a mod on at busy times - but we're working on it.

check slack suggestions :<div>To bring activity to the forums there should be a small bar or icon, like on ocn where it appears when a &nbsp;media is streaming. It doesn't have to be like ocns one, it could just be a small view in the corner of their screen that you can click to enlarge or shrink! This would bring in views which can help promote Avicus on twitch as the stream will be closer to the top of the Twitch minecraft page, meaning its easier for people to see it and click it! Then people can see avicus and it can promote it if steamers stream regularly. Please put green or red</div><div><br></div>

The problem with Slack Suggestions is that people start talking about it and it disappears and then gets lost in chat. We need a different system for suggestions.

The activity recently boosted to 4K messages a week. That's approximately 2 and a half weeks to be able to gather info before it resets.<br>So as long as staff members look at the slack, write down the suggestion a day or so after the suggestions were made, then there shouldn't be any problem.<br>It's not like the staff slack that resets every other day.

That's why we need a staff activity check, as vladthegreat suggested. The other inactive mods can be warned then if they're too inactive.

If you're going to monitor staff activity please don't leave it up to staff with a completely different timezone. It&nbsp;<i>will</i> appear that they are inactive, they're just not on when you are.

If they decide to do this they will probably just look on how many hours in total they have been on for a week. Then they can easily find out if they are on often, how much they are on, and all that kind of stuff

That's not how it would work.<br>Talking to Pete about my suggestion of activity checks, is on minimum of certain command infractions given out (ex: a certain amount of warns, kicks, bans per month), if they go on ts or not, active or not in slack and many other stuff to influence the activity check decision.

Like Aura said, judging staff activity by infractions doesn't work. I've had many days where I'm on got 5 hours and I have 1-3 infractions, mostly kicks for spam or something like that. Unless there's a ban evader online infractions are pretty low.
