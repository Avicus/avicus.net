Some of these, such as: 'Die In A Fire' aren't really very nice and shouldn't be used, even if it is mean't as a joke; some people may not take it in a jokey way.<br><br>If you're going to say something like that then let the person you're saying it to know that you're only joking so that you don't offend anyone and so that you don't get yourself into trouble :)

Well said! I know it is stated in the thread but terms like "eZ" won't be tolerated. When ever you use an possible offensive &nbsp;term or abbreviations against someone explain that it just a joke, or just don't do it at all. You don't know the impact of words on someone and saying "sorry" doesn't always help :)

I completely agree with you.<br>Considering it's not a very popular joke, I can understand the confusion.<br>This is why I added an explanation next to it.<br><br>What you said applies to all jokes in general.&nbsp;<br>Make sure everyone knows you're joking and make sure everyone is having fun!
