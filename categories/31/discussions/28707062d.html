Hello members of the community.<br><br>The reason I brought up this thread is because, as you may or may not know, the maps I have listen in the title of this thread (Clay Wars, Justice 2 and Proelium) have been recently removed from rotations, however, all the Map Development team is trying to do is give you the best experience we can afford with maps. After all, you're the ones that play them, aren't you? So do we, but you guys are our main concern, as I've always believed.<br><br>So, here goes the question. Are you happy with these maps being removed from the rotations?<br>What are your thoughts on this? Are you willing to keep them, with or without changes?<br>If any changes, which? or perhaps you're okay with these maps gone for good?<br><br>Keep in mind I am&nbsp;<b>only and exclusively</b> asking for these three maps, comments regarding other maps will be ignored.<br><br>I need to know if you guys want them back or gone, and if back, with or without changes?<br>If any changes, which?<br><br>Please add as much detail and information as you can, as it will be more beneficial for yourself, because I'm the one that will have to work with the information you provide.<br><br>Thanks and have a very nise day.

I honestly thought Justice II was fine the way it was.<br><br>Proelium's monuments I believe are the main issue so, if there could be a different monument shape, that would be great.<br><br>Clay Wars needs wood so that getting to the monument would be easier providing a good correlation with the rate that players exit out of spawn.

Proelium was prolly the best map I've played on. But the only thing I'll change is how far apart the monuments are from each other.&nbsp;<br><br>On the other hand I agree with Poker about the wood, and that the monuments are too close to spawn. But don't remove them a lot of people like these maps

Clay wars was one of the best maps in the rotations. However I agree that they need to be farther away from spawn because it is one of the most stalemate worthy maps in the rotations.

Agreed, I felt that the monuments were fine and the lack of wood made it more fun. But I have to agree it can sometimes last long

Clay wars and Proelium were fine, except the monument shape of the proelium monument which made it extremely hard to get sometimes. I really loved Justice III and I, but as for Justice II...<br>Usually the match goes like killfarm on the island near the spawn, and there is no way to get out, and they even come and spawnkill, and there is alot of trolling because the diamonds, and the punch bows make it even worse in the thin ways from the sides, I suggest you to revamp it.

Clay Wars and Justice II were perfect imo, but Proelium needs the monument restructured with a bit more surface area.

Clay Wars shouldn't have been removed. It doesn't need any changes either. (Same with Justice II)<br>I'm fine wtih the removal of Proelium.

Clay wars was a alright map, except hard to rush and no wood. If it were to be added back, wood please!<br><br>Justice 2 was a great map. It was to big, but other than that it was fine. Add back please!<br><br>Proelium was an ok map except it was to spread out, some islands were also useless. If to be added back, remove useless islands!

IMO they should stay in rotation and not be changed. The long games are a lot of fun and just shows a match between two good teams.

personally I disagree with the removing of Proelium and clay wars<br><br><b></b><b>Clay wars</b><b></b><b></b>: nice map with some hard rushing. You need to work as a team to fight yourself through, nothing for one-man-teams :)<br><br><b>Proelium: </b>Nice hard pvp, tricky to get to the monuments, but managable. The only thing I might want to change is more lanes coming from spawn. you can get spawn trapped fairly easy.

<b><u>Clay Wars </u></b><br><ul><li>It was awesome and had very great gameplay, however, I have a problem with the amount of blocks that you carry. Could you possibly increase the size of blocks in the inventory?</li><li>Could you add multiple layers of combat as well as a third monument in the extended platform?</li></ul><b><u>Proelium</u></b><br><ul><li>I do not like the map, at all.&nbsp;</li><li>Monuments to far and separated by void too much</li><li>Map has too much gaps of void, it is very eZ to get shot off. I mean, if thats the case, why bother getting diamonds at all? Lessen the amount of void plz.&nbsp;</li></ul><b><u>Justice II<br></u></b><ul><li><b></b>What can i say, there was nothing at all wrong with the map. It was perfect.</li><li>But if your lookin' for some ideas, you could make a CTW version ;)</li></ul>

After examining all the feedback clearly I brought some small changes to these maps, and they are:<br><br><b>Justice 2</b><br>- Elevated the curved lanes, monument islands, water fountains and island with special bows.<br>- Moved spawn island closer (about 10-15 blocks) to the main islands.<br>- Custom loadouts. (Red/Yellow stained clay + stained glass)<br>- Reduced amount of Diamond Blocks.<br><br><b>Clay Wars<br></b>- Pushed monument islands a bit away from spawn.<br>- Custom loadouts. (Orange/Lime stained clay + stained glass)<br><br><b>Proelium<br></b>- Back Monument was completly removed.<br>- Left and Right Monuments were pushed forward, instead of being next to spawn island.

IMO, Clay Wars was like that map that never ended. You play for like 3 hours, and all teams are still camping them. It was probably one of the hardest maps. The other two were really good for gameplay though :)
