Despite "being back" I haven't really been on avicus much/at all lately not because I am avoiding it, but simply because I have not been on the compute much lately. I have been sick a lot, my immune system is not up to par, and I have been doing as little as possible to rest and recover between illnesses for fear my body might give out. My immune system &nbsp;has always been crap so it isn't surprising every year when the sicknesses run their course that i get all of them. I am not dying or anything (although sometimes it feels like it), so don't worry to much, however I just don't think it is fair to my team or my friends on this server that I have been so inactive and so I wanted to apologize and explain to all of them, particularly roboticboy16 (known by most regulars as Robo), the reason for this absence. I also completely understand if you make the decision to remove me from the team because of my inactivity. I feel it would be hypocritical of me to not at least let you know that I would understand because I have been part of many discussions over removing other team members over inactivity, and my crime is only heightened by my being a co-leader and helping you with those decisions. That being said, if you decide to keep me around, I will be back active as soon as possible. Thanks for reading.
