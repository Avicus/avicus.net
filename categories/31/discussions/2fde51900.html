<span><b>Event #7:</b>&nbsp;This is the seventh official event on the Avicus Network, known as "Capricornus". You will be given 20 days to construct a map for The Avicus Networks gamemode, Nexus. There will however be a couple rules to the contest.<br>&nbsp;<img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/1ZkzxeF.png"><br><br><u><b>Who are the judges?</b></u><br>The individuals that will be judging this competition are Flufflepuff_ and matic0basle. Judges for this contest will not change, so please do not ask to become one. You may however request to become a judge for future Avicus building competitions.<br><br><u><b>What are the rules?</b></u><br>You have to follow these rules or your map will be rejected.<br>- You may not have more than 3 authors.<br>- You must have a Nexus map. Anything else will not be entered in.<br>- You may not create more than 2 maps for Capricornus&nbsp;<br><br><u><b>What are the guidelines?</b></u><br>Maps are judged in the following aspects;<br>-&nbsp;<i>Gameplay</i>&nbsp;(How do you think the map will play on the servers?)<br>-&nbsp;<i>Aesthetics</i>&nbsp;(How pleasing to the eye does it look?)<br>-&nbsp;<i>Creativity&nbsp;</i>(Is it unique and really stands out?)<br><br>YAML will be done by a map developer if you wish, and it will not count against you. We're all here to help!<br><br><u><b>What gamemodes can I do?</b></u><br>You can do anything possible within YAML in Nexus.&nbsp;<br><br><u><b>How do I submit my map?</b></u><br>Put a [CONTEST] tag in the title. By doing so, you are entered into the contest and put into a spreadsheet. It contains the map name, authors, thread link, jurisdiction of approval/denial, and it's gamemode. All Nexus maps&nbsp;are eligible to be in this contest. You have the permission to post your thread link in the post below so we can see it easier.<br><br>1.&nbsp;Do <b>not</b> give in-constructive feedback&nbsp;by knocking others down to build yourself up.<br>2.&nbsp;Do <b>not</b> steal maps; all maps are your property.&nbsp;Violations of this are a permanant&nbsp;ban.<br>3.&nbsp;Do <b>not</b> ghost produce;&nbsp;don't have other users make a map for you and you take credit.<br>4.&nbsp;Do <b>not</b> spam judges;&nbsp;patience is a large key. Wait for a response on your map.<br>5.&nbsp;Do <b>not</b> ghost view;&nbsp;don't tally a ton of thread views in your thread for attention.<br>6.&nbsp;Do <b>not</b> make joke maps;&nbsp;all maps must be true submissions to the server.<br>7.&nbsp;Do <b>not</b> submit maps made prior to this;&nbsp;all maps must be "newly produced".<br>8.&nbsp;<b>Always</b> give credit.&nbsp;No matter what the case, credit everyone who authored.<br><br><u><b>How can I create YAML?</b></u><br>Use our documentation resource at docs.avicus.net.<br><br><u><b>What is the prize?</b></u><br>The prize has yet to be determined.&nbsp;<br><br><u><b>Is the spreadsheet public?</b></u><br>Yes!&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a9CYPRvSxJWrkJiugM7Hl3dlCmi6M5iwYG-xU5dhK0w/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a9CYPRvSxJWrkJiugM7Hl3dlCmi6M5iwYG-xU5dhK0w/edit?usp=sharing</a>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><u><b><a rel="nofollow" href="http://avicus.net/forums/dc403a384">PREVIOUS EVENT</a></b><br></u><u><b>NEXT EVENT</b></u><br><br>Starts; March 1st<i>, 2015</i><br>Ends; March&nbsp;<i>20th, 2015</i></span>
