Hello Avicus.<br><br>In case you haven't heard yet, accusing a player of hacking through chat is now a punishable offense.<br><br>You can now report players for doing this, however, one hackusation is not enough for a temporary ban, so if you report someone, make sure it is either excessively spammed, caps were used, or language was used.<br><br>(<a rel="nofollow" href="http://avicus.net/rules">http://avicus.net/rules</a>)<br><br>Thanks<br>-Nolan

Could we have more details? What if somebody doesn't mention who they think is the hacker, so just for example 'hacker' What if somebody goes 'hackers' at the end of the game? What if somebody was obviously joking around and called their friend a 'h@x0r' would these be punishable?

Very good rule.<br>I was in-game yesterday on a match of Nexus, and one player was definitely not hacking, but two players were pointing him out and spamming in the chat the he is hacking.<br>I support this new rule 100% and thank the staff for implementing it.

finally. This would be awesome. If they say hacker like once, don't punish them but if the player starts spamming it constantly and harrasing the other player, then it's punishable. I say this due to the fact because its ridiclous to punish someone who only says hacker once or aimbot and some people just might be joking

If they all publicaly accuse the person of hacks then yes. It does not matter whether the person is actualy hacking or not, because if they are hacking they might toggle the hacks off. Just use /report.

It depends on the mod and how they say it. For example, if somebody says "hax" after they die they have a less likely chance of being warned. If they continue to say that they will get punished. If they say something along the lines of "Zieno nice hacks eZpZ FF" they will be warned, if they continue they will be kicked.
