Hi all,<br>&nbsp;<br>Feel free to tell me anything with this. There is something that I think would add greatly to Avicus and it would be ranks. Not like the ones you buy but the ones you earn. Like ranks in Counter Strike Global Offensive or League or Legends. I have an idea of like (Bronze 1, Bronze 2, Bronze 3, Bronze 4, Silver 1, Silver 2, Silver 3, Silver 4, Gold 1, Gold 2, Gold 3, Gold 4... etc.) Please, everyone let me know your opinion. Thanks.

We used to have and XP system (it worked similar to the credits system)<br>We also had a Prestige system, once you reached Level 50 (with your XP) you could earn your first of several Prestiges.&nbsp;<br>This would be represented in game by a badge that sat right next to your name.<br><br>Prestiges and XP were removed in the NISE update, and FunkyStudios said it wouldn't be returning.
