Have mods completely stopped enforcing rules on the forums? Last time I checked swearing on Avicus' services wasn't allowed, yet I see it all over the forums. Can you please bring this up into a staff discussion or just edit the swearing out of posts?

The swearing rule needs to be reverted back to the old system. <br>This zero tolerance for swearing makes no sense, especially because the staff don't seem to enforce this rule.<br><br>I mean, if the staff are still enforcing swearing based off the old "swearing's all good unless it's directed or excessive" rule, then update the swearing rule to avoid confusion please.

I agree. They want the new rule yet don't care much to enforce it.

This!&nbsp;<br><br>@OP<br><br>You can't be mods if you are gonna stare at people breaking rules and just leave it alone. Go back to the old system where you are allowed to say simple swear words and not aggressive/targetted. This old rule actually made sense and wasn't confusing. Staff,&nbsp;do you job! It's not hard to verbal warn, warn, kick, temp ban someone swearing.

I believe everyone in slack said they didn't like it, so I'm hoping it'll be changed back soon.

That's not how this works. There is practically no grey area to kill aura in the rules.
