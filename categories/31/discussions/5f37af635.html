if you are like me, you may have trouble not swearing on the server. it's hard to control sometimes. for a while i tried to just not swear, but it didn't really work. i quickly made a filter for myself that replaces swear words with something else. now when i'm on the server, i won't swear and get more infractions. horray.<br><br>==========================<br>1. <a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/" rel="nofollow" title="Link: http://www.autohotkey.com/">download autohotkey</a><br>2. right click on your desktop, select new &gt; autohotkey script<br>3. paste in the following:<br>:*:hell::heck<br>4. (optional) make a folder with as many copies of this as you need, replacing the words with different swear words each time.<br>5. when you double click on the icon, it'll start replacing the words as you type them.<br>==========================<br><br><i>note:</i> this can be a little buggy when used in minecraft. sometimes it doesn't replace the word, but i've found it works 80% of the time.

You can set macros to auto-sprint, crouch, jump, mine and so on with AutoHotKey, so the question is if Avicus will allow this or not.

Instead of doing this, why not take deep breaths and do some relaxing cool down exercises. Swearing in chat isn't going to bring you anywhere, or bring you any advantage, so just avoid swearing.

I personally don't see the point in swearing in chat. It doesn't help you, and it just angers other players. Just say it out loud if you really can't control it.

ok seriously did you all not read my last comment<br><br>people aren't gonna "take a few days off". you know that nobody is gonna do that, right?? this thread isnt about whether it's right or wrong to swear in chat, it's about FURTHER KEEPING SWEARING OFF AVICUS. if you don't want people to take whatever measures they want to or can to not swear in front of kids on avicus, maybe you're the problem.<br><br>seriously, don't try to say what goes on or doesn't with somebody. you don't know what problems a person has. you don't know them. yes there are ways for some people to relax and that would be preferable, but there is always gonna be swearing so if people wanna limit it, what is your problem with letting them?? stop the pretentiousness. just stop.

"Go to heck."<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; That'll be interesting. I really don't understand how this could keep mods off of you, I personally think this shouldn't keep you from getting warnings and such if you keep saying blatant replacements, I always see it not as the word itself that is bad, it's the intention.

yeah, but in my experience the staff punish more based on the word itself. in my own filter, it replaces the f-word with "bees". just as a test i did. i don't think they're gonna punish someone who says "bees you"

&nbsp; &nbsp; I still understand what you're trying to say. If I just killed you and you say ----------- You then I understand it's an insult. If it is repeatedly done it should be punished. I find it stupid when people thing just because you said -------- Instead of Fuck then its alright. Too anyone that has passed primary school its just a half-assed workaround, and shouldn't be allowed.&nbsp;<br><br>Therefor, this seems semi-useless.<br><br>Also, if you're typing in rage mode, you probably don't care about spelling and if you end up putting fukc then everyone understands. Most people who can hold in the rage too type said words probably havn't yet reached a maturity level to filter all that too.<br><br>You shouldn't be punished outright as if you actually said one of said words, but if you reputedly do it then the warnings and other things should happen.
