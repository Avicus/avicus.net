Hey everyone.<br><br>Firstly, I'd like to clearly state that this post is NOT to be condescending, ordering or any type of bossing around, i just think it is so crucial and beneficial for the server that I announce my suggestions.<br><br><b>The Problem:</b><br>Anyway, for the first time ever today, I saw Avicus drop below 10 people. There were between 4 - 10 people online for about 30 minutes. Now this is pretty concerning to me for a few reasons. I joined Avicus in it's golden prime, when the server peaked at counts of 600 - 800 players online. Even at the start of this year we were topping the 350 mark.<br><br>But 4 people. 4??<br><br><a href="http://imgur.com/XUTWmWG">http://imgur.com/XUTWmWG</a><br><br>Many people, including myself, have been of the view that Avicus has been heading downhill over time, slowly but surely and seeing single digits today is showing that the server must be cusping collapse and rock bottom.<br><br>I have been around almost 2 years to see amazing characters, people, achievements, games and staff come and go, lost in the sea of people Avicus HAD. But now we really need something to jumpstart the server's life again, like real soon.<br><br><b>Resolutions/What Can We Do?<br></b>I know not everyone will be in full agreement with me, but the way I see it Avicus is hanging on in the Minecraft world by a THREAD. If we do not up the player count really soon I feel like the server will kind of be smouldered and not really noticed anymore.&nbsp;<br><b></b>My suggestions vary and have probably been mentioned before, but I say we generate some ideas and stretch them to the max in order to gain recognition for Avicus.<br><br>My suggestions include:<br><br><b>YouTubers:&nbsp;</b>Everyone who uploads Avicus videos, PLEASE push your passion, publicity and encouragement towards the server to maximum extent - try to get people to join you on the server<br><br><b>Reviews &amp; Comments:&nbsp;</b>There are THOUSANDS of websites on the internet which list Minecraft servers, along with reviews and comments to write. This goes for all of us: we should get out there and begin writing about our server, show off what we have to offer as a community and structured server. After this discussion I am going to go and write a handful of reviews for Avicus on a dozen different sites or so, just to put us out there. Think, if we all do it, people HAVE to see and come.<br><br><b>Socialize:&nbsp;</b>Similar to the above idea - tell people, either on social media, your real life friends, on websites, the whole deal, just throw out the name Avicus to anyone willing to listen.<br><br><b>Seize The Moment:</b> The first time on any Minecraft server is a defying one for the future. If you don't like a server first time, then you'll likely forget it and won't bother coming back. I say we try and be welcoming and chatty to any new names and just keep our notorious positive community flowing at its best.<br><br><b>Vote!!:<br></b>The staff have made it literally as easy as possible to vote for the server, so vote!<br>All you do is click the link that comes up in the lobby or click on the voting emerald and then enter your vote at the site.<br>The more votes a server has on a site, the more publicity and popularity it gains. Remember that. So please remember to vote every possible day you can.<br><br>These factors, I'm sure are enough to build our server a foundation of recognition and pull in just enough people to spark it back to life and MAYBE, just MAYBE we can return to the old Avicus I remember.<br><br><b>If you have any extra ideas or suggestions</b> on how we can up the player count, please do not keep them to yourself, <b>comment below</b> and i'd be happy to add your idea to the list.<br><br><b>Edit:&nbsp;</b>Guys, I am adamant that the staff are straining at maximum capacity to help do these things, if anything this post is to the general community, lets ALL go out and rack up the player count :)<br><br>Thanks for your time guys, see you round.

Just a heads up. You just don't get a famous youtuber to advertise like that. It's money<br><br>Im not sure, but from other servers I've heard that these minecraft players that have over 1 million subs get like 500$ for a 30 minutes video in total.

The length of the video doesn't do crap. You get $1 off of a video per 1000 views.<br><br>Now out of that $1 Youtube will take a percentage of it, which is why it's usually better to go to a third party payment area where you get a percentage (ranges from 50 - 90 percent) and the rest goes to that parternship company (ex: Creative Nation, Voustudios, Freedom).<br>After that youtube&nbsp;<b>still</b> needs revenue from somewhere for allowing you to put ads on their videos, so instead of taking the money from you the partnership company gives them a percentage from their cut.<br>So you can have a 5 second video and have it go famous as hell and you will get the exact same amount of money with 5000 views as a video who has 30 minutes and 5000 views.

Not saying I dont agree, but we didn't have 4 players. The throwback server sometimes goes invisible and the players on that server don't show up on the count.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<br><br><br>I got ninja'd. I see your point on a low count but I think its lowest without glitching server was like 14?. As Eako said the server says its offline aka it has a red stained clay and says "0/0". when actually maybe 40 people are on it. I am quite unlucky (unless I am on holidays) when I get home from school there is 20 peeps on but in the morning there is like 104. Being aussie sometimes sucks

Everyone always gives the staff team crap about the low numbers.<br>But how do you expect the server to grow if only the staff team are working on it?<br>You can't leave something this big for the staff team to do alone. The community needs to help out too.

IMO I love avicus without 500 players. Maybe 300 players would suit my comfort zone but 500 is too extreme.&nbsp;<br><br>My Words:<br>If we just have 500 players spread out on avicus they will probably be saying "What the fuck am I doing". Avicus aren't prepared for any situation like this. Yes, Avicus may be unique and intelligent but they still leave things to the last minute. I see you guys are working hard but obviously you need help. Stop promoting people in 5 days of their jr mod application. Especially Gill! He was jr mod for 18 hours.... Yes, He was a retired admin but that doesn't meen he gets mod. Avicus have their biased ways. Block lag has been an issue for so long now. Stop saying "it will be fixed" Thats all I hear from you guys. Obviously, You aren't focusing on block lag in the time being and you are focusing on other stuff. Fix lag, Then move on to unimportant stuff. Avicus is all over the place when there are like 5 people qualifed for the developer position. Stop saying "This will be fixed in the update". No! Fix it now, It proves my point exactly how you guys leave things to the last minute. If you haven't realized we are losing players a shit tone. And if you guys don't do anything about this, you can probably tell what happens next. Another thing I have found is avicus is just wasting money. There are like 8 nebula servers and 2 of them are used. When avicus gets money do that. Now now! I think avicus are being quite slack with the staff applications. I was denied for "Excessive Infractions" and "General Immaturity". I laugh how sr mods say "Infractions won't be the sole reason for a deny". If you think "General immaturity" is a big reason.. well woah. I may be a pain and stubborn but I think I am the one trying to not play sex songs and ts and be mature....

Whatever you just said made 0 sense. No need to be salty over not getting junior mod. Block lag is focused on, in fact if you paid attention to what Kylo and Javi said you would know that once we switch to full 1.8 most of these issues are being fixed. xP

Yes, He was a retired admin but that doesn't meen he gets mod. Avicus have their biased ways. Block lag has been an issue for so long now. Stop saying "it will be fixed" Thats all I hear from you guys. Obviously, You aren't focusing on block lag in the time being and you are focusing on other stuff. Fix lag, Then move on to unimportant stuff. Avicus is all over the place when there are like 5 people qualifed for the developer position. Stop saying "This will be fixed in the update". No! Fix it now, It proves my point exactly how you guys leave things to the last minute. If you haven't realized we are losing players a shit tone. And if you guys don't do anything about this, you can probably tell what happens next. Another thing I have found is avicus is just wasting money. There are like 8 nebula servers and 2 of them are used. When avicus gets money do that. Now now! I think avicus are being quite slack with the staff applications. I was denied for "Excessive Infractions" and "General Immaturity". I laugh how sr mods say "Infractions won't be the sole reason for a deny". If you think "General immaturity" is a big reason.. well woah. I may be a pain and stubborn but I think I am the one trying to not play sex songs and ts and be mature....

With your first couple of sentences, I know what you mean, it might get a bit crazy, but keeping quiet and letting the server hover at 5 - 10 players is ridiculous.&nbsp;<br>I think the community and staff are fine; sure we all have our small niggles and problems, like you said with the block lag, last minute stuff, etc. but come on, there isn't a perfect server on this planet...<br><br>Well, then the rest of your post was kind of about the bias and inequality you see in the staff system, which I don't know too much about, but surely on a scale the positives all of the staff put together have created outweigh the negatives.<br><br>Anyway, this is kind of trailing off topic because I'm basically trying to encourage everyone to make an extra effort to gain more players, tbh i don't care about naming players or what people have done wrong, because overall i still think we're a server deserving at least another 100 players, so for now i say we stay positive and try to get more people online.<br><br>I'm by no means disagreeing with you (fully) or trying to be insulting, but yeah...

Firstly, Gill was most likely promoted so fast because the staff team know him well and know that he can get his job done effectively; Don't forget he was very high up in the staff ranks at one point, but I agree that maybe the staff should have spent more time with him to make sure he is properly up to standard.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Also, in my opinion, the staff team are more important than some other server issues because they are what keeps the server going so they should be a priority, however I do agree that issues such as block lag are just as important as having people who run the server because, in reality if block lag does get worse then people will continue to stop playing so Avicus will die.<br><br>Instead of there being so many Nebula servers, maybe the maps that people enjoy playing should have a player capacity increase, then have more servers for other unplayed games such as Survival Games or CTH. In addition to this, separate staff should be added just to promote the server and the other unplayed games.&nbsp;<br><br>Again, a larger staff team can help make these improvements so that the server grows instead of dying...<br><br>Avicus needs a lot of improvements but it is not the only server, as this post says, if we all work together we can achieve what we want!

I remember when woofles did 1 episode on Cth , the server for the next week , was just filled with fanboys/girls it<br>Was horrible. Youtube isn't usually the way to go unless you don't care about community.

The peak as of now is 50. The last time I've seen Avicus handling 100+ players was during the summer, where most servers reach their peak.

Gill has extensively helped and developed Avicus in the past,&nbsp; I'm sure that the staff team can find him quite trustworthy, and very able to be promoted back in the moderator team again.

Being mature is yelling in channels, singing random songs, annoying others when they ask you to stop, and that you aren't mature in-game. For Avicus sr staff if the policy/the way things are run are the same the system for promotion is not bias, they get every or 2/3's vote and ask for opinions on those people. When I was sr we checked logs/infraction page/TS. Don't complain about you being denied.

Gill was never supposed to be Jr.Mod, that was a mistake.<br>Because he is a former Admin and wishes to become a member of the Senior Staff team again, it was decided that he get promoted to Moderator right off the bat to see how he goes. If he's good enough, he'll be let back into the Senior Staff team.<br><br>His promotion to Junior Moderator was a mistake and was fixed as soon as it was identified by the Admins.<br>That's why it seemed like he had the world's fastest Jr.Mod trial, because it was never supposed to happen in the first place.<br><br>Also, with the whole infractions thing.<br>You're correct in saying that excessive infractions won't be the sole factor in the denial of an application and in your case it wasn't. You were denied for excessive infractions and Immaturity. These are two different reasons. <br>Meaning that your excessive infraction count <b>wasn't</b> the sole reason for your denial.<br><br>With the amount of infractions you have, your chance of getting staff is extremely low.<br>I'm not trying to be mean, that's just the reality of the situation that you've put yourself in.
