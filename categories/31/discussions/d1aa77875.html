Aweh Corey :( It's really sad to see you go. I remember the first time I met you, we didn't start off on a good path. But when you came back, I could see the improvement. And you've grown to be an amazing, friendly, and mature player. Thank you for that. I will miss seeing you in game, and I hope one day we'll meet again. <br><br>Till then, <br>Best of luck. - Frosted

You can't. You can only transfer ranks to alts, but you won't be able to do that if you're banned.
