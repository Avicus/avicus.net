YAML Suggestions

</h1>
<b>Knockback Reduction</b><br>In the loadout, under that would be a module above the armor/items saying "knockback:1.2" or something to reduce how far you can be knocked back. Such as a small map with lanes or something the size of a GS map, knockback reduction would be applicable to Avicus. If you wish to not use this module, you can either leave it blank or set it to 0.0.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Pointstreak Shop</b><br>Ability to customize what you can purchase in the pointstreak shop. Would include enchantments, amount, slot, and amount of points needed. If I wanted to add grass into the shop, I could slip it into the YAML then players could purchase grass for a set amount of points located in a certain slot to exchange for say, 5 points.<br><br><b>alt-objective</b><br><i>Overrides the type: in the YAML. </i>A feature to where when a block is interacted with, the match can end. Could be used for CTW, CP, DTC, Payload, Scorebox stuff, etc. and allows for it to be mixed into DTM. Lots of gamemode possibilities.<br><br><b>Free for All&nbsp;</b><br>Ability to allow friendly fire in Nebula and Nexus. You are able to hit your own teammates and can support as many teams as needed in-case you have a map design where there's quadrants or something of the likes. Would be put under the color of a team to indicate whether you can hit them or not instead of using the set features which is manual.<br><br><b>Proximity Indicators</b><br>When approaching a certain area (which would be under regions) the server would send an alert with "TheMasterCow has reached the objective Monument A!" with a possible sound. Any other features that could be crammed into this are the boss bar with how far away a player is from your distance, or for the sky to turn orange like a wither spawning, or just sounds/fireworks. Anything to make someone alert.<br><br>More suggestions coming.

These were suggestions, not things that are already implemented. If this helped with your ideas for a map, sorry but these things don't exist yet

I don't really see how knockback reduction will be made with the plugin, because that's minecraft, not bukkit. Maybe you can make it you get knockedback or you don't, but you can't prevent knockback with bukkit. (I don't think)<br>The pointstreekshop thing is good idea, I think this should be added.

OCN actually has a feature using knockback reduction for their Ghost Squadron gamemode. I believe it could be utilized here and for a large benefit.
