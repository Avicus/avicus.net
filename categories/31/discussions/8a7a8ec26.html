I know the staff apps closed since like a month. I was not in the list of the players who got accepted, assuming that I, got denied. I PM'ed howsie about what my denial reason was, I asked "Are you allowed to tell me my deny reason?" Howsie replied "not really..." Can somebody explain this to me? And if allowed, can one of the staff members inform me what my denial reason was? And don't tell me to go email support, cause I already PM'ed howsie.<br><br><br><br>Cheers!<br>26763

If I were you, I would look if I met all the requierments, and made sure I had indepth detail of explaining your reasonings to the fullest extent possible. If Howise was allowed to tell you, he would, but he can't from what I hear. As explained above, try and resolve what you think you did wrong. Best wishes!

How can he be not allowed to tell you? He has control over the applications. The only person to tell him no is Ivy.

It's probably best in the long run. If Howsie forced himself to respond to all the Skype messages he receives due to applicants being denied it would be a true hassle. Instead, he just ignores the messages to not give anyone in particular special treatment.<br><b>Source:</b> What Howsie just posted xP

If he tells you, he has to tell everyone else. It'd be very unfair for just you or a few others to receive critique on their appeals.

I'm not sure if it would be right to tell anyone why they were denied. If someone becomes staff they should get it by themselves, not just getting told then fixing it. Just my opinion.

Even though this is my staff app, I got denied simply because of the lack of votes. At first I thought it was the bullying infraction, but i asked yoav and he said otherwise. Pure dumb luck. I won't be re-applying by the way, feel free to use this as an inspiration BUT DON'T PLAGIARISE.<br>Minecraft username: SpicyTunaRoll9<br>Timezone: UTC +8:00<br>Experience: None, but very keen on starting.&nbsp;<br>Why do you believe you should be a moderator on Avicus?<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Most people associate moderators with a security guard that patrols the server looking for abusive players to ban/kick. However, they ultimately fail to recognise the significant&nbsp;purpose of a moderator. A moderator should be kind, dedicated, and thoughtful, helping the ordinary players and always being there for them. Rather than being a security guard who bans, I would be a moderator that is always there for troubled, insecure players on Avicus who need aid. Time to time I see players being trolled, getting annoyed, using profanity and other abusive situations, looking for help. I just want to let the general public know that rather than to scare them, I am here to help them. I would always proritise kindness over anything, unless the player fails to rationalise their decisions and breaks major infractions.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Time after time I long dream of joining that jr mod chat box in teamspeak. I feel I could make a wonderful moderator by socialising with other moderators, and even make maps. I am highly active on teamspeak and skype, and I go on avicus at least 3 times a day.&nbsp;<br><br><b>If a player is using a hacked client on the server what in your opinion would be the most appropriate punishment?:&nbsp;<br></b>This server has a no-hacking policy. We have zero tolerance for hacking. Hacking provides an unfair advantage that is by no means justified. People's k/d ratios will go down, Players will be unhappy, games will be tipped in their favor without the use of skill,&nbsp;just because one player has an unfair advantage? An instant ban. Hacking, is defined as "<b>a person who uses computers to gain unauthorized access to data." 1&nbsp;Just because the hacking is not as major as compared to other hacking situations, it is still a breach of security and should not be treated lightly.</b><br><br><b>If a player is swearing and being abusive on the server what in your opion would be the most appropriate punishment?:</b>[Justify which punishment you believe the player should be given.]<b></b>&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;<br></b>As I mentioned earlier, I always prioritise kindness over rules. However, being abusive is not respectful and there are many young players on Avicus that could potentially cause a negative influence on them by swearing. Cyberbullying is prominent in the age of technology and the danger is real because we have no identity of the mc player behind the screen.&nbsp;Depending on the situation, I would either kick or ban. If the player is using mild profanity or being rude, I would let them off with kick or warn. However, If the player has multiple records of similar infractions or repeatedly swearing (Such as spamming the chat), then I would give them a temp ban or perm ban.<br><br><br><b>If a player is team griefing or team spleefing on the server what in your opinion would be the most appropriate punishment?:&nbsp;</b>[Justify which punishment you believe the player should be given.]<b></b>&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;<br></b>If any player is caught spleefing or greifing, I believe the player should be given a temp ban the first time, and a perm ban a second time. These actions are deliberately causing malicious actions toward another player in an attempt to troll them or annoy the player. Moreover, team greifing is physical rather than verbal, so I see it as a major infraction.&nbsp;Since this can hinder the player's progress and can be classified as abusive behavior, I believe a tempban is most appropriate punishment.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Do you have the ability to record video?<br></b>Yes, I use quicktime player on my macbook pro.<br><br><b>Do you own a microphone and have access to TeamSpeak 3 and Skype?:</b>&nbsp;<br>Yes, I have both teamspeak and skype and are highly active on the forums. For the mic I use a built-in mic of my mac.<br><br><b>Is&nbsp;there anything else that will&nbsp;benefit your application?<br></b>Whenever I report a player I am always extremely thorough as demonstrated here,&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://old.avicus.net/forums/topic/9882">http://old.avicus.net/forums/topic/9882</a>. Rather than just spamming the ./report command, I make sure to carefully describe the situation and providing actual evidence by using screenshots&nbsp;rather than just "HACK" or "NOOB SPLEEFER."

Actually, it's fair. If players want to know what their deny reason was, why can't they just ask howsie? It's not that hard to make a post on the forums stating what each players deny reason was.

No. This discussion is over, No one who was denied got their reasonings and neither will you. the one reason you shall get is that we didnt think you were suitable for the job.
