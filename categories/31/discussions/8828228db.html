Regardless of whether we gain more players for this, it's still a great achievement for Avicus to recognize.

Meeting with news friends is good. But my current friends are enough for me honestly :) But I'd enjoy to make new friends anyways. ;p

Looks like blocklag isn't an issue anymore, though. Neither is the invisible fire, random lag spiking, rubber banding, scrim server reserving, boats breaking in spectator mode, dying wool to glitch a capture, or anything else. I think we're fine for a few extra players.

The Fast Hit/Fast Death glitch still happens on Cth and Nexus. In walls, if you are flying over your own side when the game starts you fall to your death. Neb isnt the only game mode :P
