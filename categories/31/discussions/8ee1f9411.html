I have to agree with the innovation part honestly. I liked Avicus because it was different than a lot of servers I played on.&nbsp;<br>The forums update (which I love) and the punishment update are making it more and more like OCN, which I don't want to happen with this server.<br>I haven't had a chance to play in game yet, but I do see what you mean, Avicus is not being innovative with the forums and punishment system right now.<br>Also, the bar up top is now pretty much identical to OCN, the leaderboards are the same. The only thing I like and is original with this update are the profiles.

1. Hackers are being dealt with. And from what I can see, quite effectively.<br>2. XP isn't rolled back?<br>3.There are MCZone only Nebula lobbies.<br>4. I've experienced one glitch. That's pretty amazing considering the massive update was just released today (yesterday for some).<br>5. Er.. I don't know?<br>6. Hyperscale was paid to make the hubs. These lobbies are not found on any other server.<br>7. Why not? :P<br>8.I think the hub is amazing. Personal opinion though.<br>9. Really not too big of a deal :c<br>10. It's your choice whether or not you want to buy a donor rank. Many people have bought diamond.<br><br><br>

From what I can see, it was an immense amount of coding. Funky had to compile all of the game modes into one plugin while implementing new maps and kits. <br><br>Also, the fantastic website that was completely redesigned. I'd say it was quite a large update and was completely worth the wait.<br>

So you made this post just to complain? Dude if you are gonna leave by all means go ahead, but when you make his whole post just to bash avicore...you kinda just seem like a huge dbag. Everybody is entitled to their own opinions, but you just bringing hate to the forums for no reason? That's just wrong.

That would be great just leave instead of complaining. &nbsp;If you have suggestions, then give suggestions, not hate on it, a lot of people worked hard to put this together, and you are pretty much hitting them over the head because it is not to your liking. &nbsp;If you want to make it better, and know how to code, then submit your application to be a coder and help. &nbsp;Otherwise, leave. &nbsp;And what is with the comparison with OCN? &nbsp;There are like 100 more other servers that have similar formats and looks. &nbsp;

i just wanna thank all of you for proving my point, im clearly under attack here just because of the simple fact that i choose to feel a certain way about something and have a point of view,<br><br>my point of view is that Avicus hyped Avicore waayy too much, its not that great, and they took mczone from its loyal users, and gave us avicus and avicore instead which is again not that great, thats why i will be leaving and thats why avicus has been rapidly losing users since it started

1.hackers - There has always been hackers on any large server.&nbsp;<br>2.XP rollback - This is simply another bug that needs to be ironed out.&nbsp;<br>3.The classic maps have been butchered.. diamond replaced with gold... - We've decided to reduce the diamond on each map for more enjoyable gameplay for all, and not just for those in diamond.&nbsp;<br>4.Super glitchy games... even if all&nbsp;monuments are destroyed... the game doesn't end. - Again, we've only just released this new update, there will be a few bugs.<br>5.I get Kicked from avicade ALOT while waiting - Explain?<br>6.All the new maps are just rip offs from Hyperscale, and new maps have nothing to do with playability - Pretty sure it doesn't exactly matter what they look like...its just minecraft.&nbsp;<br>7.Why all the GOLD?!!! - See Above<br>8.Bad hub - A lot of people like it, thanks for expressing you're opinion<br>9.No more Donor Flight - I dont get it either, is it that big of a deal? Also you're not even a donator...<br>10.rank are WAAAY over priced no rank on ANY server should ever cost 100 dollars - Evidently you&nbsp;haven't seen the prices or any large server network. If you dont want to pay it, that is absolutely fine, but some people really want to support the server.&nbsp;

It's funny how you say "almost all the maps are rip offs from&nbsp;Hyperscale" when the only ones we have (and Hyperscale was paid for them) are Volcano, Fantasy, Magma, Mystic (which is worth mentioning was removed from the rotations) and the new lobby.

Well we aren't McZone anymore. We have a new update. You're correct. We're all entitled to our own opinions, but if you just don't enjoy the server just leave. There is no need to give hate.

I think, don't call me out here, but I think that the original author was talking about gold blocks in game. <br>

If you think $100 is over over priced,&nbsp;look at literally every faction server. Yeah $300+ ranks. Plus it's not your business how some people spend their money.&nbsp;

I saw a fly hacker and he got banned but... It was a little slow. The ranks should be 75$ Diamond 50$ Emerald 25$ Gold<br><br>

Actually it was not. Abandoned park was originally Candyland but the map creator (I forget who) decided to see what an amusement park version would look like. He decided that it was better off as the Abandoned Park and submitted that.&nbsp;

What do you mean half of the maps are Oc maps? If you mean OCN maps, we only had one which was submitted to them. It was submitted under a false name, and has been removed from the rots (Ravaged).

Mc zone was the best, especially with nexus. MC Zone Nexus was a PvP minigame, Avicore Nexus is a game of who can kill steal, oh and donors do the best all the time.

Usually donors do the best because they have a lot of experience with that mini-game. If you donate to a server, you're going to play on it a lot. From what I've seen so far, we don't get any special perks.

Do you even know how long it took to code all of this, props to you funky. Ok so i'd like to see u build a better server with more people and less hackers. You cant, and neither can I. So don't dis something that u cant do.

I hate when people think we rip off OCN maps. To answer your inquiry about Abandoned Park, that is in no damn way even close to Abandoned Zoo. It has a different everything. We also have never had any OCN maps in our repository besides Ravaged, which was submitted by the mapmaker but another author wanted it to be taken out. Stop spreading false info and not knowing what you are talking about.
