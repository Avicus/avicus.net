<b>99250</b>: oh boy. Where do I start? I met this guy a long time ago and here we are now. In the same team. This person is a great player to hangout with&nbsp;<br><br><b>TheMasterClock:&nbsp;</b>Oh god. Another player I knew for a long time. Clock is overall a nice and respectful player who can be funny and relaxed at one time and the next, he becomes serious.<br><br><b>VennyMouse</b>: I recently met Venny for REAL (I knew him as a player but nothing else). He is the leader of an amazing faction that Avius players play on. Venny is a great leader who got us through the Omega tournament with tactics and ideas that he always brought up we practiced. Venny is a player I can trust my life in. He is amazing.<br><br><b>Kycrafft</b>: The nub who is the co-leader of our faction in a faction server. He is a chill player to be with and I am glad I am working with him.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Heatless:</b> Knew this nub for a while. He is a great player to be with and a great partner to play offense with. Heatless is a fun and amazon player who can change a game's direction in seconds.<br><br><b>MasterProX:&nbsp;</b>I met Andrew only a couple of months ago. I used to think he used hacks XD. He is a great player to play with on Avicus and a great player who follows instructions and sticks with the plan we first started with. Thank you Andrew.<br><br><b>JanetReyes:</b> I barely knew him at the time. Amba is a great friend who was always there for me. I used to see him on OCN a lot when I stopped playing avicus for a while. Amba is overall a great player to play with.<br><br><b>Smitdalt:&nbsp;</b>He joined the team today and already he has shown remarkable bonds with our players. Smit is a great player to play with.<br><br><b>FrozenSolstice:</b> This gril is a great friend to play with. Even though she isn't active, in-game, that much, she is always there on Skype to chat about what we(BRZK) are talking about. Elsa is a great player to play with.<br><br><b>Hockey_:&nbsp;</b>Player I have never met before<br><br><b>_Jasun: &nbsp;</b>a great player who supports the team using the materials he obtains when he plays. Jasun is a great and chill player with a strong heart to keep a team together.<br><br><b>Jiphy:&nbsp;</b>New playe; I already played some factions with him and he is a chill player&nbsp;<br><br><b>legoman2302:&nbsp;</b>New player; I have chatted with him on TS and he is amazing. He ref'd some of our TOC matches and he is an overall great and wonderful player<br><br><b>RefuseToSink:&nbsp;</b>She is a great and chill gril<br><br><b>pherray/Sli: </b>Flat<br><br><b>Snoozin:</b> Badger was one of the first players I have ever net on avicus. He is a chill and amazing player to play with.<br><br><b>SilentStrikes/DemApplez:</b> Oh god. Another amazing player to play offense with. Silent can create plans on the spot during &nbsp;a game and he always supports the whole team. He plays offense with me and Andrew and he is a chill and great guy<b><br></b><br><b>Spookz:&nbsp;</b>New player; I've already a talked to him on TS and played factions with him and he is a great and chill guy.<br><br><b>steven5703:&nbsp;</b>Dank memes. Hi Steven. Steven is a great player who keeps our team happy and laughing. He may be childish, but when he plays, he is serious (other than his demonic screams).<br><br><b>ImNotBaxk/Jk:&nbsp;</b>Last but certainly not least, we have Jk. Jk has played offense with me for a long time. We played together with Sfk and other players and it's been a good run. He isn't that active anymore but when he is, he is always happy and chill pearls everything.<br><br><b>FIyHacks:&nbsp;</b>Who is this kid? He sucks<br><br><br>Thank you Berzerk for being a family to me.

<b>TheMasterClock/CockRacer:&nbsp;</b>He is very friendly and respectful, manages the team extremely well, and knows how to work in a team.<br><b>VennyMouse:&nbsp;</b>As a very serious player, Venny organizes practice sessions and gets the team in shape.<br><b>99250/Anthony:&nbsp;</b>He was one of my first friends on Avicus, and we've been in numerous teams together, including Atomic Warriors, FanC, and Berzerk. He is a very strong player, possesses exceptional leadership qualities, and<i style="color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; ">—</i>while he jokes around in the team chat—is dead serious while in-game.<br><b>MasterProX/Andrew:&nbsp;</b>He's probably one of my best friends on Avicus by now. We met a few months ago in the TGC (Apollo) chat, and he's a very skilled player who knows how to work in a team. See you in the L.A. Philharmonic.<br><b>kycrafft:&nbsp;</b>Ky is unlike anyone I've ever met. While being a skilled player in scrimmages and practice sessions, he is amazing in the clan chat, telling jokes and maintaining a positive atmosphere.<br><b>Heartless:&nbsp;</b>Heat is another old friend on Avicus. I've rushed with him numerous times, and we've had some amazing times together in the Spamship chat, Berzerk chat, and other clan chats.<br><b>_Jasun:&nbsp;</b>To be honest, I don't really know much about Jasun except that his skills are exceptional. Though quiet in the clan chat, he almost always attends practice sessions and is a loyal and valuable teammate.<br><b>DemApplez/Silent:&nbsp;</b>I don't know much about Silent either, since he's mostly&nbsp;<i>silent</i> in the chat. However, just like Jasun, his extraordinary skills make up for his absence in the clan chat.<br><b>Steven5703:&nbsp;</b>Like the two above, I don't know much about Steven, but he's a valuable player who's loyal to the team and provides to the clan chat a positive atmosphere.<br><b>FIyHacks/Seth:&nbsp;</b>I've known Seth for almost two years, back when I was accepted to FanC. As one of the most skilled rushers I've known, he and I have played together in numerous clans, including FanC, Berzerk, and Immortality.<br><b>Hockey_: </b>I don't think I've ever seen him talk in the clan chat, nor have I seen him in-game, so I basically know nothing about him.<br><b>JanetReyes/Amba: </b><b></b>Amba is always chill, both in the clan chat and in-game. Though he used to be an asshole to me before he was banned, he is now one of the friendliest people I've ever met.<br><b>RefuseToSink:</b> She's always chill, friendly, and fun to be around, both in-game and in the clan chat.<br><b>FrozenSolstice/Elsa:&nbsp;</b>I remember meeting Elsa back in December, and she's now one of my closest friends on Avicus as well. She's always friendly both in-game and in the chat, despite not being able to make most scrimmages due to timezone issues.<br><b>Legoman2302:&nbsp;</b>I don't really know much about Legoman since he was just accepted a few days ago, but he's already proved to be a valuable member, offering to look for scrimmages whenever we needed one.<br><b>Snoozin/Badger:&nbsp;</b>Though I knew Badger for a while, we haven't really talked much. He's a really chill and friendly player who shows complete loyalty to the team.<br><b>GetRacket_/Smitdalt:&nbsp;</b>I've known Smit for a while, though we haven't really talked either. I don't know much about him except for his skills in-game.<br><b>Jiphy:&nbsp;</b>I'll be honest here. I have absolutely no idea who this guy is, since he was only accepted two hours ago.<br><b>Alien:&nbsp;</b>Yes, I know he isn't in the team anymore, but I think it's necessary to include him anyway. He was one of the most valuable players, and I'm glad I invited him to the team months ago. His skills deserve serious respect, and his dirty mind brings constant laughter to the clan chat.<br><br>Thank you, Berzerk, for helping each other through tough times, supporting each other, and being some of the most amazing people I have ever met.<br><br>Wow, I can't English today.

<b>TheMasterClock/CockRacer:&nbsp;</b>He is very friendly and respectful, manages the team extremely well, and knows how to work in a team.<br><b>VennyMouse:&nbsp;</b>As a very serious player, Venny organizes practice sessions and gets the team in shape.<br><b>99250/Anthony:&nbsp;</b>He was one of my first friends on Avicus, and we've been in numerous teams together, including Atomic Warriors, FanC, and Berzerk. He is a very strong player, possesses exceptional leadership qualities, and<i style="color: rgb(37, 37, 37); font-family: sans-serif; ">—</i>while he jokes around in the team chat—is dead serious while in-game.<br><b>MasterProX/Andrew:&nbsp;</b>He's probably one of my best friends on Avicus by now. We met a few months ago in the TGC (Apollo) chat, and he's a very skilled player who knows how to work in a team. See you in the L.A. Philharmonic.<br><b>kycrafft:&nbsp;</b>Ky is unlike anyone I've ever met. While being a skilled player in scrimmages and practice sessions, he is amazing in the clan chat, telling jokes and maintaining a positive atmosphere.<br><b>Heartless:&nbsp;</b>Heat is another old friend on Avicus. I've rushed with him numerous times, and we've had some amazing times together in the Spamship chat, Berzerk chat, and other clan chats.<br><b>_Jasun:&nbsp;</b>To be honest, I don't really know much about Jasun except that his skills are exceptional. Though quiet in the clan chat, he almost always attends practice sessions and is a loyal and valuable teammate.<br><b>DemApplez/Silent:&nbsp;</b>I don't know much about Silent either, since he's mostly&nbsp;<i>silent</i> in the chat. However, just like Jasun, his extraordinary skills make up for his absence in the clan chat.<br><b>Steven5703:&nbsp;</b>Like the two above, I don't know much about Steven, but he's a valuable player who's loyal to the team and provides to the clan chat a positive atmosphere.<br><b>FIyHacks/Seth:&nbsp;</b>I've known Seth for almost two years, back when I was accepted to FanC. As one of the most skilled rushers I've known, he and I have played together in numerous clans, including FanC, Berzerk, and Immortality.<br><b>Hockey_: </b>I don't think I've ever seen him talk in the clan chat, nor have I seen him in-game, so I basically know nothing about him.<br><b>JanetReyes/Amba: </b><b></b>Amba is always chill, both in the clan chat and in-game. Though he used to be an asshole to me before he was banned, he is now one of the friendliest people I've ever met.<br><b>RefuseToSink:</b> She's always chill, friendly, and fun to be around, both in-game and in the clan chat.<br><b>FrozenSolstice/Elsa:&nbsp;</b>I remember meeting Elsa back in December, and she's now one of my closest friends on Avicus as well. She's always friendly both in-game and in the chat, despite not being able to make most scrimmages due to timezone issues.<br><b>Legoman2302:&nbsp;</b>I don't really know much about Legoman since he was just accepted a few days ago, but he's already proved to be a valuable member, offering to look for scrimmages whenever we needed one.<br><b>Snoozin/Badger:&nbsp;</b>Though I knew Badger for a while, we haven't really talked much. He's a really chill and friendly player who shows complete loyalty to the team.<br><b>GetRacket_/Smitdalt:&nbsp;</b>I've known Smit for a while, though we haven't really talked either. I don't know much about him except for his skills in-game.<br><b>Jiphy:&nbsp;</b>I'll be honest here. I have absolutely no idea who this guy is, since he was only accepted two hours ago.<br><b>Alien:&nbsp;</b>Yes, I know he isn't in the team anymore, but I think it's necessary to include him anyway. He was one of the most valuable players, and I'm glad I invited him to the team months ago. His skills deserve serious respect, and his dirty mind brings constant laughter to the clan chat.<br><br>Thank you, Berzerk, for helping each other through tough times, supporting each other, and being some of the most amazing people I have ever met.<br><br>Wow, I can't English today.

<b><i><u>EDIT:</u></i></b> They're all hot.&nbsp;<b><br><br><br>VennyMouse:&nbsp;</b>For a lot of players, I could say without them, it wouldn't be Berzerk. But without Venny, there is no team. He helped take charge of our team and lead us through TOC. He knows how to lead and deal with pressure. Venny puts in the work where others don't. Without him....well, we lost without him...<br><br><b>99250:&nbsp;</b>A great leader and an essential slave to our team during the matches, despite not getting the credit he deserves. Sometimes he's very serious and sometimes he's get a lighter mood. He puts up with the rest of our team. Either way, he's great to be around and I'm really glad to have him on my team.<br><br><b>TheMasterClock:&nbsp;</b>One of the most relaxed players I've ever met. Clock is super laided back and loves to make jokes. Despite having the loudest keyboard in history, he's still nice to see on TS!<br><br><b>Heatless:&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;A player who I underestimated at first. He is a lot better than most people probably think he is. Heat will calmly pull off an amazing rush and keep playing calmly. He has a great peesonality and a great rushing skill set.&nbsp;<br><br><b>_Jasun:&nbsp;</b>I know him as one of the top CTH players, but I never knew he played Nebula. In fact, I didn't know too much about him before we played on the same team. Jason doesn't say too much but having his calm and collective character can benefit any team<br><br><b>FrozenSolstice:&nbsp;</b>Frozen is one of he nicest and most mature people I know. She stands above a lot of the team in those areas. Even when faced with being on the same team with annoying NA pingers with a different&nbsp;<br>timezone, she handles it pretty well. She's incredibly patient with us even though we don't deserve it.&nbsp;<br><br><b>MasterProX:&nbsp;</b>In a weird way he's like (the male version of?) FrozenSolstice, very nice and more mature than the rest of us. Too bad there's only one of him to carry our team, honestly he knows how to work really well with the team<br><br><b>kycrafft:&nbsp;</b>Sometimes he pulls his weight but he falls into the void&nbsp;<i>way&nbsp;</i>too much. Also he is never serious. "The amount of people who take kycrafft seriously is sad." -zaidms, 2014<br><br><b>JanetReyes/Ambamore2000:&nbsp;</b>Not going to lie, he really used to be an asshole. However, after play with him for a few games and conversing with him in group chats on Skype, I can tell that he has definitely changed. I'm happy to know he's back.&nbsp;<br><br><b>DemApplez/SilentStrikes:&nbsp;</b>I'm just going to quote the Cory in the House theme song to describe him<br><i>I'm the new kid moving in<br></i><i>Getting it done<br>And I'm officially the candidate&nbsp;<br>For having some fun<br><br>I'm talking about an all out party<br>And we're getting it started<br>Mr. President, you mind some electric guitar?<br><br></i><i></i><b>FIyHacks/Sethskye:&nbsp;</b>Seth is always fun to be around. The jokes, the positivity and the confidence really help the team out when we need it. We can rely on I'm to get the job done. When we needed him in the finals, he stepped up with a great performance.&nbsp;<br><i><br><b></b></i><b>steven5703:&nbsp;</b>Oh steven, where would we be without you? TeamSpeak has never been more interesting than with you. With a pitch only matched by, a very scared Greg, your voice is always full of jokes and positivity. Nothing will ever be able to kill your voice, except for maybe the Spanish channel.&nbsp;<br><b><br></b><b>ImNotBack/JKawesome:&nbsp;</b>If only he actually came back :( . Oh well, we still have fun in the Berzerk chats. You're a nice guy to have a conversation with, no matter the topic, serious or otherwise. Also, please stay away from my Facebook. Thanks.&nbsp;<br><br><b>RefuseToSink:&nbsp;</b>Let's put it this way: The fact that you can put up with me and my stupid jokes is more than I can ask of you. I really appreciate that. If you can handle idiots, you'll go far in life.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Hockey_:&nbsp;</b>I haven't really met you that well, but you've been a nice guy so far. Hopefully we'll be able to play together on the team.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Snoozin/Jiphy/Legoman2302/Spookz__:&nbsp;</b><br>Sorry to lump you guys together, but despite knowing a couple of you for some time, I still haven't personally met you guys very well. But hey, I'm looking forward to seeing the team grow with good players. I'm sure it was a good choice to accept you guys c:<br><br><b>GetRacked_/smidalt:&nbsp;</b>He's a f*cking beast<br><br>Edit:<br><br>I'd also like to talk about two players who've left<br><br><b>AlienApplez/AlienAxuz:&nbsp;</b>He has never complained and always done his job. When we needed someone to count on, he came through. He was committed to the team and never let us down. Hell, he even defended for us against Kyudo for the las half of the game. Our team won't be the same now. And don't worry, I'll buy you that drink I owe you sometime.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Upsoar:&nbsp;</b>He was never negative, he never gave up and he never let us down. He had problems with some of our members but he stuck with us until the end. For that I have the upmost respect for him. Upsoar, you are an incredible person. I'm glad to have played with you and I hope that BC will be a good fit.(And I hope you get that trial you've been waiting for)

<b><i><u>EDIT:</u></i></b> They're all hot.&nbsp;<b><br><br><br>VennyMouse:&nbsp;</b>For a lot of players, I could say without them, it wouldn't be Berzerk. But without Venny, there is no team. He helped take charge of our team and lead us through TOC. He knows how to lead and deal with pressure. Venny puts in the work where others don't. Without him....well, we lost without him...<br><br><b>99250:&nbsp;</b>A great leader and an essential slave to our team during the matches, despite not getting the credit he deserves. Sometimes he's very serious and sometimes he's get a lighter mood. He puts up with the rest of our team. Either way, he's great to be around and I'm really glad to have him on my team.<br><br><b>TheMasterClock:&nbsp;</b>One of the most relaxed players I've ever met. Clock is super laided back and loves to make jokes. Despite having the loudest keyboard in history, he's still nice to see on TS!<br><br><b>Heatless:&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;A player who I underestimated at first. He is a lot better than most people probably think he is. Heat will calmly pull off an amazing rush and keep playing calmly. He has a great peesonality and a great rushing skill set.&nbsp;<br><br><b>_Jasun:&nbsp;</b>I know him as one of the top CTH players, but I never knew he played Nebula. In fact, I didn't know too much about him before we played on the same team. Jason doesn't say too much but having his calm and collective character can benefit any team<br><br><b>FrozenSolstice:&nbsp;</b>Frozen is one of he nicest and most mature people I know. She stands above a lot of the team in those areas. Even when faced with being on the same team with annoying NA pingers with a different&nbsp;<br>timezone, she handles it pretty well. She's incredibly patient with us even though we don't deserve it.&nbsp;<br><br><b>MasterProX:&nbsp;</b>In a weird way he's like (the male version of?) FrozenSolstice, very nice and more mature than the rest of us. Too bad there's only one of him to carry our team, honestly he knows how to work really well with the team<br><br><b>kycrafft:&nbsp;</b>Sometimes he pulls his weight but he falls into the void&nbsp;<i>way&nbsp;</i>too much. Also he is never serious. "The amount of people who take kycrafft seriously is sad." -zaidms, 2014<br><br><b>JanetReyes/Ambamore2000:&nbsp;</b>Not going to lie, he really used to be an asshole. However, after play with him for a few games and conversing with him in group chats on Skype, I can tell that he has definitely changed. I'm happy to know he's back.&nbsp;<br><br><b>DemApplez/SilentStrikes:&nbsp;</b>I'm just going to quote the Cory in the House theme song to describe him<br><i>I'm the new kid moving in<br></i><i>Getting it done<br>And I'm officially the candidate&nbsp;<br>For having some fun<br><br>I'm talking about an all out party<br>And we're getting it started<br>Mr. President, you mind some electric guitar?<br><br></i><i></i><b>FIyHacks/Sethskye:&nbsp;</b>Seth is always fun to be around. The jokes, the positivity and the confidence really help the team out when we need it. We can rely on I'm to get the job done. When we needed him in the finals, he stepped up with a great performance.&nbsp;<br><i><br><b></b></i><b>steven5703:&nbsp;</b>Oh steven, where would we be without you? TeamSpeak has never been more interesting than with you. With a pitch only matched by, a very scared Greg, your voice is always full of jokes and positivity. Nothing will ever be able to kill your voice, except for maybe the Spanish channel.&nbsp;<br><b><br></b><b>ImNotBack/JKawesome:&nbsp;</b>If only he actually came back :( . Oh well, we still have fun in the Berzerk chats. You're a nice guy to have a conversation with, no matter the topic, serious or otherwise. Also, please stay away from my Facebook. Thanks.&nbsp;<br><br><b>RefuseToSink:&nbsp;</b>Let's put it this way: The fact that you can put up with me and my stupid jokes is more than I can ask of you. I really appreciate that. If you can handle idiots, you'll go far in life.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Hockey_:&nbsp;</b>I haven't really met you that well, but you've been a nice guy so far. Hopefully we'll be able to play together on the team.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Snoozin/Jiphy/Legoman2302/Spookz__:&nbsp;</b><br>Sorry to lump you guys together, but despite knowing a couple of you for some time, I still haven't personally met you guys very well. But hey, I'm looking forward to seeing the team grow with good players. I'm sure it was a good choice to accept you guys c:<br><br><b>GetRacked_/smidalt:&nbsp;</b>He's a f*cking beast<br><br>Edit:<br><br>I'd also like to talk about two players who've left<br><br><b>AlienApplez/AlienAxuz:&nbsp;</b>He has never complained and always done his job. When we needed someone to count on, he came through. He was committed to the team and never let us down. Hell, he even defended for us against Kyudo for the las half of the game. Our team won't be the same now. And don't worry, I'll buy you that drink I owe you sometime.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Upsoar:&nbsp;</b>He was never negative, he never gave up and he never let us down. He had problems with some of our members but he stuck with us until the end. For that I have the upmost respect for him. Upsoar, you are an incredible person. I'm glad to have played with you and I hope that BC will be a good fit.(And I hope you get that trial you've been waiting for)

The loudest keyboard ever are the ones with Cherry MX greens. Ik for a fact that Clock has a blackwidow, which are a little lighter than the greens (cherry and razer green switches are different) which make them less noisy. So he has the second lightest keyboard xD.

You're such a great person and you are never unkind to anyone. You just stay being you and i'll be happy forever. You defend, you offend, you midline you god mate. G0D. BC oldtime best old timer.<br><br>Upsoar : Another newbie :^) from when i've met you and played with you, you're a damn strong defender who always speaks theiir minds and gives some great calls, not only that you're one hell of a pvper and that really surpried me, PVP legend in the making!&nbsp;<br><br>Danikas : When i trialled for Instant damage that time you were by far the nicest guy that introduced me into everyone and in general was so nice.
