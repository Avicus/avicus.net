Okay, time travel IS INDEED PLAUSIBLE! (or even possible)<br><br>In the sense that you can only go to the future, but never return back to the past.<br><br>How is this possible?<br>Time Dilation.&nbsp;<br><br>If you don't know what that is GET SEARCHING!!<br><br>So if I spend a specific amount of time, in a specific place where time is PULLED slower, back at Earth it would've past a certain amount of time. So I can even go 30 years ahead in time.. but never return back 30 years.<br><br>C<br>O<br>N<br>T<br>R<br>I<br>B<br>U<br>T<br>E<br>!

Works thanks to Albert Einsteins theory of relativity. It basically works because time and space are both connected and relatives to each other. What you have to do is try bending space as much as you can. For us humans the best way to do that is by going really really fast. And by fast I mean about 50% of c, so time dilation really kicks in. Ofc the faster you go the better it works.

Gravitational waves were discovered recently, and were also part of his theory. This also changed everything, from time travel studies to black hole relativity

Gravitainoal waves were the very last step to proving general relativity right. Can't say the same about special relativity though I think ?

E=m*v^2 - you need a lot of energy to reach sub-light speed to travel in future. 10-ton spaceship needs 2,25*10^20 joules of energy to reach c/2 speed. Where will you get so much? Today it is almost impossible.&nbsp;So you should burn ~5,5*10^9 tons of oil for example and you cant take it with you, cause it waighs a lot. So much oil all countries will product in 1,5 years.

For time dilation to really kick in we would only need 50% light speed. There are some ways to achieve that kind of speed. One way is a anti matter reactor that harnesses the power of protons and anti protons coliding and cancelling each other out, to create thrust. Another way is creating a tiny blackhole which is replanished by lasers fireing visible light. Thanks to hawking radiation (virtual particles at the edge of the blackhole and and inside the blackhole cancelling and disappearing back into their energy field) we can also use that as energy.

But not nowadays. How you will store antimatter? You need some force fields, wich also need energy. Lasers needs energy as well. And how to turn back ship at this speed? What about centrifugal forces? I want to go back to Earth after this travel :O

I literally thought about this not to long ago, but if that were possible, it may also be possible to develop super speed. If the individual were to go in the future for seconds, they could slow down time around them. I got this theory from XMEN(?) where they went to save Magneto in the Pentegon and there was a scene of the lightening dude running around in slowed time.

If by super speed you mean faster than light then the only way to go fast than light is by not moving through space but by moving space around us. c isn't the max speed in the universe. c is the max speed things can move through space. If we can move space it's self then you can go as fast you want. You would have to retract space infront of you and expand it behind you somehow which ofc we have no idea how

The problem with moving faster than light is that, according to the theory of relativity, you would need infinite energy to maintain such a speed long enough for that to occur. Also, the sheer speed would turn anyone who attempted to travel at that velocity into atoms.<br><br>In my opinion, it's good that we can't travel in time. I don't particularly like the idea of people messing with time travel. Genetically modifying babies, crops, etc. and changing the very laws of nature (e.g. trying to create babies using the DNA of 3 people) is far enough for me. There comes a point in time (no pun intended) when scientists need to stop and think carefully about what they are doing.

You can simply say that there isn't infinite energy + even if you would have "infinite energy" (Just imagine it), then how do you work with it? You'd probably need infinite room to place that infinite energy and to move it, you'd need another infinite energy again and again... I hope I don't confuse someone with my shit explaining skills :c

Isn't it just that "two massive objects ..." are producing bigger/stronger/idk g. waves? I thought every mass would create those waves, but to detect them, you'd have to find very... idk. large waves? xDD<br><br><b>Please correct me if I'm wrong!<br>Thanks</b>

No, one object that is rotating around itx axes doesn't produce any at all. Only two objects orbiting each other can produce gravitational waves

Another problem BTW would be that gravitational waves don't bend space in all directions, they do it in a cross pattern. So we would probably need four extremely strong waves to bend space like that (2 in front and back each). This is how gravitational waves bend space.&nbsp;<br>￼&nbsp;<img src="http://i.imgur.com/tQeksPx.gif"><br>Love you too :p

You would need to create a machine that is durable enough to survive the sheer force of travelling at that speed, so I highly doubt that obstacles are going to pose much danger.

The closest HABITABLE planet to us humans is Wolf 1061c, 14 light years away. The fastest thing that a human has made, Solar Helios Probe can travel up to 70,000 m/s.. even with that speed it would take us 4285 years approx..<br><br>yeah sad but true

We are only assuming that their is some of it on the Moon, but there still isn't alot. We could use it for research, but we might aswell send missions to the moon or robots and not have to colonize it. Mars is way easier to terraform and turn into a habitable planet. We just have to warmen up the climate on Mars (in which hummanity is a really good sadly .-. ) and most of our problems are fixed :P We can do it the fast way and the slow way. Slow way would be filling the atmosphere with methan and CO2 and other gases or the idea Elon Musk (my lord and saviour) proposed, Blow up thermonuclear bombs on both poles. (it's as crazy as it sounds but it might actually work, it's just WAAAAY too risky)
