I haven't been around much even though I want to. &nbsp;It was 1 week probation or demtion. I took demtion and the retired rank. It was truly fun meeting so many new people. And have a lot of fun as staff. But my time has come. This is not a goodbye. This is just my step down I will still be around playing and what not. I might not be on Teamspeak as much though. ;)

We are back at how much staff members there used to be when Avicus had just started...<br><br>Pretty sad. <br><br>Some of which didn't even deserve to be demoted, Im not here to start a flame war... Just here to make you guys have a step back and look at what Avicus was and now currently is...

Well thanks for the time that you did spend moderating no matter how small/ large. Every hacker banned and rule breaker punished helps :)

The staff team is not falling apart... Inactivity and other issues have simply lessened its size and efficiency. Luckily we will have an influx of new Jr Moderators up for the task soon.

;( even if we are low on moderators it is good that we have a lot going through interviews right now, which means there will be a lot more mods.

Peachy is the best moderator we have. (My opinion, don't kill me.) If he gets demoted, then someone is gonna kick Howsie's face in.
