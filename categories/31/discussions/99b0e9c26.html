If this thing comes into play, then I guess Avicus will keep going for about another 2 or 3 months....<br>and then go down.... *sad faces*<br><br>and then hopefully buycraft will refund all of our donor money...<br><br>sad that Mojabg has to be so greedy and selfish.

Still deciding how we're going to handle the donator ranks, but no, unless we dont get enough donators in, avicus will remain up and operational. We've just got to come up with better ways to attract donators.

From what i heard, Mojang just doesn't want pay to win servers.<br><br><br>PErks are fine for donors like pets and gizmos. As long as one of the perks do not give an advantage in gameplay, its fine. Grenades for example need to be remove because they give an advantage in gameplay. So, Avicus is not doomed unless they dont remove the advantage perks. Hypixel is screwed however :/

Since it can't be pay-to-win, maybe everyone has the same stuff but donators get more of it?<br>For example, reg players can but 3 grenades, gold 5, emerald 7, diamond 8, for all the same points? Xp boost isn't p2w, maybe diamond could change color of text/name.

We will have to remove several features that supposedly make the gameplay unfair. Either the purpose of XP will have to change or the multipliers will have to be removed. We will be sure to compensate the best we can, though Mojang is making it pretty difficult. Do not expect anything that modifies an individual's gameplay (positively or negatively) as Mojang is strictly against this. Once we figure it out we will announce it properly.<br><br>(<a rel="nofollow" href="http://avicus.net/forums/6e4bb6e16?page=1#reply28111">http://avicus.net/forums/6e4bb6e16?page=1#reply28111</a>)

Players are going to pay if they like to play, maybe different types of games no other server has. Sure, a few familiar games will encourage players to play more, but we have no unique ones.&nbsp;<br>Nexus is kit PvP, Nebula is DTM (a litttle uncommon, but I see servers like that.), Walls is popular, control the hill is king of the hill, Avicade is arcade, and elim is hunger games with chests. All of our games are on different servers, with minor tweaks.<br>We say we strive to be unique, so why not do what we say?

Funky and I (as well as probably 1/3 of the forums) have suggested adding merchandise to the Avicus shop. I'm not sure if it counts towards Mojang's standards of "running a business through OUR game" or not. But I find it might be a good way to bounce back from losing a lot of donations.&nbsp;<br><br>These should be homemade with love and care &lt;3<br>#FunkyFacePlushy<br>Im sure we can find someone from the Avicus community or a random irl friend to do this.

Well, wouldnt getting rid of the donator kits be a solution to the EULA? I mean, as funky said, there could be a different meaning for exp... Maybe kits could be unlocked by how many kills you get, and that experience is just a level, kind of like how nebula was before avicore

Basically the whole perk system shouldn't be changed. All kits are balanced and have drawbacks to them. And prestiging with XP doesn't allow you to win, it just shows that you like to play on the server a lot.<br><br>Just watch....Mojang is going to set up donor ranks in their Realms servers....<br><br>Theyre so&nbsp;<i>greedy</i>!

Aesthetical items are fine, just nothing that really affects gameplay.<br><br>Only things that Avicus will have to remove is kits for donors by removing them or making them accesable by everyone and possibly the experience multiplier because you do get items with experience.<br><br>Will you get money back if you donated? Probably not.

XP boost probably wont be kept as you unlock kits by leveling up. If donors level up faster (with the boost) they have an advantage over non-donors (with more kits) which would break the EULA

For only donors? That might work since its not in-game but the xp you get in-game.

In the lobby it doesnt matter but looking at the shop /tp is also in Walls. If players can tp to other players while playing in there, then it affects it.

Ok. Heres what we do.<br>Donors gain xp bonus as usual in certain games (Not nexus or any other kit games). However one change, mainly to nebula. Remove level requirements to gain items. Make xp plainly for show.&nbsp;Add what your level is by when you chat. So it would be like<br>27 Stealthbomber16: I'm level 27!<br>Prestige would be like this<br>1 Stealthbomber16*: I prestiged!<br>Levels and prestige are now clearly showing how skilled you are in the game. Level 1's are expected to be worse than prestige level 1's. You can also take a page out of uberminecrafts book and make each game require you to donate for it to have donator status.

As long as only people that are spectating can do it. It does not give ANY player an advantage. Just allows you to tp to somebody specific and watch them.
