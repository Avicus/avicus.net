Hey guys some of you may remember who I am, I am Blade/Bradley. I am back on avicus after taking almost 6 months off. I finally have a good and beast pc too play! I'm so glad to be back guys let me tell you. Now everyone I sorta left at the most stupidest time I could when staff applications were going on and I logged on to the forums today to find I got accepted for an interview well I blew it but guys I left because of family issues and not having a good pc mainly the family issues my mom was really sick and I didn't know what do to I just picked up and left all my good friends aswell no one knew what I was doing or where I was. So I decided to make this to tell everyone I am back and look foward to applying for staff again when that day comes even if I will apply but I am back guys and I have matured alot more and I have better pvping skills. I look forward to playing with everyone!. :) ~Never Give Up On Anything Even If People Tell You, You Can't Do It Because Show Them You Can -Blade
