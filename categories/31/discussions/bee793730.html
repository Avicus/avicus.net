i totally agree with you man.. in fact in very recent times we've been peaking at around 150 people tops....&nbsp;<br>But for suggestions i think that Youtube is one way, i am aware that there are many YouTubers playing on Avicus, myself included and i think that if just ONE of us could blow up on YouTube, then Avicus would go viral, i mean if Sky or PewDiePie played Avicus we would gain thousands upon thousands of people, but so far xMinkks has been the only Youtuber tp play Avicus that has reached beyond 10 000 subscribers...<br><br>Also maybe our server just needs to be more OUT there kind of thing, like we should try and get it listed on more websites and mentioned on Facebook, which is not quite advertising.. i have been trying to do this through some sites and especially on Youtube (in comments, on videos, etc.)<br><br>I am with you, man, if you would like help with anything on boosting the server just contact me anyway you can and id be glad to help!

I don't really know what is going on, senior staff is leaving, almost no posts from the owner , no updates to think of, other than map updates, no game mode changes / corrections / updates / etc. / way more server population loss than other servers / all and all I would think that the avicus. Network may be on the way out.

This is a great idea. I love it. But there is other ways to Expand Avicus without Youtube.<br><br>Use social networks: such as Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook.<br>You can find many minecraft players using these kinds of networks. Just simply ask them to join.

I do have a few suggestions that COULD boost the player rate up, maybe a bit or alot.&nbsp;<br>Firstly, there could be more staff hosted events with rewards such as a week/month of a certain donation rank or xp on a selected gamemode, whatever suits the host. This idea could help more if there could be roles for event hosts etc.<br>Secondly, a new gamemode could be made, something that draws in loads of players. We could always do things to boost the player count on gamemodes not used because the only game modes I see used are nexus (loads) the walls (little) and Capture the Hill (rarely peaks up to 15+) Don't get me wrong, it could be my timezone that might impair me from seeing people on these gamemodes.&nbsp;<br>Thirdly, this is another thing that could be to do with my timezone, but I don't see much staff on weekdays, there are usuals that I sometimes see (not going to mention any). More staff means that more players that are breaking the rules (swearing, spamming and hackers) could get punished which would result in a less steep decline in players.<br>I will not take offense to anyone who doesn't agree to these three ways, in fact I will enjoy reading what others think about these three.

I can honestly tell you guys what the issue is, we are not allowed to have our own opinions and thoughts about anything. If you think of something that has been said before and post a topic about it, you get attacked with posts about how it has been addressed before, if you come with suggestions how something can be improved you are attacked yet again. You are even attacked in-game if you're not a "famous" or "well-known" player, I know the moderators are aware of this but nobody is doing anything about it, that's why Avicus is destroying their own reputation and losing players every day.

I have a facebook acc. Its Warmartial Zintenka. I dont use it much tho...<br><br>Now, how do i make a post about Avicus on Facebook. Because usually, whenever I make a topic. (Was in a Starhawk forums) Ppl like to randomly be jerks and stuff.&nbsp;<br><br>Anyway, here are my suggestions:<br><br>Add new and old gamemodes:<br><br><b>CTW:&nbsp;</b>Not sure how this is dead or whatever but A LOT of ppl loved it including myself. I don't know why your not adding it but please listen to the community.&nbsp;<br><br>This probably knocked off 100+ players from the population.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Skywars:&nbsp;</b>Many ppl loved it. I find it meh... its ok. But this probably knocked off 50+ ppl from population.<br><br><b>Make punishments more lenient:&nbsp;</b>Yeah, i here ppl getting punished for caps lock or excessive infractions. No reason to ban them.<br><br>For the caps lock, if they apologize or not, just warn them. If they continue, kick them.<br><br>For excessive infractions, just warn them. Say this: "You have too many infractions. One more heavy infraction (<b>kicks or warns dont count)&nbsp;</b>then you will be permabanned.&nbsp;<b>(if they haven't been banned already.)<br><br>Listen to ppl's minigame suggestions:&nbsp;</b>Ive seen many gamemodes "accepted" but none added. I know its hard to code so I'll leave this alone.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Sites to advertise on:&nbsp;</b>Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, any minecraft server forums. (Except forums owned by servers like oc.tc)&nbsp;<br><br><b>Be more accepting of TNT:&nbsp;</b>Yeah, this. Many of you are close-minded.&nbsp;<b>(doesn't mean stupid)&nbsp;</b>It means that you don't take easy to change or difference. Your not adaptable.&nbsp;<br><b><br></b>C'mon. The time is soon. If we implement a lot of TNT maps, many OCN players will com here too.<br><b><br></b><b>Thank you for listening.</b><b><br></b>

1. McZone has 1,000+ players at peak time.<br>2. Avicus is a downgrade of McZone IMO, everything has gotten worse, not to be rude.<br>3. Avicus is a main focus of aesthetics, not gameplay.<br>There is a lot more reasons why we lost players.

Hi! and First of all this is my opinion, How do you think they are going to get 2000+ players if the staff keep banning people for doing nothing, and yes I've got banned for client side mods by AviGill wich is not true, DoctaPop banned my friend for kill aura, wich is not true either, I did a ban appeal, took 4 days to get a reponse by the avicus support, and my ban appeal was denied, that's not fair, If they keep banning the wrong people the server is going down... Again this is my opinion, I don't wanna get in problems with anybody and I'm being nice, please and don't tell me ''there is an avicus support e mail'' I know I shouldnt be doing this but I need to say it... so yeah this is my opinion, and sorry for my bad english....

Hi! and First of all this is my opinion, How do you think they are going to get 2000+ players if the staff keep banning people for doing nothing, and yes I've got banned for client side mods by AviGill wich is not true, DoctaPop banned my friend for kill aura, wich is not true either, I did a ban appeal, took 4 days to get a reponse by the avicus support, and my ban appeal was denied, that's not fair, If they keep banning the wrong people the server is going down... Again this is my opinion, I don't wanna get in problems with anybody and I'm being nice, please and don't tell me ''there is an avicus support e mail'' I know I shouldnt be doing this but I need to say it... so yeah this is my opinion, and sorry for my bad english....

Wow I just realized I have about 30 IRL friends who play Minecraft but I've been so greedy with Avicus by not sharing it because it's such an amazing server I want it all to myself xD Well I'm on my way to school atm so when I get there I'll share it with em! ;)

How should the server handle 250, 500, or even 1000 players when it can't handle over 50 - 100 without lag and timing out players? No, Avicus needs much much work before you even think about milestones.

@&nbsp;<span><a rel="nofollow" href="http://avicus.net/jrl143">jrl143</a>&nbsp;&gt; This is the Average</span><br>@&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://avicus.net/Ruyfilos10">Ruyfilos10</a>&nbsp;&gt; Umm, keep to topic please<br><br>@<a rel="nofollow" href="http://avicus.net/S3M3L">S3M3L</a>&nbsp;&gt; This server has no lagg for me even when there is 1232 players (back in AVICUs 1.2 not AVICUS 2.0) Avicus is completely Capable. This is not about all about milestones this is mostly about suggesting ideas to make the server grow like MC ZONE / OLD AVICUS, Of course there is some milestones though.
