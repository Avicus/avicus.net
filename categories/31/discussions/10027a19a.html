<h2>What is this thread about?</h2>This isn't a post to notify all of you that I won't be here for a couple weeks due to a holiday, this is more of a leaving post. With my mindset at the moment I don't know how I feel and I can't come back if I say I am leaving; therefore I am telling you all i'll be "going inactive". Slowly I have been decreasing my playtime on the server and some people have noticed it and told me. I guess I am just saying that I probably won't be a regular anymore.<br><br><i>Because of all this I am ending my Top 5 skype and making a new one to continue talking to people from this community.<br></i><i>Add:&nbsp;<b></b></i><b><i>tynvale.community</i></b><br><br>I have had to urge to do this for a while and the only thing stopping me was the community. I love talking to lots of you guys on here and you don't realize how good a small community is until you try and put &nbsp;yourself in a bigger one, like I know tons of people in every game I join on Avicus and I lose that on other servers.<br><br><h2>A Couple Thank You's!&nbsp;</h2>During my time in this community I have mad a lot of friends and I am quickly going to acknowledge that by saying some words to a few of them, if you want to skip reading them feel free.<br><br><b>Sess:&nbsp;</b>We started talking regularly to eachother when you came to me and threw up the idea of creating a team, thus Cronus was born. I know I didn't do much as leader but to my surprise you didn't really mind, or at least you didn't show it to me! With this I became more comfortable talking to you and the roasts started heading my way. In all seriousness I can't thank you enough for putting up with me, being there when I needed to talk to someone and just overall being a great guy!<br><br><b>Snowlas:&nbsp;</b>It's ironic that I put you guys together but the memories I have with both of you seem to be all of us together, we casually talked a lot and we just had a ton of fun in TS. You both seem to be the main source of quotes in that thread and it always made me laugh. Snow I want to personally thank you for being there when I needed assistance and dealing with my constant roasts!<br><br><b>Harry &amp; Pal</b><b>:&nbsp;</b>Both of you became really good buddies of mine and even though you both are trolls, every time I needed to talk to someone you were both where there to help. You two were probably the people that I got along with the most on the server, so thanks for being great friends.<br><br><b>Laggeh:&nbsp;</b>da pVP g0D! I first noticed you when you sent in a clip for the very first Top 5 episode, I got to talk to you more when you came back to Avicus and eventually we became really good friends. I look like trash at pvp next to you and I was so happy when I got that fluke win in a 1v1 because of your pot lag! Good luck with you channel :)<br><br><b>Most of Apollo:</b> Other than my own team Cronus, I loved talking to the majority of you. I would point out the people to personally thank them but I don't want this thread to be too long even though it is already. I just want to say thanks for all the good memories and for letting me sub for you once or twice even though I am trash! xd<br><br><i>There are a ton more thank you's I can say to people but I needed to keep the thread somewhat short.</i><br><br><h2>What does this mean for my channel?</h2>It will continue as normal, doing funny moments and other random videos, I just won't be making my channel Avicus based anymore. This means that the Top 5 series as well as the others have been stopped, which before I go any further I want to say thanks for what you all made that series become. The Top 5 series blew up my channel in a way I never thought was going to happen, and without it I would be where I am today. I understand if a lot of you stop viewing my channel but if you want to keep in touch with me, honestly keeping up to date with the channel is probably the best way!<br><br>So if you'd like to keep viewing me that's up to you, but if you ever lose my channel link for some reason here it is:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Tynvale" title="Link: https://www.youtube.com/user/Tynvale">Click me!</a><br><br><h2>Maybe my final goodbye, I guess?</h2>It feels so crazy that I am about to do this, but at some point all good things come to an end. I did a lot, spent a lot and played a lot on this server and made friends I won't forget anytime soon, so thanks everyone and be sure to stay in touch with me in the Skype I listed near the beginning. I will reply to every comment I can on this thread and lastly, I wish I put this much effort into school essays or something because DAMN this is a lot of writing!

But in all seriousness Tynvale you were a great mate I rate 8/8 while I... you know... yep! Thanks for all that you have done for me and Avicus over all see as though you never really did get to record with me and Frozen thats fine *cries in a corner* but hopefully I will cease that opportunity and record with you... Someday I will be the ultimate wing man.

Before I say anything else, just know I am just leaving Avicus, not saying goodbye to you! I will keep in touch with you because as you said <i>"</i><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; "><i>You are easily one of my best friends on avicus,"&nbsp;</i>and you know I'll always be there if you ever need me! You are one of the few I really could call a friend and I will never forget that! &lt;3333</span>

Sorry, but I need to explore new things! I will come visit from time to time for sure! I will always remember you as the first person in this community I ever talked to on TS and I will miss you a ton!!! But hey, who knows, this may not be forever, just for the time being.

Bye Lachy :(<br>I remember the very first time I used to converse with you back in the day, and started watching your videos. How times have changed. Since you started YouTube I know that everyone watching them saw you grow into a better person, PvPer, and commentator.<br><br>We did have some fun times when we were both mods, but I wish we had more. Time zones aren't friendly to Australians and Americans unfortunately. Nevertheless, I hope that your channel continues to grow wherever you want to take it, and you do as well. I hope we can chat on Skype sometimes and make sure to come back once in a while.

After putting in some thought I decided not to do the applications and instead officailly announce the new Top 5 host in a new thread.
