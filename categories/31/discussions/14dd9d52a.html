First of all, I would like to announce that I lasted longer than Zeusy. It has been almost 2 years since I started my Jr. Mod trial on this server and even with all the shit, I have come across I am happy about my time here. I was never someone who followed others so quickly or defend others if they messed up. From day one I became a huge pain in the ass for anyone that was a senior moderator or admin and I made some interesting friends in that time. I believe I helped turn the whole team upside down by teaching others that being independent&nbsp;and having ideas wasn't harmful. By around May I got leaked information (leakers lol) that I was to be demoted for my behavior while blackmailing was happening in the senior team. So I did the common bitch move and retired before I could be demoted. While this happened one of the admins out of the worst admin team retired and Sessp came about. Also, say what you want about Sessp, he is terrible at communicating and his ideas are not the best sometimes but he was better than the spineless administrator team we had back then. Even if the admin with the bigger spine came later. I came back after being asked by multiple people and my course work and social life were intact enough to support this move. I became senior mod in a month and slowly did more as the time goes by. When Fouled became inactive during March I went to Sessp and said there was a need for another admin. Seth retired around this time and I guess I was next in line or something. Fouled came back and we worked hard for a while trying to figure out the advertisement and other issues that Brandon (K_R_Cord) helped out with a lot. Sadly I believe the person who got the most beating out of everyone in this server was Kord because when he was very focused on advertising. Things weren't communicated to him and it just made a huge mess. A month ago I got offered to start writing on a newspaper and I have been enjoying that a lot. In the end my love for Minecraft has been lowered to the point I started to not care for the server. I have seen the damage an inactive admin can do and I would not want to be one of those admins that were credited in doing nothing. I disagree with certain things this server is doing and agree with others. At this point, I do not know if the server will rise or fall, all I know is that certain things can't keep happening. There needs to be more communication coming out of the Owners to parts of the server that need it. Map Developers need to work together closer with each other and the community to know what the community wants and organize maps being built. And for fucks sake promote Koja to Map Developer he knows how to XML and build maps. He can do things. I will come on once in a while but I don't believe it will be anywhere close to what it used to be. Also I could of split this up into paragraphs but it looks less inviting to read.<br><br>Also, I am doing and AMA. My first one in 2 years where staff guidelines are not restricting with what I say to the point I care. (They could take away my retired rank but I do not believe I will come back anytime soon)

1. No<br>2. Carrying the back of the mentor team when there were 3 mentors was a fun experience because I was the only person who interacted with juniors and I got to shape them to be the best they could be. Also, maybe I shouldn't say this but personally demoting Arigenn felt great.&nbsp;<br>3. Funny enough people are going to laugh when I say this but Tazz probably benefited the server the most at my time as mod. Tazz was a huge bitch to the system and with a team of people constantly saying yes to bad ideas you got someone who told the seniors to fuck off was what they needed. What I like about the senior team now is that we don't always agree and conversations happen out of these things. We find mistakes faster than the older senior teams. I credit Tazz with this even if the server thought he was some kid that somehow got mod (Which he was)<br>4. Not even close to being the oldest staff member.&nbsp;<br>5. I didn't want you as moderator at first. The whole "L" situation really annoyed me but you softened up and became a good moderator. I feel you still try too hard but try not to look like it. Just be yourself and learn from your mistakes and don't worry about the road ahead. Do you.

Doing the April Fools prank was extremely fun. People thought DTM was actually being removed and seeing all the complaints in my DMs really made me feel like we did a good prank even though it was very obvious it was.&nbsp;<br>Also promoting Passively was fun because I pranked him thinking he was being demoted or something before being promoted.

I could see you being promoted to senior moderator. You are very comfortable&nbsp;in your position and don't overly try your ass off to the point you are obviously trying to get it.

first time I met you I felt you were very tryhardish. You are a lot calmer now about certain things and have come a long way. I still think you try a little too hard and I will put my advice in here as well. Calm down and remember it is ok to make mistakes as long as you learn them. If you try so hard to avoid them you won't grow at all.

Take it from someone who has seen everything. The server could either stalemate itself to death or the Owners could go where they think they should go and start with that. It can probably start doing better (Not at the point with over a 1000 players) but we can pick up quickly. and I hope they start cutting the BS that has been happening lately.

Official you rose up to a stage no one wanted to do. I have a lot of respect for you in this aspect but you shouldn't try to do everything. Also, Brandon feels sorry about leaving you in the middle of a tournament. As a mod I think you should ease back a bit and go with the flow. Try to change what you think should change and help other mods. You have lots to learn as a mentor as well so focus on that.

Avicus is a server that suffered from weak administration who focused on little things that don't matter in the end. We finally have people focusing on shit that needs to be done and even if I do not agree with everything that has been done, we are getting it. I love the concept of team pvp&nbsp;since I did come from OCN before.

1. Depends on my college semester. First semester it was Friday and the second one it was Thursday. All I know is I hate Mondays.<br>2. 19<br>3. Either stalemated with the same number of people or higher numbers.&nbsp;<br>4. I don't really know who will be promoted to senior. I haven't focused my time enough to know who really deserves it. Koja for Map Developer though.<br>5. Your interview...fuck that. Found out the questions were changed last minute and it was me just shiting on them. Congrats on getting through with me shitting on the questions.&nbsp;<br>6. You are a great moderator that I would like to see be promoted to mentor to learn even more. I think you know what to do and your calm attitude plus your ability to see different situations in a calm manner really helps the team. Just don't get too hungry for a promotion. You will look and be better when you do things for the server because you love the server, not for the promotion. Even though you haven't really done things like this if you ever want to aim for senior moderator that would be my advice.

It's weird because out of everyone in the staff team I felt you and I had a relationship like Brandon and myself...without the parts of being called a disappointment and being demoted for a day because you annoyed me. I see you as someone who has shaped up the best and will continue to shape well. The admin position is hard but if you rely on Crazy and Fouled I believe you three could be the best administrative team yet.&nbsp;<br><br><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">greatest achievement?<br>Telling a community member to suck my dick as an admin and getting away with it.&nbsp;<br>I mean Mentor was probably the best rank I cared about so getting promoted to that really was great.&nbsp;</span>

Don't overwork yourself and have a backbone to things you do not agree with. We need admins to be actively knowing what the community wants while figuring out ways in drawing new ones. You should be fine anyway. Have fun with it as always.

You are good at doing things done but in the base heart of it you follow crowds&nbsp;way too easily before making an important decision. You also believe too much in words instead of actions.

Great worker but you get frustrated way too easily. When this happens you focus on the stupid things instead of what really matters.
