Hello everyone, this will probably be one of my last, if not my last posts and activities on Avicus.<br><br>As of now, I have retired, quit, left, etc. Avicus in every form - In game, the forums, &nbsp;and YouTube, unless it magically blows up (gets famous), then i MIGHT continue.<br><br>There were, are and most likely will be many factors as to why i am departing the game and community, and I will explain it in two ways:<br><br><b>The short version</b>: (For those who don't really know me or care, and/or don't like reading)<br>Much of the community in the past and recently have accumulated a lot of annoyance and irritation that I just do not want to put up with anymore. Whether it's being rude by swearing, being cocky and opinionated, i don't really care, but over time this has just blown my fuse, and I'm done with people who ruin the game and my time on purpose.<br><br>The other main factor is simply, like many other retirees, school. I am well into 10th grade now and i feel like i am being drowned in projects, work, homework and social stress, so much that i can't even get home and find the energy or mood to play Avicus.<br><br><b>The LONG version:&nbsp;</b>(for those who knew me, care or just like reading for the hell of it)<br>In the past, as mentioned people would grief me, swear at me, accuse me, target me both socially (in chat) and in game, and just generally be nasty to me.<br>It happens, right?<br>But after 15 months of constant swearing, hacking, rudeness and straight up asshole attitude and behaviour, it has just gotten to me to the point where it has depleted all of my patience and enjoyment for the server.<br><br>As i also mentioned, i am 15 and fighting like hell to keep down the amount of work thrust at me, and at the end of the day, Avicus isn't a delicacy or leisure, but just another chore, as i usually out of energy to even enjoy a computer game by the time I'm finished with a days stress.<br><br>The sad part about it is that you never really think or realise how fast time and childhood can accelerate until it is actually happening or happened.<br>I discovered Avicus December, 2013, where I had just gone from 13 to 14 years old. I was a kid, beginning middle school, chilling with friends, etc. and every day was just another day...<br>But at about 15 and a half, i am expected of keeping up with new work, understanding money, looking for jobs, worrying about girls..<br><br>And Avicus has just shrunk into this additional minority in a packed life.<br><br>Of course there's the personal issues with friends, family, etc. basically when shit hits the fan type of thing, and all of these pounding elements have eroded my enjoyment and luxury of playing, so that now i just have to say farewell to all of you and a big thanks to about 90% of all of you for making such a memorable, incredible year and a half on McZone/Avicus.<br><br>Now i would have one of those big ass lists but, once again, many, MANY of the friends i want to thank have left, so i guess i will never get to say farewell to them, but thanks to everyone who played with me in game, you surely know who you are.<br><br><b>In future:</b><br>I MIGHT be able to find a spare hour or two on weekends or in the holidays to have a quick play and say hello, so you just MIGHT see me at some point i the future.<br>Same goes for the forums.<br>When i say I've quit Avicus, i generally mean Minecraft as well, but obviously Avicus has been the spotlight so thanks again!<br><br>For my 36 or 37 subscribers or whatever the hell it was, I'm sorry but I've made a pretty obvious decision to quit my YouTube channel, UNLESS it randomly, miraculously becomes popular out of nowhere, then i MIGHT try to keep things running, but yeah, for now I'm done.<br><br>Thank you and goodbye. #552<br><br>P.S sorry it was so damn long, i never meant to write a fricken novel XD

Hey man, I will miss seeing you on the server.. I really hope that your life will be successful. You're making the right decision to move on from Avicus, and focus more on being successful. I totally understand why you want to move on, and fully accept that. Furthermore, enjoy 10th grade, do your best. You'll be missed man. Come back sometime, and say hi :)<br><br>-Sham
