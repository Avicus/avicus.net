<span style="font-family: lato, sans-serif;">This is just to clear things up. Yes, I am leaving.</span><br style="font-family: lato, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: lato, sans-serif;">But not for the reason some people seem to think I am.</span><br style="font-family: lato, sans-serif;"><img src="https://ci5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/eINrt-rxfHy4PlvK_ub8H--FdmzJgtmO-dBcVh86EZGi62rgYPl7HRp-XQ74kKIEvJ8Mc0FcdvWDVNkhMxYZwsBDj1l9mm7E0LbKfmjR=s0-d-e1-ft#https://i.gyazo.com/f0fc252a82b5963e23f5a948acbfd0d5.png" title="Image: https://i.gyazo.com/f0fc252a82b5963e23f5a948acbfd0d5.png" style="font-family: lato, sans-serif; max-width: 328px; width: 328px; height: auto;"><br style="font-family: lato, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: lato, sans-serif;">^ That is not the reason.</span><br style="font-family: lato, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: lato, sans-serif;">The ACTUAL reason I am leaving has to do with real life.</span><br style="font-family: lato, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: lato, sans-serif;">First off, i feel as though i am not doing as well in school as i should, and i feel a large portion of that is due to spending too much time dedicating everything to avicus, and i'm not really getting anything out of it, so i feel like there's not much of a point to it anymore. I also haven't had enough time to myself to exercise, or hang out with my friends, because of how much time i spend on various avicus platforms.</span><br style="font-family: lato, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: lato, sans-serif;">Second of all, minecraft as a whole, and avicus especially has just gone to shit. More often than not there are not staff on to help with hackers, and i have to try to take it upon myself to try to get a staff on and get evidence, and i see no point to doing this, as nothing is getting any better. too many of the staff are inactive and/or in some cases incompetent. Not to mention avicus has just gotten boring and repetitive, and too many people in the community have just become complete dicks and/or mod tryhards who do their best to piss you off.</span><br style="font-family: lato, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: lato, sans-serif;">If you still think I'm leaving because my staff application got denied, you're wrong. I just feel as thought all the time i spend dedicating to this server is having a negative impact on my life and i am getting absolutely nothing out of it.</span><br style="font-family: lato, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: lato, sans-serif;">And yes, this time I am leaving for good. The only time I will be on is if i am playing with one of my friends, because thats the only time I ever have fun on avicus, cause it simply doesn't have the spark it used to.</span><br style="font-family: lato, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: lato, sans-serif;">I'm only gonna thank a few people, because there are only a few people that i feel as though were my true friends.</span><br style="font-family: lato, sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: lato, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: lato, sans-serif;"><img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/398fb956587f4ec7ac8d9474648022de?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/TheMasterClock.html" style="color: Gray">TheMasterClock</a>: thanks so much. you supported me more than anyone here, and i feel like we've probably become closer friends &nbsp;than anyone else i've ever met on this server, and you're a really cool guy.</span><br style="font-family: lato, sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: lato, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: lato, sans-serif;"><img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/a2fc436888a64ac1880da562d259b684?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/XGalibur.html" style="color: Gray">XGalibur</a>: I'm really happy you got mod, hopefully you can bring the server back to its glory days. you were always the most chill guy i talked to. cya.</span><br style="font-family: lato, sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: lato, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: lato, sans-serif;">Finally,<br><img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/075b5514293a4bd5bcef367e687d3556?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/KojaCola.html" style="color: #006BD2">KojaCola</a><br><img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/c27e3c929fb64b009ffc16ed9dc5a5e4?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/kon333.html" style="color: none">kon333</a><br><img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/da09fae1fefb4503ac504ac5038123a1?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/KeewiDood.html" style="color: none">KeewiDood</a><br>please get mod. you are the only guys i know who actually deserve it.</span><br style="font-family: lato, sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: lato, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: lato, sans-serif;">Goodbye guys.&nbsp;</span><a href="https://youtu.be/F3gIYgSa4qw?t=214" title="Link: https://youtu.be/F3gIYgSa4qw?t=214" style="text-decoration: none; color: rgb(66, 133, 244); font-family: lato, sans-serif;">https://youtu.be/F3gIYgSa4qw?t=214</a>

the fact that you spend so much time saying it's not because you got denied just makes it so much more obvious that it is because you got denied, and that's totally okay dude
