Due to recent events, my time here will be sporadic with long periods of off time. Eventually, I hope that I'll be able to&nbsp;<i>phase out&nbsp;</i>and lose complete interest here. <br>Or I might just regain interest and whatnot, who knows. All I know is that I need a break from here for awhile or forever probably.<br><br><b><u>Warning:</u> This is NOT a hate post.&nbsp;</b><br><br>I tried to stop myself from making this post and just "phase out".<i>&nbsp;</i><b><i>Quitely</i></b> with no post. But that isn't fair to me because I think that for all that I've contributed and how well that I communicated with you guys and my efforts to help create an amiable and fair atmosphere... I think that I deserve a little more communication than just an&nbsp;<i>abrupt demotion.&nbsp;</i><br><br>I woke up and found out what happened as soon as I logged on. I talked to Snow about what has been happening to me prior to my demotion and he understood well enough while pointing what I did wrong and what I should've done. He said that everyone has their moments.<br><br>I accepted these facts and I admit that I should've handled things a little better. But <b><i>this</i></b> isn't fair.<br><br><b><u>Staff-Mods:</u></b><br>You guys are really great people to talk to. I may have handled the situation with Michael badly but the least I deserved was a talk about what has been happening and a notification directly to me instead of an immediate demotion. This is what everyone was talking about when there is very little communication. Talk to me about the situation before taking actions. <br><br>When i handled the TS affair before I was involved, I made sure that I talked and listened to both parties and I actively communicated and recorded both of 'em. No bias and a lot of communication. This example should've been followed.<br><br>Just before I was demoted, I had a talk with Snow about what was happening to me on the last days before I was demoted. I faced constant harassment and opposition from Michael's and DaGoldBrick's groups. I understand why I was demoted but the least I deserved was a little chat about&nbsp;<i>why&nbsp;</i>these things have been happening and&nbsp;<i>what&nbsp;</i>we can do to fix.&nbsp;<br><br>Especially since I was really dedicated to the job and I handled reports quite nicely. I talked to people casually enough and was quite active. To just... demote me randomly... no notice no less... is&nbsp;<i><b>rude.&nbsp;</b></i><b></b><br><br>It took two Seniors to tell me what happened. They listened to my point of view and what has been happening to me recently.<br><br>And this could've all been avoided if&nbsp;<i>certain people,&nbsp;</i>were already banned from all of Avicus' services. I'm pretty sure if anyone else tried this nonsense they would be banned quite promptly. I am appalled and angered by what I have been witnessing. Despite the risks, these things could've been avoided if every staff member opened their eyes sooner <b>(With the exception of a few)</b>.<br><br>The reputation... the racist jokes... It's so obvious guys.<br><br><b><u>Staff-MapDevs:</u></b><br>I thought we were friends. You guys didn't even give me a direct notice from Skype. Just a Gmail notice... It was abrupt just like the moderators were and I thought we were more friendly than this.<br><br>Not even a "goodbye" or a "Thank you for your service". Especially since this was the position that I worked <i>the&nbsp;</i>hardest for and that I was surrounded by friendly people. I feel hurt and wounded.&nbsp;<br><br>I admit that I was a bit rude to the antagonizers. But not "Excessively", this happened over a period of about 2 days. And my responses were only a little insulting. Not overwhelmingly insulting.&nbsp;<br><br>Besides the screenshots of the Pokes I sent to Zacc (Which can easily look like I started the problem. He didn't record his own voice and the responses that he sent to me.). I was called a "Pussy" and judged based on where I lived. I was heavily antagonized throughout the few days and I find it hurtful that I'm the one called rude.<br><br>Even if I was rude, I wasn't "Excessively" rude and I tried my best to dumb down the situation and ignore the rest of the posts directed at me. Well, thanks for letting me experience being a MapDev atleast... heheh... *Slouches*.<br><br><b><u>Players:</u></b> Try not to give the Staff team too much work and flak, alright? If you want to make posts criticizing their actions... do them constructively. What they did wrong, what they're doing right, how should they improve?<br><br><b><u>Dregs:</u> </b>You keep dumbing down Avicus and pissing people off... One day, you might do this to the wrong person and you will have to answer to some or a lot of people. Whether it be one person or your government. Keep at it.<br><br>__________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br><br>Now that this is over, I would like to call out some people who I believe deserve my praise for being friends and great people.<br><br><b>Para:</b> This guy is one of the most intelligent and aware people that I've ever met. He's a great person who is one of the most ancient and one of the greater staff members out there. Hello man, things didn't work out in the end for me. But oh well, if I ever get interested in Avicus again we can hang out a bit. Possibly we can hang out on Steam if you wish. Oh and Admins, promote this guy to Senior plox!<br><br><b>Evo:</b> A great person, a great Map Maker and a great Head MapDev. One of my first friends here along with Para. See you later, I hope. Good luck leading the team with Sli :)<br><br><b>Poker:</b> A <i>great</i> friend and the guy who stood up for me when I was being targeted for telling a TS guy off about harassing a former staff member. To you Poker, I wish I can repay this debt that you did for me. If you have a Steam, we can hang out. I have an active clan that I'm a part of on there for a specific F2P Steam game. Learn the ropes and Tier up then you can join us if you wish ;)<br><br><b>SnowSX3:</b> A great mod and a better advice giver. Wish I could've gotten to know you better man and I wish that I could've gotten to the next level to see what good I could've done *Sad smile*. See ya man, you'd make a great Senior.<br><br><b>Auratix:</b> A great Senior who congratulated me once when I handled a TS problem between two parties. He went to me for advice when I made an older post that constructively criticized staff and player actions. Despite me having no advice for him other than "More casualness and open behavior with normal players" xD<br><br>Thanks for being a good person to me :)<br><br><b>Cyanide:</b> A great (Former) mod and person. He knew that when we were "off-duty" (No current reports or reports are being handled by other mods) that he can cut loose and joke about. I find him Charismatic :) Lead the staff-meeting that I attended.<br><br><b>Sli:</b> Great Head MapDev who knew how to lead us with Evo. Despite the message sent to me... I wish we could've parted on better terms than this man...<br><br><b>RileGuy:</b> Casual and relaxed person who lead a build team that I used to be a part of. You keep makin' those maps man ;)<br><br><b>Skyadia:</b> HOOPS! I love ya man :) A&nbsp;<i>great&nbsp;</i>friend and an even better builder xD Wish we could've finished that tree map man. Well, see ya man. And keep buildin'!<br><br><b>Robin:</b> An honest fellow and a great friend. This guy gave me sound advice that caused me to become the way I am today! For that, I thank you Robin. I hope to see you again hopefully&nbsp;<i>if&nbsp;</i>I ever come on again after tomorrow :)&nbsp;<br><br>Bye my bae &lt;3<br><br><b><u>MapDev team:</u></b> Keep goin' on and boost the quality of Avi's maps. Choose 'em well guys.<br><br>I'll play some Nebula tomorrow then comes a decidedly long break. See you guys later (Maybe).

Hmmm not sure why you were demoted. In the case of Junior Moderators, if you make a big owwie you will get demoted. You should also take this to Skype.

I was demoted for a few events that happened in the recent days. Just before my demotion.<br><br>If I took this to Skype I would have to contact multiple people. This is more or less a leaving post that also asks for a little more communication when demoting people.<br><br>Imagine, you wake up one day and you find yourself demoted. No Skype messages or anything. I didn't get a message on the moderators end and I found out the MapDev's message through Gmail. I was looking through Gmail for updates on a website that I write stories on.

Well, it shouldn't happen to anybody. At least a notification or a talk about why you will be demoted and what you could've done to fix. If these actually happened then the amount of Retired that don't rage will excessively drop.<br><br>This is one of the things that a lot of people complain when there is no communication or very little.

When you first got promoted, I thought it was a dumb idea since you had gotten angry about not being promoted a long time ago. Good god I was wrong lol. When you recorded both sides of that conflict, that was some great stuff. Pure moderator material. You also did great as a map dev and worked hard for it as well. Bye Zin!

Really? Because when Nintendo and I got demoted at the beginning of June, it took me contacting SIX Sr. Staff before I got a reply, and then I had to wait a whole day before someone actually told us why we were demoted.

We agreed and disagreed on issues and I usually came out looking like I was bashing the staff. You interested me to say the least. You were mod at the worst time to be staff and even if you were not the best mod, you were not that bad. It is hard and you will learn how to deal with people when time comes. Bye.

Thanks for the advice. You come off a bit... cold I guess but I realized that that is because you don't want to come off as too aggressive. <br><br>You only had the intent to give advice and try to help us. Though harsh, you gave us constructive criticism more or less.<br><br>Bye man.

Thing is dude, and this post really proves it, is that you are undeniably cocky. You always think you're right and when someone tells you otherwise you can't take it. Like i know i'm a bit like this but seriously you're not a bad guy, just way too much ego. Sometimes you have to let things go and acknowledge what you've done wrong so you can be better at it next time.

Man, that's a real shame. &nbsp;I remember when I was demoted, I had a notice about three weeks before hand, and although I can't seem to find that demotion message itself, I remember it being very kind and thanking me for what I had done. &nbsp;It's kind of a shame to see how things have changed, and especially to see you go, Zintenka. &nbsp;You were an amazing Jr Mod. &nbsp;I know you probably don't have much to say to me, because&nbsp;<i></i>I doubt you really knew me at all, but I have seen you moderate and casually talking to people, and you always seemed mature and kind. &nbsp;Good luck in life, as they say.
