<b>1. What is your username in minecraft and what is your favorite game on Avicus?&nbsp;</b><br>Hello! My name is ScriptingCookies, and previously known as TheHoopsman. The 'Scripting' part in my username comes from my love for coding (Java*Script*). The 'Cookies' part comes from a small inside joke that started way way back, when I first joined Avicus (MCZone at the time). TheHoopsman username came purely from the fact that I loved the game basketball. My favourite game on Avicus would have to be Nexus :)<br><br><b>2. What are you most excited/obsessed over at the moment?&nbsp;</b><br>I am in love with music! I love all genres and constantly listen to music (Except Country music :P) Also excited for interviews, yay!<br><br><b>3. Where are you from?&nbsp;</b><br>Currently, I am living in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Go flames go!<br><br><b>4. Are you in school, or do you have a job? &nbsp; &nbsp; </b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>I am in school, in the eighth grade. My strongest subjects are Mathematics and Science. Currently I am in the school band, and play the trumpet and the trombone.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>5. Who or what inspires you the most in your life? &nbsp;</b><br>Someone who inspires me the most? That's easy, the answer is Fluenza_. He's a really awesome and friendly guy, who is dedicated to the server. He spends hours and hours making sure that this server is the best as it can be and does this in the best manner possible. He is a really awesome role model, that everyone should look up to.<br><br><b>6. How do you contribute to the Avicus as a staff member?&nbsp;</b><br>I contribute to Avicus as a staff member through map constructing, fixing up map glitches, and moderating rotations. It's been really fun working with other Avicus users and making maps together. It's awesome bonding with so many different people and getting to know them through map making. As for glitch fixing and rotation moderating, it may be stressful at times, but in the end, it ensures that Avicus maps are they best they can be, and that people have loads of fun on them. I also run Avicus building competitions, which are super duper fun :)<br><br><b>7. What are the most common questions you get asked while map developing?</b><br>"Make geor MapDev plzzzz?" "can we mkae a map pls pls?" And "how many cookies can you script?"<br><br><b>8. Anything else you want to mention?</b><br>It's been amazing working as a map developer for The Avicus Network. The day I was promoted, I swore that I wouldn't let the server down, and fulfil my job to its fullest, and I won't break that promise.
