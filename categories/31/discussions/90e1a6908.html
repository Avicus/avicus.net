Hello! Recently I have been playing on Avicus and love the community and all the great maps! However I would like to contribute a map and have a few questions. I have looked around already on the forums and tried to find the answers to these but I was unsuccessful.<br><br><b>Question #1</b>: Are you aloud to use Terraforming?<br><br><b>Question #2</b>: What themes seem to be the most popular?<br><br><b>Question #3</b>: How big should the map generally be? (So it isn't too big or too small)<br><br><b>Question #4</b>: Should it be created on a superflat map, or in a void setting map?<br><br><b>Question #5</b>: Could you have a test server with the map for staff to check it before? That way you guys don't have to download it and then say, "Wow this is terrible." Thanks so much guys! Bye Bye for now!

Alright thanks for the information! I just was curious about the test server, however it makes sense now.
