Just a guess:<br><br>Probably not. The server has developed far much more than the code initially was for prestiges, and considering the new mechanisms in the server it'll probably have to be reintegrated somehow with credits and gadgets and players and the database and such. It'd also kind of bust the point of some things we already have, like badges. As a more recommended situation, the server map designs are really the basis to getting credits and prestiges and such so resetting it would create a more fair environment for everyone instead of the old "bridge out 50 blocks" maps in old avicus.

<br>So what I want to see come to avicus, some things are already coming and some things need to be worked on. I could care less on what is coming to avicus so I will focused on what can be fixed<br><u>Maps<br></u><b>Maps are boring and repetitive:</b>In all honesty it is getting better and better on this part and I have been complaining for a while but this needs to be addressed more. I can barely remember map names and the problem isn't that they are named in different languages or anything like that, they are not special. Maps that I could remember are Mute City, Clay Wars, Quintus[Dear god...] and that is really it. Barely any maps that come to avicus now are all the same and people try to play it safe when making a map, If I can call out someone, ParaPenguin in the last few months has made some maps that if i were to play I would remember their name, he has gotten better at making maps that are different and I would like to see other maps like his because they are different.<br><b>The aesthetics vs game play factor:</b> In all honesty this shouldn't be a factor I have to go by but I will go over it. There is a feel that some map developers feel that aesthetics are more important then gameplay, which in both factors, both are very important. I would like to point out that aesthetics are a point of view as well, I like simple maps, Like BoomBox from OCN and other simple aesthetically pleasing maps. Other people have other views on that map and call it a terrible map for aesthetics and really I don't care. Game play doesn't change as much as a point of view. It does change but in some cases but it is usually the same.<br><b>Do not remove server favorite maps:</b>Call me out on being a hypocrite now because what I am saying before was mainly just when approving or disproving maps. I am really only thinking of one map and that is Clay Wars, Clay Wars is not my favorite map at all. It is one of avicus's most liked maps and it was removed. Clay Wars DID have it's fair share of problems when it came to gameplay but I can tell you Quintus played worse. Another favorite map in the community but it was still in the rotation. Now I might get that Quintus is a different map because of the author and the time period both maps were added but: Both maps has flawed gameplay, both maps a lot of people have fun and I would argue that more people have fun on Clay Wars because the lack of spawn killing.&nbsp;<br><u>Staff v Community&nbsp;<br></u>Before<u>&nbsp;</u>I make any suggestions here I would like both parts to read this little. I am a recently approved senior &nbsp;staff member on a gaming tournament thing. I am not saying this to brag but I want staff to know that I have some knowledge at being in a high position so I would ask if you take me seriously. Also when I am suggestion this I will not be basing anyone in the community. I do not believe bashing staff or community members is a smart way in bringing new ideas to the table and if I started doing that here I would look unprofessional and you might not take me seriously. Also I will be posting about past events such as the two threads that were made and there was a huge staff v community battle. I will not be posting any names just the ranks.<br><b>Bias in the upper level:</b>When people read this they might say it is human faults and we can never be fully unbiased. I am not asking for all admins to turn into emotionless people in a day or anything like that. But there is a problem when the bias becomes too much that most of the community feels like there is bias in the staff level. I will be posting later on my suggestions for each problem in the bottom and I have barely anything to say other then the bias comes off and there is a problem when it comes off. and the community feels a little unsafe from it<br><b>Acting Professional:</b>I am going to be very blunt with this. Staff, you are leaders of the server, when there is two threads that are serious discussion threads [One was a question thread that randomly turned into the chaos that it was turned into] you need to act the best you could. You need to work together to solve a problem. Again with me being blunt, but more then half of the staff that posted didn't act professional. There was a few lies that were said to keep the community to know some imperfections, there was the stupid pointing game that sadly both parties entered. &nbsp;It felt like a lot of staff who were supposed to be in this leadership role didn't live up to what that role is. I know that Avicus is a little less strict and I want staff to hope that because if I acted in that way as a senior staff and did what half of the staff that posted did...I would have a staff infraction[Which is infractions for staff and if I get too many I would be demoted] or a full demotion on the spot because it shows I don't have the capabilities of being a staff member.&nbsp;<br><b>The HUGE flaws in staff apps:</b>It does feel like if I want to become a staff member I just have to lie a bit and don't show my huge flaws and I get in. It feels like you will take what you can get and run away with it without actually testing it to see if it works well. What is wrong, You can lie easily on the staff apps, you can get mod way too easily, the mods are not strong enough for their actual title presumes and the tree slowly collapses with the server:<br>For the developers you have been doing a nice job, have ice cream and some cookies and go on your way.<br><br>So I was just posting problems that are on two areas and I would post more but I can't think of any. I will now post my own solutions to each problem but you can find your own. It doesn't really matter as long as there is a solution.<br>Maps being repetitive: Easy. Encourage map makers to go out of their comfort zone. Just remember Lyzak was not a trend follower and made a lot of different maps. He might not be remembered as the best map maker of OCN but his trends on OCN are the most followed trends of that server. Just try something different.<br>The aesthetics v gameplay: Just remember some things are terrible for gameplay and gameplay should be a first and aesthetics should be a second<br>Fan favorite maps being removed: Have a poll on the forums or some type of review for players to write so you can see what maps people like and what maps people don't like<br>Bias: If you have a lot of bias with someone I feel that you shouldn't really deal with the appeal's final decision. i don't have a lot of suggestions for this sadly but I just wanted to put it out there<br>The staff being more professional: This is for staff. Look at all threads that deal with something like a problem. Now problem solve. What is the best way to solve that problem. Fighting with random people from the community doesn't solve a lot of problems.<br>The staff apps. Try to have more then just the staff apps. I am in favor for hand picked staff but it is your choice.<br>Thanks for reading
