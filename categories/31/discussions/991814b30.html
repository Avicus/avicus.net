I can detect something in this... well... um.<br><br>Its sort of based off of common sense to tell how old it can be.<br><br>Bumping a topic IMO, is saying something completely unrelated to an old topic. But according to everyone else, its posting something on an old topic; relevant or otherwise.<br><br>So i guess, yeah. If the topic was unanswered or if its like a thing similar to maps then you can post updates or ask for answers... relevant to the topic.

Dude, the very comment you're replying to just literally explained the whole problem. &nbsp;If someone types in a 'bump' comment, it just an obnoxious thing to do. (Assuming they know what a 'bumb' is) If someone bumps a topic, it puts that topic to the top of the 'Recent Discussions' category on the forums list.&nbsp;If there are topics that do not have relevant posts, but are still considered 'Recent Discussions', it is in in the staff's best interest to lock the topic, before more unrelated comments are posted, and the topic becomes spammy. Lock's are issued because if people were still interested in the topic, people would've been commenting on it before it was outdated, and a new post would be considered a 'bump'. Bringing up an old topic that people are not interested takes up space on the forums from topics that are actually still interested.<br><br><br>*Cue the 'The more you know' please*

If someone bumps it and the thread is already resolved/answered then there isn't really a point to the thread since more people will just bump it in the future.
