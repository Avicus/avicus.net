So like, haven't been on avicus since yesterday, log in today and says I'm banned for 3 months. This is just BS. Any reason to actually ban me? Technically I was banned on "9/10/14" which is highly impossible, and this is just a total lie. I recently checked my infractions, and says that the mod "D00ZIE" banned me, unless you this server actually has a reason for banning me for like 2 months, that makes no sense what so ever. Banned for 3 months for Excessive Infractions? Yeah, no. And then this mod puts only a 3 day ban on the Infractions part of my profile? I have been banned about maybe a "week ago"(lol, if you get it) for Multiple Infractions, then you ban me again? This is just Bull. Goodbye.

Story of my life on avicus. Read my infractions. Im perm banned. I have never seen you on so you must be new I am assuming. I got banned 2 months ago just so you know. And when school started in September time just flew by. So 3 months might go fast for you but i understand your pain.

Why does it matter how many infractions I have? The mod that banned me made an invalid report on my infractions, and made a different one in game. This mod in my opinion, needs to be demoted. He/She was just trying to trick me into getting banned. Anyways, thanks for telling me where to appeal.
