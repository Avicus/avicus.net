So, this problem has been bothering me for a while now.&nbsp;<br>Basically, what happens is I click on Minecraft, and it pops up. I then go into my Forge profile and click "Play," but nothing happens. The launcher simply disappears like it does whenever you're playing any version of Minecraft but never comes back up. It's also shown in my CPU and disk usage. Usually, they rise up a bit and stay there until Minecraft's fully launched, but when I launch Forge, they go up and then plummet. I've looked all over the Internet for some help, but I couldn't find anything D:<br><ul><li>I have Java 7u75 for Windows 8 64x</li><li>I don't have any mods in my mods folder, so they aren't the issue</li><li>I have Forge 1080</li><li>I have uninstalled and reinstalled my Java and .minecraft multiple times, so they're not the problem</li></ul><br>Any help would be really, really appreciated D:

I've had this problem before. It's a pretty easy fix. All you do is move your forge mods out of the mods folder, delete the forge .jar file, and also the&nbsp;forge profile. Then go to their website and download the recommended type from any version of forge you want to use (1.7.10 works the best). Never use the latest from any version, since they are buggy and things like what you stated above happens. Afterwards just run the file, create a new MC file with the forge version and throw the mods back in your folder. It should work by then.
