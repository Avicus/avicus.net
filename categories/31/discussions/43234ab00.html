Alright, so we haven't had a party of any kind for a while, so me and Jozz have set up a PlugDJ party with a contest and prizes.<br><br>First off, if you don't have a PlugDJ account, just head on over to the <a title="Link: http://plug.dj/avicus" rel="nofollow" href="http://plug.dj/avicus">PlugDJ</a>, and there you can create an account. While you are in the community, make sure to abide by Section A of the rules, and the additional guidelines provided under the channel description. Once you are there, you can start playing music until the official start time, at which point we will disable the DJ Cycle and Lock the waitlist (explained more later). <br><br><b>The event will start at 6:30 EDT</b> on Friday July 24th. At this point we will have anyone who wants to participate in the contest (including staff) join the waitlist, then lock it and disable cycle (if you arrive late, we can manually add you in :). Because, the contest will be whoever can get the most woots. Choose your song wisely (and make sure it follows the rules), as you only get one chance. Once everyone who wants to has participated, me and Jozz will total up the scores and determine the winner! We ask that you stay the whole event (about an hour) so that the scores are even for everyone. <b>Troll videos are a disqualification.</b> <b>Points:</b> Woot - 1pt, Grab - Tie Breaker, Meh - Doesn't Count. Please do not grab just to boost a song's chances. Grab like you normally would, if you like that song so much.<br><br>Tonight there will be a spreadsheet open to the public where you can see people who are entered, and their score. Once the event starts, you will be able to find the spreadsheet here: <a title="Link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RXIfq0FoirrL6szLM4IXFLOs8ZTb5fa-yl7nutxMo4Y/edit#gid=0" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RXIfq0FoirrL6szLM4IXFLOs8ZTb5fa-yl7nutxMo4Y/edit#gid=0">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RXIfq0FoirrL6szLM4IXFLOs8ZTb5fa-yl7nutxMo4Y/edit#gid=0</a><br><br><b><u><b>Prizes!</b></u></b><br>1st Place: Resident DJ on Plug, and Music God on TS.<br><br>2nd Place (will only be awarded if enough people show): 2,500 credits!<br><br>3rd Place (will only be awarded if enough people show): 1,000 credits!<br><br><br> <b>Feel free to ask any questions below :)</b><br><a title="Link: http://plug.dj/avicus" rel="nofollow" href="http://plug.dj/avicus"></a><a rel="nofollow" href="http://plug.dj/avicus"> </a>

No set genre! And song that you think will please the masses :)<br><br>(Edit): Another piece of info: Meh's do not count against you. We only count the woots.

Quick question, the troll videos (example: Toy Story 69) shouldn't be allowed? Also would the "grabs" count?

Basically, we ask people to follow their judgement, and have it be a <b>song</b>. Hopefully, the crowd won't give a lot of woots to a troll song, but we'll see what happens. Grabs don't count extra for you. Just woots. Grabs are used as a tie-breaker.<br><br><b><b>EDIT: Troll videos/songs are a&nbsp;<i>disqualification</i>.</b></b>
