My internet is terrible as well.<br>What I try doing is unplugging your source of internet (your router) and everything in the plug where it has been plugged in.<br>Then, wait for about 5 minutes or so, and then plug everything back in.<br>Click on the power button, wait for all of the lights to turn back on (on the router) and then reconnect your laptop / PC back to your internet.<br>If that does not work, restart your PC / laptop and try connecting to the internet again.<br>Hope I helped!

I made that the first time my Internet was not working, but dont worry I know whats the problem, look, my dad bought like a type of service that contains the telephone and the Internet, oh and also the TV, so the telephone didnt work one day and the TV and Internet had to be changed, my dad bought the wrong amount of megas, (I had 40 before and I have 6 now) so I cant play... :c<br>
