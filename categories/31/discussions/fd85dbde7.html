today In Nebula, I was insulted by myworld6 and crustyHD, myworld6 additionally spammed, pulled of nazi jokes about me being german and disregarded pelpes orders. Still they didn't even get&nbsp; kicked as far as I know. This pushed me from really loving avicus to probably leaving. I also know of other cases, where people were bullied and those people are probably leaving to. <br><br>I really have no Idea what avicus is intending with these things. People leave, the bullies stay.( I actually wanted to by me a diamond rank soon, but I definitely WONT do that now)<br><br>Could the staff PLEASE change soemthing about this for the others, because this really ruins the game fun

You could mimize your chat so you can't see the abuses or just report it or play on a server with staff on so they get kicked etc

I am sorry to hear this. As I suggested earlier I was AFK when it all happened. I only saw some minor things but I obviously missed the bigger picture. As I said I would and will inform other staff members about their behaviour. Contact me on skype if you want to sort this out; pelpelajax is my skype name,

If you feel like you're being bullied, staff members should be doing something about it. But on the other hand, you shouldn't be pointing out specific staff members if you have a problem with them, or other players too. I would suggest contacting a senior staff member.

This is racism. It is horrible that in 2014, people make jokes about Nazis. As much as I now despise the people who called you this, do not public shame

Please don't leave, no matter what.<br><br>These instances happen a lot, and the staff do need to act I agree, but sometimes they are not there.<br><br>Please do /report if you feel you are being bullied and state exactly what they said, and the staff will issue a warning and eventually a kick if it continues, that could lead to a tempban.<br><br>We just need to appreciate the fact that the staff cannot be everywhere at once.<br><br>iBiZa

So I just casually join a Nebula game when I come back from school, break two monuments then I look at chat and find myself being insulted for breaking the monuments by ForscherFinder because he wanted to kill/ xp farm. I then said it was point of the game but he wouldn't listen so I got mad and started being rude. Then when the mod appears, like most forums players he reverts to his angelic form and says he's being bullied by 2 horrible players. Really. @Mods, stop sucking off donors.<br><br><br>P.S: I didn't do half the stuff you said e.g be racist.

Racism and bullying are not permitted on the server. I assure you that if any Staff member sees this happening ingame it will be dealt with.&nbsp;<br><br>You must remember though that no matter how hard we try, we can't be everywhere at once which is why if this does happen again make sure to screenshot it and report it so we can deal with it. Sorry for your trouble.

As I said, I told them to stop and act mature. Crusty continued, I warned him for that. After that it was pretty quite. If this ever happens again to you, or any else, always report. Could I talk to you on skype quiclky/

Racism and/or bullying is not allowed on any circumstances whatsoever. No matter what you were called at before, do not retaliate back. Ever.&nbsp;<br>Two things you can do to prevent this or punish the player:&nbsp;<br>1. Report! If a staff member does not come, report once more. If a staff member still does not come, take a few screenshots of the bullying and report it online.&nbsp;<br>2. Communicate with the player. Most players here are intelligent enough to create a compromise, this sometimes works, but at least give it a try! ^_^&nbsp;<br><br>Because both sides do not seem to agree at all in this situation and is not giving evidence at all, both of you could submit an Online Report if you do have screenshots showcasing what happened in this scenario and if you believe that the &nbsp;opposing player's language is strong enough for a temp-ban.&nbsp;<br>Like Archadonic said, on behalf of your staff team, we are sorry for your trouble and you had to deal with this.

The problem is, that i didn't make screenshots because a staff member was on and I didn't know at that time that he was afk, or I would have screenshotted it<br>@ ibiza I do know how /report works, still thx though :P&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also did report both of them, but I nothing happened, except the warn as I see

I merely said, that It oculd have been cleverer to farm kills( for EP) than break a monument and I didn't say that in a insulting way either(if yes I didn't mean to) The mods are definitely not sucking of donors, they are just doing there job. <br><br>And if u can read, you will have noticed that I wrote, that myworld made nazi jokes and spammed additionally to the swearing, not you. Just so that you know, ause I am aware that the nazi jokes only came from myworld6

So you're complaining that the staff took his side because hes a donor?<br>Before you've even put up a fucking argument? Hes the only side of the story, how are they 1 sided?<br>Also "sucking off donors" is a strange phrase

I am going to lock this thread to prevent any further argument taking place. So just to make it clear again;<br><br><b>Bullying/Racism is not allowed on this server or in this network.</b> In future if you do see it happening use /report or take screenshots so that we can punish the player.<br><br>If you have any other concerns you can contact me with my skype on my profile or email support@avicus.net. Sorry again for this.
