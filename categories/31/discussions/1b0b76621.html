So today I was playing Nexus, a very rare occurence, and I came across a map with four teams, idk what it was called, I don't play it ever.&nbsp;<br><br>But anyways, it was four teams, two of the. Had two players, but my team and another only had 1. Sine we were down a player, and both pretty sure this one guy was hacking, we kind of made a mutual agreement not to kill each other. It wasn't really a team, more of like an ignorance if their existence like "I will allow u to live, fellow underdog".<br><br>just wanted to know if u could get punished for this. I'm pretty sure u can, but it seemed ok at the time.<br><br>~higger

I think this should be allowed in that type of situation.<br><br>Sometimes I 'truce' with another team with low players before the walls drop because imho its quite unfair that most of our team got teamkilled and the teamkiller left. So if it's like a 2v2v5v6 then I might truce with the other team.
