Not that all the suggestions on here are not great ways to make Avicus Better... but I really think we should Focus.<br><br>I see Polls about better moderation communication, I see polls about bringing old Game-Modes back, I see lots of Rule Posts &nbsp;etc.... I see a million Players asking for a million things.... but really... Should we not look at things and focus on fixing the failing systems we currently have in place first?<br><br>1. Map additions - very poor system in place for adding amps / content, correcting submitted maps , communicating about the map, adding the map to the server (testing) and removing maps that no longer play well. If we had a great system in place and all the game modes had fresh, playable content that the masses liked, you could focus on other things that would make the server even better. Map makers would know whats going on, map devs could give better feed back and Avicus could start to become something closer to like it was in the MCZone days - or more.<br><br>2. Player feed back from in game: We have no feed back method to report from in-game about what maps we like, what game modes we like, what content we want to see, or anything that is definitive. Avicus needs real data to make things better and real systems to collect that data and use it in a positive way. - Are we going to add a game-mode because some people on the forums ( who have been on Avicus a while ) like? Or do you want to get feed back from the new player ( and the old) while they play? Yes. You will get much more data this way. You will have the answers to a lot of questions and will push the server up.<br><br>3. Lag - feed back : This is something that is needed, do we know what lags certain maps? Whats the player total, block count, etc etc. The server needs some kind of feed back device so that the owner knows exactly when the server starts to lag. IF it needs to be a command in-game that a user initiates fine, If it needs to be automatic great, but there is noting worse than having a great game on a new map, &nbsp;then you cant see your arrows anymore, or you see 4 people floating in air and everyone says - hacker, when its just server lag... How can these problems be solved without information?<br><br>4. Moderation - This is not something that I see as a big problem on Avicus , although a lot of time is going into it. Certain times of days we may not be able to get a mod, but for the most part I think we have enough mods and they do a great job. I had a hacker &nbsp;" attempted murder: me today, but the mod was there and banned him after my report in about 10 sec. Whatever your going to do in this area fine, but Know that it is already better than most servers...<br><br>5. Prestige / Reason to play - Folks We have got to have some kind of "Draw" to the server, the Prestige does a great thing, but we should really consider taking it to the next level. I am not going to place suggestions here, but this should be a thought on all the mods minds.. how do we keep the players coming back.... Great maps, Great game-mods, updated content, Prestige rewards, community, Lag-Free, Awesome Moderation, Fun, exciting, never know what great thing is going to have next on Avicus.. players should want to check in every day for the great things going on...<br><br>So what do you think - If we fix these areas and implement a few things, the server could really take off! School is about to start back, and Our player count is going to fall most likely.. we got to be on our A game and get the players to keep playing, keep logging in...<br><br>+1 or -1 &nbsp; thoughts...

Actually, I was going to suggest some focus points that the Senior Staff could work on.<br>Mind if I use a couple of these points?

1. We have a very large range of maps. Each rotation is unique, perhaps try another one.<br>2.&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/Avicus/Issues">https://github.com/Avicus/Issues</a><br>3.&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/Avicus/Issues">https://github.com/Avicus/Issues</a><br>4. Well, doesn't seem like much of an area that needs focusing, given what you had to say.<br>5. Yeah, things along these lines might be added soon.

The_Detonator_ :<br><br>Github is clearly not the answer to anything.... Not only does it require an addition log on, it is not user friendly to anyone but a mod and is used by about 1% of people, not really something I would use to help solver server problems or to better a server... just saying no reason to even mention it in this post as we are &nbsp;talking about something that can be used by the masses<b> in-game</b>.<br><br>We have a large map base for a few game modes, how do you know what maps people like the most ( or game modes )? How do we know what problems exist on current maps, how do the map builders know what maps are accepted or what needs changed etc... Lots of work needs to be done.<br><br>Again, Avicus has no " Wheels" to gain any kind of traction currently. In game data collection is the solution to the knowledge portion of the problem. Avicus also has no way to effectively communicate back to map builders on anything map related or content related and forum polls don't really get a broad enough range of player submissions for any real kind of solution making.<br><br>@jozzmcozz : use all ya like my friend.
