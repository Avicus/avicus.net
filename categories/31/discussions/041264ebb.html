<div>So, if you guys didn't notice, I had a bit of a breaking point today. I was accused of DDoSing a team during the tournament, but it was just a bad joke. All this hate and criticism... it's really getting to me. Thus, I've determined that I just can't take it anymore. Therefore, I've reluctantly decided to retire. I'll have my successor prepared to take on the job hopefully by the end of today. Anyways, I'd just like to thank some people for how they impacted me as a staff member:</div><div><br></div><div>I'll try to put this is semi-chronological order within my career as staff.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Emmaye -  </b>The first staff member I ever met, and you were like a brother to me. Even through the thick and thin, we stuck together. GG bro.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Jozz/Riskings -</b> The roughest bumps I've had as a staff member were with you, but I feel like it strengthened me as a person. It motivated me to do better, even when maybe I wasn't in the wrong.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Princezz_Dubstep - </b>Motivated me a lot especially in my early times, and taught me a lot of skills that I still use today.</div><div><br></div><div><b>DoctaPop - </b>Probably one of the most dedicated to the team I've ever seen. We've had bumps, and I annoy the shit out of you, but it only makes us closer. (wink wink)</div><div><br></div><div><b>MidnightBeats -</b> Like the only guy left from my batch, I always looked up to you even though you didn't know me too well. I just wanted to put in my respect for that, cuz you cool and Korean dude. (Congrats on Sr Mod btw :P)</div><div><br></div><div><b>ItzDylan115 -</b> Just retired yesterday, but you were always a role model for me, when you mentored me and when we'd stay up really late when TS went down in 4 hour long skype calls. And especially when you'd sit around like a simpleton and poke me with the dumbest puns I've ever read in my life. Thanks man.</div><div><b></b></div><div><b><br>Glitchy1 - </b>Stood by me even when times were extremely tough. When I was demoted, you fought for my return. When every single person was against, you helped me out. If it weren't for you I don't think I'd be here today.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Tel6331 - </b>This guy is a true friend. I used to hate you, until you took the bravery to thoroughly investigate my demotion. After that, I was so glad I knew someone like you. From racing &nbsp;for hours to making detailed plans as Senior Staff, you were just the best guy to be around. Thank you for that.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Cole/TenBucksOfMoney -</b>  I remember when we were both Mods, and you got demoted for some reason. But hey, you were cool.</div><div><br></div><div><b>ParaSpider - </b>A person I could talk to and trust at all times, gave more suggestions than any other staff member, and a phenominal role model.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Aex/TNT -</b> As an OCN Mod, I assumed you had a lot of experience, but I never knew you had the skills you do. Thank you for your hard work, and keep it up.</div><div><br></div><div><b>PokerFace, Juanoh, DaGoldBrick, MLGtino, MasterProX, FrozenSolstice, Aphelion Numberz_/99, FIyHacks, Hacktivism, StormzInvader, and the "Resistance" - </b>Thank you all for your suggestions, assistance, and opinions. It may look like we ignored you, or disliked you, but it was the opposite. I had the utmost respect for you all, because you weren't afraid to speak for yourself. You weren't worried about what happened to you because you cared about everyone's well-being.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Rinn/Peacheh/Dutchis/MommaDoc/PeachyYas/dddddddddddd -</b> Despite all the hate, this guy is a real fighter. He fights hard every day for what's right, and he's been doing it since I was in staff, and probably before. He stood by me when it was tough, and in the end now he still does. No matter what people say he gets it done because he knows it has a greater purpose. He puts service over himself, regardless if you believe it or not.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Zeusy - </b>A role model, and a real hero. I've looked up to Zeus since I first met him, and I still do. He openly expresses his opinion, and although sometimes salty, is a great guy. I'd also like to thank him for taking my place and burden as the new Administrator. Thanks buddy.<br><br><b>stubs -&nbsp;</b>for being god<br></div><div><br></div><div>I'd also like to give a subtle thank you to the following: KyloCode, Pelpelajax, Auratix_, Iron, Mango_, Petlas, Legoche, Zaccc, MerlinMaster, GrapeSmoothie, javipepe, Aerosmith, and pavilion99. I'll probably have to add some others.</div><div><br></div><div>I'd also like to thank <b>Ambivalence_</b>, for teaching me that there are some really, REALLY stupid people out there.</div><div><br></div><div>And lastly, to staff or anyone aspiring to be staff, I give you this piece of advice.</div><div><br></div><div>“How bad do you want it? Let me tell you right now that anything you want in your life, anything that you want as part of as human being; character traits, anything that you want, success, money, anything that is &nbsp;important to you in your life is not going to be an easy accomplishment. Anything worthwhile is not easy. Anything worth having does not come overnight. Anything that will be worth it you will be worth the struggle. Listen there’s a whole lot of people out there waiting, there’s a whole ton of people waiting to be successful, there’s a whole lot of them, but I don’t suggest you join the waiting list for success because that is an endless list of people that are saying, “I want it!” It is no longer enough to “want it.” &nbsp;You gotta go for it! That’s the only way that you are going to be successful, and today, today you have to stand up and fight for your dream! Today you have to stand up and go and get what is yours! While everybody else is waiting, while everybody is relaxing, wishing for it, wanting it, hoping for it, you gotta be out there making it happen every single day. If you want to set yourself apart from the rest of the sheep herd, the rest of the people, mediocrity, average. If you want to get away from all of that and into success, doing great and really being fulfilled in your life. You have to step up! Step away from average! Step away from the 97% of the population! Understand that in order for you to be successful you need to find success and get around it and spend as much time around it as you can. You have to learn from it. You have to be constantly learning from it, and that is the only way that you will really get to where you want to be. The formula to success is really, really, really simple! However the journey, the grind, and the hustle is by no means easy. And, so if you are going to get up and take it seriously, if you are really going to go for it, you have to get this straight through your head, straight away. It is going to require ALL of YOU! Every little piece of you, that last bit of energy, everything that you have, all of your resources, all money, all your time, all your energy has to go into it, has to be invested into it! &nbsp;No other options, one way and that’s the only way! You wanna make something big happen? It’s gonna take a while. You want something that is worth something to you that’s going to take effort, that’s going to take hard work and dedication and stuff. Looking for the overnight success stuff, Googling stuff, looking at Facebook stuff, checking all this shit that you don’t need to be checking, focus on what is important in order for you to get your goal! The easiest thing in the world it to be distracted. There are so many distractions out there, there’s a billion of them! And being successful is very often all about deciding you are not going to fall for the distractions. You have to be able to stay focused on your goal and to keep going every single day, no matter how hard it gets. You are the only one that can make your life what you want it to be. There is no one else that is responsible for your condition. Look, if you want success in life try taking some responsibility. The moment that you take responsibility for your life is the moment that everything shifts. Decide that you will not leave it up to anyone else, not to school, not to your parents, not to your friends, not to your siblings, not anybody else. No one is responsible for your success but you and that puts the power in your hands.”</div><div><br></div><div>I'll still be just active as I was, but I just won't be an Administrator anymore, I'll be a total dick! :D</div><div><br></div><div>Thank you.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div>

Well, after everything that has happened over the last few months all I really want to do is say thank you. For putting up with all the annoying shit I put you through, every time I was trying to get you to listen and understand my point of I continued to bug you because I felt that you were ignoring that fact that there was tons of problems you were overlooking. I would like to take the time to formally apologize to you for that, I am very sorry. <br><br>I would also like to thank you for the chances you gave me as a staff member. You fought me many times, fought for me when I was Jr mod, fought for me again during the Resistance problems and also dealt with multiple problems I had with other staff members while you were senior mod. <br><br>You were a great admin in the end, but every great person has their faults. Thank you for all the work you did.

Michael, I don't know you that well and when I did have that rare&nbsp;occurance of talking to you, you sing random songs, but you were a great admin. Well done on your hard work and good luck in the future. I will always remember you banning me on my alt. Anyway, cya :c

Just remember to not cave in under the pressure too much. There will be those who respect your decision, and those who will respect your decision whilst continuing to support you.&nbsp;<br><br>Cya 'round. :c<br><br>Forgot to mention - I wouldn't be where I am today if it weren't for you. I wouldn't even be close to considering using Teamspeak at all. It was your encouragements and hilarious &nbsp;moments alongside Pop that brought me to engage with the community. I have so much to thank you for, Michael.

Hey Michael, sorry to see you go. Sorry for all the shit I gave you this morning in slack, I was just really disappointed about the situation. I hope you don't hate me, and maybe we can talk on Skype sometimes as we really didn't talk much. I'll miss you. &lt;3<br><br>And no, this isn't to make me look better, I really flamed you bad when I shouldn't have, and I hate myself for doing that to you. :'(

Dude, I'm sorry about what happened. I really wish I could've done something to help you out, but I only found out about the incident this morning. Also, everything Vobaseball12 said in his post applies to me: I shouldn't have been so unkind and brash, and I deeply apologize for that.<br><br>Well, good luck in future endeavors. Your service to the staff team was and still is very much appreciated :)

Ouch.<br><br>I think I'm going to write a small paragraph for you, even if I'm on holidays, but oh well, you deserve it:<br><br>From my point of view, even before I was a staff member you seemed like a really fun and great to talk with guy, and so you were. When I got junior mod I started knowing you a little bit better and with more detail, but what I said above was still true, also I got told by some people that talked with you that you thought I was fun and that you liked how I was doing as a staff, which made me quite happy and also made me appreciate you a lot. The moment that I have probably laughed more on Avicus was when you played&nbsp;<b>that</b> prank on me when I got full mod, hehe. To be honest I'm really sad you actually retired, but it was your decision, hence I have to respect it regardless if I agree with it. Also I want you to know that you made my day when I saw my name on this thread. If I ever leave/retire, you'll be there too I promise. Thanks a lot for making me laugh and being a great guy and a great administrator.&nbsp;<br><br>Thanks a lot Michael :)<br><br>My kindest regards<br><br>o/

You always seemed fun and eager to do stuff for the community, and I was really happy when you earned yourself Jr Mod. You have worked so hard since then, which has been proven in your promotions through the staff ranks.<br><br>Thanks for everything man, R.I.P and gg

It wasn't true, Ok. Get that out of your mind. Michael said it as a "Harmless Joke" that Ambi took too seriously. There is evidence to back this up, and also, Impact stated "We didn't get DDOS'ed, nor do we give a shit about an Avicus Tournament."
