Most of our infractions are "spamming /report", and I find it weird how no one hasn't thought of this.&nbsp;<br>Basically what I'm trying to imply is that how come we can't implement or add in a plugin that notifies the player that a mod has read their report and is coming to assist. I'm making a discussion about this because we've already had issues where a user is either flying or using kill aura, anti kb, forcefeild etc.... And no staff is on to assist *making the game extremely unbalanced, and unfair*&nbsp;<br><br>Here is a link to a plugin I looked up (I don't know if it will work but I'm trying to help)&nbsp;<br><br><a href="http://www.curse.com/bukkit-plugins/minecraft/core-report">http://www.curse.com/bukkit-plugins/minecraft/core-report</a><br><br><br>Hope you guys support this.&nbsp;<br><br><br>P.S I am NOT implying that the server is understaffed/Dead. I'm just bringing this up for less /report spamming, and abuses.

Actually this wouldn't be a big issue, if the moderators used /msg to tell the players that the reported player isn't hacking or got punished.

What a mod is suppose to do (or what I would do) is take the report, I would always call if a player I was on got reported, no matter who reported that player how many times I would not ask that person to stop as I would still be watching him &amp; say in the staff chat that I'm on that player already. When done is a different story. If the player would be breaking the rules I would tell that person and issue a punishment (v warn, warn, kick, tb or ban). If the player was clean we would ignore the report a few times, after a bit if he is still being reported I or another mod would end up checking up on the player, if that player is found to still be clean we would notify the player who is reporting that the player that he reported was indeed clean and that he no longer had to report the player (I would say no names). Most of the time in the end of any situation the player would stop, if he would not continue we would go and v warn the player and punish him accordingly as long as he continues.<br>So this wouldn't be too bad of an idea except it's that the players don't listen, as anything regarding to reports (unless it's really vulgar or racist and has nothing to do with legitimately reporting someone) we would verbally warn him first. So it is not the communication problem but the player just doesn't listen.<br>Hope this cleared things up a bit :)

I think there should be "suspicion" meters. /reports will raise the&nbsp;suspicion. and the player proving clean will lower it.&nbsp;The&nbsp;more "cleans" you have, the harder it is to get "suspicion". The the mods can read of the "top suspected" list and go monitor the players.
