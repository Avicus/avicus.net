Lmao they were. Then 1.9 happened.<br><br>Also, did you even read Apple's post. The reason OCN is done is because they were losing more and more players over the course of 2 years. Also, they were running off of donations and didn't have as much money to keep their big server up. So my guess is it was either be a smaller server or no server, and Apple made the choice of no server. Now that OCN isn't a thing anymore, so many new players are going to come here.<br><br>Also nice spam topic but I felt like writing this xP.

We've been losing even more players over the last 2 years. They still get up into the hundreds reguarly, we haven't in AGES. Think back to MCZone when we had well over 1000 players online very reguarly, now we around 50 if that. We have shrank by over 95% since MCZone. And people still say this server isn't dying...

If you feel it's because of our low player counts you're wrong. OCN gradually decreased in players over the course of 2 years whereas Avicus has had a constant player count of 40-100 players for around a year now.<br><br>Also:&nbsp;<a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/AvicusNetwork/status/754750555600203776">https://mobile.twitter.com/AvicusNetwork/status/754750555600203776</a>

Overcast is a hell of a lot more expensive to run than Avicus.<br><br>Last time I asked, financially we were doing fine, where as OCN obviously wasn't. But that's because they had to put a lot more money into their network than we have to with ours.<br><br>Although obviously player counts are important, if a server is doing well financially, it'll stay up and if it's not, it'll close-regardless of the player count.

This server isn't dying, going smaller doesn't mean it's dying. We have been growing recently, and although some of you think that a few players doesn't make a difference, at this stage everything does. This server is still bigger than when it started off 4 years ago. We just need something to really kick start its growth. We are going to be staying around for a long time, I can assure you.

Avicus will eventually die, and yes it is dying right now but it is possible to change it round even at these late stage and turn it around, put some life back into the server! But that requires 100% commitment from every staff member, they can't just sit around playing games all the time they have to be working on stuff that actually makes a difference. Also those who say threads like this are pointless... They aren't they're creating discussion about revival and if anything show strengths in our community.

Heh... not bad, kid. Not bad at all. Your meme, I mean. It's not bad. A good first attempt. It's plenty dank... I can tell it's got some thought behind it... lots of quotable material... But memeing isn't all sunshine and rainbows, kid. You're skilled... that much I can tell. But do you have what it takes to be a Memester? To join those esteemed meme ranks? To call yourself a member of the Ruseman's Corps? Memeing takes talent, that much is true. But more than that it takes heart. The world-class Memesters - I mean the big guys, like Johnny Hammersticks and Billy Kuahana - they're out there day and night, burning the midnight meme-oil, working tirelessly to craft that next big meme. And you know what, kid? 99 times out of a hundred, that new meme fails. Someone dismisses it as bait, or says it's "tryhard," or ignores it as they copy/paste the latest shitpost copypasta dreamt up by those sorry excuses for cut-rate memers over at reddit. The Meme Game is rough, kid, and I don't just mean the one you just lost :). It's a rough business, and for every artisan meme you craft in your meme bakery, some asshole at 9gag has a picture of a duck or some shit that a million different Johnny No-Names will attach a milion different captions to. Chin up, kid. Don't get all mopey on me. You've got skill. You've got talent. You just need to show your drive. See you on the forums...
