<h3>Tournament News</h3>

<p>New tournament announcements have been made!

<h3>Avicus Public Relations<br></h3><h3><span style=" font-weight: 300;">A new twitter has been created to allow the senior staff team to advertise a lot more.

No offense, but did you make any tournaments during your time as admin which was like 2 years I believe? I mean, I recall one happening in MCZone that was apparently really unorganized and played really bad, too.

It's purpose is mainly to reach out to YouTubers for advertisement, the <a href="https://twitter.com/AvicusNetwork" rel="nofollow">original</a> account is still used though.&nbsp;<br>I agree, can't seem to understand why the main account with actual media to show activeness isn't going to be used for advertisement.

1) Explain how the tournament is poorly organised. This has so far been one of the better events that's been hosted. In addition the tournament hasn't even started yet. How can you say its poorly organised when all that's happened is that there have been like 3 posts about it and registration opened and closed.&nbsp;<br><br>2)You have no idea how to run a fucking tournament, i didnt see you run one when you were admin.<br><br>3)All you do is post negative stuff and do jack shit to help.<br><br>'<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; ">they seem like cringey, uninteresting affairs.'<br><br>then why comment on them?</span>

Why is there a need for two twitters when avicus has like 10 people who actually care about using twitter. Not to mention most children (Avicus' main targets) wouldnt use skype. Didnt the staff policies just get released shoudlnt they have been shortened and then published? Please dont archive my posts again. Its hard typing on phones.

</div>
I agree with this. Just give Sr staff access the the main Twitter account, and allow them to post what they would post on this second Twitter on the first. As it is, there's only ever a few posts a week on the Twitter to update people on some news worthy thing.<br><br>Could improve the activity on the main Twitter too. Which is something great.

"poorly organised tournament" smh. this is definitely one of the best organised tournaments in terms of information and you're saying it's poorly organised. I'd like to see you do a better job mr think you know it all. It seems to be that when you retired I guess you became a total cunt because all that power was lost from you. If you really want to help this community stop acting like a complete prick and actually give some good feedback instead of just listing off things - give reasons for your fucking answer how on earth can you accomplish something without giving a reason / evidence. <br><br>just basically stop with all the continuous shittalking on the forums because no offense dude you're simply going to end up getting a lot of hate from this community which you sort of already are because of your attitude. This was a good community update Arigenn keep this up because the more you do this the more you interact with the community and keep them up to date with the latest news :).

I mean an official set of rules that can easily be found. I wasn't entirely sure where to find them if I needed to direct someone to them.

I personally am thankful for this post. I recently started playing on avicus and a community update is helpful. Good work :D<br><br>While the server is not as big and successful as it used to be, I still think that this server is awesome; I love the community and the server itself!<br><br>In regards to all the hate going on in this post. I&nbsp;think that it is immature of people to randomly point out issues, without any solutions. I get that you probably just want to help the server improve, and while identifying faults in the server is important, it is still rude, unfair and generally just unkind towards staff to call their work bad.<br><br>I also believe that people responding to said replies have been, in some cases, acting immature as well. Responding to people with personal insults based on their opinions is just ridiculous imo; If your trying to squash someones argument based on them 'flaming' then don't throw insults at them.<br><br>I don't want to fuel anymore fire, I just wanted to state my opinion.<br><br>p.s. I think this post is cool staff. Thank you :)
