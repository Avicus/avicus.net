So I was playing some Nebula, and I found this out.<br>Before the game starts, most likely you will do /join. <br>But what's weird is you can keep repeating /join, and you'll end up&nbsp;on the other team eventually.<br>So you can basically pick your team, like donors can. It should be fixed.<br>I don't know if this happens on other games, but I only found it on Nebula.<br><a href="http://imgur.com/LB4vcqd" rel="nofollow">http://imgur.com/LB4vcqd</a><br><a href="http://imgur.com/F92am7q" rel="nofollow">http://imgur.com/F92am7q</a><br>Check it out.<br>~DiamondPorkchop3

Yes.. Thats because the game hasn't started. You are /joining the other team purposely<br>It doesn't happen all the time, only when teams are uneven

I understand what you mean.<br><br>I think you should be able to rejoin the same game on another team&nbsp;<b>as long as you return to the hub&nbsp;<i><u>first.</u></i></b><i><u></u></i><u></u>&nbsp;<br><br>The reason I say that players should still be able to do this is because(in my opinion) it does not really matter which team you are on as long as you are having a good time. Players would have to return to hub so that other players who are not upgraded can still have a chance to join the game when there are only a few spots left than not being able to join a full team when like five players are doing&nbsp;<b>/join</b> to rejoin the game on another team without exiting the game.

You can also do /leave and then wait till the other team has less players than the other and do /join again. That's what I did as I was a non donor.
