Okay, i know that this talk, controversy and conflict of "the server is dying" is getting very heated and is probably the core of the forums at the moment in terms of main news.&nbsp;<br><br>This is not intended to be a rant or spam, and I'm seriously not in the mood for "Im sick of these posts, stop spamming" or anything related - you either read or you don't.<br><br>In my overall opinion, the server is <b>NOT</b> dying, but in fact far from it.<br>And this is why:<br><br>McZone. It was a nice place, had lots of games, etc. etc. and I remember joining in Dec. 2013, towards the end of the life span of McZone, and noticed an average 700 - 900 players on daily. Now before you try to correct me and say "NO it had more like 2000" Remember, i joined in the very last few months, where, even the staff have admitted, the player count was going down, so thats a little evidence to suggest that McZone was falling in numbers a bit, and i heard that to re-accumulate numbers, the whole Avicore concept was introduced, but either way it came.<br>Many people complained about the loss of SG and Skywars and all that, and left. It's a statistical fact. This doesn't mean that where we are now means that we are stuck in some kind of gravitational grip toward a black hole, where the player count will deteriorate until the server flops. Thats just pessimism getting the best of people. Avicus, to me, seems to be going through similar stages a sport star would - the highs and lows of the career. For a solid two months of the identical features we have now, we still lingered around 450 - 650 people a day, but i guess the less dedicated decided to leave for all kinds of reasons: not enough games, got bored, family issues, etc. And the player count just happened to lower a few hundred.<br><br>Now as silly as "Only a few hundred" sounds, i simply believe that Avicus has its own player gain K/D! So, like every 2.2 people that leave, another new person finds out about the server and joins. Surely that makes sense to someone, right? Its basically like saying the player loss rate just seems to be higher than the player gain rate, and there is our problem.<br>We need to identify and fix why people leave more frequently then those who join and also find a way to rise the "K/D" of Avicus, by finding ways to incline the level of people that find and join our server.&nbsp;<br><br>And i know that this is well and truly underway, as there have been tournament suggestions, YouTubers, including myself trying to amplify the recognition of Avicus and general social media spreading on Facebook, Twitter, etc.&nbsp;<br><br>If we stand solid mentally, and alter the required areas, it is just a matter of time.<br>Avicus has been fractured, and only healing lies ahead from here.<br><br>Thanks guys, OPTOBAT.<br><br><br>BTW sorry for making it so god damn long, but is you're passionate about this topic, you'll understand, and also an acknowledgement to those who also DONT think the server is dying, because you probably recognised some of what i was saying before i posted it :)

I did, and I don't care. Why can't you just post this on one of the other threads instead of contributing towards the problem.

There's already been tons of threads made about this, no need for another one.
