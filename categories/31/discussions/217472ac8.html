Hey everyone i haven't made a game/discussion in a while and i just thought of a weird, funky kind of one:<br><br>Comment what you think Avicus would be like in terms of population if the game mode numbers were reversed - for example, Nebula pretty much always had 0 people; it was the least popular game mode, and then Elimination and Avicade had the most players (80 - 120)?<br><br>Do you think Avicus would be more populated or less populated if the game mode numbers reversed?<br><br>I know it's kind of complex to understand so if you're confused just say so and i will try to explain better, but otherwise, please comment :D

The chances and the choices and the ways are lost.<br>And that made it fail and it will fall forever.

yeah i guess if the game mode numbers flipped, then the entire population of Avicus would too :/

And to reply your question, yes, the population will be changed sucessfully because during the mczone, nebula was not too populated and the hungergames and skywars was. And that could be, yes, another different that the community and Avicus will face.

I disagree.<br>You say that based on the fact that Nebula is the most popular.<br><br>In a world where Nebula is the least popular and Elimination is the most popular Avicus would have the same amount of success and popularity it has today. It's just that a different gamemode would be the most popular.<br><br>It's like a parallel universe. If you know what I mean

It would be&nbsp;<b>more&nbsp;</b>popular, because people only spend their time on Nebula because the bulk of the people is on it, sure, they might love it, but they would definitely love the other underrated gamemodes that get next to no attention.

I don't think that there would be a change. It is just that another game mode is more popular instead of nebula.
