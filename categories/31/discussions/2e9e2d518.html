Yes, it would give an advantage, but wouldn't it benefit staff moderating?<br><br>If someone reported a player for "Flying" you could watch their screen and see if they are hacking, same goes for really any hacks.

I'm not denying that it would be helpful, I am just saying it gives a player an advantage over another player, so it is illegal. Staff are not above the rules and although it would he amazing to use to catch hackers, it would still be illegal to use as staff.

If any moderator is worth their salt they should be able to tell if someone is hacking or not just by looking at them. They shouldn't need to go into their head and look from their point of view. If they do then maybe they should reconsider their post.

Wrong. I disagree with your statement saying this is illegal because Optifine, and Gama Bright give an advantage to another player over another player and they are legal mods. Now you may be thinking yeah but they can use Optifine and Gama Bright too, well same goes for this mod. If this mod is available to everyone and doesn't improve your PvP skill in anyway...&nbsp;I think making such mod illegal is just nonsense. And it's not like x-ray texture packs or things like that, that you basically can see everyone no matter where they are. If you heard the video, he said that you have a block limit in which you can see their screen and it isn't that easy to exactly locate where they are underground if you can see their screen. So I really don't see any problem with this.

That's like saying "Wizard Hax should be legal to use because everybody can use them!" Say you are guarding the monument and you hear somebody breaking the blocks around you, you could activate this and see where they are. Same goes for a rusher, they could use this to "scout" the opposing team defence.

Again... it's not that easy locating someone with that thing... He can be breaking the blocks near you, but it is really hard using that thing and knowing where he is... Having his perspective and trying to hide at the same time is really difficult to do. And then you have what Voltdrive said, it's kind of hard to do a command to have someones perspective while Scouting.

Giving a zoom to your screen and having your screen clear without darkness all the time gives you a pvp advantage... Shooting someone from a far place without optifine is harder than with it and fighting in a cave is harder without the mega brightness.

Personally, I don't see why mods can't use this, for moderating purposes only ofc. You say mods must follow the rules, but yet sr. mods get gamemode 1. If they get that for moderating, I don't see why they shouldn't be able to use this provided they don't abuse it.

Mont of us enjoy playing the game, as well as playing on other servers. Most servers would ban you for having this on your system, regardless of whether it is turned on or not.<br><br>As for the unnamed person claiming that it is equivalent to gamma bright and optifine, that is incorrect, those mods do very little in terms of gameplay, while this mod has the potential to have quite an effect on gameplay.

This is Hacking! You hack in to the minecraft client and then you see the screen. It's just bad! If a Mod uses this, he breaks the rules and will be banned. If the staff uses this, I quit Avicus. I don't want, that someone see my screen, wethever I "hack" or not. ITS JUST FALSE!

Your last paragraph is incorrect. I can compare mods for their legality. It is not my opinion, it is the effect on gameplay. And yes, all three of them give you an advantage, but they are different advantages. I think it would be easier for me to explain each one.<br><br>First off, avicus is not a survival server, being able to controll resources is not part of the gameplay. With this, being able to controll the lighting is not part of the gameplay. It is extremely easy to toggle past the max that is in settings, and so mods such as gamma bright are allowed.<br><br>As for optifine, it gives a large fps boost. The zoom is a handy tool that does not hinder gameplay. It makes it easier to see things, which I personally use due to a fairly low screen res (720p).<br><br>The mod in question gives you a large tactical advantage. You can see over walls, you can see under walls, you can see defenses, you can plan on how to pass these defences, learn where defenders lie, all before you've come within 59 blocks of the place. The mod is not legal for use of this server at current, and shall remain this way until a manager or above says ptherwise.

I agree that this indeed gives a slight pvp advantage,say someone wants to try to sneak up on you,but you have his perspective on camera,you can literally see where he is going,and in this case,you can judge when he is going to attack you.<br>As for the mods not using this mod,I also agree with their judgement,using something illegal to spy on someone using something illegal as well,isn't that just downright irony?

No. I have no quarrels with staff using it solely for the purpose of moderating. It's just that I imagine that some would like to play without having to switch their client.
