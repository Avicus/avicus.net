I feel like I'm a good PvPer, but I go into slumps of bad play more often than the average person which annoys me because I know &nbsp;I can do better. Does anyone have any tips to stay consistent? Today my aim was awful for example (which is true it was); is there an aim warm up I could do or something to make it less awful atm? And as I said, general consistency tips.&nbsp;<br><br>Thanks,&nbsp;<br><br>-ShadowSlayerZ7

What Ducks said.<br><br>I like to focus on the crosshair, and moving it onto my opponent. It really helps me concentrate on my opponent and aim. Other than that, practice is really key, which unfortunately takes time.

I can aim most of the time but yes as I said I fall into slumps, I'm a very musical person so I'm always listening to music. If if helps anyone here are some good songs : Tristam &amp; Bracken - Razor Sharp, Noisestorm - Surge, Tristam - Kings, Noisestorm - Breakdown, Tristam - Follow me, Tristam - The Vortex, Tristam - Jawn, Tristam - Chairs. Take a look (included a lot of Tristam because his stuff is amazing :P).

There are many tricks you can do in pvp but one of my most favorite trick is to strait line combo. Im still learning, but I think the way to strait line combo you must find a pattern to either enhance youre knockback or a way to delay your sprint. You can do a trick(I think?)called hybrid blocking. How I do it is by blockhitting when you come in contact with your enemy(Don't always blockhit, when you can't reach him do a normal hit.) You can also do this by hybrid sneaking or sneak tapping, this is exactly the same as hybrid blockhing but instead of blockhitting you shift and hit when you come in contact with your enemy. These tricks will enhance your knockback and at the same time delay your sprint causing an illusion from your enemy's POV to look like your hitting him from like 8 blocks.

Ok, going to take up the position of being the first person to tell you how to stay consistent, rather than how to pvp.<br>If you take, say, a weeks break from pvp, the first day back you CANNOT expect to be pvping well. During this day, I'd say to just practice your strategies such as strafing, clicking fast and your rushing routes around the map.&nbsp;<br>If you're just playing inconsistently i'd probably say do some variety and try different strategies. Doing the same thing over and over will likely become inconsistent as the strategy will have changed the more you do it (Kinda hard to explain what I mean, just ask for clarification if you don't understand).

One thing I use (which I probably shouldn't say but whatever) is I'll fake a strafe to my left and as I'm starting my strafe to my right I'll hit 1-2 times to knock them up into the air then I go for a short jitterclick burst hitting them 3 times in the air sending them backwards, then usually people sub-consciously go in few a big hit to even things out which I sidestep to my right most of the time and capitalize on, usually finishing them off with either a jitterclick or continue strafing depending. Sometimes if I know they're low I'll block hit from behind them to click faster for more damage.

AFK at spawn, you're sure to stop doing bad plays and you will completely be consistent. And if you care, you're kda will even stays stable o:<br><br><br>Hehe, anyway just get into it, you gotta keep enjoying what you're doing. Personally, when I start doing more bad than usual it just means I'm not enjoying playing anymore, so I just stop. But if you want to stay warmed up, as other said, music or smash your head on your keyboard, uh, I mean like just try to do some crazy play (1v5 or something) it personally makes me back into the mood, even if I fail it.

That's Stan's tactic and you're nowhere near close to getting it right if I can beat you whilst doing 360s every hit, imo you're average everywhere outside of avicus.<br><br>Back to the topic, consistency is one of the things even the best players have problems with, there's not really much you can do about it but put on some music, take a break, shower whatever until you feel you've improved.<span><br><br></span>
