Actually, this is the exact build I was going for! At least with the GPU and processor, the rest is just preference (but Win 8, seriously xD).<br><br>Although, if he is recording, I would get a lower budget case, power supply and motherboard to make room for a good performing i7.

Look, first understand computers, then buy one, by just seeing, you can't really tell, watch videos, ALOT OF THEM, learn about computers then go on about building one, smsh, You need a good combination, no bottle necks, research videos about your components, are you doing 1080p, at what refresh rate, @60, or @120, or @144, just do some research plz, you can't trust some of these people, some talk complete trash, and sorry but thats around 30% of all pc builders that try to help.

Not much. I gave a 800$ CAN build that runs 1.8 at max settings, OptiFine &nbsp;with a 16x edit and get around 120-300 FPS. 400-600 on 1.7.

Won't be streaming, If he wants for it to look nice, there... But he's not streaming, so I don't suppose an i7 will improve performance by that much.

Makes sense. I would still give a lot less money for some components and upgrade on the GPU or CPU. Seriously, paying 250$ for a mobo is just not necessary . I'm here with a 60$ mobo and I'm doing just fine.<br><br>Other than that, very nice build!
