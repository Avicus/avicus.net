As a guy who spends most of his time on the forums, I was quite shocked when I played on the Avicus Nebula servers.&nbsp;<br><br>The chat was filled with hackusaters of all kinds.<br>People going:<br><i>"Hacker!"</i><br><i>"Report soandso for x ray!"</i><br>and<br><i>"Don't worry, he will enjoy his long ban"</i><br><br>What the heck? &nbsp;<br>The forum community are filled with pretty cool people but the in-game chat are filled with whining babies who think that everyone and anyone constantly hacks the server.<br><br>It's not a good thing to show to newer players.<br>I have found the in-game chat behaviour very lacking.<br><br>I have been disappointed.

Most of those people that you see hackusating and swearing are not part of this community. They're just people who log on occasionally and play. I bet a lot of them haven't read the rules either. You wouldn't really see any regular forum users swearing or hackusating like that on a server.

I do understand this problem. have you tried warning them? warning them will not impersonate a moderator.&nbsp;<br><br>If warning doesnt work /report is always there or file an online report.

Basically what Jkawesome said, much of the server's actual community like the players aren't even part of the forums or even looked at the rules. Avicus is currently looking for moderators to hopefully lower the amount of hackusations

Yes, Avicus does have quite a few people who do not follow the rules but do not lose hope! There are many people that are very great and honorable players out there... We just need to be good role models to them.

You pretty much get that on most servers nowadays... It's a MINECRAFT issue really not ours. It is sad though that all of these people have nothing better to do or were not raised better than to abuse random people in a game. Generally I found it's people that don't get enough attention in their life so they seek it online by being negative people which saddens me. The best cure is to ignore em.

Usually they call others hackers because they got killed by a good player. Such as me.

I agree with Arachadonic, I see this on many servers nowadays and it's really getting on my nerves. There's also a lot of swearing and rudeness in the chat, which really bothers me.<br><br>Almost all people that are involved with the Avicus community are not like this. Hopefully with the new moderators, everything will resolve alright.
