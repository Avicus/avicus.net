Does Spawn Killing count as going in the actual spawn. or Does the area around it, Like a bridge and the exit count, Because I was kicked for Killing someone on a bridge out of spawn, but I see people killing in Quintus which is called "Spawn Camping" I belive, Are they the same and both punishable? Just a question :P

Spawn killing or targeting is when you attack the enemy in or around their base. <br>It is <b><b>not </b></b>exclusive to just attacking them<b> <b>in</b> </b>their base, the area around counts too.<br>So to answer your question, yes, they are the same thing and are both punishable. <br>Hope that helps.

Spawn killing counts as running into their spawn and killing them as well as waiting a few blocks outside of them and then killing them. This is not allowed and can be tempbanned once a warning has been given. What some people do in Quintus is 'Kill Farming' where they wait in their iron or wait in the rectangular part of them map with the two towers which is ok....To some extent. But if they are imposing into your spawn, any evidence you have is greatly appreciated and can be posted in the 'Player report' section of the forums.

If&nbsp;we take Quintus as an example, you should be <b>allowed</b> to get out and grab iron (or diamond)&nbsp;to armor up in&nbsp;order to defend yourself and your rmonument.&nbsp;Most of the times I play this map, players of&nbsp;one team stand&nbsp;right outside spawn (0 -&nbsp;3&nbsp;blocks away)&nbsp;in full diamond armor and kill the other team spawning only&nbsp;in&nbsp;leather armor. <br><br>I had this discussion in-game with a few players who thought it's alright to attack right outside spawn when the other team isn't capable to defend themself or even the monument. I did report this twice but no moderator came on and no action was taken, instead I was called stupid and someone who doesn't know anything about the gamerules. :)

Look you have to allow players a direct route out of spawn. This means most of the pathway on quintus. If you are cutting off their only route, that's spawn camping/killing/kill farming.

Spawn killing is when you run into the opponents spawn point and kill them.. Simple as that

^ No it isnt. You need to give them a clear path out of the spawn.
