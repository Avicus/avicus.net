I killed you yes, but you turned regen on later on, and everyone in Teamspeak were yelling at you, saying you had regen, and the first time i fought you, i knew you had regen, why?<br>I hit you about 3 more times than you did&nbsp;with a diamond sword, and then UltraBubbles fought you directly after, and you killed him too. I dont recall you eating a golden apple, so it was obivous you hacked.<br><br><br><br>

Just wanna hop in here and say that regeneration hacks (or FastHeal)&nbsp;don't exist. Although they are *apparently* found in some client menus, pretty much any kind of no-cheat plugin ever should counteract this. Unless someone can supply proof that there is a viable regeneration or fast-heal hack that is able to bypass NoCheat's filter, I stand by what I said.&nbsp;

We do have *a* version of No-Cheat. However, there are several hacked clients that are able to bypass even the most sophisticated anti-cheat plugins. Also, when the sensitivity was lowered in our version of no-cheat, I think it may have been lowered a tad bit too much.&nbsp;
