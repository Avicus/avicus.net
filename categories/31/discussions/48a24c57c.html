I've always wondered why a player needs 3 full pages of infractions before a Permanent ban can be issued. <br>Now, I'm all for a second chance but 3 pages of infractions is far too lenient.<br><br>For example, there is a player on the Avicus Network where every single one of their infractions is chat related. Spamming, excessive swearing and Hackusating are only some of the things this player has done.<br><br>This player has 17 infractions. <br>These infractions consist of 7 kicks, 6 warns and 4 temporary bans.<br><br>This player re-offended and got their 4th temp ban.<br><br>By tomorrow, this player will be back on our servers.<br><br>I'm sorry but where is the thinking in this?<br>I understand the moderators don't have the time look up every player's infraction page before punishing but something needs to be put in place.<br><br>If a player has multiple infractions for the same thing, moderators should be able to perma-ban them instead of waiting for the whole 3 pages of infractions to fill up.<br><br>An in-game command for moderators that show a player's infractions has been suggested before.<br>I believe this will truly help mods when punishing players&nbsp;so that moderators can give the correct punishment.<br><br>Also, I believe that moderators should be more strict when giving out punishments as the last thing we want to do is make Avicus the place where players can repeatedly break the rules over and over again.<br><br>If you made it this far down, congrats.<br>What are your thoughts?<br><br><b>TL;DR</b>:&nbsp;<br><b>- </b>I believe moderators are too lenient when it comes to permanent bans.<br><b>-&nbsp;</b>If a player has multiple infractions for the same thing, moderators should be able to perma-ban them instead of waiting for the whole 3 pages of infractions to fill up.<br><b>-&nbsp;</b>An in-game command for moderators that show a player's infractions has been suggested before.<br>I believe this will truly help mods when punishing players so that moderators can give the correct punishment.<br><br>Thoughts?

I like the idea for a command. But the problem with mods being too lenient that the server becomes a place where people can repeatedly break rules is the other extreme that the mods are too strict that the server is no longer fun to play on. There has to be a balance which is sometimes hard to find.

I completely agree with you on this issue, and I right now, for me, players with 15+ infractions have one more chance until the next infractions is a permanent ban.&nbsp;<br>In addition, I &lt;3 and totally support the idea of an in-game command for moderators that exhibit a player's infractions since it makes us much more efficient. <br>Agreed. :P

I'm not saying that the mods need to be so strict that Avicus is unplayable.&nbsp;<br>I'm just saying with regards to permanent bans that moderators need to be more strict.<br><br>Personally, I'd say if a player has 2 or 3 infractions where the same rule is broken they need to be perma-banned.<br><br>I strongly dislike what we have today where a player can obtain 15+ infractions and still play on the server.

I didn't mean to seem like you meant a mod should be that strict. &nbsp;I just meant is can be hard sometimes for mods to find the balance between too strict and too lenient

Players obtaining these infraction can be changed. I saw a former rule breaker change after a temp ban. I would give this idea some time before using it. Just wait for the new players to come in. +2 for the idea

Please, too many players are getting away with over 20 infractions when most aren't warns. Mainly kicks and tempbans.

Funny thing is, we decided to make ourselves far more lenient on the "Excessive Infractions" rule, and in doing so we've practically eliminated the entire usage of it in many cases. &nbsp;To my knowledge, we only ban/tempban if they have multiple infractions given within an extremely short time span. So for example, if a person has many chat infractions, but they are spread out a month apart each and are only warns, we aren't going to do anything about it. &nbsp;If they constantly get something like 1 or 2 infractions a day, then that is when we take action accordingly.

As sulo said, the staff attempted/is attempting to make the excessive infractions punishments more lenient, so most staff don't perm-ban/tempban very easily. Lots of time people will change, so it won't really help just banning them. If you see someone with excessive infractions like what Emmy said, with mostly kicks/tempbans, you could submit an online report. ^-^<br>For the staff command, it's been suggested so many times already D: And it's a great idea... maybe it's coming in the next update ;o

Staff don't "warn or kick for random stuff". They have a reason to do so, whether the player was excessively swearing, team griefing, being rude, et cetera. Having multiple infractions means that the player does not help the server maintain a positive environment, and does not contribute to the server in any way.

I wouldn't call it laziness.<br>It's just really time consuming if you have to look up a player's profile page every time you punish someone.<br>Which is why we need /lookup where mods can see a player's infractions in-game.

There is also the after-the-fact punishment. For example, when I was a Jr. Mod, I kicked this guy, and realized he had two pages of the same stuff, so I brought it to a mods attention, and an additional tempban was put in place for excessive infractions.

IMO, it depends on the situation. There have been times where I've seen a player have a full page on infractions (or more), and I've been like "Uhm hey, shouldn't this person get a little tempban?" Some mods would do it, while some would not. We have a general criteria to go by, and while I am all up for it, some mods are more lenient on it, and don't quite follow it.

The in-game command where moderators can see how many infractions one has is a great idea, but as others have said, there isn't a defined line of "excessive infractions" telling us when we should perm-ban.

I agree with the things you're saying here, but when we get a lot of reports coming in, we can't always look up the infractions on someone's profile.

I remember when somebody made a post about a command where staff members should be able to do something like /infractions username so that they can easily check all the infractions of a certain player, if the problem is that it's too time consuming, then this command would defiantly be able to help right? staff can also use this command if they are about to punish a certain player to see their previous infractions (if they have any) to decide their punishment from there, &nbsp;possibly increasing it up to a temp ban or ban<br>just a suggestion^ :P

There is a command plug-in that does this.<br>It is /lookup or /l<br><br>Ex) <br>/lookup SnowSX3&nbsp;<br><br>This brings up the player's infraction history, the infraction, the moderator who issued the infraction and the date of when it was issued.
