</h1>
Let me start off with,&nbsp;<u>this is not to insult staff, this is simply to help out staff, new and old with hack detection</u><u> and signs a player is hacking to help improve bans.</u>&nbsp;Anything to add? Suggestions? Comment away.<br><br>Without Further Ado:&nbsp;<br><br><u>KillAura/FF:</u>&nbsp;<br><br>-Always aiming at an exact point on the body. (It doesn't have to be the head)<br>-Keeps the target at 2-4 blocks away most of the time because of the kb produced.&nbsp;<br>-FF can be good or bad, Nodus KA is really bad, vs like Weepcraft KA which is pretty good compared to to other common hacks. It varies how hard it is to hit the person using FF depending on the quality of the FF. Some FF hacks will toggle to the closest person to you in that moment, while some will stay locked to the same person until you change targets manually/toggle.&nbsp;<br>-If it does change targets, it will immediately snap onto the next person. When using FF their shoulders will turn to hit them before their head fully turns, which can also be attained with high dpi and/or fast turns and response time with good aim, but that is generally uncommon.&nbsp;<br>-FF can be multi-target.&nbsp;<br>-FF can twitch and hit several people in one turn.&nbsp;<br>-FF range can be expanded in better clients, usually to 6 blocks, sometimes 8. (Difference between 8-blocking and having a 8-block radius FF)<br>-Can hit players without looking at them<br>Notes: Jitterclicking can attain some of the same attributes as FF.&nbsp;<br><br><u>Aimbot:</u>&nbsp;<br><br>-It's basically a worse version of FF, always aims at a certain part of the targets body. It shares many similar traits with FF, except for the most part without the auto-hitting and kb. &nbsp;<br>-The user's body is free to turn wherever it wants, but the head stays locked on target&nbsp;<br><br>Video of someone using Aimbot:&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=4sNuhLTeHF0">https://youtube.com/watch?v=4sNuhLTeHF0</a><br><br><br><u>Anti-KB:</u>&nbsp;<br><br>-You take almost no knockback (kb) with decent anti. When the person is taking no kb due to their ping and/or lantency, they will usually stop, If it's bad, the lag will usually negate the first hit's kb and they will take no kb for just that first hit, like Juano in Nexus (&lt;/3). With Anti, they will slow down slightly when they get hit, but they will not stop moving or move backwards. If they stop moving when they get hit, it's generally not Anti. If they slow down, but don't stop moving, especially when critting, it is most likely Anti-KB. If it's just ms/latency or techniques, they will just drop down, not continue the forward motion, vs Anti, were they will get slowed down, but continue the forward motion.&nbsp;<br><br><u>Triggerbot:</u>&nbsp;<br><br>-When set high it gives the same effect as jitterclicking, except due to the clicks being perfectly times by the program, it gives huge kb. Triggerbot also causes random headtwitching, so look out for that.&nbsp;<br><br>-When set low, all it does it help deal extra kb, so be wary of that as well. It will look less sketch<br><br>-Blockhitting/comboing will get lots of kb and that effect 2nd or 3rd hit, Triggerbot and Autoclicker are the first hit.&nbsp;<br><br>-If you&nbsp;jump and their head does ultra twitches when you jump, that's triggerbot<br><br><br><u>Note:</u> Most Triggerbot users are easy to strafe, but will deal huge kb when you get in front of them. Do not accidentally take sprint resets (blockhitting, w-tapping, etc.) as Triggerbot's extra kb. If someone blockhits the first hit and gets lots of kb, it's probably not triggerbot. You'll eventually learn how to spot Triggerbot with experience.&nbsp;<b><u><br></u></b><b><u><br>IMPORTANT:</u></b><u></u>&nbsp;Triggerbot =&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=SYegol4Xksc">https://youtube.com/watch?v=SYegol4Xksc</a>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It will look something like that. If the person is good and out-cps/pings you to the point of garunteed first hit with a sprint reset, it will look similar.&nbsp;<br><br><u>Autoclicker:</u>&nbsp;<br><br>-Same as Triggerbot, except it's client-side and not built-in. Only difference is that Autoclicker usually screws up the users dpi/sensitivity of the mouse and can cause pretty bad aim without headtwitching upwards.&nbsp;<br><br>Cayden Using Ghost Client: https<a rel="nofollow" href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=blZU3-BYf6Q">://youtube.com/watch?v=blZU3-BYf6</a>Q&nbsp;<br><br><u>Speed/Movement Enhancing Hacks/BSM:</u>&nbsp;<br><br>-Eat and block while moving&nbsp;<br>-Sprints in every direction&nbsp;<br>-Sprint/movement particles show when standing still

Probably add something about bow aimbot. Make sure to tell an easy way to see it, which is going behind them and seeing if their shots randomly curve. Also, bow aimbot is not never-miss, you just get a better chance of hitting them.

Yes but they won't "work" as a reach-hack. Kill Aura is hitting 'all' people in the radius of &lt;reach_settting&gt;. It doesn't promise you to deal damage, it just hits the enemys in this range.

Yeah. Im going to add lots more over time, but I find bow aimbot practically useless on Avi, because you'll randomly shoot teammates xD.

Reach hacks don't exist, it's just a modification the KA has that tells you the range of it.<br>Normally the max range is 6 and as I already said, some clients have it till 8, reach hacks don't exist because that's possible in a normal MC client too, you're way too wrong bud.

Some clients, like Nodus and Apex, allow you to add "friends" though, so if they set their team on the friend list, the hacks wouldn't target them.

I know, I've used Nodus on Mineplex and Random servers before. The issue is that people leave and join so quickly it doesn't matter, you will always end up hitting one of your teammates, plus most of the time people don't know it exists or puts in the effort to put each separate player in that catagory (friends).&nbsp;<br><br>So I kinda felt that It wasn't needed, thank you for the suggestion though ;)

The triggerbot is like an autoclicker/click aimbot/macro as the only thing it does is that when you aim to one player (manually), you start hitting him, you can customize this aswell so you can aim to the other player's head or body.

Why not? It gives you an ability to out-run players when block-spamming, so if you get stuck, you just go over, instead of getting stuck and killed?
