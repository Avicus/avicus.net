Hey guys, this wil be my final goodbye,&nbsp;<br><br>Ive had a good run since mczone, but this wil be my final goodbye.<br><br>I will not return to the server. One of the reasons is that i have been demoted without any notice, i put my heart and soul into my work on avicus, gave manny sugestions and changes to the system. But after all this work this is what i get as an reply, a cold hearted demotion without any notice.<br><br>So i wish the rest of you the best of luck,<br><br>Greetings.<br>shiro.

@Kycrafft, as stated before, i will no longer be on any avicus related platforms. i will anwser a few questions on the forums for people who have a question, in about a week i will also abandon the forums.<br><br>@<span><a href="http://avicus.net/437157" rel="nofollow">Straightened</a>, Time will learn my friend.<br><br>@</span><span><a href="http://avicus.net/resepignev" rel="nofollow">resepignev</a>, Howsie was demoted because he was going inactive as director, and was not willing to talk to staff about the time of absence, we decided that we wanted a change and new leadership was allected. <br><br></span>My demotion has to do with inactivity from the game due work and finding a house wich i also shared with the avicus team. The higher ranks decided that i would be demoted. there choise and i will honor it. tough i do not agree on how they handeld the procces. This is also the only reason i still write on the forums, because i feel slighty "mad" about the way they did it. *Not going into detail if an higher rank wants to explain how they demoted me its up to them,*

Gl in everything m8. I didn't get to know you too well myself, but you seemed chill.&nbsp;<br><br>Not to be that guy...but cold-hearted demotion is a bit harsh.&nbsp;<br><br>Ofc there are reasons why this happened, and trying to pin the staff team for being cold-hearted for demoting you is just ridiculous. If you were demoted, you were demoted for a reason.&nbsp;<br><br>Gl and I wish you the best.
