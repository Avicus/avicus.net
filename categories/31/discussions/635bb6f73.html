This is just my opinion but I don't really think the donor ranks are worth it to buy/upgrade now. They used to have a lot more perks like premium items in the point shop which made them worth the money but since all those were removed you don't really get a whole lot from the ranks. I was thinking about getting emerald but you don't really get a whole lot more from it except for a slight xp increase and a few kits which you still need to work hard to get.I think the prices for the ranks need to be reduced or have more perks added. Tell me your thoughts.

The point of ranks isn't to get perks, it's to support the server.

kycrafft is right.<br><br>The point of donating to the server is that you help support the Avicus Network.&nbsp;<br>Perks are just a thank you from the staff.&nbsp;<br>You should donate to support the server, not to obtain the perks that come with it.

Yeah, I donated to support Avicus, the perks are just a nice little reward. Also, I believe the things you described were removed because of changes in Minecraft's EULA.
