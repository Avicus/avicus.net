By daily, do you mean you don't want to buy them online and at a store instead? &nbsp;If so, that really brings down your options.

I'm thinking he means with a microphone because he said he wanted to improve his channel's audio.. why would you want to get a headset so expensive? ;_;

My headset is $10 and the audio isn't terrible.<br>I wouldn't recommend buying big expensive headphones / microphones, unless you are a big YouTuber who makes his money from YouTube.<br><br>Sorry buddy, I don't really know any good headphones, but I would recommend looking at logitech headphones, as they are quite cheap yet produce nice sound. :)<br><br>Good luck! :)

The Logitech G230 Stereo Gaming Headset is very good if you want some good headphones with a microphone on it.<br><br>For only about $60, I would say it is totally worth it.

I have a Logitech USB headset, works perfectly fine for me. Around $40.<br><br>If you really want legit headphones for listening, I recommend Senheissers for great sound quality and a flat response, Bose for good fit / style / sound quality, Sol Republics for Beats-sounding quality with great build / style, and Monsters for basically same thing as Sol Republic. But, it's perfectly up to you x)

How is this possibly spam?<br>The new rule does not allow people to post personal life updates, this is not personal, he's simply asking for good headsets, and this thread is useful to other people as well.<br>Think before you type

Ok for starters, wireless headphones do not give you cancer as there is no proof to show it. Also, you have never used my headset nor any other Logitech Wireless H800 headset. So stop talking poo out of your bum Zeddy Zed. #CacalmarinFTW

A majority of the time you get for what you pay for, if you want top notch you're going to need to have a little bit higher money budget. If you pay for a 20$ headset it's going to be pretty shitty 75-80$ is much better but as I said, if you want a top notch headset then that is going to be in the higher end money zone.
