What is everyone's best match in terms of kills? Mine from what I can remember was 45 kills on Senex II with like 3 deaths only because I camped and bowspammed. Yours?<br><br>iBiZa

Ended an hour-or-so-long match of (I think it was) Rendezvous I. All the iron was gone, both teams had one monument left and ridiculously OP defenses (not so much the defenses that were the problem as were the 15 or so defenders). Spent 15 minutes tunneling past them, managed to get right under the monument. Had to break some blocks to get at it, one of the defenders was staring right at me. He was AFK. Two other defenders were within hit distance of me, and I managed to break it. AFK defender came back just as I was about to break it, got one hit on me and then it broke.&nbsp;<br>I probably got like 2 kills and 30-some deaths but this was the match that stands out in my mind.

I like this^Sometimes the best matches don't involve a ton of kills. It's just an amazing game overall the makes it stand out.

I get approximate 100 - 150 kills per 1 death. ;) (I don't count the maps with diamonds, on those maps you can killfarm up to 500 if you so wanted to.)

One time I was playing on Justice with full diamond armor and there was a very secure bridge. I made a little house like thing on the side of it and sniped the pursuers off before they could get to me &gt;:D defenses were OP so the match went on forever. Solid 397 kills... I'm a nub...
