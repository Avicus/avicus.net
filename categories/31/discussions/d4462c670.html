I currently use 2400 @ 100% sensitivity.<br>Do you think there is a better one for PvP &amp; Parcour? Pls post C:

If you can change your DPI, I would recommend going through all of them and testing how you do in PvP, and then deciding.

It's down to personal preference. Try different settings, like Nolan said. I use 4000 DPI at 125% sensitivity because I've learned to adjust by slowly raising my DPI and sensitivity level (I used to use 75% sensitivity with 1600 DPI.)<br><br>According to several guides on the internet, higher sensitivity is better for swordplay (to help with your aim) and lower sensitivity is better for archery (to get a steadier aim,) but again, it's down to personal preference.

I found a mouse that costs aprox. $10, it is a laser mouse with I think 2400 DPI. I heard laser mouses are better in FPS games, but the best DPI settings is how good you are with them.

As long as your sensor is not a ball, it will make little to no difference.

Ideally a higher dpi is better because you can turn quicker etc. But it decreases your accuracy heavily. What I recommend is starting off on middle dpi and slowly raising it after you're comfortable.

I always stay at 1800 DPI and 150% sensitivity. Gives me good control and good aim with Sword and bow.<br>I recommend it.
