A few days ago I started playing on this server and I loved it , I put effort and started playing seriously and when I wanted to see my statistics is not loading , I do not charge anything for my profile, I have said in the game that put a / stats at the end of the link in my profile and I worked, but I still can see my nemesis and stuff that are also interesting , is there any solution?<br>Oh and also , I have to make some friends and also saw that I find the button to add them as friends, not as someone tells me?<br>Thanks in advance! Excellent server :D<br><br>PD: Sorry if confunsas words but my English is not very good xD

Hello&nbsp;MateOMG_10.<br><br>To add friends, go on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://old.avicus.net">http://old.avicus.net</a>&nbsp;and find the player that you wish to add as a friend. Then, go on their profile and click "Add Friend".<br>When they accept you, you will then be friends.<br><br>Stats are sometimes glitched for newer players.

The stats problem might not get fixed anytime soon :L but to add friends go to the old forums log in and hit the "Add Friend" button. Here's mine. <a href="http://old.avicus.net/99250" rel="nofollow">http://old.avicus.net/99250</a>
