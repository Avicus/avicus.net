As some of you may know I was recently perm banned from Avicus. I would like to inform you that I will be staying with the community even though I will not be a player on the server. I will be giving ideas and input on things and am not a bad sport for getting banned.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -PD

Hey PocketsDude, I really feel bad for you. Looking at your past infractions, I believe you could easily appeal if you do not abuse the public chat since most of your infractions are because of that.&nbsp;<br><br>I suggest that you appeal at the end of the month and then by then, maybe you would have learned your lesson. Good luck and thanks for being a good sport!

Hey Pockets.<br><br>Although you want to inform the community that you will be staying, posts like these are unfortunately&nbsp;<b>not</b> allowed on the forums, according to Section D, Number 7.<br><br>If you want to help out the community, your ban <b>may </b>be easier to appeal, although excessive infractions is not the easiest punishment to appeal.<br>However, it is not impossible.<br><br>Good luck!
