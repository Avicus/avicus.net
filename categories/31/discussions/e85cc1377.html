I believe that PPB and BC can compete with OCN teams. We have an advantage of knowing maps etc. As shown last tourney, OCN teams really weren't that strong. Even then, we have beaten teams like SquadCat on OCN maps.

:/ Fort trials members and practices largely with our less experienced players and we still do well. Tbh if this is a joke we don't need jokes of it's kind. If not we don't need the negativity, thats what we have haters for.<br><br>@OP BC is good, PPB doesn't do much as far as avicus scrims so imo their map knowledge advantage is gone. Apollo is cool, we'll see what their roster looks like in the tourney though since atm it changes frequently. I will never doubt berzerk again, so they are always a contender. Fort should do well, but hey we'll see. I won't comment on ocn teams as they either can't show up or don't care so it's hard to predict their results.

No joke we try to get OCN teams to scrim on the avicus maps. It doesn't work out well. You would either be in amazement or you will cringe at the amount of work I put on the CTW maps we have so far. But no PPB are shit and they should feel shit

No joke we try to get OCN teams to scrim on the avicus maps. It doesn't work out well. You would either be in amazement or you will cringe at the amount of work I put on the CTW maps we have so far. But no PPB are shit and they should feel shit

BC scrim way more on OCN than we do on AV :3 There's just more teams to play over there, like we're no where near the best on OCN but we aren't bad either. &nbsp;Same with PPB infact both teams barely have any players that haven't been in an OCN tournament, most of us being in quite a few. &nbsp;There's is such a stigma on Avicus that OCN players are all gods, yes they have their fair share of them but you lot do underrate yourselves. Also before someone checks my OCN stats this isn't my main account, same for quite a few members of our team.&nbsp;<br><br><br><br>@OP out of the current teams BC or PPB looking strong.

<p>tbh I believe that most&nbsp;ocn teams are better than avicus teams is untrue. I do accept that teams such as lunglove, punishers and impact are far better than even the best avicus teams, but also the worst ocn teams and even worse than the worst avicus teams. This is because of community on ocn are far bigger than that of avicus. So the chances of ocn having better teams is greater than avicus. There are far more ocn teams than we realise. less thatn half are better than the&nbsp;average avicus team.</p>

Hes not is retarted as he may sound, Bad Company for example have players that have been in top ocn tier teams eg Punishers, Ambush, Impact, Schaden, Fishy and Turquaars.<br>Clearly the average OCN regular is better than the average Avicus regular, but you guys on OCN seriously under estimate 1 or 2 teams.

It really depends on what the teams are looking like when the tournament comes around. I'd say the top 3 teams from last tournament + PPB will all be contenders, but it will also come down towhich teams bring bring their A games.
