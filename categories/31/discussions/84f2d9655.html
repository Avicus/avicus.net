Everyone hates it when donators join the winning team in a game of Nexus to gain more exp. Well perhaps we can make this change.<br><br>So my idea was that the people helping the team the most deserve to be rewarded, and those who cheat don't deserve anything. We can give winning exp based off of how many kills a player has gotten a game. So if you got about 20 kills a game you get like 12 exp when you win, and if you get 0 kills you get nothing. So donators that team swap get no exp.&nbsp;<br><br>It can reset every time someone does /leave to also prevent team stackers. For example, I'm playing Nexus. Then about half-way through I see Smitdalt join the other team. My team has about 5 players, they have 6. I want to be on Dalton's team, so then I switch over and teamstack. BUT I lose my exp with this possible addition. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Here's an unofficial chart representing what it might be:<br><br>3 kills: 2 exp for winning<br>5 kills: 4 exp for winning<br>8 kills: 6 exp for winning<br>10 kills: 8 exp for winning<br>13 kills: 10 exp for winning<br>15 kills: 12 exp for winning<br>18 kills: 14 exp for winning<br>20+ kills: 15 exp for winning<br><br>I'd appreciate the feedback! Tell me what you guys think!

+1 I think this would really help. The reason it'd help is because if someone switches then they lose all their xp from kills. Also this would help leveling up faster ;)

I love this idea. Maybe it could be interpreted into other modes? Like nebula and cth? But having the kill requirements tweaked, As I can tell players can get 700 xp/h if they just kill farmed. That is if the exp kept rising with the kills.<br><br>But +1 c:

What is with a unfortanally disconect? You play the whole game on your team and you can't get a kill, because your computer is crappy and ugly or if you are just too bad for getting a kill? ?&nbsp;What is if the team in what you are have 5 ppl and the other team has 3 because they disconected and you join the other team to make it fair? or in Nebula, you play a game and your friend joins, you will join his team, because he isn't a donor. What is then?

I think it should be something like this, it's just that 3-5 kills isn't much :/<br><br>3 kills: Miss...<br>5 kills: Miss...<br>8 kills: 6 exp for winning<br>10 kills: 8 exp for winning<br>13 kills: 10 exp for winning<br>15 kills: 12 exp for winning<br>18 kills: 14 exp for winning<br>20+ kills: 15 exp for winning

I feel that as long as you stayed on your team for most of the game, you should get xp, regardless of who won.

Agreed with ViolentBoo.&nbsp;<br>3-5 kills in one whole 10-15 minute Nexus Game, is very subtle. Especially when the game is fully packed up to 80 kills. At least 8 kills to earn exp on a team.&nbsp;<br>Not only does this prevent cheating, but it also does earn more exp for bigger contributors.&nbsp;<br>+1!

This is to prevent teamstacking at the end of the match, where donors join the winning team to get points.

I partly agree, but I feel this will bring in a storm of killsteals and spawnkills, and thats going to cause more of a problem then a donor joining a winning team does
