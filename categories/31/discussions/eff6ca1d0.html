Anything regarding <b>contests</b>, <b>mapdevs themselves</b>,<b> map questions</b>, <b>yml questions</b>, <b>github</b>, <b>rotations</b>, <b>rank questions</b>, or whatever you want to discuss will be answered to the best of our ability and put in the OP.

<span><b>Who will be the new mapdevs? (after the update) </b>We aren't currently sure of the amount of mapdevs that will come after the update. There may be 1 or 2 within the foreseeable future, though, which is before 2015 ends. We'll see.<br><br></span><span><b>How many new mapdevs will be there?</b> Possibly 1 or 2, can't speak for the whole team. We've done polls and done meets on this before discussing it among the others. We don't want to have the team expand too much, otherwise it'll be difficult to maintain.&nbsp;<br></span><br><span><b>Regarding yml.

A lot of changes will be made, see Ivy's facebook sneak peeks!<br></span><br><span><b>More Map Events planned?</b> If we get around to it. Lots of maps in storage at the moment, though broken.<br></span><br><span><b>Public yml test server? </b>I don't think this will happen. If it does, I'd imagine you'd have to rent them.<br><br></span><span><b>What permissions do mapdevs have? (ingame/forums)</b> In-game, we have commands to set maps, end matches, use build/dev/mapdev servers, and to change cycle durations. We also have a dev chat in-game. On the forum, we have access to staff discussion and a green name. That's about it.<br></span><br><span><b>If you could change one thing in the current yml system, what would it be?</b> I'd love for there to be certain items gained after a set amount of kills. For instance, killing a member on the enemy team for the 5th time without dying would give you a special item.</span>

Then usually it results in a denial. If we try to list improvements or potential revisions to have it play better and they don't budge, either we try to compromise or have to deny it.

It depends. We don't look for anything specific, though gameplay and looks are important. There's creativity, uniqueness, size, and other factors though it's really onto the mapmaker; it's their canvas that we rate.<br><br>This is more of an opinion-based thing, but I personally like to find a balance between them. If the gameplay is nice though, there's no questioning I will appreciate that map even if it doesn't look the best.<br><br>You just use the build: flag and add a * so nobody can build.

Up to IvyCode. It can be easily abused, though I wouldn't mind if they had the end command for broken matches.

1: Download a void world or use a preset where it's all void. You could also use plugins to generate void worlds such as CleanroomGenerator.<br><br>2: Try using <a rel="nofollow" href="http://docs.avicus.net">http://docs.avicus.net</a>&nbsp;and you can use any text editor you'd like.<br>3: Not exactly.

After looking at your map, I personally would say it's denied. It's flat, offers semi-boring gameplay, has a lot of void, and it isn't really unique. Try experimenting with palettes, adding more shape to your maps, and adding more features to your map.&nbsp;<br><br>Not sure.<br><br>Also not sure, what is it directed toward?

I have a couple questions:<br>1. Would the server ever add a voting system for the next map?<br>2. Are any 'old school' maps going to be brought back. I really liked the one where it had a tree with diamonds in a chest underneath it at the front of the spawn. Forgot the name though!<br>3. I am making a Nebula map as a series on my channel, I make the map based off of the ideas generated by the Avicus community. At the moment they would like to have a little twist to it. I was wondering if I should have 3 monuments and 2 are behind the spawn and 1 is somewhere in front of it, I was wondering if this would work or would it promote spawnkilling?

I think that cherry land really tests people, to see who are mature and use the tnt for good or bad. That was how I always saw it, my opinion but the map dev team have their own reasons for adding/removing maps.

Okay so my idea for a new map system is: First the system would choose 3 random maps. Then players would get to vote for maps. The map with the most votes would win. If there would be a tie the system would randomly pick between the tied maps.

1. Are you guys also considered kit developers? (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://maps.avicus.net/Shared/">http://maps.avicus.net/Shared/</a>)<br>2. Do spawners work?<br>3. Will dispensers with spawn eggs spawn mobs?<br>4.&nbsp;If you reward -1 points per kill in tdm, will this disable points being given for kills?<br>5. Is&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://docs.avicus.net">http://docs.avicus.net/</a>&nbsp;100% updated?<br>6. Have you guys thought of giving players weakness along with resistance when they spawn? This way players can't be killed when they spawn and players can't abuse their 8 seconds of resistance to kill others.<br>7. Are you guys able to put in maps of different gameodes into another rotation for a different gamemode? (Ex: A CTH map into a Nebula server)

1. Yes, I guess.<br>2. I think so, yes.<br>3. Yes.<br>4. No, it'll go backward.<br>5. Not entirely, could use some changes.<br>6. Point of it is to make you stronger so you can beat off spawnkillers. Not being able to fight back would only make it worse.

Is this what you mean? First select a region using the world edit wand, //wand. Then use .//set (block),(block) and etc depending on how many different blocks you want.&nbsp;<br>It makes the blocks in a random pattern.

What I'm going to ask isn't really a major factual question, but one that I'm asking just because I'm really curious...and it might be a little hard to explain, so bear with me. :D<br><br>Ha<i></i>ve any of you guys ever been conflicted about passing a map through the testing phase? As in, has there ever been a map that you <i>reeeally</i> wanted to add to the rots, but didn't want to because it had some outstanding flaw of some sort? If so, could you perhaps name a couple?
