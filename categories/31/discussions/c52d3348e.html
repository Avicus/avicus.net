These are some of the&nbsp;buildings I work on when my internet is slow, I could add some more if people wanted, but I'd see if people liked these. *These are my first builds in Minecraft feedback would be nice.*<br>Here is the Sears Tower:<br><a rel="nofollow" href="https://flic.kr/p/pY3QFr">https://flic.kr/p/pY3QFr</a><br>My "House":<br><a rel="nofollow" href="https://flic.kr/p/qCfKnU">https://flic.kr/p/qCfKnU</a><br>Another House:<br><a rel="nofollow" href="https://flic.kr/p/qCpz6T">https://flic.kr/p/qCpz6T</a>

I can't see any of your builds. It is too small at the angle of the screenshot.

Alrighty, always wanted to give feedback on creative buildings instead of maps :P.<br>ANYWAY:<br>I'm just gonna give feedback on the tower, since your house isnt that "aesthetically pleasing" (no offense bruh)<br>I know its supposed to be a similar replica, but I think it should be scaled up a bit more to make room for more details.<br>If you're building modern, I suggest soartex fanver or flows hd resource packs as they're prime modern packs for building.<br>Perhaps some color variation would be nice, as of now I cant really see anything since its so dark.

My house isn't&nbsp;aesthetically pleasing at all in this texture pack, but in a different one (which I posted a picture of) it looks somewhat better, but not that much. It was made as my very first thing in Minecraft, way back in 1.2.5, when I didn't know how do much, so I know that would be bad. I posted new pictures of the Sears Tower that looks better with the other texture pack, but I may have to make the windows smaller. I don't want to make it any bigger because it is already 108 blocks tall (1 block for every IRL floor). But thanks for the suggestions, no offence taken. :)
