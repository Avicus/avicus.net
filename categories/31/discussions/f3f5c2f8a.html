Since I haven't had a chance to comment this because the threads were locked swiftly, porky's punishment isn't biased. I'll explain why.<br>First of all, aimbot is more extreme than an auto clicker. Why? Because it grants a more unfair advantage in game than an autoclicker, which is why they treat the violation more extremely.&nbsp;<br>Second of all, it isn't "biased" because it's D00ZIE. IF D00ZIE was using killaura or aimbot he would still be perm banned. Just because you're a donor/forum user doesn't mean you are immune to punshiments.<br>Finally, quit spamming the forums. Emmy isn't abusing his powers, you're just flatout wrong.&nbsp;<br>-Spicy

Still, there is no reason to constantly complain on the forums, contact a director/manager through Skype or the support e-mail.

Also what nolan said, I was in the teamspeak at the time with a few other players WHO HAVE A HISTORY FOR GIVING DESCRIPTIVE AND RATIONAL REPORTS OF HACKING TO MODERATORS. Instead of accusing him of "hak" we came to the conclusion that he was indeed hacking. Plus we got a few mods to spectate him and they agreed he was hacking as well. Even without the teamspeak chat he was getting multiple reports from decent pvpers that he was indeed hacking, therefore the mods came to the conclusion that he should be perm banned for hacking. End of story.
