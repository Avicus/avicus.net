No, Steven retired and the ban doesn't gets appealed if a staffmember/mod retires.<br>Only Moderators + have ban permissions.

The person who banned you decided to retire (when they were still a moderator.) It just shows this because that person punished you before retiring. The ban is still valid.&nbsp;<br><br>So in short, no.

yes twice once on July 31st then another 11 days after but there should be an immediate warning before someone is banned aka "you have received a warning if you continue with the current behavior you will be banned or temp-banned" unless its for hacking then it should be like that

Okay, this is not the place to complain about your infraction. If you wish for it to be appealed, go to the "Appeal an Infraction" tab. Good luck!<br><br><br><b>Locking...</b>
