From my experience on the server I have theorized that those who purchase ranks get better treatment than those who don't such as a person who doesn't have a rank says fuck- the mods tells them to stop and person with gold or higher says fuck- no one cares

You're theory is incorrect.<br>No player is above the rules and no-one gets special treatment.<br><br>This includes everyone, regulars, donators and staff members. <br>We're all on the same playing field when it comes to the rules.

I'm on Notal's side here, the staff team has constantly told people (and me) that swearing is perfectly fine, as long as it's not excessive or directed towards someone, most of the time saying "fuck" in chat lands you in no trouble whatsoever (past experience)<br>In regards to the OP, you see regulars with ranks being punished all the time, it's really not a rare sight, it really depends on the staff member you're in game with, some of them don't appreciate the use of the word "fuck" but wont warn for it.

ok imo there is some truth to the original theory, but (and this doesn't make it any better) it's subconscious. whether you like it or not, you have many biases. everyone does. it's just a fact. they exist and to deny that they do is silly.&nbsp;<br><br>unfortunately, we can't conduct a controlled test to prove these biases, but they are most likely there in some staff and you can't prove that you would punish a diamond donor as strictly as you punished a normal user for the same exact thing.<br><br><b>the best thing to do is recognize that these biases may exist. not just for a positive donator bias in staff members on a minecraft server, but in life. you recognize that you may be prejudiced, or have certain stereotypes. every privileged person, whether they want to or not, probably bases things off of stereotypes towards a less privileged group. and what you have to do is recognize this and fight it. denying it only further contributes to these kinds of problems</b>

I second this. I have seen it with different moderators and it really makes the staff team look like they sometimes can't decide on a side to take. It makes them look undecisive and when I see someone swear in chat who is a donor they won't get punished, and when I see a non-donor they will get punished for saying the exact same thing. The Staff team is indecisive ATM, and they need to be able to make a choice soon on whether or not swearing is allowed.

just by looking at donor's profiles, you can see they also can have a lot of infractions. it's true.<br><br>however, most of the ones i looked at had multiple permanent bans that had been cleared, and the players were allowed to come back even if they had tons of infractions and a few perm bans. that might be where the bias falls, but i'm not sure. i'm speaking from a purely factual place here from what i have seen, <b>if you have arguments to the contrary i am happy to question my views.</b>

IF the "new" rule says you cant cuss AT ALL, then I am against it. (And this is coming from a person who is against cursing and doesn't curse at all)<br><br>Sure it is an uncessary thing to say in chat and its a trash word but if its to vent out anger, i guess its ok. I mean, we got kids in minecraft screaming stupid, uncessary stuff so shouldn't they be punished as well?<br><br>Point is, its gotta a bit more chill. You can't just ban cursing in general because a lot of people in the internet curse. IF you can't deal with people saying like the f word once, then its best to stay off the internet.<br><br>However, i beleive they should be punished if they curse directly a person with rude intentions and use it excessively<br><br>Readarding the @OP, i do not see that a lot in Avicus if i remember but if you do see some bias, just email support (btw just to be clear, just cause your a donor doesn't mean you can break the rules and stuff. You are still a normal player who plays Avicus but the server has distncted you as a person who donated and got the perks that came along with it)

And if we have the right to create whatever we want the server would lose balance and everyone would be hacking and swearing and building inappropriate things. Having rules is a good thing because it keeps the server intact and safe. It keeps the server healthy and clean for players to enjoy.

but it makes sense the people should have the right to dictate the server unless their a hacker in which case they get no rights as they are basically a criminal. I say we just base the server off of a democracy so we can decide on what we want and don't want instead of letting admins and mods dictate what to enforce and what not to.

Guys please, everyone calm down. The situation shouldn't get worse. If BurningTaco here wants to test something, he has a right to his opinion. But I suggest next time, picking a server where you first claim is valid. Staff are picked to respect all players.<br><br>As for yourself BurningTaco, I suggest you calm down man. Although you may have your opinion, why go about it being rude to others? Telling people to suck something is just wrong and disrespectful man. Please. This community is all respect and fun.

He did ban evade, and there's evidence showing he ban evaded on video.&nbsp;<br><br>Not trying to get any1 banned, but ban evasion = a ban and no chance of appealing, and that clearly hasn't been followed.&nbsp;<br><br>You're basically stating that there is no bias, there obviously is.

I know he did. I didn't say he didn't. I also didn't say there was no bias. There is bias. But bias and whatever this burningtaco kid is talking about are two different things. Donators getting better treatment? The amount of donators that get punished on a daily basis man. Same goes for regulars.

I'm saying how there is bias. I'm not moaning saying "OMFG THIS SERVER IS SO BAD AND BIASED", rather I'm giving examples to prove a point.&nbsp;<br><br>Some of those people I would not like to see banned, but I would like to point out that there is bias and it is there.&nbsp;<br><br>If you're going to deny it, expect arguments and counter-points against that :P

But your examples are garbage. You can't prove bias just by those statistics.

Ok, as a fair question to ask then concerning that, is that if everyone is on the same playing field, then why is someone with 4 Perm bans and TONS of bans on alts you know about still playing on the server?&nbsp;<br><br>I mean, do what you want, but seriously...you can't say everything is fair with stuff like this.

I dealt with Brick a lot when I was Senior Mod, I banned him multiple times, and other senior staff would keep appealing him.<br><br>After a few months Brick's misbeahavior was getting rarer and rarer eventually to the point where we just didn't see the reason to permban him as he would just wreck havoc on alts, plus as I previously said he wasn't acting like a complete dick anymore.<br><br>He hasn't gotten an infraction in 5 months, so it looks like he's changed.

I would like to know why staff members are allowed to use racial and homophobic slurs and be disrespectful against people with mental and physical disabilities. It's pretty obnoxius tbh, especially when sr staff members deny it like it never happens, when it does. <br><br>I'm sure Avicus doesn't want recognition for being racist, homophobic and against people with disabilities, or do you?
