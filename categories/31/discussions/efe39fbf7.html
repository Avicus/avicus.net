Just going to keep this nice and short and readable for you :D<br>Well what a journey, from MCZone being my first server to now. Avicus has changed soooooo much. Well I have decided to become furthermore inactive as I don't really enjoy playing Avicus as much anymore. I haven't said anything on the forums in months and well, the community is dying (no offense). I have really enjoyed my time here though but I sadly must continue with other things. I will play occasionally but it is unlikely I will be on the forums much more at all. I have 2 more maps to submit though first :D<br>Anyway quick thanks to these guys:<br>EricV4 - Good fun and enjoyed making maps with him :P<br>Peachy and Kammy - Great supporters for my build server and cool to talk to<br>Evo and Para - Amazing map dev's helped me soooooooo much<br>Everyone who's been part of my build server, Fennercraft and played with me on Avicus,<br>The avicus community - Although it's dying it was the strongest community and good fun to be a part of<br><br>Bye everyone,<br>Thanks for the journey<br>subzero out :P

Well, You've been a good friend to me and all I can say is thanks. We may have just met, but I feel like we had something. I just wish you could have stayed so I could tell you what that something was. Now that your gone, I don't know what to do with my life. There a hole in my heart, where you should be, but your not. And with that fact to lead me no where, I will cry and cry and cry. Until you return to me :'(.<br><br><b>P.S.&nbsp;</b>Cya l8r
