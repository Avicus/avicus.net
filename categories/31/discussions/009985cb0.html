</h1>
Not gonna lie: I'm not active on the server, and I'm not very active on Teamspeak. The only thing that I have stayed remotely active on is Discord.&nbsp;<br>Why you might ask? Well, I enjoy having thought provoking discussions with old and new friends. If you're in Discord, then you know the only channel with any type of thought provoking discussion is #politics.<br><br>Well, politics was removed a few days ago. Immidiately following that, political banter was forbidden as well.&nbsp;<br>Why you might ask? I have no f***ing clue. It was one of the most used chats on Discord. Yes, there were sensitive and flammable topics discussed regularly. Yes, some people may have had their <i>feelings</i> hurt by someone else's views. But why remove the whole channel? People are entitled to their views and opinions, and I don't think Avicus should censor something that is a huge part of everyone's lives (indirectly).&nbsp;<br><br>Quite honestly, I think the reasing behind this rash decision was that one or two players complained about some hurt feelings. Then, the people in charge (I have no clue who actually carried out the decision) took the easiest, fastest, and most blatant route to satisfying this one (or two) player's hurt feelings. Simply removing the channel and barring a whole topic from conversation From what I can tell, the active #politics users were not informed or asked for their opinion. <br>Here is a drastic example that shows the same kind of coddling: I am allergic to dairy. I don't like when people talk about food with dairy because I feel left out. Should all talk on dairy related food be forbidden just because I can't have it? Hell no, thats f***ing stupid. So why block a whole aspect of my life because one or two kids feels uncomfortable with my opinion?<br><br>People who talked there mostly enjoyed it. If they didn't, then they knew that all you gotta do is click on a different discussion board thingy. It was a stupid decision that removed one of the only reasons I still interact with this amazing community.<br><br>So, here is my demand: give us,<b> mature Avicus players,</b> a place to discuss politics and sensitive issues. What's the downside? It just gets more players on your platform. For those players who want to continue to be coddled, who want to live inside their perfect bubbles, who don't want to experience the real world; give them the option they&nbsp;<i>already had</i>: to not join or view the conversation.<br><br>Thank you for reading and please comment your thoughts down below,<br>Max<br><br>Also, as my favorite comedian, Jim Jefferies once said:<br>"You can call me a cu**, I'll call you a cu**. You don't have to come to my house, I don't have to come to your house. You can f*** off, I can f*** off, and thats the kind offreedon we should celebrate everyday!"

Seniors discussed it apparently, but they should've got 2 community members one for each side of the discussion involved.

Personally I don't think it should have been added in the first place, after all, this is a minecraft server mostly for younger audiences. Talking about politics always creates arguments wherever you are. I think some light discussion on politics is fine, but we don't need a separate chat for it. However, I do agree that it was an unfair move and it should've had some sort of a compromise.

The Discord server itself may be meant for younger audiences, sure, but the politics channel was used mostly by older, more mature members and there were only really 2 or 3 people who would cause trouble. If some form of guidelines are put in place, there really is no reason for it not be brought back.

Political discussions usually never end in happiness... It only creates anger and uneasy tensions. I understand politics are important but remember, it's a Minecraft server... It's not the right place for politics.

No one is forced into that channel or to even speak in it. It's a minecraft discord, you cant target a "young" audience when you have a large "teen" audience.

That's a very untrue opinion.<br>Politics isn't just a big bundle of bullshit that happens in life.<br>There are multiple happy things that come out. What you may ask?<br>Well lets bring up one of the latest ones, equality to gays. I'm not gay myself, but I'm sure as hell happy that the people in the politics world were able to bring more equality to everyone with more broad of an opinion.<br>Yes there is a lot of shitty things that happens about politics, but politics isn't just about Muslim classified terrorist attacks and U.S.A vs North Korea.<br>You just choose to look at it that way if that's all you see it as.<br><br>As for happiness to the Discord? Let me see, the Discord went from having a shit ton of talk to where only 1 channel reached 50+ messages in a span of 6 hours.<br>So it's done a lot more negative then it has done positive to the Discord.<br><br>Who would have been able to foresee that the most active and properly used channel getting deleted would bring back a lot of repercussion of hate???????????

I don't use Discord very often but I feel that the <b>politics channel is needed</b>.&nbsp;<br><br>People have the right to discus their opinions with others in a constructive manner. You might disagree with them, that's okay, but you can't outright ban free speech and their right to have their own say. &nbsp;Most of MCZone's/Avicus' faithful playerbase are now in their late teens/early twenties and some of us like to remain active with our old peers to discus our ideals with them. &nbsp;You shouldn't remove a politics channel just because some people dislike the discussions (of course, discussions may get slightly heated but that is the nature of certain topics). Make it a private or unlisted channel. Or better yet, if you dislike political chats LEAVE THE CHANNEL! No one is making you stay, no one is saying you can't leave; you have a choice.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><br>p.s. I'm allergic to dairy too.

I've always seen people discuss politics on Avicus&nbsp;and it hasn't bothered me or anyone in chat but the occasional&nbsp;annoyed mod. I dont see what removing the politics channel will do, people who wish to freely discuss matters of politics will surely just move to another channel?

When I meant "happy" I was saying that politics usually have debates and discussions, which is fine, but it doesn't usually lead to pleasant conversations especially if you view things differently. It may not seem like I understand the importance of politics, but I do. It's really important but my point is that you can take it elsewhere.. it does not need to be discussed on a minecraft server.

This is a move that has way more negatives than positives. Right now there is a question in the server leaders if the act was performed properly with little to no communication towards the community and seemingly making it without a correct judgment. So let's get into the main arguments why it should be removed by the seniors and moderators.<br><br>"There are topics that are borderline, not ok"<br>This happens when leaders do not know how to successfully address a situation and the guidelines for community members are supposed to follow is not drawn up well enough. The cause looks like number one because of situations not being rightfully handled in all channels. #politics does have a higher concentration&nbsp;of these issues and because of that, the ineffective&nbsp;way of dealing with these situations is shown more in this area, making it look like a harder place to moderate when in reality it just showcases the imperfections of the current way situations are dealt with on the server. I have suggested staff guidelines to be tightened up to help moderators and training to be upgraded, though I believe the sudo problem is what your concentration is going off to. It seems like a waste and pissing off a part of the community made it even more ineffective than it should of.<br><br>"We have a younger audience."<br>This is a false statement going with the fact that you put Minecraft's community instead of the sub-community this server with Stratus. Your game does not attract younger players to the server because of the gamemode's themselves. You have team based pvp&nbsp;that is too hard for a developing mind and too fast paste for older community members. My guess is that your medium age would be 14-16 years of age and it is older on Discord because younger people do not generally go towards the center of a community. &nbsp;<br><br>"We are a Minecraft server, not a politics server."<br>You are correct and wrong in this stance. Yes, you are a business that gains financially on an outport of Minecraft's multiplayer system. You are wrong because this isn't the right excuse to justify your decision. In the base line of things, Avicus is a service towards its&nbsp;customers. You give service from, the multiplayer part of Minecraft's pc client, a web forum, a teamspeak server, and a discord channel. &nbsp;You have to go service your customers through these 4 areas. Your community is different for each of the four but that is where you have to adjust. <br><br>The three main reasons I have covered have been used as excuses to try to convince themselves that hurting the discord community's trust is worth it. In reality, this move solves barely to no issues that are plaguing&nbsp;the Discord part of the server and hurts the trust towards the senior staff team and depending on the vote, could hurt the trust towards the moderator team. The negatives outway the positives and the progression of the server is still at a stand still.<br><br>My suggestions are putting an NSFW tag onto the channel to discourage younger kids from reading the channel and work on a stronger training and guidelines for staff members to use when addressing the problems. It will solve a lot more long term issues and will prject the server in moving you guys foward.<br><br>It's also midnight my grammar is shit I know

"Who really cares" Well just scroll up and you'll see how many people&nbsp;<i>really</i> care.<br><br>"bitching about a politics channel" We aren't bitching. We are trying to stop the Avicus Senior Staff from tyrannizing us and trying to take our right to discuss about news away.<br><br>There always are more important things, but that's a stupid attitude. Example: Why play Avicus? There is more important stuff! Why build maps for a Minecraft server? There is more important stuff! Why watch TV? There is more important stuff!
