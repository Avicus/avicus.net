<u><b></b></u><u></u>As you can see, the server isn't doing as great as it was in the past and the server is going downhill. If we are going to save the server before it completely dies off, we need to do something now before it is too late. Please comment what you want to see changed, improved on, and any new features on the server. What can the Staff do to improve? What do you want to be done on the Avicus' platforms? What features or minigames should be added? What perks would like to see added/changed? If you have any ideas you would like to share, feel free to share them, as you guys are the majority. Instead of you guys approaching us, I'm going to approach the community, I want to hear what you guys have to say. With any new ideas you guys have, I will go ahead and pass it to the higher staff myself. Thank you all for reading.<br><br><b><u>Progress so far:<br></u></b><a href="https://avicus.net/forums/discussions/ede91a946">https://avicus.net/forums/discussions/ede91a946</a><br><a href="https://avicus.net/forums/discussions/0c4ae7e36" title="Link: https://avicus.net/forums/discussions/0c4ae7e36">https://avicus.net/forums/discussions/0c4ae7e36</a>

Throwback was removed because we need more players. Apparently we lost players due to it. Readd Throwback asap to save at least some players, before they quit. Also, readd the Nebula Shop, Prestiges &amp; Credits System (merge them somehow together), CTH and of course many old maps. (We got rid off old maps since a few months now, people complaining about how they always play the same maps. If we readd the old maps, we'll have some times to add new maps &amp; players will actually have fun for 1-2 months with old maps) I'm sure at least SOME players will return if these things are coming back asap and also, the developers should work on important stuff, things that got removed for dumb reasons, before they add new features which players don't use/like.<br><br>I know keenan said "Prestiges are not coming back" and Map Devs were like "Throwback is GONE and won't come back" etc. but you guys really need to do compromosies. As you can see, we're dying now faster than we did before when we had all this stuff!<br><br>#PLSCHANGESOMETHING

First Id like to thank you, Junr, for making this. One of the biggest problems Avicus is facing is not enough community players taking initiative. We need Avicus staff to ask the players more what we want. The devs spent time making the new teamspeak feature which seems like a waste of time. Here is 1 idea I came up with...<br><br>Avicus staff does not have a direct communication with the community when it comes to coming up with new ideas. I think there should be a place on the forum where players can suggest new ideas. These ideas will be voted on every month and whichever one is voted most will be chosen for the next step. This next step will include the author of the idea and 2 chosen correspondents from the community discussing the idea further with Avicus staff (most likely sr mods and admins). This way the community will have a voice when it comes to new ideas and players will also be given an incentive to be able to see their ideas come to life.

Thing is, the main reasons why people wanted it removed was because there was no other server played, making maps repetitive, which made people leave as they got bored of no new content.<br><br>Another thing was that many of the maps were really stalemated maps, so along with repetitive maps, they would always go for a long time as they would end up being stalemated.<br><br>Adding back throwback would be a terrible idea, but add a few maps from throwback that aren't complete shit.<br>And Quintus was pretty shit guys, I won't lie.

I agree with this, but I think we need to bring some things back. Not everything the exact way it was before, because that would legitimately be moving backwards. But we lost a lot of players because of some things being removed. Prestiges and Credits could be combined to create something to work for while playing. As of right now, the only thing you can work for is Credits, which are completely pointless. It makes actually playing the game get boring very quickly. On any other big server there is a leveling system. They aren't complicated, it's just a level. But it gives something to work towards, set your own goals and achieve them. I'm working on an idea for a system with Credits and Prestiges and/or a leveling system.&nbsp;<br><br>Now on to maps. Throwback being removed was a good idea. Removing all the maps within Throwback was not. Most of the maps on Throwback were very good, and very fun to play. They just got repetitive after playing every map 5-10 times a day. There were some maps, that I agree should have been removed but many of them were not bad, and had to reason behind removing them other than that they were played too much.

No big company or business ever went far by staying in one place.&nbsp;<br><br>No no matter what choice is made, some players are going to leave.

And I get that you want it back. But if you want Avicus to grow as a server, Throwback has to stay gone. You can't grow a server playing the same old maps for years (same goes for game modes)

Yea my bad, I realized what it was (I think).<br><br>Regardless of how well the map might play in your eyes, you cannot attract new players by bringing nothing new to the table and playing the same few, olds maps over and over again.

True, which is why we need new maps for people to love. I've said this before for Walls maps, but it does apply to other gamemodes as well. MapDevs are extremely picky on maps. Sometimes maps just need to be tested and worked with and they would be really good maps. But just getting rid of old, good maps won't help. We can still keep the old maps and gain a player base, we just need new maps to go alone with the old ones.

Think about what I'm going to say and take a long hard look at the server and don't get pissed.<br><br>From what you guys, as Staff, can see, do you honestly think that Avicus has run it's course or do you see some kind of vision ahead? I personally can't see anything major ahead.&nbsp;<br><br>Let's face it. Minecraft is screwed (at least for the PvP aspect).<br><br>The community is fucked up.<br><br>This game get's boring.<br><br>I think Avicus should die with it's dignity. You know sometimes you get hooked to a show, and it's been running for a long time, maybe 11 seasons or a big number like that. The show was really good at the start but became bad as time went on. I'd rather that show end while it's still good and when the the writers think the spark is gone and move on, instead of clinging to a false hope that there is a future for this dumb show and continue making episodes that suck (I think this happened with Big Bang Theory even though I don't watch it much I stumble across an episode once in a while and can differentiate the old and new episodes very easily but anyways).

&nbsp;Well we did this with 3-4 major updates and in each case, Avicus lost hundres of players. Now after removing Throwback we're at 20-60 players. 2 years ago, it was something like 500-600. As an example: People get annoyed if they play so long to get prestige 10, and on the next day, they're removed.<br><br>Of course we have to move forward, but that does NOT mean that we HAVE to remove things. Seriously. I don't know for what reason Walls etc. have been removed. I know it might be hard as a dev to develope new plugins because older plugins are outdated and stuff, but how many times did we have this now? I remember the Omega update, Avicore and now Atlas. each time tons of people left (btw did I forget an update?)<br><br>This should tell you that feedback of the players who actually play the server at least <b>as important</b> as the opinions of three people. (Admins) What I want do actually say is that we should've listened more to the community. Way more. Now we regret this

The funny thing is that we had an anti-cheat 1-2 years ago. However, it caused such bad lag that the community begged it be removed. If we do add an anti-cheat, theres always the possibility of the same experience reoccurring, potentially causing more players to leave. Theres a sort of risk involved. Either play with hackers who are there for 5 minutes before they are gone again for another hour or so, or constant, unbearable block lag and stuff but no hackers. I'll let you decide.

What I'm trying to say, and I honestly doubt you're even getting it, but there comes to a point in time, especially after a server looses basically all of it's player count, where you got to decide on whether or not to continue to let it burn to ground, or try and get new players.<br><br><b>New</b> players.

Let's be real. Removing Throwback didn't get rid of people. The decisions after that, and what they did with the Throwback maps is what made people leave. Readding Throwback won't do anything. The MapDevs just came out with an update that involves a lot of changes in Rotations, and as they stated in the update thread, there will be updates to rotations more often. They are moving in the right direction with maps. They are adding back the&nbsp;<b>good</b> Throwback maps, along with the maps that were sitting in other rotations that were never played.&nbsp;<br><br>The community needs to be open to new maps as well. I feel like everyone is complaining that the rotations are stale and boring but the moment anything new comes along they don't give it a chance and hate it. Give some things a chance, honestly, sometimes things are very good, you just need to get used to it. Atlas was hated when it first came out. Now, asking anyone, Atlas was a good choice, a bit rushed, but it was a good choice. (A lot of people will tell you that Atlas was terrible because they removed Throwback. Refer above, please...)

Ima say that we need the old maps back. All of the rest of stuff like credits, I'm not to fussed about. But some of those maps would need changes.

Let's be real. Removing Throwback didn't get rid of people. The decisions after that, and what they did with the Throwback maps is what made people leave. Readding Throwback won't do anything. The MapDevs just came out with an update that involves a lot of changes in Rotations, and as they stated in the update thread, there will be updates to rotations more often. They are moving in the right direction with maps. They are adding back the&nbsp;<b>good</b> Throwback maps, along with the maps that were sitting in other rotations that were never played.&nbsp;<br><br>The community needs to be open to new maps as well. I feel like everyone is complaining that the rotations are stale and boring but the moment anything new comes along they don't give it a chance and hate it. Give some things a chance, honestly, sometimes things are very good, you just need to get used to it. Atlas was hated when it first came out. Now, asking anyone, Atlas was a good choice, a bit rushed, but it was a good choice. (A lot of people will tell you that Atlas was terrible because they removed Throwback. Refer above, please...)

Prestiges and XP the prestige shape would have to change or the 10k badge would but I think something could be thougt up for both being used like getting both XP and Creds per kills etc and XP goes by game mode credits go by whole server , Old Cth (where you got power ups for kill streaks an shit and the kits were actually good and old maps), Nexus(and some old maps), Walls, zalidor and venomous (sry is hard to read am on fone)

<b></b>The other day, I was talking to a regular and I asked them what would they like to see and they responded that they would like to see the ingame shop less biased to players, so I made a suggestion about it and would like to see what you guys think about it:<br>Suggestion: Can items in the ingame shop be available for <b>EVERYONE&nbsp;</b>no matter what rank you are. I understand that keenan wants to make money where players have to buy a rank to get a certain item, but that's not going to work. If players have something to work for, like how re-adding prestiges etc, players will actually stay to achieve what they are getting. Just think about it, people will buy a rank to get credits faster to get things faster, but since things are limited, no one is going to work for something, because what's the point of it?

Actually, making exclusive items for donors will work. You know how I know? Avi us up se to have avengers grenades as a donor item and A LOT of people donated to get them. I understand we can't do this anymore because of the stupid EULA., but I think Wendys should make it so donors have a discount for the items so people actually feel like donating. Let's be honest, the current rank she are horrible.
