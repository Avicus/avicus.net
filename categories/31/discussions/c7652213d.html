Prstiges have been replaced with Badges.<br>XP has been replaced with Credits and it's all been reset.<br><br>Basically every kill and objective you get earns you credits. Since you have the Gold rank you get a 1.5 times multiplyer too (WooHoo!)<br><br>You can buy items (like badges) in the lobby.<br><br>The lobby's been redone too.<br>Hoped that helped a bit.

LIke snow said but in more detail:<br><br>Prestige is replaced with badges. Like when you prestige you get a badge, except here you purchase badges w/ credits.<br>XP is now Credits (Like OCN and their raindrops)<br><br>Lobby has been changed and there is a chatbot. So I like that. :)<br>Now you can use credits to get lobby items!1!1! No more donor rank or online purchase needed xd<br><br>But welcome back xddd
