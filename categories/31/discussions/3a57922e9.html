Hey! So I am considering upgrading to Emerald, but it says the cost will be $50. I think it's supposed to be $25 since I'm Gold already, but it doesn't say anything about that. Thank you!

I think there is a way to get an upgrade somehow... but I don't remember.

Correct me if I'm am wrong, but I believe all you have to do is buy Gold again, and tell a Sr Staff member to upgrade you.

Yup, what Tarh said. If you purchase another Gold rank, just ask for a Sr Staff member to combine them into an Emerald.

Even though it says its $50 it really isn't. However you decide to pay it will come up with a message that says that you won't have to pay full price. I'd you have any questions you can always contact a staff member and we would be willing to guide you through the process. This would be a good way to use the TS support rooms. :]
