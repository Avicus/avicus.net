<b>For the uninformed, mojang have recently said that their eula has always forbid the sale of ingame items, which could seriously affect avicus and many other servers. However there is still uncertainty over the extent of this ruling - while selling 'a diamond block' is obviously against this, are ranks also banned now? What about things like particle trails, or special perks such as team choosing in minigames. These aren't specifically minecraft items but are still part of the game... sort of. Another interesting concept is whether or not the sale of bukkit plugins, which are of course the code of a developer and not mojang, is allowed by this.<br><br>Whatever the final details are, it will have a big impact on avicus. What do you think of this decision and do you feel it will damage the server?<br><br><br><br>A tweet by notch:&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/notch/status/474869769301409792">https://twitter.com/notch/status/474869769301409792</a></b>

It's not a new EULA. He's just clarifying what was already there.

Are they pissed off that people are making mc better than what they are doing? &nbsp;It takes them forever to make updates and what do they add, fireworks o_O? They do not add shaders, or anything to make it more appealing looking or more fun with more mobs to kill or anything. &nbsp;To even say it takes them a long time to code, they have a full team whose sole job <i>is</i> coding for mc, so they don't have an excuse to not make mc more fun. &nbsp;And then they hyped up the 'realms' only to find out, that you have to freaking pay in order to play that o_o! &nbsp;They are becoming too greedy and pissed off that people are making servers that makes mc more interesting than what they could. &nbsp;And why would he even make a comment like that, he stepped down from his role in mc anyway to work on his other 'gaming' adventures that are completely not mc related o_O?

Yaazey exatcly. I was shocked when i saw the price for mc realms and i'm comparing this to club penguin's membership which is sorta bullshit. It's like everything's already needs to be paid and i'm also wondering why did notch tweeted about banning for paying our ranks. It will be totally useless plus only the owner will pay every month or every few months? That will be more expensive for him/her unless that person must be very rich or getting whatever he/she wants from his/her parents. Everything is getting fishy now when i saw notch said that. I hope they wont ban the buying of ranks and perks.

I don't think they're evil. It's their right to enforce their EULA which has been around for years.

I doubt notch would actually do that, since ALOT of people would riot and Minecraft would slowly start to die. People would probably even knock at his window at night when he is sleeping and i think that it's&nbsp;very possible since this happened to quite a&nbsp;famous youtuber after he quit. And also if i got this right every people who have paid for a VIP would lose it too, right?<br><br>

@obsidian dude... you knew I was joking with 'evil,' right?<br>&nbsp;:P Even if it's legally right for them to enforce their EULA, it isn't morally correct. By doing so, they will ruin the game experiences of millions of people. Minecraft is a SANDBOX game, the essence of minecraft is with the community, without profit, the community won't be able to develop all the awesome servers/mods/resource packs etc.<br>@fazer more like die super fast :( :,( <br>

riot? I hardly doubt there will be street protests about a technicality in the eula of a video game.

Well, let's say if some VERY famous video game would take away memberships and lose all of their "unique" membership items i would say probably most likely yes, riots :P
Or mebe not and i'm just retard00d, but it remains to be seen.
