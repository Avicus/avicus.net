Question to mods - I'm confused

</h1>
So I recently got banned on Avicus for hacks. When I appealed they removed my infraction was remove because they have no evidence. So why was I banned in the first place?!! I'm confused, are mods even allowed to ban me if they have no evidence to suggest that I am hacking?<br><br>P.s I'm not angry with the mod who banned me but I want to know why

I believe that the person that recorded you was unsure about their decision and they just asked someone else to ban you. The person that banned you [iron] was not the person that recorded you I believe, However I can look more into the situation if you would like.<br><br>Thanks,<br>GuyNamedRiley || Avicus Moderator

You're supposed to have your infraction completely removed. You should also appeal your "Trolling" infraction.

I have spoken to Iron in-game. He is trying to ignore me but he says Sessp recorded me but decided not to upload. He also says that I was hacking in the recording. I would appreciate that thanks :)

If the infraction doesn't have any evidence, it can easily appealed/removed. Unless, another staff has evidence, there are no arguments against it.

Yes, mods can ban without evidence, however they are strongly encouraged not to. Some players who only come on to hack, won't bother with appealing therefore it's worthwhile banning them even without evidence.

yea that helps answer the question, what i dont understand is why Iron banned me given that he had no evidence and it was not the kind of hack that you refer to. for example if i was flying, i would not appeal because you cant argue your way out of it, however the hack that i am accused of is one that can look legit. (and not to mention i play on the server way too much), he could have easily predicted that i was going to appeal.

Either it proves I'm hacking or not...<br>and if it doesn't, don't ban me. Simple as that, am I right?

Whether there was evidence or not, mods have nothing against you personally I can assure you. I was in fact there when you were banned and there was evidence, however I'm not sure what happened to it. It may have been false, it may not have but you are unbanned so I shouldn't worry too much.

If you don't mind, I would like to put this topic to rest. In its current state there is Evidence. However, said evidence is sitting on someones computer because said moderator refuses to upload it. Hence leading to your appeal due to "Lack of evidence." As I stated in game, I don't see why you are continuing this and trying to pin all of your problems on myself. If you truly wish to end this conversation, stop feeding people with responses that are not true/accurate.<br><br>If you desire further attention please contact me or a senior moderator on skype.

Depends. If it's false, then yes, but if we're appealing it because we're ready to have you back, it remains just appealed.

In my opinion its like court, everyone is innocent until proven guilty. &nbsp;If you have trouble getting your evidence then don't ban him until you actually have it. &nbsp;Saying a mod can ban without evidence but is encouraged not to is like saying the mod is always right...
