So I was looking at a post by Sethskye about Nebula challenges. This something that I think would be great fun so I am going to make a list of challenges that go from easy to hard. I thought going down this list might make nebula more fun. Credit to Sethskye for my idea.<br><br>1. Get one kill.<br><br>2. Get 5 kills in one match.<br><br>3. Get 5 kills in one life.<br><br>4. Get 10 kills in one life<br><br>&nbsp;5. Build a two storeyed house just outside of spawn with a sign saying "Hey there" at the door. Must be at least 10 x 10 blocks.<br><br>6. Place 25 signs with step by step directions to get to the other team's spawn.<br><br>7. Pretend to be a store clerk selling iron at from a chest with your own hut for 5 minutes.<br><br>8. Get a monument.<br><br>9. Get 20 kills in one life.<br><br>10. Build a protection building around a monument.<br><br>11. Build a skybridge to the enemy spawn/base.<br><br>12. On your monument, defend and &nbsp;kill five people who were at the monument.<br><br>13. Rank to level 10<br><br>14. Get 2 monuments in one match.<br><br>15. Hold shift the whole way to the other team's spawn, straight through the middle of the map.<br><br>16. Get first kill on a game with 20 or more people.<br><br>17. Get and arrow kill from 30 blocks away.<br><br>18. Build a tunnel underground to the enemy base.<br><br>19. Get to level 20<br><br>20. Build an underground (Or below spawn-level) tunnel to monument and break monument.<br><br>21. Kill an iron player while you are not wearing armour (And not with a bow, not from hitting them off the world).<br><br>22. Kill a player with a bow shot from 60 blocks away.<br><br>23. Go to the enemy's iron supply, and make yourself iron armour.<br><br>24. Go to the enemy's iron supply, and make yourself iron armour, except this time, kill five people at their base.<br><br>25. Get all the monuments in the match.<br><br>26. Rank to level 30<br><br>27. Kill 30 people in one life<br><br>28. Only die once the whole match.<br><br>29. Don't die any times the whole match.<br><br>30. Kill 10 people with a bow in one life.<br><br>31. Build a skybase to the enemy monument and boat/minecart drop down onto the monument and break it.<br><br>32. Kill someone with your fist.<br><br>33. Break a monument with your fist. (Idea from sfkwww)<br><br>34. Rank to level 40<br><br>35. Incase an AFK defender in wood at the enemy monument, then break the monument.<br><br>I'm not finished with the list, and I should get up to 60-70 challenges when I am done, but give me feedback on what you think so far.
