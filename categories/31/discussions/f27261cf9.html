On behalf of ViceWatercolour, I am going to say that he wishes to return to his Administrator position after his recent demotion from the rank. This is a decision that I will involve the whole community on, as its a rather important decision, and I believe its more than fair for the community to have a say in this.

He did good as an admin and did many great things and had nice plans, too. But too be honest, as stated above, he apparently doesn't want anything to do with the seniors and even ended up retiring his senior rank. He can accomplish plenty of his plans without being an admin, although I'd like to see him maybe become a senior.

He did do a great deal to help the server, but he abused his permissions severely and proved he wasn't capable to be the leader of the staff team. He can come back as a Senior and still help the server out, continuing what he was doing as an admin, but he needs someone to monitor him since he has not proven worthy of Administrator yet.

Ok let's be honest here I'll step up and be the admin.&nbsp;<br><br><br><br><br>No but on a serious note like a lot of people have starred above, he didn't want to be associated with the staff team and he somehow abused his powers which I don't know how but apparently he did. But again, he was very helpful and he did do quite a bit (it seems) for the server. So if you can make sure he won't abuse his powers or retire completely if he gets demoted, I think he should. come back.<br><br><br><br><br>But I could still take his position. ARIGENN INTERVIEW ME

I think he should return as admin. He obviously retired because he got demotion. In my opinion Vice is creative and thinks like no one els, which can both be good or bad. But he did a great job as admin and actually made things happen. Get him back.

With policies and the like, there's only so much you can think ahead. Policies help outline things for simpler cases, but there's so much that can happen you surely should not live or die by those pre-written standards, it'd be a dumb decision for any server or company or whatever.&nbsp;<br>I think in that regard, with somebody who seems to contribute a large amount to the server, it's not worth getting particularly worked up over those. We want simply what's best for the server.<br>And if he has problems with the senior team, and they are considering bringing him back in and he is willing, then does it not seem that they have decided to work on those problems? Because it does to me.&nbsp;<br><br>At least this is what I get out of this. I haven't been here awfully long and I haven't seen a lot of what happened previously, but a lot of people seem to agree with what Vice has said after his demotion and from that I'd think it would do&nbsp;well to have him working with the&nbsp;staff team again.

I have no problem with him returning - but honestly, we could return him as a Trial-Admin, or a Temporary-Mod, or a Temporary-Sr Mod. Overall it'd make sure he doesn't still have those commands. Personally I trust him 100%, but this would compensate for those players who are wary of him misusing his commands. He could not have access to them at the start, so that we would all have time to adjust before fully integrating him back to Administrator.&nbsp;<br><br>Basically, it's a yes from me.

Good Admin<br><br>But he retired from SrMod. If you think about it, retiring and requesting a promotion straight to Admin is a quicker process than having to go from Sr back to Admin. If he does get promoted go to a rank lower than Sr.<br><br>Also Para abused perms so going straight back to a rank with lots of perms isnt a good idea imo

1. This new policy we are meant to be working so hard to enforce doesnt allow him to come back for a while.<br>2.
