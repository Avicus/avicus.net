Anyone think that DTC, will be not bad in this server. I play a lot of DTC, and for me this gamemode is the best. <br>What do you think?

Actual DTC is kind of possible in yamls, you can make bigger monuments (bigger than 1 block), but Avicus won't get the gamemode at all. It's OCN and if avicus gets this gamemode a majority of players would say avicus is copying OCN.

No.<br>We already have a bunch of people complaining that Avicus is an OCN ripoff just because of DTM as a major reason and a few other minor reasons. Adding DTC will put more gasoline in the fire and get more ranting.<br>If we do get it (almost 0% chance that we do tho) we might as well close Avicus or call it OCN 2.0 or merge it with OCN... which is a big nono

And what if the said that this is a copy of OCN, it´s a gamemode, and all servers can have the gamemodes which thay want. Imagine that we create a gamemode which is called destroy the enemy base, OCN and all servers can copy that gamemode. I don´t see any problem of putting DTC.

not even close...&nbsp;<br><br>@OP:&nbsp;DTC is a good gamemode, but imo, not for Avicus. Most of the players on the server don't know how to use TNT or would grief with it. No offence ofc, but if the average player will grief/misuse TNT, there's no point in putting in a gamemode that is 100% reliant on skill with TNT.

It's true though. You did "copy" their gamemodes.<br>However no one frankly cares about copying anymore. CTW are on several servers, Survival games, skyblock, spleef, (i could go on forever) none of those are "original" anymore. Just embrace the fact that Avicus "copied" OCN and there's nothing wrong with taking an existing gamemode and implementing it. OCN doesn't care frankly wether Avicus would implement a gamemode originally from their server anymore.

People on OCN didn't magically have a fairy overnight and transplant knowledge of cannoning to all the players when it was first introduced. Greifing was a MASSIVE issue on OCN (and it still is but better), but as regulars shared it on the forums and the word spread cannoning became an actual thing on primed. Then the players who were unfamiliar with TNT would start using it, and there you go.&nbsp;<br>It IS a pain to moderate, but as long as adequate staff are there to enforce the rules i think Avicus could pull it off. There are also be anti-TG plugins that could be installed.

Yes, It's been out for some time which I said, but if it's been out long and people from there would come on Avicus and troll us and rant about it on their forums. If a recent "copy" happened then I'm sure something worse than a little trolling &amp; ranting on their forums will happen.
