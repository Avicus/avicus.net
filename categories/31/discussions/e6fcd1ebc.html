Hello everybody I am sad to say that my build team and build server will now no longer exist. The main reason was that I didn't want to manage the build team anymore as it just wasn't working out. Anyway my server is going down now and it will be turned into a proper prison server. I have always loved prison and had 2 previous failed atempts at making one big so I decided to go all out in a new map and everything. My server is now whitelisted so you cannot access it until the prison is finished. I will give you the download of your maps but only if you request for it in game or on this thread of which you have 2 weeks to do so until they will all be deleted. I really enjoyed having the build server up and I had some real great moments on there. I thank you all for your co-operation and have a nice day!<br><br>Subzero

You can contact them via skype, almost every buildteam has a skype chat with all members, so post it there. And if someone has not skype, they already read the post, they just didn't made a reply.

The server used to have people not just from the build team on it. I am alerting everyone in the easiest way possible :D

Locking this since it really serves no purpose and if your server has closed, they can assume it had resigned already.
