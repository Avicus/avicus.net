Hi.<br><br>I just wanted to take some time to make a post involving past events, present events, and what will happen to Avicus in the future. Keep in mind that this post is just composed of trends I have noticed and these are just my opinions. Please do not start any flame wars here. Thank you.<br><br><b>Recap:<br></b><br>I&nbsp;think a few of you may remember when we started that "push" on one of the voting websites. There wasn't any obvious impact however, a few days after people started to vote, Avicus surpassed 200 players on at one time. I believe this is the most Avicus has had for months. Unfortunately, that was a 1 day thing and now we are back to the average of 150 at the peak point. Basically, what I'm trying to say is that if people are encouraged enough to vote, Avicus will slowly regain some players. An incentive such as credits will definitely improve the server's ranking and player base. Special thanks to every one who had voted then. I'm pretty sure that most of us (including myself) has lost the incentive by now and that's fine.&nbsp;<br><br>Map Development I'd say is doing very well. With the newfound use of Trello, map submissions and map statuses have been more organized then ever before. In addition, the Contest Committee has found a few new members. Hopefully some more cool ideas will be discussed. Even if you aren't in the committee, don't be afraid to voice your suggestions! I think that the maps on Avicus are what keeps some people here. The original gameplay of the classics and the jaw-dropping views of castles are simply stunning. 1 suggestion I have is to sort the DTM rotations, (excluding Mix) by player limit. If you play a Senex 1 match right after a Clay Wars match, you'll end up with about 30 spectators. Just something to keep in mind. I might suggest a custom rotation later on.<br><br>Avicus is becoming more competitive! Although sometimes you may not think it is, especially when people cover the monument, more people know what they are doing! Defenses are becoming stronger and people are grasping a better knowledge of defending and attacking. Every Clay Wars match I see always gathers 50+ players with tons of people on defense. Even if the people defending are not "professionals" or what not, pretty much everybody knows to dig to bedrock. Teams better be searching for some new recruits!<br><br>The community is getting closer! Back then when you hop on the forums, you always see the same names. I'm glad to say that I see names I don't recognize on the forums. After the message about applying for staff was introduced in-game, I know for a fact that a few people saw that message and got the incentive to join the forums. More messages like these will attract an even bigger audience. On another note, I see some more staff communicating with the community which is a good thing. All the complaints we had before are slowly starting to decrease. When people cannot give as many complaints, you know that something is being done right!&nbsp;<br><br>The RedRover/Mega/Pickup Scrimmages have been a blast! To twist things up, teams have been mixing their players to create new teams. You get a good experience by working with other players.<br><br>The Avicus Social Media is active! Not sure if any of you have noticed, but I took a look at the Facebook page and it's buzzling with activity now. Many recent events and posts have been made there.<br>Facebook Page:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/AvicusNetwork">https://www.facebook.com/AvicusNetwork</a><br><br><b>Future:&nbsp;</b><br><br>Avicus has been through many tough times. I sense that Avicus will slowly rise back up and I predict that you will not see less than 100 players on Avicus at anytime by Christmas Season. Hopefully this goal can be reached!<br><br>Thank you for reading. Comment below anything you want to say.

More Advertisement is something Avicus needs.<br><br><br>More Advertisement for players to log onto the forums.<br><br>More community discussions on defensive tactics and other tactics for new players to see.

Lets be honest Avicus will only attract more players if competitive scene kicks off.

One of the main reasons why Avicus lost so many players (not talking about mczone) is still block lag. Block lag. Block lag and block lag. Seriously, why does it take so long to remove this bug...

I think even if you use the 1.8 only server, there is still quite a bit of block lag.

There's also block delay where the placement of the blocks you build when bridging is delayed by half a second and upwards :/

Actually I was Incorrect. The 1.7/1.8 combo creates the "biased Knockback" that some players have. &nbsp;rip<br><br><br>So I don't really know what causes this block lag<br><br><br>My fault.

I did notice that the people on avicus are getting quite a bit better at the game in general before I left, so hopefully that trend continues.

^^ I believe what Smit has said, cause everytime i see a match of senex going on, People are actually NOT blocking the monuments. Its good to see that players are actually under standing what is going on.

One major issue is definitely the fact we have too much John Cena. We need to get a bit RKOs with Randy Orton if we dare want to progress anywhere.

What we need is a sizeable youtuber to showcase and play on our server, relating to a post someone did a little while ago (cant remember who.)<br><br>Or, we just stay happy as we are, because I think the community is good atm?<br><br>We dont peak over 125 players much now, but imo its fine.
