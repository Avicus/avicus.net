So today Badlion had another Judgement day, pretty much where they go out and ban a ton of players at once for cheating. I think most of you know that they have a very good anticheat. If it was buggy, Badlion wouldn't go out and ban tons of players like this. I just thought some of you might find this interesting. There's quite a view players I know personally on that list smh<br><br>Link to badlion thread:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.badlion.net/forum/thread/76254" title="Link: http://www.badlion.net/forum/thread/76254">http://www.badlion.net/forum/thread/76254</a><br>Link to full list of players that were banned:&nbsp;<a href="https://gist.github.com/mastergberry/6a802fa0e9a4b770a29b" title="Link: https://gist.github.com/mastergberry/6a802fa0e9a4b770a29b">https://gist.github.com/mastergberry/6a802fa0e9a4b770a29b</a>&nbsp;(use Ctrl + f to search)<br>Link to twitch stream where it happened live:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.twitch.tv/ArchyBot" style="color: rgb(0, 85, 128);  font-family: Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; " title="Link: http://www.twitch.tv/ArchyBot">http://www.twitch.tv/ArchyBot</a>
