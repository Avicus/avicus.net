Okay so today i thought i'd play a little bit of nebula so i go on and play about 10 maps with no problems at all, then i was lucky enough on the 11th map to get some diamond armor and a diamond sword. Anyway so i go out and kill someone and find he had around 30 golden apples on him so i keep them and stay in the middle of the map with a few others on my team. About 5 of the opposite team came and tried to attack us, so we killed them, they came back, since we had gapples we had full hearts, so we killed them again. Shortly after the game had finished a player goes "EVERYONE DO /REPORT TOMID6745 HACKS" Looking at the screen shot below that's a false accusation. So my question is, are people allowed to do that?<br><br><br>Image: Removed due to question answered.<br><br><br>

yes, they are(if they really THINK you hack), but if you really didn't hack, the mods will just ignore the report, after they check if you are hacking or not.<br>Otherwise, if they are just raging, no.<br>

Tell them /report is there for a reason. If they continue post a report online since it is I believe considered spam.

Bro, you're fine. Just like what Trident said, the moderators will&nbsp;just ignore the reports if you don't hack. And I'm sure you don't. Don't worry. ;)

&nbsp;It's still not allowed even if you're sure that someone is hacking. <br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Saying to people who to report is not allowed. + It's kinda spam and you are accusing someone for hacking. You can just report them. <br><br>Correct me if I'm wrong. :)<br><br><br>

To answer this question in full response, it isn't allowed. It isn't allowed because what he did was basically scamming, he said something that may or may not be true without showing any proof. You can report someone, but that doesn't mean you have to tell other people to do the same. In other words, announcing something that may or may not be true to everyone is againt the rules, but it isn't against the rules to think that you hack. I&nbsp;think this is a well answer for you question :)<br><br>Note: Spamming isn't allowed either.

Telling people who to report is not permitted. Neither is spamming. If it continued beyond that, it could also be considered a form of harassment. What he did was infraction-worthy. If I were you, I'd file a report in the Player Reports section. The player in question would probably receive a warn.<br>By the way, now that your question has been answered, you should remove the link to the screenshot out of courtesy to the player.&nbsp;
