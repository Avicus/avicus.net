Hey all, recently Kylo and his team had released&nbsp;<b>" The Omega Update "&nbsp;</b>, which included a bunch of new updates, new things added to the game, website and more! I would say it's great, but I have a question in mind.&nbsp;<u><br></u><br><u><i><b></b></i></u><i><b>What happened to Destroy the Monument?&nbsp;<br></b></i><br>If Kylo did remove DTM, part of my heart is basically gone :P<br>DTM is the gamemode that I spent most of my time playing, and I can't resist to see it go.&nbsp;<br><br>So yeah.. I hope DTM isn't removed, and if anyone has any idea about this, please do let me know :P<br><br><b>Thanks!</b>

Destroy the Monument is still here. In Nebula, there are 3 different game types. Team Death Match (TDM), Capture the Wool (CTW), and of course, Destroy the Monument (DTM).

Yes DTM is still hear don't worry :D so as Pete (MajestysDream)&nbsp;said there is DTM, CTW, and TDM. There is also Mix server where there is all three of these gamemodes together. So make sure you look around and check out some of the new gamemodes. :D
