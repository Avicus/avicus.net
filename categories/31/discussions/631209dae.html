Well basically everyone keeps saying in the forums saying we need more developers, but what is a developer exactly? If you reply, can you please tell me: The skills you need and what responsibilities you would have.<br>I am thinking of learning over time to try and gain some skills for developing but giving me some information on this post would help loads, Thanks :D

It is mainly (from what I understand) being able to create the plugins that run the server. At the moment we only have one developer and that is IvyCode.

Okay thanks :D But what are the plugins that will be required to run the server? (Might be a question only staff can answer)

Avicus uses its own plugins for pretty much everything except for AntiCheat.<br><br>Being a Dev requires you to be fluent in Java, Ruby on Rails, and HTML.<br><br>If you believe you qualify, e-mail Ivy: info@avicus.net

A developer can write the codes for applications, plugins and modifications for an&nbsp;application (ex. plugin 'Nebula', 'Nexus' for the&nbsp;application Minecraft) and much more.<br>There are languages like C++, Java, Javascript, HTML etc. which can be used to <b>write programms or scripts.</b><br>Minecraft is using the Java-Engine (Java is needed, to start Minecraft), you need to learn Java if you want to write your own codes for a plugin.<br>IvyCode is the only developer who wrote all plugins for Avicus. (That's why it is so laggy ;) jk jk

Avicus HTML is just basic bootstrap, which is really easy to learn.<br><br>There are lots of Ruby on Rails guides online.<br><br>If you want to get into Bukkit programming, there are lots of guides on YouTube for that as well.
