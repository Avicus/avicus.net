Sr Mod's+ check the appeals. A lot of appeals come in and it doesn't take ten seconds to answer each one, which is why you get a long wait time. But anytime upto a week should be your wait time. Bottom line, be patient.

No, they should always respond, even if it's denied. If no reply comes in after one week, resend it.

Why can't Moderators deal with appeals?<br>Why can only Sr. Staff deal with it?

Maybe because they are not considered responsible enough.<br>Though if they can ban they should also be able to unban, in my opinion.

I can understand why Jr.Mods not being able to but Moderators have already earnt that trust and full acceptance into the staff team. <br>With a little training, you can get the Mods to help out. This would take a load off the Sr. Staff team.

No, if they're retarded enough to ban you falsely, they will not be able to unban you correctly.
