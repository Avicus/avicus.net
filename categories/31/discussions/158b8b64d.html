Hey so basically I didn't plan on making a retiring post and was just going to tell people the reasoning behind it if they asked. Then I got messages from like 5 different people within 10 minutes of the announcement so I figured I'd make this (yes ik I'm 2 populAR).&nbsp;<br><br>To be completely honest, I underestimated the work ethic that goes into being a senior, whether a senior mod or an admin. This was my first mistake. As a mod, I wasn't very active in general besides in-game. To be frank, I was quite surprised that I was even considered to take up the position as senior mod. The behind-the-scenes work that goes into keeping the server in an reasonable state is a lot more work than I had ever expected. The dedication and work ethic of everyone on the senior staff team is genuinely admirable and incredible. Though at times it may seem like there isn't much being done to improve the server and its state, I can assure you that there is a lot more than meets the eye with regards to that. I have so much respect for those putting the utmost effort into making this community an enjoyable place and believe they deserve a lot more praise than they are given (don't be rude to them guys, they're trying).&nbsp;<br><br>Less than a week after being promoted to senior, I found myself a job for the summer (as a financial assistant for those of you wondering). This made being active much more difficult. It's not really an excuse though as I was never too active on most platforms besides the server and teamspeak. Nevertheless I saw myself becoming more and more inactive in-game and on other platforms that I was already inactive on. It had come to the point where the only reason I'd log on was to scrim with my team. This may not seem too drastic but my logic behind taking the senior mod position was that I'd do my moderator tasks (being active in-game and making sure things are all good for example) as well as the senior mod tasks. For some that may seem do-able, possibly easy for others but for me the workload was too much for me to handle. This resulted in me neglecting nearly almost all the tasks involved in all my staff positions.<br><br>I was not willing to give up the time I spend socialising IRL (ik crazE) nor was I willing to sacrifice the time I spend actually playing the game to deal with the behind-the-scenes work of being on the senior staff team. I knew if I did that I would lose all motivation to do anything. I saw no other option but to retire. I genuinely feel that it will allow me to enjoy my time playing the game again. I'll feel no restrictions. In the past month of being a senior mod I'd spend my time in-game worrying about what was on discord and spend my time on discord becoming frustrated at certain decisions made by certain people or the amount of messages I'd have to scroll through. It was dumb that I was letting that stuff frustrate me but it did. I know for a fact that there are many more current moderators that could take the task of senior mod and be a million times better with it than I ever could. I was a wasted place on the senior staff team so I decided to make room for someone more capable and fitting for the position.&nbsp;<br><br>I rated IRL stuff over Avicus and I'm not going to lie, I don't regret it. I will be active in-game but as a player - not a staff member. Maybe one day I'll return to the staff team if they'll have me but until then I'd like to thank everyone on the staff team and the community in general for giving me the opportunity (not gonna give specific shoutouts because let's be real this is already enough cringe). If anyone has an questions about anything ask away because let's be honest I probably did the worst job ever at wording this xd. Also if you read this whole thing fair play, because I most likely wouldn't have.&nbsp;<br><br>Hope I made some sort of a difference during my time on the staff team. PEACE OUT MY DUDES !!

You will be missed dearly.&nbsp; You were respected and liked.&nbsp; I understand that other things must take priority though.&nbsp; That job as a financial assistant will hopefully be fun and fulfilling to you.&nbsp; I have no doubts that in the future if you wanted to come back that you would be considered.&nbsp; The wording is very fine, very sophisticated.&nbsp; Very much fair play.&nbsp; You will be missed as a Senior Mod but we will be glad to still see you as a fellow player.
