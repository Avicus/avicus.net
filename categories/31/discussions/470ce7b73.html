Private Chats on Teamspeak!

Recently we had a bit of a debate about whether we would implement private chats, so I decided to ask you guys whether you would like them! *Note* If we do have private chats would you rather have chats that can be made by anyone, but disappear when you leave, or we could have X amount of private chats, but too get in you have too ask a mod for the password.<br><br>Anyways, Discuss!

Really? How does one speak with pokes? Well, we would like too get more people on Teamspeak... Also what if you want too talk with more than just your friends? You cannot make friends on Skype, with Teamspeak you can actually meet people.

There aren't enough people on Teamspeak too make this a problem, one person can only make one channel.

I think it would be something good to implement when we get a larger player amount on ts. If it was implemented now, it would in fact split the community like kcraft said. &nbsp;But whenever we get a lot of people on ts, it would be really nice to be able to make private channels.

This will ruin TS by separating us, everyone would make private chats and we wouldn't talk again with some people. Also, we'll have to get more people on TS to implement this cause we're not that many people to make this an issue already.<br>Huge -1.

I don't think we should do this. It will result in elitism, there anren't a lot of people in the teamspeak and if they are all in private rooms ther is going to be a bery tense atmosphere in the teamspeak

My concern would be that users would go, make a channel and just hide in there. It already happens with donors going to premium suites, and staff going to their channels.<br><br>I disagree with this.

This is a cool idea, but like some people said, others may just create a channel and not use the ones we already have.&nbsp;<i></i>It's nice to talk to people in Teamspeak, and with Zed's point of just going on Skype. I would say that certain people prefer Teamspeak due to the extra features such as push to talk. But this was a nice idea ^-^ However, I disagree.

I honestly think this is a bad idea. People like privacy, and I understand this, but I really like being able to go on Teamspeak and meet new people. This is just a personal preference, but it doesnt really effect me that much considering I find private chats unnecessary anyways.Whether this does get implemented or not, I just hope that group activity on teamspeak doesn't change.

Yes!Yes! Very much Yes! They are so useful, if you want to just hang out with friends without randies butting in, or for tournaments. Private rooms for tourney teams might be the only reasonable way for team members to communicate during tournament matches privately.
