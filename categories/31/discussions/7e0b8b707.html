Training doesn't really help. You need to start developing your own gamestyle. Only you can master your own tactics...

You have to learn what's the best way for you to kill a player in a 1v1 combat, practice is the only way to get better. You can develop a better experience, and you can try different techniques to what is suitable for you. Practice different styles!

If you're trained by someone, it leads you to become a lot better. You learn how to make <b>viable</b> tactics from then on. I trained Stan for a bit in about 1.4, and he's OP now with a tactic that I never told him about.

Which faze? :d<br>On topic: You can use others as a building block to get up; but you usually get used to some sort of playstyle and you mold it to your use. That's what happened to me anyways.<br>Watch some YT'ers, watch how they play and mold it into your playstyle.

I'd teach you if you wanted. But I'm ez :p. The best way to learn is to watch videos by good pvpers and try and incorporate their tactics into your pvp. The best way to do this is practice. Watch people like Cayden, pmpheys, 0scavenge0, Stimpay, UnPhair and ApacheBlitz

Watch videos and practice. I managed to get myself from a 0.8 KD at the beginning of Avicus to a 4.99 KD right now.<br><br>Also depends on what you want to get good at. I'm best at bow because I've been playing Nebula and TF2 (in Minecraft) for so long, so I'm "training" to be better with swordplay by doing Soup. Hunger games mostly revolves around swordplay, but it requires you to be a bit smart in terms of hunger/inventory management, facing teams, and being aware of your surroundings in order to find/avoid players and keep yourself from getting lost. So play different minigames depending on the aspect you want to work on.<br><br>And btw, every opponent you face is practically a trainer, whether you shrek them or they shrek you.

It was very easy for me to train myself. Then in that case, I would love to train you! :D If you want, add me on skype: bestbigcat . I specialize in so many different types of PvP. Some you wouldn't even imagine like PvP involving a <b></b>fishing rod as a secondary weapon.

I'm not a pvp mlgee pro, but the best I can give you is don't rely too heavily on block hitting. I see a lot of people running in just block hittin' all the way and expecting that to win all their fights for them. &nbsp;The second somebody some along who knows how to counter it, they just fail, and you can kill them while keeping a full health bar.

I don't ask people to train me but I do ask why I was killed and what I did wrong in battle so I can get better. A thing to remember is you will always die, no matter what tactic you use you will die training at it so don't give up just because you die heaps of times.

But you know what's worst, being predictable. Block hitting might sounds nooby, but is easily counterable, so don't complain about it, enjoy the free kills. <br><br>I would personally recommend doing both depending the situation, but the most important part is, have style, be unpredictable, be even more godly than latiku or cenation, and do crazy stuff, you'll think about what you did after you did it, don't take time thinking before going ham!
