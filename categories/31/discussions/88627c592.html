<u></u><u></u>Hey guys, Edans here. <br><br>As a Head Map Developer of the Maps Section, my personal&nbsp;goal is to improve the gameplay of all maps. This will begin today and hopefully will improve down the road.<br>I have 2 surveys that I want players to fill out to help the current Avicus Rotations improve and become better.<br><br><a href="http://goo.gl/forms/Q5Dgoa028r">http://goo.gl/forms/Q5Dgoa028r</a>&nbsp;- Basic Gameplay Feedback - Basic Form where you can talk about gameplay in specific rotations as well as a single map gameplay feeback suggestion. Only 1 of these are needed.<br><br><a href="http://goo.gl/forms/CstCS87ypR">http://goo.gl/forms/CstCS87ypR</a>&nbsp;- Single Map Feedback - The form where you write about a map and what is wrong with the maps's gameplay and what can be improved. This can be done multiple times<br><br>Thanks so much if you fill these out. You may also use this thread to discuss with other players about the current gameplay state of the server.<br><br>Thanks!<br><b></b><i>Edans</i>.

These are the only type of surveys that should be on the forums regularly

I don't want to get involved with your surveys right now but imo general feedback is that objectives on avicus are too easy. This is because of lack of defenders rather than the format of the maps but if there is a way to make a map that encourages defending then that would be a very good thing. Perhaps putting diamond by the monuments for defenders or something like that<br><br>thanks Eako

How about doing your 'job' instead of asking the community to do it? If you're doing a survey make it simple (rate out of x), if people care to give there opinions they'll seek you out obviously.
