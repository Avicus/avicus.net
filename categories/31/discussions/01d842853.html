Here are my ideas if we ever host a tournament for some of the smaller gamemodes. These are just rough outlines of what I think would work.&nbsp;<br><br>SG:&nbsp;<br><br><ul><li>FFA</li><li>Matches of 12 players ("group" stages)</li><li>Points system: 1 point for a kill, 3 for a win, 1 point for top 5</li><li>The 12 players play 3 consecutive (or not) games (the highest scoring players ex: 4-6 move on to the next stages)</li></ul><br>Walls:<br><br><ul><li>2 Teams in each match</li><li>8-10 players on each team</li><li>each team will be split up between two quads</li><li>Friendly fire between different quad colors is&nbsp;<b>on</b></li><li>Certain kits are banned (Not saying these kits <i>should&nbsp;</i>be banned, but for example: Fisherman, Alchemist, Snowman)</li></ul><div><br></div>CTH:<br><ul><li>4 teams in each match&nbsp;</li><li>5-7 players on each team</li><li>Max score: 750</li><li>The same 4 teams will play 3 consecutive matches</li><li>The teams with the highest total points win (ties go to the team with the highest wins or a tiebreaker match with a score limit of 250</li><li>Certain kits are banned (not saying these kits&nbsp;<i>should&nbsp;</i>be banned, but for example: Demo, heavy, sniper, Yeti)</li><li>Top 2 teams move on (this is for the group stages)</li></ul>

If we were to do a Walls tourney, I'm pretty sure we'd have to add a loooot more ores to the quads ;p<br><br>Maybe we could have tournament Walls maps?

Maybe that is not true, what if you didnt have perfect loot? Then ur team would get options like, should we have one big tank? Should we split it up? And so on.

Or for every match every team gets like 4 options of kits they can pick. Then the gameplay wont always be the same, but still a difference.

If we split teams up to have two quads each, that might fix it. But a lack of resources might also make the game more dynamic. It makes strategy more valuable than just straight up pvp.

Speaking of all this, may we have seperate teams per gamemode? Ex: I am in Cacalmarin for Nebula. What if I wanted to join a different team for CTH but stay in Cacalmarin as well?

I like the Idea of a walls tournament for once since it is one of the only games I play XD here are my ideas for it<br><br><ul><li>Two teams, loser eliminated&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>New maps made especially for the tournament so everyone has a fair chance</li></ul><ul><li>No kits</li></ul><div>XD I know that is only three ideas and there would have to be a lot more to it, but I think a walls tournament is the way to go!</div>
