And why do we care....?<br><br>Post a topic in player reports if you want something to happen. The "regulars" can't do crap about spawnkilling.

Easy fix: <i>leave the game.<br><br></i>All you're saying in this topic is that you got spawnkilled on a laggy computer, nothing about wanting a fix. Make it clear next time.<br><i><br>eg; create a system and suggest it here like you can't get hit for 5 seconds after spawning</i>

Oh I thought you meant leave Avicus.
However, still pretty pointless what you're telling him to do.
