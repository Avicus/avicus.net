Hello everyone.<br><br>Now, as the vast majority of you know, the Omega Update will bring to us Survival Games, along with 44 maps for extended variety and amazing experiences by yourself or with your friends, unless you don't have any to play with.<br><br>Now, I'll be explaining you how will Survival Games maps be released once the update is here. Then again, I do not know all of the information, but I'll be telling you what I know so you guys know how things work.<br><br>We'll start with 12 Survival Games servers, and they'll be named SG01 - SG12 respectively, but now, as I have previously mentioned there are 44 maps, and if you divide that number by 4, you get 11. Meaning there will be 4 different groups of maps, and these will be called&nbsp;<b>Waves</b>. Each Wave will be comprised of 11 different maps and if you play a certain wave, you'll most likely encounter maps from that small group of 11, while the rest of waves contain the other 33.<br><br>The group of servers from SG07 to SG12 will be called&nbsp;<b>First Wave</b>. And these servers will be the ones we start with once the Omega Update is released. We will be releasing Waves over time, so you get to play these maps for some time, then we throw in some more depending on... stuff.<br><br>That means, the group of servers from SG13 to SG18 will be called&nbsp;<b>Second Wave</b>. And this wave will contain 11 new maps some time after the Omega Update is released, meaning these servers will be unavailable for everyone until they are officially released. With that said, this leaves the group of servers from SG19 to SG24 as&nbsp;<b>Third Wave</b> and the group of servers from SG25 to SG30 as&nbsp;<b>Fourth Wave</b>.<br><br>Now, you may be wondering, what are the group of servers from SG01 to SG06 called? Well, these are called&nbsp;<b>Universal Wave</b>. And these group of servers will contain every single map from the Survival Games repository, making it possible for you to enjoy any of the 44 maps in that group of servers. You may play a map from First Wave then one from Third Wave&nbsp;<b>depending on what you vote for</b>. However, all 44 maps will be available on the Universal Wave once all waves are released, that means once the Omega Update comes, you'll only be able to play the first 11 maps, then once the Second Wave is released, you'll be able to play 22 maps in the Universal Wave, while you'll only be able to play 11 and 11 in the other servers.<br><br>Which maps are on which waves?<br><i>That's a surprise.</i>
