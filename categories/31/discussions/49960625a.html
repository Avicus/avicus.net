DTM Monument Transitions - Important

Hello,<br><br>As you've probably already noticed, monuments now have transitions in DTM (Destroy the Monument). This meaning that after 25 minutes of gameplay, the monument will change from an obsidian block to a gold block. This change was made in order to reduce the stalemate that occurs on most maps. I will admit that this change was rather sudden and it shouldn't have been made this way and I apologize for it.<br><br>We want to have a vote with you guys on this change, whether it should be reverted, improved upon, introduce later on with more expansion upon the idea or to keep it.<br>Please vote <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdft9etpxe5IhXhh8yW-e3-BolB0rPv-o81UNzDv6Ql4Tl9Kw/viewform" rel="nofollow">here</a> regarding this change. We want reasoning for the answers, not just a "remove" or "keep" so we're able to see what you guys actually think of the idea.<br><br>When voting, please be sure to address your opinions in a polite and constructive way or your vote may not be counted.<br><br>Regards,<br>The Map Development Team

This should not be implemented in DTM<br>Stalemate is a map issue, and cant be solved by this<br>Block transitions were developed for DTC and then should stay like this. It's in DTC to prevent not stalemate but simply being impossible to break the core after a defense is set up

Shouldnt be a thing. It makes it far too easy even against a pro defense, they just need a good second on the monument, and its gone. I don't think this should be implemented.

Eh, stalemate is not always cause by map issues. Defending can lead to a stalemate.

I'm saying that maps that have issues and do get stalemated because of the issues its the map issue<br><br>My general point is<br>Maps that are stalemated are map/xml issue. its nothing to do with defending. defending should make the objective harder to get and it can stalemate a bit sometimes which is fine, but generally a map that is constantly or usually staltemated is a map issue.

I recon you are active cause you're a mod, but looking at your kill feed you get like what a couple kills a day? How can you have such a strong opinion on something you don't seem to play very often? Players like myself who play destroy and the server in-game a lot, know what's good and what's not, which brings up the main reason people don't like this, it affects good ol gameplay.<br>

Here's my suggestion. Why should we limit it to 1 block? After 20 minutes we get 8 gold blocks, at 40 we get 4, and at an hour we get one. Something along the lines of this I think would be better.

Please vote to "<b>remove</b>" this change on DTM!<br><br>1) It's biased! <b>Favors rushers</b> and <u>penalizes any defender</u>s who care to defend. You are basically discouraging anyone from defending because after setting-up a solid defense, someone could win with one mine stroke depending on the map. &nbsp;It's not a balanced rule.<br>2) <b>Credits are unfai</b>r! &nbsp;It gives the <u>same credits for breaking a gold block as an obsidian block</u>. &nbsp;This will warp stats. &nbsp;Again, it's not balanced.<br>3) It <b>supports quick (non-team focused) games</b>! Many players on avicus <u>like long games</u> where the defense can really spend time creating an awesome defense together as a team (ie. DustDevils). &nbsp;Teamwork is key and makes avicus fun.<br>4) Short games&nbsp;<b>keep players on the same server (mix or destroy)</b>! Longer games should be encouraged because they help promote server diversity. Players who like a shorter game will start a new match on the other server mix, destroy, deathmatch, etc...<br>5) <b>Change with no warning</b>!&nbsp;Community input should have been considered before changes were implemented.

I don't like it<br><br><br>DTM with monument changing is a terrible idea since it's just one block. Cores have multiple blocks so it's really fair for it and breaking a single block won't end the game unless the defenders are blind to patch up the core.<br><br><br>Some Additional Views:<br>The Monument Phases should NOT be forced upon a map. They should be the map makers choice. Maps like Clay Wars are SUITED for long matches where teams need to rally as a team and PUSH together against the opposing team's defense. If there are gold blocks, there are legit NO uses for that. If you have a diamond pickaxe, you'll break it so FAST that you don't need to cover yourself up. Like I've stated, not all maps should have phases. The Phases should be the map maker's choice depending on how they feel about their map.<br><br>It's a nice feature but it was terrible used and forced onto all the maps of DTM.

This would be a good idea but only if timers were really long, like 10 seconds. There's also the fact that lots of defenders just get full diamond and box defense so it's almost impossible to kill them.

Please vote to "<b>remove</b>" this change on DTM!<br><br>1) It's biased! <b>Favors rushers</b> and <u>penalizes any defender</u>s who care to defend. You are basically discouraging anyone from defending because after setting-up a solid defense, someone could win with one mine stroke depending on the map. &nbsp;It's not a balanced rule.<br>2) <b>Credits are unfai</b>r! &nbsp;It gives the <u>same credits for breaking a gold block as an obsidian block</u>. &nbsp;This will warp stats. &nbsp;Again, it's not balanced.<br>3) It <b>supports quick (non-team focused) games</b>! Many players on avicus <u>like long games</u> where the defense can really spend time creating an awesome defense together as a team (ie. DustDevils). &nbsp;Teamwork is key and makes avicus fun.<br>4) Short games&nbsp;<b>keep players on the same server (mix or destroy)</b>! Longer games should be encouraged because they help promote server diversity. Players who like a shorter game will start a new match on the other server mix, destroy, deathmatch, etc...<br>5) <b>Change with no warning</b>!&nbsp;Community input should have been considered before changes were implemented.

Even though I agree with some of your points, like 5, I think that it's important for Avicus to make the game more entertaining. A playerbase of 50 or 75 can be happy with the game as it was, but what about all the other people that join the server and leave because of the stalematey and boring gameplay of DTM?&nbsp;<br><br>While this playerbase should be kept happy, we shouldn't blindly satisfy it, but hear it and see what's good for the necessities of Avicus.&nbsp;<br><br>For example in my case, I've come to a point in where i play once every two weeks maybe, and retired because I simply didn't want to join the server and play.

After discussing it we've decided to revert phases and we'll keep it to DTC only.

i actually like stale avicus maps and if you want to change it to gold atleast put 3 or 4more blocks of gold since 1block of gold is easy to mine if you want to implement it to DTM

Why not just add efficiency to the pickaxes over time and keep the monument an obsidian block throughout the game?

Well shit, half the dtm maps you guys have are messed up:<br><br>1. Some monuments are on islands 20 blocks away from the map<br>2. Some monuments require you to go through enemy spawn to destroy them...That's just wrong<br><br>So yeah I'm in favor of the gold mode

Before I say this I know the problem has been fixed.<br><br>I'm against having obsidian &gt; gold changes for the simple purpose as to why? So many games currently finish within the 5-10 minute mark and cycle to something completely different. <br><br>Some people come onto Avicus purely to defend and having gold block cycles really take away the fun of doing this. The occasional game of 30+ minutes can be really enjoyable for rushers and defenders of all sorts, seeing as trying new strategies is a popular idea in these games. <br><br>Most stalemate defences can be broken with a good team push on a skybridge, so why make it easier for attackers when to be perfectly honest we should be making it easier for defenders.<br><br>That's just my point.

Gold is way too easy to break and the game usually ends straight after it turns to gold<br><br>i also think that this shouldnt happen at least in tournaments especially where the monument is only 1 block
