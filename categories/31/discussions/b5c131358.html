Hey Avicus players.<br>I've got bored and started going on Infractions of &nbsp;people. Then I have found this one:<br><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/swYsI45.png">I've been wondering if switching teams before the game ends for EXP is allowed or not allowed.<br>I didn't do it for your information, because in my opinion it isn't fair.<br>However, it isn't saying it's not allowed in the rules, which means you can do it.<br>I think those punishments should be still given for Teamstackers and people that switch teams for their own EXP.<br>Opinions?

I knew it was the infraction of pizza. And it's not allowed to change the team at the end to get the winning exp. It's cheating and only because it doesn't state in the rules, doesn't mean that it's allowed.

To be honest, I think it should be allowed, because you have donated to have the privilege of doing this, so you deserve the exp for that reason.

Section A, Point 8 in the Avicus's rule says that:<br><b>"Do not intentionally take advantage of server exploits that give you an advantage of other players. Doing so results in a severe punishment. Instead, we highly encourage you to&nbsp;</b><i><b>email&nbsp;</b><a rel="nofollow"><b>support@avicus.net</b></a><b>&nbsp;with details regarding the potential server exploit."</b><br></i>Well, this is similar to abusing your donator or changing teams in the last minute so I think this isn't allowed at all.<i><br></i>

When you donate you buy certain privileges. The problem, and the thing that annoys most people, is when players abuse those privileges. This sort of thing as well as team stacking are excellent examples. Like Juano said, it's sorta like exploiting bugs in the sense that you're doing something that wasn't meant to be intended. I'd consider it illegal for the most part.

Picking which team you want to join is fine. Or even if you leave to join a losing team to balance things out is fine. I have no problem with that. What pisses me off is when someone realizes their team probably won't win and leaves to join the winning team. In a way it's like giving the old team the finger and saying "I'm part of this team now!"

mmmm.. well i think its kind of cheating the order of the game, you know? like exp exists fore to earn and get your independent levels, but changing teams <b><i>for that reason&nbsp;</i></b><i></i>is not really in spirit of the game, and defeats the purpose of exp, so IMO this shouldn't be allowed, but i would punish it with any more than a kick or two :O

Really only applies to TDM. Or maybe somebody would switch teams if the opposite team has broken like 4 monuments on Quintus while your team hasn't even destroyed one. It's gonna be obvious who wins, so people might switch for that. Just a thought.

TNTTurtles is relevant actually. He wouldn't buy a rank on Hive. Why? He hates the server with a passion. But you must seem to like Avicus, as you've spent a lot of time and effort towards it. So, subconsciously you did pay to keep the server going. Why would you even pay if you didn't like it?

No, I donated to get XP faster. In deatil, I wanted to reach prestige 1 at Avicade faster than Steven with buying a Diamond upgrade (The Emerald upgrade was just for Avicus :p. (But of course. OF COURSE did he play more after I bought it .-.)
