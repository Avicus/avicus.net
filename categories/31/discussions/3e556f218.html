Put your most clutch moments down below! I have two.&nbsp;<br><br>1. About a year ago on nebula, I was rushing on Quintus. The other team had broken 4/5 monuments and we had 0/5. Then in some sort of miracle our team had 4 players (including me) break all 5 monuments in under 30 seconds to clutch a win. We weren't even communicating, we just decided to all rush at once.&nbsp;<br><br>2. Today on walls I was playing on Grotto Area. If you didn't know, you trade emeralds for enchanted diamond armor and potions on that map. It takes a long time to kill people also. During the game, everyone died until it was me vs 3 other players on one team. They were decent pvpers and the fight lasted for what felt like 10 minutes (each player had a few potions of complete health restoration). I almost broke 2 diamond helmets fighting, but I managed to somehow pick off players at the end of the fight and win the 3v1 and come out on top

Server was lagging<br><br>It was a halcyon match. I mine the monument and it broke but I died before I fully broke it so it respawned 5 mins later it says I break it

It was a very long match on Quintus, and each team had 4 out of 5 monuments broken. Our defense was under heavy attacked, so I knew it was now or never. I made my iron quick, and dashed right to the back of their spawn. I broke the back wall, and this guy came and hit me. He got so much knockback that I hit the monument island, and then looked down and place a block, saving me from the void. I pillared up, killed a full diamond and full iron, and broke the monument just as they reached the island, and I saw our last defender die in chat.&nbsp;<br><br><br>Best.

A long time ago when I was playing on quintus I was rushing and at the time I did not know what monument was broken as I was a noob so I bridged to every monument &nbsp;and tried to see if it was broken and on a couple of them someone decided to place the broken obsidian back which made it take forty minutes or so until I finally got the unbroken monument and I broke it just before someone killed me.

Quintus. Other team was 3/5. My team sucked. I went over to their side in their armor and bridged to all monuments. I then proceeded to destroy all 5 of them, thus making meh team win.

In a SG match, there were 6 people to start with, and it turns out it was a 5v1.&nbsp;<br><br>It was this map where you lit a certain place on fire, and the floor would collapse. I managed to get all of them on the trap platform and killed them xD

It was a game on senex I (good map) and the game had been going on for a long time. And i sneaked passed the whole team to find the monument protected by about 10 people. I didn't know what I would do. But then I saw a chest and there was some lime armor and I was on the blue team. So I took that armor and swapped it with mine. Then slowly made my way to the monument while pressing shift. And when someone came passed I just pretended I was building the bridge better.. Then when I got to the monument. Surprisingly nobody reconized that I was on the opposite team. So I waited till nobody was watching to quickly break the monument with about 10 guys all around me. Then we won the game and they were trippin ballz

As a lot of you know, I am bad at PvP due to having a laptop, so this was my best moment.<br><br>It was Zao, about 4 months ago. I was rushing and 7 people were all trying to snipe near the void area, and I just went up and killed all of them, and I don't know how I did. That match ended up being 64-11, my best ever. Normally my matches are like 2-9999

MilkshakesMC were playing a round of UHC. He said he was going to get something so he will be back in a minute so he left the game. So I was alone smelting my gold and suddenly there was a team of two right there after me. I killed one player but the other player got down to two hearts. Suddenly that other guy's mouse spun by accident and his head spinned away from me. Then a managed to kill him. And after deathmatch we both won. :)

I don't think it would have been under a minuet. because there are 5 monuments on quintus.<br>And it takes 9.3 seconds to break one obsidian. plus the extra time it takes for you to get to the other monuments. and it would take an extra few minuets to get to there monuments from you're base.

Wasn't really a clutch moment&nbsp;but about a month ago I was on Quintus, I found some purple armour, put it on (I was on cyan) and then just shift-walked through their spawn, to their iron. Then, I connected all of their monuments up, and broke them all!eZ

I was playing Luar and the match was nearing on 30 minutes. There were many campers at their defense, and I quietly found some of the other team's armor in a chest. I then built behind the monument, then built up above it from behind. I then jumped on the monument, and quietly destroyed it. The guys below me had no idea what had happened. There I felt the true feeling of victory

I was playing Luar and the match was nearing on 30 minutes. There were many campers at their defense, and I quietly found some of the other team's armor in a chest. I then built behind the monument, then built up above it from behind. I then jumped on the monument, and quietly destroyed it. The guys below me had no idea what had happened. There I felt the true feeling of victory
