I am new to Avicus, and already, I have collected a few... infractions.<br><br>I don't really care about a few of them, one was a mistake, and another I don't understand, but the one I want to address is the tempban I got.<br><br>A few days ago, I was tempbanned for an hour for combat logging. It makes me feel really bad to have that on my profile, because no one will believe my stats and I will be looked down upon by the public.&nbsp;<br><br>In short, it was kind of a rage quit. There was this guy, who was better than me, who killed me over and over and finally I got fed up, so when he hit me off the world, I void logged, right in front of two Avicus mods.&nbsp;<br><br>I felt really bad for doing that, because I hate it when it happens to me. I also feel like I lost the trust of some of the mods, and I could never actually get to know them without this divide between us. I want to say sorry. Sorry my emotions got the better of me, and sorry I broke the rules, in front of two staff members as if I was a common noob.&nbsp;<br><br>I'm sorry. I really am. I hope the players on Avicus will forgive me. ;-;<br><br>Oh, and btw, this isn't an appeal so don't tell me go to the support page or anything.<br><br>Thanks! And sorry!<br><br>~higger

If you're willing to take the time to write an apology like that it shows to me and many others that you truly care.<br>Very nice of you :D<br>

It's ok, I personally don't think KD's are a big deal, so I don't care if someone combat logs and I don't think someone should care unless the person who has the good KD is egotistical about it and brags. I'm glad you apologized, still, because some people get angry over that. Sometimes your emotions control too much and stuff like this happens without you&nbsp;<i>really</i> having a say in it. It's ok, you seem like a good person; don't be sad about it (:<br>

Banning for combat login is a bull crap reason, on a different server I was tempbanned for that cause my game crashed...

No worries, it happens. I always sometimes get mad when there is a good PvP'er and I rage in the chat which gave me my infraction. Apology accepted! :)
