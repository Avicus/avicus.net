I've seen many people accuse others of hacking but really, do they know what hacking is? I'm not the most experienced player when it comes to hacks, etc but I generally have a good overview of what hack does what, so when I report, I tend to get the right hack.<br><br>Since there is a super limited space for me to type in, I am doing this thread on Google Docs so all you need to do is click the link and read.<br><br>P.S: I am certain about most hacks but some of them I have given an accurate go. If there is an error, feel free to explain to me and I will edit it.<br><br>Link:&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NWO0HM-6u_Y76unDqryEkjEHCHIhcv4kqrm3hEYdI88/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NWO0HM-6u_Y76unDqryEkjEHCHIhcv4kqrm3hEYdI88/edit?usp=sharing</a><br><br>For a more detailed explanation of a few mentioned hacks, click here:<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://avicus.net/forums/08812970d">http://avicus.net/forums/08812970d</a>

I definitely agree with you.<br>Recently, I have been banned by a foolish moderator saying that I was hacking in the server. I wasn't hacking, and this is really outrageous. This should stopped, and only the senior moderators should be the one who control the bans, not a foolish female moderator. I have been sending several email to the staff, and they are not answering.. I have been disappointed because I was playing this server for almost 2 years now, since the Mczone.&nbsp;<br>Do you even know how you feel when you get banned for no reason?

If you've sent in two emails regarding your ban, and you haven't got a reply, I can contact a Sr Staff memebr for you. However please don't be so negative on certain staff members, and being sexist. <br>If you have an issue with the staff team contact Tel.

Excellent guide. This covers most of the hacks that clients come with, and would be really useful for some of the mods (no offense to the staff). However you might wanna add that some clients come with aimbot that focuses on one player only, instead of focusing on the nearest player. I also suggest you add derp, x-ray, auto-crit, toggle-crouch, and nofall. Overall, great guide.

Once again, like I said in the email, yes, you may ask the senior moderator to ask for an reply. And also, I am getting nervous and frustrating whenever people gets accused,<b> especially&nbsp;</b>by moderators who should be the one who knows better. This has been one of my favorite server, and yet, I am banned. The only fault that I did on this server, might be that I was just enjoying, and I am not that kind of person which to use Cheats to enjoy what I am given.

I think you might need a lesson on sexism.<br>Sexism is discrimination towards another gender, or the belief that one gender is superior to the other, as well as stereotypes.. etc<br>Finding out someone's gender has nothing at all to do with sexism..<br><br>I advise you to show some modesty.

I disagree. The way "female" was incorporated into "foolish female moderator" — given the defamatory context — does come off as seemingly (or possibly ostensibly) discriminatory and patronizing, as opposed to if merely "foolish moderator" was said with disregard to the staff member's gender (which is irrelevant anyway).&nbsp;Whether or not this is in concordance with the poster's intentions is ambiguous, though his message leaves a negative impression nonetheless.

The word "female" on its own means nothing, but due to the context he used it in, it actually could be interpreted as sexist easily.&nbsp;<br><br>A) the word "female" there was unneeded, and under that context, was used in such a way that implied strongly that player was looking down on the "foolish female moderator", as if scolding a small child. &nbsp;<br><br>B) The context they used this phrase in was pretty derogatory and disrespectful, once again&nbsp;<u>looking down</u> on such. If it was just " foolish moderator, OK, but the fact that they mentioned the sex of this moderator and paired it with a derogatory term.&nbsp;<br><br>This is why in my opinion, that comment was sexist.&nbsp;<br><br>Lose the tude...

You should look for more info about the ghost client because you don't have a minimum idea of how it works.<br>The rest has a lack of info but it's somehow correct, keep the post updated.<br>Good job so far!
