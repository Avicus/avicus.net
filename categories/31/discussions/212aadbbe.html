  <h1>New Hub <small>Gecko Canopy <i class="icon-ok"></i></small></h1>
</div>
As a conclusion from the map developer meeting, we've decided to make a new hub. Which would be smaller, so it would be simpler to decorate the hub for future holidays and easier/faster navigation for newer players. As you've already seen, the new hub is already in place. Featuring more hidden secrets, a harder parkour course and a great style for aesthetics! We hope that this hub will be long lasting on Avicus. Get ready for more features in the future! :)<br><br>
<div class="page-header">
  <h1>Gamemode <small>Assignments <i class="icon-ok"></i></small></h1>
</div>
In the past, we assigned each person to one gamemode, they would do their part and look after it. They will be responsible for accepting/denying maps, YML/map fixes and the maintenance of the gamemode in total. Hoping that in the future, more people would start to play different gamemodes if we polished them up and added new styles and methods to the game. With all this under way, me and Evocal have decided to bring gamemode assignments back in place. They've all been assigned to the task of improving their gamemodes with other 2 Map Developers (5 in Nebula), so we'll evaluate how well they do their job more seriously now. We are hoping that this method will be more efficient and that we could strive for success. Map Developers are allowed to work outside of their given gamemode at times, but if it's too constant and they  abandon their own gamemode, they will receive a warning. This probably won't be the final change ups, but here's the assignments for each map developer:<br><br>

<b>- timaeusTestified:</b> Nebula, CTH, Walls<br>
<b>- Slyae:</b> Nebula, Nexus, SG<br>
<b>- Skyadia:</b> Nebula, CTH<br>
<b>- Zerkk:</b> Nebula, Walls<br>
<b>- Mango_:</b> Nexus, CTH<br>

  <h1>Map Testing <small>Community Event <i class="icon-ok"></i></small></h1>
</div>
Considering we haven't had an event such as map testing in a while, we thought this would be a good time to host one. We don't have a list of maps that will be tested at the moment, but in the near future, expect one! As shown in the past, not a lot of people actually come to the event. We have a possible idea that would help this situation. Having a double credit boost day on the hosted server would most likely increase the number of people attending. It will be broadcasted in the lobby &amp; in matches (if we can). This idea will probably be in effect, so be sure to stay tuned for it.
<div class="page-header">
  <h1>Feedback <small>For MapDevs <i class="icon-ok"></i></small></h1>
</div>
We have recently created a feedback sheet for the map developers. Me and Evocal (head mapdevs) will be providing pro's and con's on how the map developer is doing so far, and they will provide me and evo feedback on how we're doing too. This method will hopefully alert everyone and soon, be more efficient, as we will learn what we need to improve on. Expect improved map developers soon :]<br>Other then this, there's not really much to say about the topic.<br><br>
<div class="page-header">
  <h1>Rotations <small>Dawn, Dusk &amp; SG <i class="icon-ok"></i></small></h1>
</div>
As most of you already now, there is a new rotation update to have the MCZone (throwback) rots split into 2 different sections of time rather than opening a new server: There's Dawn, and there's Dusk.<br><br>
<b>Dawn:</b> Plays maps strictly from the MCZone era.<br>
<b>Dusk:</b> Plays maps strictly from early avicus, early avicore, and an extra Quintus + Clay Wars.<br><br>
<i class="icon-chevron-right"></i> Thanks to a pull request by IcyCode, survival games now has 5 rounds before restarting! <i class="icon-chevron-left"></i><br>
How this works:
SG Lobby, people vote for map<br>
Voted map gets played<br>
Game ends<br>
Server automatically cycles to a new SG lobby<br>
Repeat x4<br><br>
We hope that players will enjoy this update! There will most likely be more maps added later on.
