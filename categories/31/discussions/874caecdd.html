I just wanted to know how you think Avicus would eventually downfall like all great Minecraft servers do. (All good things must come to an end) and how you would eventually give up on Minecraft. Any thoughts?<br><br>As for me..&nbsp;<br>I think my Minecraft experience is coming to an end, along with my days of gaming. Appropriate&nbsp;to end it on such an Awesome server.<br>Why?<br>Just feel like gaming is wasting my time, every time i'm on the computer I feel like I can be out, having so much more fun and being more healthy (I blame myopia on gaming, ik no evidence but meh). People keep saying, "being a teen is the best moments of their lives"&nbsp;<br><br>So yeah... don't wanna waste it :p<br><br>Bye

It would end like Undertaker's Streak. 21-1.<br>We'll end up being around for a very lng time when suddenly a new server appears. Then avicus will unexpectededly lose all its players. Regs will leave. randies will take over. funky will hang up the diamond sword &lt;/3

If I was in charge of the good-bye part of Avicus, I would have Avicus leave with a bang. Literally.

Avicus will end due to lack of updates, people later get bored, people leave, less people = less donations, no donations = RIP<br><br>Ill stop playing Minecraft because the game is starting to suck now, really, thanks Mojang, wonderful updates recently.

Everytime someone makes a good bye posts it makes me wonder why they're leaving and then I realize that it's because they wan't to really live their life with their own real life friends. And although I intend to stay here a little longer I wish you the best of luck in life and hope you find what your looking for. Just remember to make the right decisions and you'll be fine :')

Considering it took like 6 months to make 1.8, hyped it up so much, and now we get a overhyped laggy piece of sh*t. I would say it was pretty bad.
