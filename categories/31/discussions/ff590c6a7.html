Hello, as you might have noticed, we now have support rooms on TeamSpeak. <br><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/vD8HIad.png"><br><br>These rooms are like a Help-Desk. If you have any questions and/or concerns, you will move in here. A Moderator will then come and help you to the best of their ability. If you abuse these rooms, you <b>will be banned </b>from&nbsp;TeamSpeak. Please only come here if you need anything. It is not a place to talk to other players. If you have any questions and/or concerns, feel free to ask below. I will do my best to answer them. Have a great day :).<br><br>Just a note; this isn't for your life problems. Purely Avicus related.

If a staff member abuses it, they will most likely get a warning or be demoted. If they have a private discussion, I'm sure they'll stop once a member of the community comes on to ask a question. I honestly do not think that any of the staff would abuse it.

Like I said before, It's nearly impossible to tell if staff members or just regular players are abusing it.<br><br>I just don't really see the need considering Gillette had to sit in their for at least a dozen hours and I still don't know if he ever got what he wanted.

Regarding regular users abusing it: It'll be monitored, and they'll be dealt with appropriately.<br><br>Regarding staff abusing it: Not every staff member would abuse it. Like with a regular player, either notify another staff member, or "report" them. They'll be dealt with accordingly.&nbsp;<br><br>Sure, one of the 2 will eventually happen, but that's why we have the Report subforum, and staff members. No matter what, the Support rooms are great, and were needed.

I really don't think Gill needs a "Retired Rank" since he messed up all the permissions and just sits in cspacer chats or Admin channels purposely. Retired players shouldn't have Staff Powers at all, so I think the rank should just be removed.

I agree with that. Or, you could just it into just a basic rank like Gold or Emerald. Even then, it serves no real purpose, it's just a cool little thing like a donator rank :P

Not everyone, maybe, anyday of this year or week or day,etc, a new user that joined TS will see Gill in a room with his rank so he will probably ask you or another mod: "What does the retired rank stands for?" and then you'll just answer him with what Gill did for this server and all the effort he putted on it.<br>It's not for the permissions the rank gives you, it's for the value it has.
