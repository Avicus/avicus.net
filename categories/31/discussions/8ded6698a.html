Uh. This happened just today. I was going through airport security in landing, and I had my climbing pick in my carry on luggage. Since the airport near me is really lenient, they let me keep it on board with me.<br><br>However when I touched down, the security asked me to throw my pick away. I started to protest, whilst swinging my arms around with the pickaxe in my hand. Long story short, I got in deep trouble, made myself look like an idiot and scare everyone. I kept my pickaxe though!
