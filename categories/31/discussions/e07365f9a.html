It's the perfect time...<br><br>I would:<br><br>Demote all staff who were in Insidia<br><br>Ban 99250 (jk)<br><br>Promote Robin and BmB to admin<br><br>Make autism jokes legal so DaGoldBrick doesn't get forum banned<br><br>Give the middle finger to people who don't like me<br><br>Make ToggleSneak legal so I won't get banned and lose us the tourney<br><br>Ask staff members who were agreeing on the Michael post who is bias and then promote those I asked to senior mod.<br><br>Add a 1 dollar entry pool for each player entering the tourney and put most of it towards the prize pool. This would attract a lot of players to Avicus.<br><br>gg why am I not admin yet

As the role of an admin, you should focus on your community because these are the players that enjoy your server that you play on, focus on fixing the lag, focus on advertising tournaments and to also get out player count up even more!

would make a re-assasment day, but now actually no bias, and demote everyone that doesnt meet even 1 of the requirements, no matter about their past experience or advantages they have on the other staff. also listen more to the community, at the end the staff (not trying to be rude) are trying their best for the communty, then if they dont listen to the community its not worth it

It's not really too hard to do. I could clean the staff in 24 hours, as long as every staff member got on at least once to talk to me. (if I was admin ofc)<br><br>Oh, and that's a promise. Not a bet.
