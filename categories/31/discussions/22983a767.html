This is not happening with me.<br>It is most likely a problem with his computer or internet.

I don't think that's the problem... His other internet-using applications work.

@jord<br>tell him to change his version to 1.7.9, sometimes, even if the version is compatible with the server, the actual version is still the best.<br>if it still doesn't work, ask for his vid settings<br>@kammy<br>try changing it to 1.7.9, if its not

This is happening to me, too. I can't get on the server, but all the other servers are totally fine. I've ran it on Minecraft 1.7.2 and 1.7.9, but after 30 or so seconds of pinging, the internet symbol is crossed out with 1.7.9 next to it. I logged out, it still didn't work, I logged back in and played and it worked, then I logged back in and out and it didn't work again. Pretty annoying ):<br><br>Edit: Now it's working again ._.
