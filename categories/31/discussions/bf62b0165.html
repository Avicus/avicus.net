Yeah, I know it sounds a bit silly, but I'm wondering. I'm thinking of getting back onto my first server (I'm not leaving or anything) and believe it or not, hacks are alllowed. No PVP hacks, just small ones like gammabright, x-ray, et cetera. <u>So, I'm wondering if I can have an x-ray texture pack as long as I don't use it on Avicus</u>. If I'm not allowed, I completely understand. Thank you! :3

You're not allowed to use an X-Ray texture pack on Avicus. Doesn't matter if you have one in your texture packs folder, you just cannot use it on Avicus.

Well think about it, someone is shift tunneling towards the monument and you see them with xray then go for them, is that fair? That's why it isn't allowed.

Oh, oops, sorry, I'm really tired so I forget to add obvious things in xP<br>I'm not going to use it on Avicus (God dang, hacking sucks) I'm just wondering &nbsp;if I can have it in my resource packs folder. &nbsp;I'm not x-raying on Avicus but I do want to x-ray on the server that it's allowed on and I don't feel like deleting the pack everytime I get on Avicus. Sorry for the confusion xP

You can have it installed as long as your not using it on Avicus.
