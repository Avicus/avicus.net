<p>Guess what, staff spotlight is back, and I'll try my best to regulate them again. Smiley has stepped up to be our first staff in the spotlight for a little bit. Discuss and show your support for him in the comments!<b><br><br>What is your username in Minecraft and&nbsp; what is your favourite game on Avicus?</b><br>My username is Smiley and my favorite game on Avicus is Capture the Wool </p><p><b>​​Introduce yourself in 4-5 sentences.</b><br>Hey everyone! My name is Ethan, and I like to party xD I have played the piano for 4 years now. I also love to cook a bunch of different food (Chinese food is my favorite). I enjoy spending my time on Avicus moderating, and I really like spending time with friends on here and meeting more of the community! My favorite subject in school is currently Chemistry, but that’s probably gonna change by the time finals come around.</p><p><b>​What are you most excited/obsessed over at the moment?</b><br>I’m going rock climbing in about a week, so I’m getting myself super pumped up for that. I’m also really excited to see what the new year can bring! I’m really obsessed with Snapchat for the first time this week.</p><p><b>​​What interests you the most in life?</b><br>I’m really interested in nursing or going into the medical field. I would like to help people out a lot :simple_smile: Some jobs in that field require you work about 2 days a week, so I would also want to start my own business in my free time.</p><p>​​<b>What music/art/media do you like?</b><br>I’m in love with Of Monsters and Men right now. I also really like “Love Yourself” because Ed Sheeran wrote it, of course.&nbsp; My favorite TV show is Parks and Rec, and I’ve been binge watching Bones for about 4 months.</p><p><b>​​Where are you from?</b><br>I’m from Texas in the US of A!</p><p><b>What are the most common questions you get asked while moderating?​​</b><br>I get asked “How do you like moderating?” a lot, and I have to say, it’s pretty awesome. I enjoy the feeling of helping out, defending somebody if they need it, or making somebody out there smile!</p><p><b>​​​Anything else you want to mention?​​<br></b>I would just like to thank all the nice people out there for playing and having fun! It absolutely makes my day when I see someone on here being nice and happy to others! I look forward to a year of moderating for Avicus, meeting new people, and having a bunch of laughs <br><br style=" color: rgb(44, 45, 48);          background-color: rgb(249, 249, 249); "><br style=" color: rgb(44, 45, 48);          background-color: rgb(249, 249, 249); "><span style=" color: rgb(44, 45, 48);      display: inline !important;     background-color: rgb(249, 249, 249); ">​</span><b style="color: rgb(44, 45, 48);     font-family: Slack-Lato, appleLogo, sans-serif;        background-color: rgb(249, 249, 249); ">​</b><br style=" color: rgb(44, 45, 48);          background-color: rgb(249, 249, 249); "></p>
