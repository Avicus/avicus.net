First off, I would like to congratulate the PowerPuff Boys on winning Race to Victory! Prizes will be distributed soon.<br><br><b>Pel's Retirement; A Thank You:<br></b><br>Sadly, yesterday was hindered with Pelpelajax's retirement. He was a great official. Please thank him if you see him.<br><br><b>Things We Can Improve On:</b><br><br>Please reply down below if you have another things that are not listed here.<br><br><ul><li>Fix Servers. Way too laggy.</li><li>Fix maps. Way too skybridged based, and stalemated.&nbsp;</li><li>Improve on detecting hackers during a tournament match. We are very sorry EC.&nbsp;</li></ul><b>Updates/Announcements:</b><br>First off, I would like to say that there will not be another "big" tournament for a while. Don't worry! Instead, we will be having small, 1 day mini-tournaments with varying gamemodes.&nbsp;<br>New Officials? With Pelpelajax's retirement, there will be new officials. Yes, plural. Expect that very soon.&nbsp;<br>I can promise that lots of good things are coming!<br><br><b>Avicus Leagues? What did you just say?</b><br>Stay tuned for more imformation. Again, coming very soon.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Our Goals:</b><br><br>Basically, we want to improve Avicus' player count with tournaments. More players = better tournaments. We also want to provide good, fun tournaments.<br><br>Get hyped!<br>Regards,&nbsp;<br>The Officials :)

Many other stuff are "coming very soon" and we've been waiting too long IMO. But from this tourney organization there is a lot to improve, the things that you listed are right, also get way more organized on the streaming side. No way only one streamer for 2 rounds with terrible quality, impossible to watch. Overall I'd rate 5/10 but it's good for the start and I'm happy to see it went partly smoothly, looking forward to the league as well. I'd like to get more info about the league if possible.

The streaming wasn't amazing, and we'll find ways to fix that.&nbsp;<br><br>I feel like the only reason things didn't come quick (which I will try my hardest to get things out quick) is because we were too focused on a "big tourney".

Tbh, they were pretty insane. 1 match reached 45 minutes, the other 2 43. Deltah fucking clutched for you guys when I was on my side with the wool on Sand Ocean lmfao. They were probably the most intense matches ever lmfao.&nbsp;<br><br>We're not disbanding, BmB just stepped down :c&nbsp;<br><br>Sorry for any salt, players should've been mad at the map, not you guys or Ihze. Hey, we nearly won by me underbriding afterwards anyway :) ggwp

Most intense matches I've had in my life, both teams clutching each other every minute, Glitchy getting the wool seconds away from the end of the match and Delta getting Tazz whilst being 5 blocks away from the monument.<br><br>Was a pleasure to play against you PPB, gg.<br><br>Only thing I didn't like about this was the server being fully 1.7, the lag spikes were annoying since I never got them whilst using 1.8.
