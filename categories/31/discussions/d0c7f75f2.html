Hello!<br>I think there is a thread about this. (Sorry if there is)<br>Alright lets get started!<br>Walls players love to play walls but don't like to play DTM and don't compete in the tourney. Walls players have been talking about this and wishing that there was one. It has come to me that maybe we should do one.<br>It would be a 3v3v3v3 base game. Walls rotation picked later.<br>Pros: Everyone would love it! People are good at Walls and this would make itquite intresting! It will make walls a lot exciting! Everybody is talking and has been waiting for this and want this!&nbsp;<br>Cons: There will be people who love walls but won't compete and wont have any walls to play on!<br><br>Please leave feedback, and I know that there are lots of you who want this to happen like me!&nbsp;<br>Thanks!<br>-Soccer4Life

Hey, Soccer, I love the suggestion but a thread (<a href="https://avicus.net/forums/00886d7b5">https://avicus.net/forums/00886d7b5</a>) has already been made about possible ideas for a walls tournament. Since there are two threads I'm going to lock this one, but feel free to post your ideas on the other thread!
