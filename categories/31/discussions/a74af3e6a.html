<span>Hello</span><br><span><br>After a&nbsp;</span><b>VERY&nbsp;</b><span>successful second tournament, I am here to first of all, congratulate Bad Company on winning their second unofficial tournament. Well played lads. Unfortunately, there will always be something sad - NovaLikesPvP was blacklisted (appealable) and Ethernal Cross were DQed after the Semi Finals. There were DQed for two reasons:</span><br><br><ol><li><b>Not taking the game seriously</b></li><li><b><span>Spamming&nbsp;</span>inappropriate<span>&nbsp;lanauge in chat.</span></b></li></ol><b></b>However, I couldn't have organised this myself. A huge thank you to the Unofficial Event Coordinators:<br><br><ul><li>BmB</li><li>Fouled</li><li>Jiveh</li><li>GrapeSmoothie</li><li>Atdit</li><li>Awesome_Apricot/ AprilTheAnaconda</li></ul>Time for the sad news however good news comes within it. This will be the last unofficial event for a while, however more events may happen. The reason for this is that the official tournament is being announced <b>VERY&nbsp;</b>soon. This can only mean good things.<br><br>Regards<br><br>The unofficial event coordinators.

kk admitedly i see that nova got pissed that it changed without his knowledge, but you did give 24 hours which was the best you could do and a days notice is more than enough.<br><br>But Nova all you are doing by going into rage/spam/fuck everyone mode is painting a bad image for your team, which is sad, because you are good players.

For anyone who is complaining about how it went; if you don't agree with the organization, than why do you guys still play these tourneys? Organize your own one if you aren't happy with these. Can you guys be thankful for someone actually organizing this stuff?

Are you stupid? You started this argument, funnily enough nova, I don't care that your team got DQed. You're just salty that you had to play Senex which is obviously stated on the post, which I announced on the day before the tournament and even made a post saying that there had been map changes. I don't care that you didn't read it, even though I am fully entitled to change anything on that post whenever I like. I'm not wrong - I'm SO sorry that you can't read my post and then are so stupid to call someone from your own country a 'beaner' LMFAO who does that. You started this argument and I don't care that you don't care to reply.&nbsp;<br><br>The funny thing is, you could not make an event better than this - I've had pretty much every team tell me that my unofficial tournaments were better than the official one, so I don't give a that you are are mad because he's totally immature and can't keep up to date with my post.<br><br>Furthermore, you called me for 15 minutes straight on Skype when I even told you I wasn't going to pick up and then you go on to say 'I have no time to complain' LMFAO what kind of hypocrite are you?

Are you stupid? You started this argument, funnily enough nova, I don't care that your team got DQed.

Quick notice regarding future events: tazz, slicorn and I are all doing lots of work regarding the real deal official tournament so these unnoficial events might be put on hold for a while, however simple mega scrims we should still be able to host so stay tuned to the post. (Rhymes)

It's funny how he called you a kid and that he'll "ruin" you. Pretty sure that's not redacted correctly but whatever, thanks for making the tourney.
