Hey so I'm sure we all remember the other thread about this, but it was a while ago so I want to ask again.<br>Is it still 5000 subscribers needed for VIP rank, and 50,000 for YouTuber?<br><br>Honestly I was trying to go for this VIP rank for a while now, but at the rate Avicus YouTubers are growing, I don't even know if Avicus will still be around until someone gets 5k; let alone 50,000...<br><br>I know a lot of people have complained about this, so I'm just wondering as well...<br>Could this be lowered to a little bit of a more reasonable amount?<br><br>I know a few people that have YouTuber rank on badelion and they have around 5k subs, but obviously as we know badelion is a much bigger server than Avicus.<br><br>I think at this point in time (and I'm not trying to sound cocky or anything), I'm probably one of the biggest Avicus YouTubers (active ones at least), and I know that there are a lot of other AviTubers who are dedicated to making videos for Avicus, and they're actually getting some of their viewers to join Avicus (I know that it's happened to me, at least), and I think that these people should have some sort of "reward" (aka a rank) for that.<br><br>I know there is a "subscriber minimum" at the moment, but let's be honest.. Avicus doesn't have&nbsp;<b>nearly</b> as many players as it had back in the day, so who knows how much longer it'll last?<br><br><br>Basically.. what I'm trying to say is, either decrease the minimum amount of subscribers needed (to like 3k or something more reasonable), or give the rank to people who constantly make Avicus youtube videos.<br><br><br>Anyways last time nothing was done about this, but who knows; maybe things can change :)<br><br>Thanks for reading!

To be fair, people always get lower view counts in comparison to their sub count.<br><br>@OP I agree, I've never seen anyone on this server with a VIP/YouTuber rank, and although it shouldn't be given out to anyone, it definitely should be lowered.<br><br>100% agree

I'm aware of that but he averages like 300 to 400 views per video. For 2k you would expect it to be somewhere along the lines of 800 to 1k views or higher.

Agreed, should be lowered, and views with subscribers should also be counted as Brick said.<br>You can always get a certain amount of subs, but once a majority of them are inactive, you aren't doing much of a difference then others with that same amount of views with a lower subscriber count.

For me it's just certain videos that get 200 views or so..<br>For example most of my Nebula videos get 300+ views<br><br>Also there are a ton of bigger YouTubers who have way less views than they have subs<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/LittleLizardGaming/videos" rel="nofollow" title="Link: https://www.youtube.com/user/LittleLizardGaming/videos">Example1</a><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheAtlanticCraft/videos" rel="nofollow" title="Link: https://www.youtube.com/user/TheAtlanticCraft/videos">Example2</a><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/iBallisticSquid/videos" rel="nofollow" title="Link: https://www.youtube.com/user/iBallisticSquid/videos">Example3</a><br>Etc..<br>But yeah I get what you're saying... but still Avicus is a relatively smaller server and the amount of views I get on each video is always more than how many players are even on avicus at a time.

I just like having something to aim for. I don't know, it's just something that would probably want me to make me do more videos on the server.<br><br>I don't know if you think the same way; everyone has a different reason though and that's mine.

I think staff decided on making the rank 2k subs or something like that, but I don't know where that went. Might have to ask an Admin about it.

I didn't say I was the most active. What I meant was out of the relatively bigger ones I am probably the most active (<a href="https://avicus.net/woofless" rel="nofollow">example</a>).<br><br>Also just because you're at 300 (congrats on that by the way :P) doesn't mean you don't deserve it. You also make content for Avicus and I think that's great!

I think this is a good idea because I don't think that that many people would be able to subscribe from Avicus, unless people that don't play Avicus. For example Ocn people or just other people that watch youtube might just like your channel.

Yeah I think it should be lowered, or else there really isn't much point in having it considering there's no one close to 10k. Other than porky, I don't even know who the "big" avicus youtubers are... it would be good to have that just to know.

Yeah you haven't been here for a long time but basically at this point, I actually think you're one of the bigger ones too. Most Avicus youtubers have a couple hundred subs.
