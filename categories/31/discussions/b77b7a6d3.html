<i>I just thought I'd publicise it on the forums as a lot of people don't know about this.<br></i><b><br></b><b>Recently, Avicus just released it's new voting system! You simply vote for the server each 24 hours, and each time you vote you can redeem 28XP levels for the minigame of your choice. To redeem it, simply hop onto the server after voting (it can take some time for your vote to register, so be patient!) and you should have an emerald in your hand. Right click it, and a submenu will come up, just click on the item that represents the minigame of your choice and you will automatically recieve the 28XP levels!</b><b></b><i><br><br>Here is the link to vote:&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://avicus.net/vote">http://avicus.net/vote</a><br>Hope this helped a bit for some people!</i>

hi guys I am back and&nbsp; I have a little bit to say. I haven't been on the computer and avicus much in the last week because I was banned from the computer so I have missed some of what has been happening but I open up minecraft and see the avicus server with the MOTD at the top of the multiplayer screen. and what does it say? Vote for Free XP!<br>I was just like No, just no. <br><span>I understand you want to reward people, but do Prestiges not matter anymore? I understand that you want to promote the server and you want to reward people for it, but isn't 28 XP a bit steep? Isn't&nbsp; it a bit too much? maybe give a free kit or 10 points to spend in game and like 10 XP also or 5. but 28XP is 28 kills. <b>28 </b>kills. if you gave them 10 in game points or something that would be so much easier and they could buy stuff in game and get legit kills. now what about Nexus, people are just going to be levelling up really easily at the start and i understand that the higher levels you get the less the xp really matter but even then... i don't know. just some suggestions and feedback.</span><br><span>banway out.<b></b></span>

Yea, I understand your opinion, but it needs to be rewarding enough for people to put the effort to vote, or want to vote. :)

<span>Um, banway 28 exp in nebula for non donators is 14 kills, not 28.<br>As for nexus? I dont even think you'll even get to level 2 with 28 xp.<br><br>Personally, i love the voting system, we're already in the mid-40's on the server list, which is great! I also believe that 28, is fine.. Hell, it used to be 35 and i was fine with that.<br><br><br></span>

Let's say I just joined Avicus. I wouldn't have ANY kits, whatsoever. The donors and players who play non-stop already have a HUGE advantage. <br>Nexus is unbalanced; players who unlock Scout become OP compared to new players. It just gives players a boost, if you know what I'm saying.

I have started voting because avicus deserves to be popular, not just for the 28 xp.<br>
