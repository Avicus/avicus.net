Thank you. There have been complaints about every single little thing... Also, when players say "the community is bad." Who do you think the community is? You, the players. Don't blame&nbsp;<i>everything&nbsp;</i>on the staff team. Also, don't go around saying stuff about the staff team, because if you haven't been staff you wouldn't understand out point-of-view. We've been both staff and players, so we can see both sides. And quite frankly, some staff haven't retired because of school. It's because they kept getting harassed by players.
