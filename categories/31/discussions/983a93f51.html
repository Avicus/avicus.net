Well, we have kinda made a "thank you", but I thought that I'd make a bigger one.&nbsp;<br><br><b>The Players -&nbsp;</b><b></b>Even though there were lots of no-shows and DQ's [Dairy Queens ;)], we still "love" you guys. Without all of you, this tournament would not have even started.<br><br><b>Kylo -&nbsp;</b>You made the tourney plugin. Not one problem with it. We really couldn't of have the tournament without your plugin. You're awesome.<br><br><b>The Event Staff Team -&nbsp;</b>More the referees 'cause we officials suck ;). But really, thank you to all the referees. We needed you guys, and you guys were always there to help. This tourney would really suck without you. Officials, well, ya know.&nbsp;<br><br><b>The Streamers -&nbsp;</b>First off, thank you to Jozz for organizing the streamers. The first week was a little bumpy, but in the end, it turned out pretty good. Thank you, streamers for giving up your time, and some of your computer storage to record/stream the tournament.<br><br>Well, I'm not the best writer, but I think this "Thank You" was a necessity. I really hope I see all of you, and more, for the next tournament. :D
