I'm sorry for being a stupid troll on the forums, it was really immature of me to do that. However, I didn't mean to harass the staff in anyway (you know who you are), I was just joking around. I'm sorry if I've hurt anyone else's feelings (other then the staff) and I'll try to keep my trolling to a minimum on the forums (unless it's a person who knows I'm joking lol.) Anyways I just wanted to clear that up and I hope everything is fine with you all.<br><br><br><b>Shoutouts:</b> -<b>&nbsp;</b>RefuseToThink for forgiving me even after what I did.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - JuanoMC for forgiving me after creating replies containing lots of hatred and making &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; him look bad.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - All Staff Members for treating me nicely even after my tempban.<br><br>Sorry if I missed anyone (you know who you are)<br><br>~ Sincerly Spladeâ˜»

I'm going to say what I say to all apology threads. I cannot accept the apology unless I see proper change. If we don't see change well then all this is words on an Internet forum. I'm not going to pile on much more but you did come off as a bit of a smartass. I hope you will prove but will not accept this apology until you do improve.<br><br>&nbsp;Also the only person that determines the jokiness of a joke is the person on the receiving end.

Can we just give him a clean slate and move on? If he starts acting dumb, you can hate him for it. But I think we should all just leave our opinions behind until he shows if he has changed. In a week, you can think what ever the hell you want about him.
