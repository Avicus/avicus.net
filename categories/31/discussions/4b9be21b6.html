If you have the same IP address, you can only vote once. I have two computers and can only vote once per day on only one. The other has the same ip so every time I switch over and try it tells me I have voted. This is the same with mobile devices.

Did you get the xp from yesterday?<br>If yes:try voting again, if it denies you again, try empting your cache, restarting your browser and trying again, if it still doesn't.. I guess you'll still have to wait D:<br>If no: look for two emeralds in your hub inventory
