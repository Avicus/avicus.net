Well, many servers have an option when you join to use their resource pack and I think it would be great if avicus used one.&nbsp;<br>They could use it to customise things like the in-game shops or kit selectors.&nbsp;<br>The pack would be chosen by managers+ &nbsp;and would most likely be a simple one.&nbsp;<br><br>This idea is not complete and is just a recommendation as of now. Please leave any&nbsp;<b>constructive</b> feedback or criticism ^_-

I would recommend if this come true using as a base Mapple Pack, its very simple clean and great for PvP

It's a nice idea but what if people don't want to use the pack? Then the customised items wouldn't work.<br><br>&nbsp;I personally only use 1 texture pack and only plan on using it. Good intentions but I don't think people would buy into this.

Servers have their own resource packs for servers for their custom textures

-1 this could resort to lag and this can cause a flame war in which texture pack

I don't really feel like it's needed. Default is fine and if people don't like it they can change their resource pack manually.
