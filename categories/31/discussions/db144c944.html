*&nbsp;I grew up among violence and threats, mostly directed at me.<br><br>* I don't like people, I just can't stand anyone. I think it is mainly because of the violence and my trust issues.&nbsp;<br><br>* I have a secret crush on DGB, hahahaha.<br><br>* When people, mainly on Avicus, argue about cps, 1v1, kohi and so on I giggle because it is amusing as fudge to know how people waste their time.

Tbh thats a really good texture pack.<br><br>Wanna make one together one time? I havent made much resource packs but I value quality and originality over quantity.<br><br>Every pack I make takes about 3-4 months, I can show you my first pack, its not as good as what I make now, but its really good. I had been making it for about 6-7 months, but my custom textures werent as good, since I used nova skin. I could link you to my private resource pack (soon to be released, hype!)

1. My height is almost 3 times my weight (I am almost 170 cm and way 60kg)<br>2. I am an all-rounder achiever at academics<br>3. (Possibly true) Some people say that I was smarter than my prep/first year at school teacher<br>4. When I was 6 I scored over 50 goals in my soccer season, including 6 in the first game(5 for our team, one for their team)<br>5. 3 years later I scored 6 goals in 1 game again, but all for my team including a free kick and a weak foot from a tight angle

<b>Very rarely</b> does anything like that happen. I've been playing rugby at my school for 3 years now (A's, A's then B's) and the worst thing that happened to someone was that they got mildly concussed.
