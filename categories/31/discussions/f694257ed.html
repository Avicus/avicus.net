Well it's been a good run on this server. It's time for me to move on. You will see me always on AU Kohi but not on Avicus anymore. I haven't really been playing much and I am losing interest. I don't know if it's considered spam,( this post). &nbsp;I will be thanking people over Skype for their contribution to me on avicus. BALLZI out.
