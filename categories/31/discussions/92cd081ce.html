Hello all,<br>This thread will contain very quick information what the administrative and the senior staff have in stall for Avicus for the coming weeks and months. With my re-promotion to admin, I feel like it's necessary to state my goals and focuses too! =)<br><br>Firstly, I can safely say that Mango and I have our minds set to improving the community &gt; staff relations, further developing stable moderators and senior moderators alike with the priority of ensuring the staff teams capabilities are greatly enhanced, remodeled and (heavily) revised. So far, we've tightened the policies and focused on cracking down on some serious issues internally. (see below).<br><br>Earlier, an updated version of the Code of Conduct for staff members was announced. It is designed to be easily understood, with little to no flexibility (allowing a much more structured staff system). Don't worry, it <u>is</u>&nbsp;going to be enforced unlike past months...&nbsp;<br>Alongside the new/updated policy, comes an organised (new) warning system. It consists of implemented 3 tiered warnings; depending on the severity. (LOW = 1 point, MEDIUM = 2 points and HIGH = 3 points). All staff members start with 4 points, and for example a moderator receives 2 point warn (MEDIUM), that member would have 2 points left. A staff member will be demoted as soon as they hit 0 points. However, instant demotions will still take place under certain circumstances.<br><br>Additionally, Mango and I plan to work closely with the senior moderators to pump out monthly updates (video and/or text form) to guarantee as much transparency as possible. We want to repair the relationship between the community and the staff by hopefully preventing and eliminating secrecy among the team. Then, we can focus on community events. This doesn't mean tournaments, but something like giveaways, parties and celebrations so everyone is involved!&nbsp;<br><br>Thanks for reading,<br>Administrator &amp; Senior Moderator Team

I like the new idea of the points system for the staff team. Also, I do follow the Avicus Facebook page and try to reply and read as many posts as possible, will this be included as to where the updates are coming from?&nbsp;<br><br>I also LOVE the idea of giveaways, maybe once every few months there could be a competition to see who can destroy X amount of Monuments or get X amount of credits within a certain time and then win a free 1/2 month rank! Parties sound cool too!&nbsp;<br><br>Thanks for letting us know! :)
