Ok, so all the most of the community is doing is hating, I'm guilty of this, but I've explained such actions to one staff member over Skype.&nbsp;<br><br>I'd like to thank the staff team for putting up with all this shit and still trying as hard as you can to improve. The community doesn't see what happens behind the scenes as much, I've been rash and insulted such staff, but I do see the potential in the server, and I wish the best for Avi, sometimes I just get carried away. Backlash I cause is mainly trying to help staff and improve the server.&nbsp;<br><br>Ik I should apologize for throwing the staff under the bus so much, as all are amazing people and are great to be around. Even if hack detection Isn't their strong suit, at least we have nice friendly mods who care about the server, and this has been shown to me. It's hard to see from a community standpoint, but yeah. We tend to throw the staff under the bus so much instead of giving them support that would be helpful to boost morale. Like, there are so many servers where the staff don't care. I understand that some things are long past due, and that if definitely annoying, but you can't say anything until you've seen both sides.<br><br>I'm no staff fanboy or tryhard, nor was I forced to make this. I infact find some people with such characteristics annoying, not all though.&nbsp;<br><br>And I get it's annoying as a community member, but how would you feel if all someone did was shit in your face about the work you put in and not give much help or suggestions?&nbsp;<br><br>I'm not saying "staff are amazing!!" "they're so cool!" but I think they deserve an apology for all the shit we put them through daily.&nbsp;<br><br>But seriously, we can do better than just sitting there and whining all day, lol. We all want more, all may not be the best, but at least appreciate what we have. &nbsp;<br><br>I feel the staff don't get enough of this and things like this should be said more. I've stated the issues I have with the staff team, now why not be a little positive for once?

As a previous and current community member and a previous staff member I know both sides are to blame. I felt the staff did fine before but the community helped me see that the staff have room for improvement. That being said there was a lot of shit thrown at the staff that wasn't needed or true. Yet even then it's hard for the community to judge the staff because they don't have as good of an idea of how the mods work. Most people only have limited info on which to judge mods, and it's not their fault if they get a bad assumption.

Ok, let's re-discuss the points mentioned ^.^<br>First of all, I would like to apologize too as it's partially my fault as well, why?, well first of all for my negativity this days, it's not like, "negativity" really, it's just the way I say things (Honestly and straight throught) so basically all I was doing was giving my honest opinion about the topics that caused some sort of "revolution" (Community vs staff), HOWEVER, that's not an excuse for the answers i've given to several staff members like Fluenza, Snow, Peachy and some others, I can go on with the list but they're too many. I'm really sorry about this and i'll try my best to fix this with positive attitude and feedback on every post in the forums and in every match in the server. I've seen both sides of the trouble, as a previous staff member, I know the hard work the staff team is doing and I know all the hard work they're doing and they will do in the future so I think it's really hard for them going throught this :/, know as a community member currently, I know how me and the rest are mad because of the false bans but you're right, you try hard with the reports and you can make mistakes as well, no one is perfect after all haha!<br>That's all I have to say about that, now with the rest of topics, Shadow/Stimulating clearly explained them so there isn't much to say more than a thanks for not being assholes that don't care about their own server like the crappy staff team Kohi has right now ;D For now, that's all I need to say, hope you forgive me too :^)

Why can't you just accept his apology and act like a moderator?&nbsp;<br><br>The reason most people don't listen to you, is exactly, because you just keep on telling everyone the same thing.

I kind Of Agree And Disagree.Staff need to get rid of some mods , Honestly.But &nbsp;i Do mostly agree.There have been some &nbsp;Trolling Mods,We need to get rid of them and replace them.i think we should shut down the server for a day and Get rid of all mods and Make everyone And new people Who want to apply can apply again.<br><u></u>

You're accusing them of leaking information, I think evidence is needed for this as you can't accuse someone for something just with words. This can help resolving the trouble faster as well.

ALSO, if you think a mod did something with this amount of severity, I highly suggest you to talk to a Sr or an Admin in TS or Skype to complain, the forums are not the place for this.<br>Also make sure to provide evidence and don't be an ass and deny everything, you're doing wrong here by doing this too.

Ok, ok. I'm sure this will be brought up in the staff meeting. However, staff members are reflecting on their flaws and making changes to themselves, they don't need to be spoon-feeded every step of the way, which is exactly what you're doing. I suggest you wait a week or so, and then state your opinions, at least give us more than 1 day to change. Thanks. ;)

I'm actually trying to discuss like a normal person until someone got butthurt, you should re-read my post where I said "I don't think we'll see a difference, to be honest".

Thanks for making this post, Shadow. It takes a lot of maturity to do something like this. As staff, we are trying to be the best we can be, and the new staff are still getting used to things, which is why some things may not be consistent, and the older staff still make mistakes, because we're humans and we weren't manufactured to be perfect. <br>And also, I'm not trying to throw the new staff under the bus and blame our mistakes on them. We've all been making mistakes.<br><b>Much love&lt;33</b>

Why would you need the evidence when I've already contacted the concerning staff? I don't understand why would post my name too, when I clearly said in my post I don't want it to be revealed. "No-one cares for your stupid half-hearted complaints", I didn't expect a moderator to respond like that.

Why would you be scared of a player on a pixel-game? I told you, I have nothing more to say to you. And yes, the conversations will stay with <b><u>me</u></b>.

Guys, stop.<br>Your endless bickering isn't doing anything to contribute to this thread. &nbsp;I know you have Skype, so please, keep this off the forums. &nbsp;Nobody wants to see it, and you're just making a show.<br><br>Anyways, thanks for making this Stimulating, it's good to go on the forums and see something positive.

Thank you for this, as almost everyone has stated; it takes some maturity and courage to do this. Yes, we are all not perfect. And me myself, being new to the staff team, I'm still getting used to a few things. So I'd like to apologize in advance if I make any mistakes. But thank you for this.

eh?<br>I'm not entirely sure if I'm reading you right, but i meant that I wasn't trying to bicker but set him straight. He's still learning and the better he learns now than from doing similar in a much worse situation.

Both you and me know it's a lie, someone did leak information to you. <span>Oddly enough the same time as all Ambivalence_'s friends started to spam my "LFT" post with my name when <b><u>only</u></b> Jozz knew who I am. It is a coincidence, isn't it? ;) <br></span>

<br>Ambi said "What position are you willing to play?" You responded 
with "That's an unnecessary post, you know that I won't join your team."
 (or something like it) It wasn't unnecessary at all. Maybe other teams 
may need this information? <br>Oh, I also haven't spoken to ambivalence_ in like 4 weeks. <br><br>By the way, nobody has leaked information about your name to me. I just did some research. ;'&gt;)

Holy... the amount of saltiness from both parties is just disgusting. I never expected this to escalate into a fight, but please use Skype to come to an agreement.<br>Can we all please just stop? Otherwise I'll lock the thread.<br><br>Report staff members to the senior staff.
