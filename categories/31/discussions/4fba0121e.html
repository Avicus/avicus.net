<b>The mentors</b> are a group <b>reestablished and refined</b> for the purpose of<b> </b>helping the admins and seniors manage junior moderators, and, at times, moderators. The mentors are defined to help tutor, answer questions, give feedback, fill out spreadsheets, help with decisions, formulate responses, and be involved with anything they're assigned to work with. &nbsp;The mentor system currently has no cap/limit to how many can mentor, however it's a selective group. Only those handpicked from other mentors and seniors may appoint them.<br><br><b>What did the old mentor system do?</b><br>The old mentor system just basically gave every moderator a mentor position when they were promoted. This is seen as a disorganized move, considering that a lot of them lacked experience to help each other out properly. The old mentors had even less of a role, and they were disbanded for further renovation. As the system is currently stabilized, I am here to announce the new one.<br><br><b>Where did the old mentors go?</b><br>The mentors that did not exceed our expectations were demoted. We still have mentors from the old batch, however we want strong mentors that are teachers and can describe themselves as helpful, motivated, and able to afford putting forward time to assist others. The old mentors are still able to be reconsidered: if they prove themselves, we may appoint them.<br><br><b>How does the mentoring system work?</b><br>We appoint mentors singularly and not in batches. There is currently no training for mentors, except documents/presentations that they read off and elaborate on when necessary. We also have had a few other documents in the works to bump up staff quality that are possible to be released! When a junior moderator completes their interview or completes their trial, they will be presented with any available mentors to train them. When they are finished being mentored as a junior, they are allowed to moderate the server.<br><br><b>Is there a central mentor manager?</b><br>Yes! With senior departments (soon to be announced), the current manager for mentors is GrapeSmoothie. If GrapeSmoothie is not available (on leave) or if you have complaints, you can forward it to MidnightBeats or ViceWatercolour.<br><br><b>What is the demotion process for a mentor?</b><br>A mentor can be demoted on vote of the seniors/admins.<br><br><b>Can a player/non staff member be a mentor?</b><br>No, as there is certain sensitive information that cannot be trusted in other's eyes. We may allow people from time to time from the community help us assess staff, but for now it is not under consideration.<br><br><b>Does this mean moderators can't help each other?</b><br>No! Of course they can help each other. Mentors are just a designated role for it, they are expected to be more knowledgeable. Nothing is stopping someone from asking a question to a moderator.<br><br><b>Do the officials/mapdevs/media have a mentor system?</b><br>As far as I am concerned, the mentoring system is for the moderating team only. We do not have any variations of implementations as in depth as ours on the staff team. This doesn't mean that any of the other staff groups, have training documents, however, just not set mentors.<br><br><b>Who are the server's mentors?</b><br>Currently, as this post:<br>- Iron (Promoted to Senior)<br>- Javipepe<br>- Fouled<br>- OscarElNana<br>- RavioliPvP<br>- Vinnx (Promoted to Senior)<br>- Arigenn (Promoted to Admin)<br>- PieZ<br>- Jiveh<br><br>If you have any further questions on the role, you may drop them down below and the mentors/seniors will answer them.

Much better than having literally every Moderator as a Mentor.
