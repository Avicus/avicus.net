</h1>
Event #4: This&nbsp;is the&nbsp;fourth official event on the Avicus Network, known as "Chamaeleon<span>" You are given some time to construct a map in&nbsp;the gamemode&nbsp;"Avicade" You have the choice of CaveIn,&nbsp;Chroma, Minotaur, OiTC, and Red Alert.There are a few rules however, but it should be fun for everyone!<br><br><br><br><span><u>Who are the judges?</u><br></span>TheHoopsman and Sethskye. The judges may change.<br><br><span><u>What are the rules?</u><br></span>You have to follow these rules or your map will be rejected.<br>- You may not have more than 3 authors.<br>- You may not produce maps for&nbsp;any minigame &nbsp;with the exception of Avicade. This contest will hopefully encourage people to start producing maps for Avicade in the future!<br>- You may not submit more than 2 maps for this contest.<br><br></span><span><u>What are the guidelines?</u><br></span>Maps are judged in the following aspects;<br>-&nbsp;<i>Gameplay</i>&nbsp;(How do you think the map will play on the servers?)<br>-&nbsp;<i>Aesthetics</i>&nbsp;(How pleasing to the eye does it look?)<br>-&nbsp;<i>Creativity&nbsp;</i>(Is it unique and really stands out?)<br><br>YAML will be done by a map developer if you wish, and it will not count against you. We're all here to help!<br><br><span><u>What gamemodes can I do?</u><br></span>You can do anything possible within YAML as long as it is for Avicade. <br><br><span><u>How do I submit my map?</u><br></span>Put a [CONTEST] tag in the title. By doing so, you are entered into the contest and put into a spreadsheet. It contains the map name, authors, thread link, jurisdiction of approval/denial, and it's gamemode. All&nbsp;maps are eligible to be in this contest. You have the permission to post your thread link in the post below so I can see it easier.<br><br>1.&nbsp;Do not give inconstructive feedback&nbsp;by knocking others down to build yourself up.<br>2.&nbsp;Do not steal maps; all maps are your property.&nbsp;Violations of this are a perma ban.<br>3.&nbsp;Do not ghost produce;&nbsp;don't have other users make a map for you and you take credit.<br>4.&nbsp;Do not spam judges;&nbsp;patience is a large key. Wait for a response on your map.<br>5.&nbsp;Do not ghost view;&nbsp;don't tally a ton of thread views in your thread for attention.<br>6.&nbsp;Do not make joke maps;&nbsp;all maps must be true submissions to the server.<br>7.&nbsp;Do not submit maps made prior to this;&nbsp;all maps must be "newly produced".<br>8.&nbsp;Always give credit.<span>&nbsp;No matter what the case, credit everyone who authored.<br></span><br><span><u>How can I create YAML?</u><br></span><span>Use our documentation resource at docs.avicus.net.<br></span><br><span><u>What is the prize?</u><br></span>This will most likely be a certain amount of XP, but we are unsure and need to discuss it further.<br><br><span><u>Is the spreadsheet public?</u><br></span>Yes!&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a9CYPRvSxJWrkJiugM7Hl3dlCmi6M5iwYG-xU5dhK0w/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a9CYPRvSxJWrkJiugM7Hl3dlCmi6M5iwYG-xU5dhK0w/edit?usp=sharing</a><br>&nbsp;<br>PREVIOUS EVENT<br>NEXT EVENT<br><br>Starts;&nbsp;December 2nd<i>, 2014</i><br>Ends;&nbsp;<i>December 16th, 2014</i>

</blockquote>
</div>
When making a Chroma map, always use Quartz blocks. The game doesn't work without them.&nbsp;<br><br>CaveIn is pretty much a parkour type mini game where blocks are falling from the roof and you have to be the first to the top.

Chroma is where you gain a feather (brush) and you have to paint the entire map most of your color before time runs out. PvP is enabled so you can knock the other player out of the world, and there are powerups that fall occasionally for you to use such as glue to stick a player down to where he can't move, and so forth it is supposed to have 4 teams, and for the maps to be decently sized<br></span><span><br>Thanks Para!</span></span></span>
