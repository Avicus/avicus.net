Hey everyone, I'm just kinda confused and upset at the moment :(<br>WHY in the world is the level of people leaving Avicus skyrocketing???<br>I don't see anything WRONG with Avicus, and i understand there are personal reasons that people leave, but why so MANY?<br><br>It's really beginning to depress me, people i admire and occasionally people i know just leave out of the blue! I'm completely into Avicus and am doing YouTube with it too, and I've been here 7 months, and am not bored or anything! Infact, I'm beginning to think of suggesting to the staff to make a forums page called "Leaving Posts" or something :(<br><br>I dunno guys, i just feel bemused at the moment...

Summer in North America is ending soon, so that's most likely why.

I think a goodbye page in the forums is actually a great idea :D

The majority of them leave due to personal reasons. It's out of Avicus control.<br><br>The North American school system is starting soon as well. Most people would like to focus on school work.

We should make a global "Im leaving" post and let people post their names when they leave.

Yea then the forums could be focused less on goodbye posts and more on helping the server improve.
