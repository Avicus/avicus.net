Hello everyone! Over the next few months I'll be interviewing different members of the staff and publishing the answers here on the admin blog for you all to learn more about the guys and girls who manage the Avicus Network.<br><b><br></b>Today our staff spotlight is on&nbsp;<b>awesome_apricot </b>who joined the team five months ago.&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;<br></b><b><br>1. What is your username in minecraft and what is your favorite game on Avicus?&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"awesome_apricot" - came out of nowhere, really. Just sat there, on the sofa, laptop on my…Um, lap... And thinking of funny, random usernames for the game my group of friends had been hyped about. My favourite game on Avicus has to be Nebula. Just. So. Much. Funzz. I also really enjoy Nexus. Maybe not so much now it's all revamped, I'm a bit of a classic person, I loved Nexus with just the 3 regular kits. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b><br>2. What are you most excited/obsessed over at the moment?&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Right now, I am excited for the new rugby season to start, gonna be a corker! :D My team has won our county cup 2 years in a row prior to last year, and we're eager to et it back. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b><br>3. Where are you from?&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>I live in the tea filled, grumpy old people filled, mardy, moody, weirdly filled: England! :D &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b><br>4. Are you in school, or do you have a job?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>I am in year 11, for all of you English people - I'm 15 years old if you want to translate that to your country's educational system. I also have a job, but too much info, man, too much! XD &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b><br>5. Who or what inspires you the most in your life?&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>My dad. Awesome, funny, random bloke, who I spend a lot of time with. Supports me no matter the cost or time. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b><br>6. How do you contribute to the Avicus as a staff member?&nbsp;</b><b>&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;<br><br>I generally try to do reports most of the time, and if I'm not - I'm playing with players, speaking to them, having a bit of banter (ofc ^_^). I enjoy attending o reports, banning hax0rs and sorting out any issues that happen to arise. &nbsp;<br><b><br>7. What are the most common questions you get asked while moderating or managing?&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"Mr mod can i hve OP pls i hve mi own srver ill wrek u 1v1 ya" - just kidding XD, mostly that though, to be fair, however it is quite funny when people ask you why their hacks "aren't working"... &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b><br></b>Hope y'all enjoyed!&nbsp;Peace!

I like this. It would be cool to have a sign up sheet for all users to do it, that is if u have the time to do it.

Nah just for staff, sorry, it'd be too much if we were posting about every user. Plus a lot of people would get bored of it. If you want to post something about yourself, do an AMA in the introduce yourself section of the forums.
