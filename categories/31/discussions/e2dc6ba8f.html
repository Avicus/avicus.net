Server isn't encountering lag. It's on your end unfortunately, DarkArcher810. It's unlikely that it is AntiCheat as we've toned it down so that it does not interfere with gameplay. If it does, then again, it's likely a poor ping or connection to the server on your end.

Yesterday the server crashed 4 times within 2 hours and there was serious pause lag. I'm finding that the lag is coming from the server, not me...

Must have a bad ping. I've never had lag since Avicore came out, just fps lag.
