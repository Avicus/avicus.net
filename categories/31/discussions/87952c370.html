Hello, am Cord.<br><br>Since we are allowing people to do community events I wanted to put my hand into this. So I have decided to do a classic to The Avicus Network and do a walls event. There will be 2 separate&nbsp;times for this event so we are able to appeal to EU and NA players. Here is a quick schedule:<br><br>3:00PM EST*<br>Hawaii<br>Mt. Blizzard<br>Lands<br>*You guys pick and I will XML it.*<br><br>6:00PM EST*<br>Garden<br>Wild West<br>Mini Walls<br>*You guys pick and I will XML it.*<br><br>*Times may be changed or even date depending on the next week. Wednesday will have the final date and time. Please put suggestions or state if you are coming. Chill on Teamspeak with other members and make this how you want to make it.&nbsp;<br>Am tryharding&nbsp;for Jr. Mod &gt;.&gt;

Oo add Village to the NA maps and remove Hawaii. &lt;3<br><br>Hawaii is a map that takes 3 minutes to be ready on if you're alone or with one teammate. <br>On Village it takes some more time and knowledge of the map, as well as the different strategies.&nbsp;<br><br>Also a suggestion and also a slight demand: Please make height limits higher. Skybases used to be a huge part of Walls because they are fun, it's a new strategy and it requires different strategies to take down based on who is in the base, the type of base, and what the person has. Half the reason Walls died before was the removal of skybases.

The challenge right now is making the regions for the height limit&nbsp;well so that they don't break the gameplay(Jumping over walls). I have some ideas on what to use XML-wise to counter this but I do not know if I will have this issue fixed by Friday.

You can raise the height limit but have different regions preventing people from going over the walls.<br><br>Or, you could make the walls higher.

also remember to fix the regions on walls maps so you can't get past the walls early<br>you can block up and go on the outer walls on like pretty much any map and get to mid/other team's bases<br><br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/w7JOgqd.png" title="Image: http://i.imgur.com/w7JOgqd.png"><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/qQwBBMS.jpg" title="Image: http://i.imgur.com/qQwBBMS.jpg"><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/gscBSFh.png">
