Alright, first of all. I take&nbsp;<i><b>a lot</b>&nbsp;</i>of risk making this topic. But this has been a subject in my mind for awhile. Do not take it personally.<br><br>I just want to address the issue with the community. <b>I warn again, p</b><b>lease... do not... take this personallllllyyy....<br></b><br>If I call out any names then it isn't to shame, but to address a situation. And plus, everybody looks at who's been<a class="yjlxgoqe" href="#49330814" title="Click to Continue > by coupcoup"> promoted<img src="https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"></a> so if you feel ashamed then so be it. A post was already made about you so everybody pretty much knows.<br><br>Whenever I do these things, it is not with the intent to harm. It is with the intent to address a problem&nbsp;<b>as neutrally and non-aggressively as possible. If i accidentally offend someone by making an obvious suggestion (Sorry guy) then I edit it out... well try to before it gets locked.</b><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><div>This has been a frustrating issue for over awhile now. I've noticed that the MapDevs are sort of biased when selecting new ones. It isn't fair.</div><div><br></div><div>I will give well-founded reasons as to why i find that they are biased.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>When the Senior moderators were promoted to mapdev rank i found that it was mostly unfounded because a lot of them that WERE selected have little experience when making maps.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Merlinmaster among them however, is a sound exception as he is a very good and long-time map maker. Hell, i wondered why he wasn't promoted sooner...</div><div><br></div><div>Secondly, a lot of them were taught how to do githhub, if that is the case why not teach the rest of us map makers who do not know how to do githhub? Do you see what I'm saying?</div><div><br></div><div>Now, please take this into consideration as I have watched this progress over span of my 1/4 of my time in map making.</div><div><br></div><div>Recently, a new rank is made out in the<a class="yjlxgoqe" href="#29266332" title="Click to Continue > by coupcoup"> open<img src="https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"></a>: Jr. MapDev. If they feel as if i do not deserve MapDev yet (Which I am sure I do) then atleast make me Jr. MapDev. However, making me Jr. MapDev is not warranted as I have an exceptionally long time in map making.</div><div><br></div><div>I see people who have less experience in mapmaking than me getting MapDev. It is frustrating and quite demoralizing. I feel neglected and ignored.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It isn't fair.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;I am not angry at any of them, in fact some were good choices like Hacktivism AKA JKawesome, he is quite active and i can find a ready response from him on skype whenever<a class="yjlxgoqe" href="#58483916" title="Click to Continue > by coupcoup"> available<img src="https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"></a>. He helped me work out my EridaniCTW YML of which i am very grateful for.</div><div><br></div><div>But then, there are the completely nerve grinding choices. This one the most shocking.<br><br>The promotion of triplezko, he made only one map for Avicus as a whole and one YML. I feel that this should not warrant a promotion; recognition but not a promotion.<br><br>Then another MapDev was promoted for the exact same reason i should have been. He is a great person and I believe that he'd do good &nbsp;*Winks at Robin_DD_J* however, if one is to be promoted for this reason why shouldn't I?</div><div><br></div><div>I remember asking Kylo when he was FunkyStudious if I could make maps for the server.</div><div><br></div><div>He made a smiley emote and said "Of course"&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>So from then on I went into mapmaking. This was in 2013. My first map being "Dreadnought Wars" which was a grade-A piece of crap i admit *Winks*<br><br>However, my second map: Coup de'tat was beautiful, it had a solid platform behind it and it was well accepted among members back in Old Avicus. Then from then on, my maps grow better and my YML started to actually work mostly properly. I worked with MapDevs and other people to improve my skills in coding. <br><br>Especially since I want to be a Game designer myself and this could help go onto my resume as experience. Im in the 11th grade and college and my future is a constant burden on my mind.</div><div><br></div><div>I do not want MapDev to mess around with commands or to troll the Repository... I want it....</div><div><br></div><div>To Help The Server. If i ever got MapDev, I was gonna do my best to build morale of Avicus map makers.... I was gonna help people with their YMLs and host weekly map testing<a class="yjlxgoqe" href="#97302315" title="Click to Continue > by coupcoup"> events<img src="https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png" title="Image: https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"></a> to make map builders WANT to make maps and attract a lot of attention from other servers possibly.</div><div><br></div><div>But it is sad that that vision is blurring and phasing out. At this point, I feel so disgruntled to even make a map for Avicus much anymore. Most people here notice how frequently i used to make and post maps for Avicus; excited to get responses and feedback--what should I keep, what should I improve? What should I get rid of?<br><br>It was all so invigorating and satisfying. I was certain back then that I was on the right path to getting MapDev.</div><div><br></div><div>My recent one, [CTW] Karthorne was<a class="yjlxgoqe" href="#79450339" title="Click to Continue > by coupcoup"> denied<img src="https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png" title="Image: https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"></a>. I made it with LeCobalt and we put in a lot of hard work into the map.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>And what caused me to go here and type up this message as if it were a Thematic<a class="yjlxgoqe" href="#584467" title="Click to Continue > by coupcoup"> Essay<img src="https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png" title="Image: https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"></a> is to find that a map called [DTM] Bermuda was accepted yet it was longer than my map... made by a certain Senior Moderator... (I am not hating, im just pointing out the facts)<br><br>CTW Karthorne is doing quite well on OCN though. MapDevs there are gonna test it within this week--hopefully.</div><div><br></div><div>It makes me sad to see people who have less experience than me getting MapDev. I'm one of the few Veterans. <br><br>Eric among the people who needs MapDev, he is a hard worker and persistent map builder. Despite his infractions, I believe it should not conflict with his chances especially since he is trying to act better.<br><br><b>"I did my homework... now I feel that I... and a few others should be rewarded..."</b><br></div><br><b>Not a personal update but an issue within the server.</b>

Sorry if I seem blunt, but I fail to understand the creation of this post.<br><br>Darkye_ is in charge of the MapDev Teams' staffing, if you have an issue with our MapDevs, let him know instead of making a forum post. <br><br>To be totally honest, it really looks like you're proclaiming yourself and listing reasons on why you should be a MapDev.&nbsp;<br><br>That's just what I'm seeing here.

This has less to do with concerns and feedback and more to do with you complaining that you haven't received a Map Developer rank yet.<br><br>I don't see how this thread is needed on our forums.
