Maybe some people who live in the U.S. can meet up. there could be one for the East coast, Westcoast and Anywhere inbetween. If so, can there be like a legit Avicus meet up, not just some poorly thrown together thing. Maybe we could do one in New York and that would be really easy for me to make, cause i live in New York (not necessarily New York City)&nbsp;<br><br><br>Anyone else live In New York or somewhere close so it would be possible? Thanks for reading. Be sure to reply :D

I doubt this would happen for anyone, really .-.<br><br>All the past meetups kinda failed and just disappeared. Even if you are in the same city as someone it still would be difficult to see them IRL, especially with protective parents. &gt;.&gt;<br><br>Anywho.. I live in Virginia.

-1<br><br>Too difficult to coordinate, and, as Para said, there are conditions that apply to some people e.g. protective parents, school, etc
