Hey guys.<br>Just want to clear something up before I start.<br>I'm not leaving Avicus, I'm just retiring from my Moderator position.<br><br>I always knew right when I got promoted to Junior Moderator in January that I'd be retiring around December-February.<br>Going into this I knew that I was going to be Moderating while going through my last year of high school and I knew that at the end of the academic year (December ish) I'd most probably retire around that time because I'd no longer be at school anymore and I'd have to start thinking about what I was going to do with myself in the big wide world.<br><br>Unfortunately for me, I have to retire a little earlier than expected.<br><br>Here's the thing.<br>I recently got some of my grades back from school today and it wasn't pretty.<br>I have end of year exams in 6 weeks and I just can't keep spending 90% of my free time moderating anymore.<br>I have to focus on my studies now more than ever and I can't keep prioritising Avicus over School.<br><br>Trust me, this is as big of a surprise to me as it is to you.<br>I didn't plan on retiring today, it just kind of happened that way.<br><br>I really don't want to retire eh? Like, I really don't want to xD<br>But I just can't keep doing this. <br>I have to start thinking about my future.&nbsp;<br><br>Having said that, it really hurts to walk away from the staff team. From the guys who've grown with me over the months. But I know they'll still be bosses without me xD<br><br>I guess the one thing I regret is never being good enough to get into the Senior Staff team.<br>Despite how hard I worked, I was never up to par with the standards that was required.<br>My goal was to become a Senior Moderator before I retired and not reaching that goal kinda stings but hey, that's life.&nbsp;<br><i>Just to clarify, I never did anything with the intention of getting into the Senior Staff team, it was just something that I always aimed for.&nbsp;</i><br><br>This community is so cool, I've learnt a lot from you guys. <br>The combination of praise and criticism has been so beneficial for me. I've appreciated every word of it.<br><br>I was a staff member for just over 8 months (245 days)<br>I was a Junior Moderator for 20 days&nbsp;<br>I was a Moderator for 225 days.&nbsp;<br><br>I'm so proud of the staff team and how far it's come since I started.<br>I've seen a lot of people come and go during my time as staff and I can say that the improvements that are being made and that will be made will truly change the staff team for the better. <br><br>I couldn't be more proud at how far this team has come.<br><br>I'm not going to thank anyone specific, I'll save that for my leaving thread whenever that comes up (not soon :P)<br>But you know who you are ;) Thank you. For everything.<br><br>There have been a lot of ups and downs during my nearly 8 month stint but I can confidently say that this has truly been the most coolest experience I've ever had.<br><br>This experience has taught me a lot of things and has definitely given me a confidence boost because believe it or not, I'm a very shy person IRL xD<br><br>So thank you for the most fun I've ever had on Minecraft.<br><br>I'll still be around, I just won't have that sexy red tag next to my name hahaha.<br><br>&lt;3

A'right, since I don't have the time to write a hugeass comment and, frankly, I want to save the best for your leave once the day comes, I'm just going to say this.<br><br>Hey, we may not have known eachother for a while, but I sure as hell remember you back when I started getting into the real jist of things relating to Avicus (Teamspeak activity, etc.) You were like a role model to me, mate, I'm not even kidding. Your dedication and initiation was on point. Plus, you were my most active mentor during my Jr. Mod days, and that meant a lot. You put up with everyone for so long, no matter how much they pestered you for simple mistakes or tested your patience. You made it to the end, mate.&nbsp;<br><br>That's all I have to say moderator wise. Much longer than expected, but trust me, once that leaving post comes, this'll be nothing compared to other things I have to say. ;)

Um, Where can I start.<br><br><br>First of all, I'm actually crying. I know it seems stupid to cry for a block game, but for me(call me whatever you want) its like seeing a brother passing away. Ever since i joined Avicus you've been my inspiration, not just inside Minecraft, also outside, just like a Older brother. I knew this day would come, but I didn't think it would be so soon. It just seems like yesterday when I was the one telling you to not MiniMod, when now i am the MiniMod. You know things that none of my family members know, and you treated me like I was your brother. It really sucks to see you go, but I do understand that School and your future isn't compatible with Minecraft.&nbsp;<br><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; "><br>He´ll look like a Normal Player, &nbsp;Well, He really is, But, Snow has something special.

<i>Very&nbsp;</i>sad to see you leave the staff team, Snow. I remember working with you back when we were staff together, you and I would&nbsp;<i>always</i> help each other. You were a&nbsp;<b>phenomenal&nbsp;</b>staff member, mad respect to you, sir. I wish you good luck in wherever life takes you. Thanks for everything man. :)

You were truly one of the best mods and my best friend, well you still are my best friend. Whether we were dealing with problems together or banning hackers together (or banning ourselves :P) we always had a blast. You were truly one of the best moderators, when i first joined the staff team you were a role model to me, i pretty much looked up to you throughout the first couple of months. Only recently i was questioning wether you were my role model or if i was your role model xD&nbsp;<br><br>Hopefully i will still see you ingame and on teamspeak as often as i did before and hopefully maybe in the future you may be able to return and continue to make a good impact on this wonderful community and hopefully we will still remain best buds :D
