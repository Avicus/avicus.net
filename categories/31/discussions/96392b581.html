Dear friends, family and all avicus users. (warning, long emotional post incoming)<br>Firstly, before I get into major detail, which I will. I want to explain what this post means to me, and what I hope it will mean to you. I am only 14, but I am heading into a point in my life where time isnt really...there.<br>I am going to enter a school for environmental studies, it is a dorm school and I will have access to my computer for about 3-5 hours every 2 weeks. That is approximately 12 minutes a day if you split it.<br>This means avicus is now out of my schedule......<br>I will have my phone to stay in touch, but playing isnt going to happen anymore. At all.<br>At least not for a few months till I can find a "solution"<br>This isnt a goodbye, but I wont be on almost at all, so this is a thank you.<br>I want you all to take this post into your lives and use what you can, learn from my mistakes and successes. Make yourselves better people threw my flaws.<br>I will do my best to name every person or group that has changed me for the better....and for the worse.<br>I will thank each and every one of those people, and from these stories, I want you to learn. This does not mean every person I have met, just those that I feel deserve recognition.<br><br>FightToWin: Fighttowin has been an inspiration to many, and he has to me as well, but what he said before he left....not only did it touch me right in the heart, but it also opened my eyes.<br>Games have been a big part of my life since I was 5(pokemon &lt;3), and they continue to be so, but so many people have said it is a waste and I dont get anything out of it. But I DO get stuff out of it. Being part of this community has given me the ability to talk publicly and organise events MUCH better than I used to. I know how to use google drive more than I should, and I have made so many friend who have helped me so much. I want to thank you though, for being an inspiration to everyone in this community.<br><br>TheDiamondGecko: If it werent for her I wouldnt be here, she was the one that brought me on to teamspeak and one thing let to another, and im here :D<br>Thank you for bringing me here tully!<br><br>The Sistahood: I want to go through every person in detail, and I will since this is one of my final large posts. I just want to thank this people though for helping me become who I am, an outgoing person in the community.<br><br>KooDaLord and TechFTW: These two were more or less my first friends. Koo was a random player, I was a random player, and together we formed the sistahood (we are the creators in case you didnt know). These two showed me what it is to go grand scale, to expand and to "Conquer" in a sense. We built maps together and enjoyed games of nebula. He was my first ever friend, and showed me what being part of a community was like. It brought me such joy, of likes I hadnt seen before. I cannot thank these two enough for being there for me when I needed them, I would also like to apologise for distancing myself from you two recently. Thank you Oh so much for everything you have done for me.<br><br>Howsie22 (aka my little joshy): Howsie I really have alot to thank you for. Firstly you always listen to my rants about everything and anything, and I always listen to yours. You have been like a big brother to me and jozz. I really enjoyed being your PA as you took me "under your wing" as they say. It was a real pleasure working closely with you and having a great time. Also, thank you for bringing ponies into my life, fluttershy is a real joy. Id really love to continue working with you if you allow me to, but with the little time i will have, it would be hard to get much done on my end. thank you for everything howsie, /) bronies for lyfe man.<br><br>Itzdylan115 (aka baily): baily has been a real joy to play with as he is a truly intellectual person.&nbsp;<br>he always looks out for me and makes sure I feel good 24/7. When I dont he feeds me trippa snippas and golden gaytimes. He always does what I want, even if he doesnt want to do it, just because of how caring he is. He is an extremely lovable character and without him things would have been pretty lonely at times. Thank you so much baily, Ily &lt;3&lt;3<br><br>Sweetmango: One of my greatest friends, and a person who looked up to me. I really appreciate all the times you have been there for me, and I want to thank you for all your sweetness and awesomeness. You have been there for me in my tough times and made my last year an interesting experience. I hope your adventure as a mod goes well :D. thank you so much!<br><br>Buster_U (hannah): Hannah was also one of my first friends on avicus, but she never talked when she started playing, one fine day I asked her why, and she didnt give me a proper answer, so I asked her to talk and she was reluctant at first, but she enjoyed it from then on. After which she started to talk to others on teamspeak and had an amazing time. &nbsp;Hannah is one of the most adorable friends I have had the pleasure of meeting. Thank you so much for bringing ponies and happiness into my life :D<br><br>Zeus449: Zeus has looked up to me from day one, and this came as a shock for me, since no one really looks up to me as a person. He always asked me for advice, and has given me some at some points in my journey. He is always a positive person and is lovable and caring to everyone around him.<br>Zeus has been one of my greatest friends from the beginning and will remain being a great friend till the end. Thank you for everything zeusy &lt;3<br><br>Gilletteracer/Avigill (max): Max, you have been one of few people that I look up to for advice and careful guidance. It has been a real pleasure working alongside you day by day, and it was a pleasure creating good memories with you. When I met you in singapore it was so much fun! And even though we have had our differences and things have happened in the past which may have made you look down upon me as a selfish or ignorant young human being, I want you to know that I appreciate everything you have done for me. Thank you so much for being there for me when I need you. Ill miss you :D<br><br>The_Detonator_ : detty has been one of the most intellectual and enjoyable people I have met during my time in avicus. He always sheds a new light on situations which NO ONE could have thought of. Whenever I need a logical and suitable explanation for a situation or just a little bit of intelligent guidance, he has been there for me, better than google might I add. Detty has been and will continue to be a great friend and a source of inspiration on how to be a crazy yet smart human. Thank you det, I hope I wont be 2 hours late next time (inside joke)<br><br>Refusetosink: otherwise known as refoose, refuzzle, refoosle, refuse or sinkydinky, Refuse has been a great source of fun and joy for the past few weeks as I have only met her fairly recently but she has been on everyday to play with me and our krew. When things go wrong you can always count on her to be there for you, unless she is scared shitless, in which case she will hide under her pillows. Andy may or may not have zoomed in on the melons. Thanks so much refuse, ill miss you!!!11one!<br><br>Tel6331 (andy &lt;3): Andy has been one of the greatest friends EVER, he is always very cheery and very eager to play with me, just as I am with him. he has introduced me to many new games, and has helped me in several ways, mainly being there for me when I need him the most. Andy always does what he can to make me feel not only important, but loved and cared for. He has always tried to incorporate me into what he does so I can also have fun alongside him and his friends. Andy has been an inspiration to me, showing me what it is to be a kind and caring person. Thank you so so so much andy for everything you have and will do, it has been so much fun playing with you day in day out.<br>May you always be unturned in my heart &lt;3 ;)<br><br>Gaboelmejor (gabby): Gabe was an amazing friend of mine since I started here on avicus, we had lots of fun together, but after I became Senior staff, he didnt seem to like me very much anymore. This is probably due to the fact that (with his own evidence) there was a biased opinion etc...Gabe although has all my respect, after this incident he apologised and really wanted to make sure things were set right. Gabe you have been a great friend, and I really hope we can keep in touch in the future, Thank you so much gabby!<br><br>Cocoalattesauce (eileen) : Eileen was also one of the first people I met on the server, she was a very quiet person, and didnt like to talk to other people much. Of course just like many other people I squeezed her till she talked :3 and from then on it was all fun and laughter. She is still a good friend of mine and will continue to be so. Thank you eileen!<br><br>MLGtino (bae): One of the friendliest, coolest, nicest guys I know. He was my close friend right from the start, he cared for me and made sure I was always happy. Without him I probably wouldnt be where I am today because he knows how to make people happy. He is funny and loves to give me shitty nicknames xP. Tino has a special place in my heart, and will remain a great friend of mine 4 lyfe, I love you tino (no homo)<br><br>Themastercow: Cow and I have had rough times right from the start, I will not get into detail but he taught me a very important life lesson, how to let go. After this incident we had a long chat as we settled our differences and became good friends. I know I can count on cow to be there for me when I need him, and I am there for him when he needs me, sometimes the best friendships can come from your enemies. Thank you &lt;3<br><br>DGB/Stan/Trail : These three taught me what being good at pvp truly meant, it taught me to look more carefully when finding hackers and I have fun talking to these guys and learning more about pvp day by day. Thanks guys!<br><br>Awesome_Apricot (april) : April was the first person I nicknamed, of course he hated it :3 but I made it stick, he now lives by his true name. April is a very kind and smart person, and I love spending time with him. Thank you for making good days great billy!<br><br>D00ZIE (dooz): This guy is twisted, inside and out, and I love that about him. He is always such a joy to talk to, and knows how to cheer a guy up. Doozie is a guy I can share my feelings with, as his lifestyle is very similar to mine. Doozie can be a very caring person when he wants to be, and spending time with him is always a pleasure. At times when I play with people I get ignored when I want to say something, but doozie always has his ears open to what I want to say. Thank you so much for being there for me dooz, its been a real pleasure.<br><br>NolanDalton: Nolan is still a young soul, and has much to learn. He is very caring and has stood by me for very long. Nolan looks up to me for advice and guidance, and I hope I have given it to you nolan, you have been a true best friend, and playing with you was the highlight of many of my days, thank you for being such a great friend.<br><br>mooch: Mooch has been a great friend to me and always lends me a hand when I need it. Several times when I needed someone to talk to, mooch was there for me. Mooch always takes time out of his day to listen to my many 'mini-rants'. Spending time with mooch and the rest of the guys is always great fun and I hope that if I find time someday, we can continue to play and have fun! Thanks so much mooch!<br><br>case (quesadillas) : I also met case recently, but me and him have grown to be great friends. He is a kind and friendly personality that I enjoy seeing every day. In my group of friends, case really fills all the holes, he is like a puzzle piece that fits perfectly, thanks for being so kind case, its been so much fun!<br><br>TinyNitai: Now I know why you named yourself tiny ;) you have been so kind and supportive throughout my journey here on avicus, talking to you everyday is the highlight of my evening. You always give me such good advice and guidance when it comes to lady people. You have one of the most bubbly personality I have ever met and you really know how to cheer me up when I need it. Thank you so much for being there for me when I need it!<br><br>Poptyler: Tyler has been a great great GREAT friend to me. We always have discussions on how we can improve the server and each other, and talking to him always lightens my mood. Tyler always tries to let me join in on his little adventures, and we spend alot of time talking about really random shit. Me and tyler have one major difference though, I dont till poop. (also inside joke) Thank you oh so much for being such a fun and kind person tyler. I really hope "Doozies Vag" doesnt close down anytime soon....<br><br>Glitchy1 (eric): Eric has been one of the most caring people I have ever met. He helps me through every tough situation I get into, and I help him with anything he needs. He has become like a long lost cousin of some sort, but I feel as though he is part of my family. Eric not only cares for me, but also makes sure I dont get ignored when we are in group chats. Eric has been one of my best friends, ever, real life or MC. I will never forget everything you have done for me eric &lt;3<br><br>Jozzmcozz: Jozz is and always will be my brother, we have so much in common, and we are always there for each other. Jozz has been there for me in my toughest points in life and in Avicus. During my parents divorce I only talked to 3 people, one of them being him...He really helped me feel joy again, and has always managed to do so. He makes me feel special, and wanted and loved. He also helped me enter the PvP world and helped me become better when I first started, I could write books about jozz, but I could write books about everything, so thank you SO SO SO much jozz. You have been a true brother to me...we will meet some day... :)<br><br>I have only two things to say before you go, firstly if your name isnt here, I sincerely apologise. This post has already taken me several days, I wont be able to finish anymore if it were any longer.<br>Secondly, if you are ever in plight, all these people here, and so so so many more are there for you...<br>You guys have shown me what its like to have a huge, caring and wonderful family, and I hope one day I can come back to stay a little longer..<br>I have 6 days till my school starts...I hope to see you all someday soon...<br>Bye avicus...Its been fun...Ill be able to come on maybe twice a month, so this is almost like a complete goodbye...So thanks guys, its been a real pleasure...

Dear yoav. Now that your leaving i feel terrible because there are so many things that i needed to get straight with you and that i needed to prove to you. Just to show that i am not just some cocky little kid who talks behind your back. Now your leaving just churns me up because the disgusting impression that i have left on you as you leave is going to remain stuck forever. So i would like to once again apologize for any thing i have ever done to hurt you in any way. In the future i wanted to show that i could be better than i have shown. That i am not just an obnoxious dick. So i am sincerely truly sorry that you are going. Everyone on Avicus always has a good thing to say about you and in retrospect you seem like a fun, interesting, responsible, clever and overall a great guy that  i greatly regret being unpleasant towards. I am sure you will go great, well earned places in life; me and the entirety of Avicus thank you for benefitting the community in such a large way. I hope you can accept my apology. So much respect, good luck and good bye Yoavkipper. bmbrocks321

To start off, I want to say that I really understand your message. I always loved hearing what you had to say and I'm sincerely SINCERELY glad I didn't miss this thread (I noticed it just out of the corner of my eye while checking the leaderboards). This is one of the only "leaving threads" I've really cared about, for the most part. I personally ignore these things, but to me this is more serious than cancer. You were always a fun and laidback moderator that I could look up to and appreciate. I wish I could stop you from leaving, but I do think you made the right choice. Nothing should stop you from pursuing life. It's been a pleasure, I hope I can talk to you sometime again, and don't think I won't miss you.<br><br>Peace man.

I'm glad that i joined team speak when i did, Yoav you were actually the person who told me to joined team speak. The first people i met were Yoav(Yova :)) and Jozz. These two people were my reason to come back on everyday &nbsp;to team speak just to have someone to talk too. Thanks Yoav for all the loving memories &nbsp;we created, It's these one that are hard to forget but i shall never forget. &lt;33

Damnt. Why does everyone have to leave. Yoav you are and forever will be a great friend. Though we met a couple months ago. When I did talk to you. You were supportive, you were helpful, kind, and all in all a great mod. I will forever miss you. I remember that time we hung out when I was trying to fix TS and we shared screen and you told me my computer was screwed up :).

It's unfortunate that you have to leave Yoav, but I'm extremely glad that we were able to become friends. You certainly brought a lot of joy to many people in this community. <br><br>Thanks so much for all the assistance that you offered me and everyone else. It was great fun, and I'm glad that I was able to help you out too! :)

Hey, you're like the only person who can keep up with my starting stupidity on TeamSpeak.&nbsp;<br>You were also there for me, to interview me, to tell me updates on important things and I still remember what happened the first time we met on Avicus. ;)&nbsp;<br><br>Good luck Yoav, you'll always be a constant figure here on Avicus.

Yoav, yoav, yoav...Where do I start.<br>Oh I know! From the very beginning of course!I remember the day when I entered the Avicus Teamspeak for the very first time. I saw a lonely guy at Chat #2, and naturally, I joined the exact same chat.&nbsp;I was scared to talk at first; but something was different about this guy.... He was welcoming and talkative. I've honestly never met someone with those qualities.&nbsp;We talked and talked all night long. The laughter, the game play discussions... oh how fun that was! I knew, from thee second I had the courage to formally say "Hi", we would be friends for a very long time.<br><br><i>Days, weeks, months past....</i><br>I remember both of us applied for Staff on Avicus, however I got denied. My online friend got promoted, but damn, I was so happy for him!He formed a special group, so we could all connect and know a bit more about each other! This group was known as the Sistahood.&nbsp;After meeting new people, I finally had the courage to apply again.&nbsp;I could honestly write 3 pages of things this particular person did for me; expecting nothing in return. However that would take forever to complete.This guy was also known as yoav, one of my best friends.<br>Soon after I was promoted to Jr Moderator; yoav helped me every second of the way. I could tell his goal was to make me the most efficient Moderator possible.&nbsp;Today, I couldn't thank him more. If it wasn't for yoav, I wouldn't be where I am now. I wouldn't be working close with the Directors, I wouldn't of made new friends and I wouldn't of enjoyed myself on a server which has so much potential.I tried my hardest to re-pay him, but somehow he still manages to make me happy; even on my saddest days.&nbsp;<br><br>When he went to Cambodia, he sent me a little model of a dragon with a handmade card... To this day, that card and model still lies next to my bed. When ever I need help to get through something tough, I always have the dragon to remind me of yoav (when he is offline).This might sound weird, but I've never had a friend who has cared so much for me.&nbsp;We would video call as much as we could, and of course, you would have no shirt on.&nbsp;<br><br>As I am writing this, I'm getting a bit teary. When I heard that you were moving to go into a boarding school; I was devestated. It may not look like it, but I don't like showing those emotions through messages.Knowing that your time online will be limited, it always makes me want to put in more effort into talking to you. We still have discussion on what would happen once we finish school; a possibility to finally meet in real life.<br><br>Yoav, you'll always be my friend. Actually no, not just a friend. My best friend.You're literally a brother to me, as I really don't talk to my siblings often.<br><br>I will never be able to re-pay you for the amount of respect, courage, compassion, happiness and honesty you've given to me. I will always treasure this moment, every day of my life.<br><br>I wish you luck in school, and I can't wait to talk to you soon!
