Everyone, listen. <br><br>As most of you know, a recent wave of Junior Moderator promotions and demotions occurred. Not many Senior Staff were online, however each one of them gave their opinions on the Juniors. We needed to get the promotions/demotions over with, however Vacuum and Tyler (DoctaPop) were the only Senior Staff members online to do so. I didn't have access to TeamSpeak, however I was online to confirm their decisions. So for any of you who think Tyler and Vacuum handled this on their own without an Admin's confirmation, they didn't. I was there to confirm each and every one of them, so quit putting the blame on them if you believe a Junior Moderator was wrongly promoted. If you have an issue with any of the recent promotions or demotions, contact me privately on Skype. The overall gist of this is, quit putting the blame and pressure on Tyler and Vacuum if you have an issue with any of this. You can find my Skype information on my forum profile, so contact me. We'll discuss matters there.<br><br>Cheers.

I'm not going to call you out on anything in public, so if you truly have an issue with a punishment, contact another Administrator or contact me on Skype. I'm not discussing this in public. All I can say is, you deserved those infractions for what you were doing.

They weren't interviews. They had already gotten the Junior Moderator rank, these people were promoted from Junior Moderator to Moderator. This had nothing to do with interviews.

I think most of the promotions were well deserved but the odd couple which only said something when a Sr staff member was on or a MOD !

Guys please stop hating on the staff team.&nbsp; Their job is already hard enough without you guys spitting on their faces.&nbsp; You are just putting more pressure on them.&nbsp; Regarding my demotion, I have no grudges and I am not mad.&nbsp; I have complete trust in the Sr Staff team.&nbsp; Sounds like you guys need to put some trust in them.

+1<br>I was demoted from Jr Mod and I don't have any regrets. It just makes me better by showing how much I need to improve on if I want to be a staff member.

I don't think there's much to do, Mods just need to check the e-mail, take reports, be active in TS (Not hard, you have fun too) and be active in the forums.<br>The only person that has a lot of stuff to do in the staff team is Ivy, he runs the server, now, with the other Admins, nothing much to say, they're just in charge of the community and I hope they're talking about this at the moment because there aren't any other topics to discuss apart from the tourney and the update.

Guys, not all of these people are just randomly hating on the staff team, and some of these people actually believe that some of the current moderators didn't deserve their position. There is no need to defend the staff every single time, because sometimes there are problems with them.

Thank you for clarifying this subject Jake!<br><br>With the recent threads about the staff team I really feel that voicing your opinions to high up staff would result in a much easier and less dramatic scenario. The staff team is not perfect. We all know it, but there is no need to constantly belittle the staff and people who defend them. If you really do believe that some moderators are sub-par contact one of the seniors, or Jozz/FluenZa_.

Hey I'm all for improving the staff team but I just think things like this would be best suited for a private conversation with the Sr Staff members.&nbsp;<br><br>I just think that a lot of unprogressive flaming is happening over this subject and it's not very pretty.
