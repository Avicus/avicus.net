Just a note for everyone asking for individual feedback: I'm not saying I know this or that this is 100% true, but think how many applicants they had, and how many of them were denied. To go back and write a review for each and every denied staff app would be a lot of work, and not even necessarily worth their time, because sometimes (im guessing at least) they don't have a huge reason against someone, except that they just were not as qualified as some others, so when asking for a reason, you are asking for a reason not just for your self, but for each of the (30?) applicants that were denied, because they have to treat everyone equally, and that would take a lot of time and effort that could be put into moderating. That being said, it would also be very saddening to not get in, and not know why, so I brief explanation, such as "Lack of detail" or "Previous infractions" would be nice.

Thank you guys all for the kind comments, we are all here for a reason and that`s the community. You guys don`t understand how nervous I am right now. Good luck to all the people that made it this far and this has been added on to my list of the best things that have ever happened to me(believe me, that list is short).<img src="https://i.imgur.com/SMKRdJ1.png" alt="">
