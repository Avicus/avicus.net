Question to moderators

Hi! <br><br>Who do I contact when I'm being accused of hacking by a specific player in every game I play? <br>This has happened many times the couple of days I've played here (I started to play a week ago). <br>I reported everytime and a moderator (I won't namedrop who) was on last time and one time before but nothing was done about it. <br><br>Should I send a mail? Or what do I do? I got screenshots as well. It's a bit annoying not being able to play when I'm being attacked by a specific player everytime I join.

Player reports are always done. The only reason in-game reports aren't done is due to no staff being online.

A moderator was on and watched it happening one time, but nothing was done about it. I made a player report anyways, thank you.

Just a single accusation would be a warning, but excessive accusations would be a tempban.

I do understand what you are saying,&nbsp;a moderator was&nbsp;in-game and saw everything that happened, however, no action was taken.

Yeah, I know, I don't mind when players accuse me of hacking, but when it's the same player following me and doing&nbsp;it every game I play, it becomes a bit redundant. I think it's because of the difference in my KD in the short amount of time I've played here.

I don't have any&nbsp;issues against any of the staff members, that's why I won't name drop either. I asked a question because nothing was done after multiple in-game reports.

Well, I just thought that you had a problem with a staff member considering what you said, "<b><i>I</i></b><span><b><i>&nbsp;do understand what you are saying,&nbsp;a moderator was&nbsp;in-game and saw everything that happened, however, no action was taken."</i></b><i></i> It sounded like you had a problem with a staff member.</span>

No no c: He said in-game reports are only visibly for in-game moderators so&nbsp;I told him a moderator was on.

I will do next time, if I see it again. <br><br>Yes, I know I can't get banned when people accuse me of "hacking", it's about being attacked by the same player every single game&nbsp;I play. I did report the player on here right after my post yesterday, and I reported in-game multiple times.

If a player is accusing you of hacking several times, the easiest way to report them would be to take a screenshot and post it under&nbsp;<b><i>"Player Reports"</i></b><i></i>.
