Clarification on Scrim Server Rules

Hello,<br><br>This has been one of the most confusing topics, and it's been decided previously, however it seems to have not been properly communicated between the staff and community, so this is why I'm making this post here so it clears up some things:<br><br><b>1.</b> Scrim server rules are the exact same as public server rules, excluding what's allowed during tournament operation.<br><b>2.</b> The passage saying otherwise was removed a bit ago.<br><b>3.</b> The senior mods will not hesitate to view the server logs.<br><b>4</b>. Claiming that rules don't apply is not a proper appeal reason anymore.<br><br>As well as this, lenience will not be given anymore to scrim servers. If you wouldn't say it on pub, don't say it on scrim servers. A rule, also, if you are claiming that this isn't documented, isn't necessary. In it's technicality, it's an Avicus service, and the only thing that had a barrier between it was the passage before, and now that it was removed already, it goes straight to the rules page on what to and what not to do.<br><br>Due to issues in detecting scrim behavior, if a moderator requests log checks, they can request it, and we have the capability of detecting leader's and member's logs at any given moment. We advise good behavior.<br><br>Thank you.

<span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">I feel like the answer is already implied, but does this apply only to behavioral and conduct-oriented rules, or gameplay strictures — prohibitions on spawn killing, team griefing, and so on — in addition? My understanding is that the supposed (and unnecessary) enforcement of those gameplay rules is what caused the most confusion, at least from my experiences. Your qualification of what is now to be enforced revolves mostly around behavior in the chat, so I'd assume this post is just for that, in which case you should clarify further.</span>

Yea, it's mostly to do with the staff team cracking down on the behaviour in chat.<br>Spawn Killing and Team Griefing is still allowed <b>solely&nbsp;</b>on Scrim servers.

i mean, its good that this is finally clarified...but personally i disagree with the fact that they are the<b> exact</b> same rules as public matches. An example is spawn killing. I think that spawn killing should be allowed <b>IMO&nbsp;</b>because it's a way to slow the other team down. If you are being spawn killed, then ask for backup from your teammates. I understand if you disagree but that's my opinon,

I can see where you're coming from, but look at it this way. A scrimmage is suppose to be a practice match. So what would the point be in spawn killing during a scrim since you won't be allowed to do that anywhere else?

Yeah, I know, I partially agree with him. I'm just saying why slow them down by spawn killing if you can't do it anywhere besides scrim servers? :p

I recommend that you actually make a new section on the rules page for the Scrimmage Server as you can't actually see the rules unless your team makes a scrimmage schedule and you go to the page that the notification you get re-directs you to.<br>Like "Tournament Rules" or "Scrimmage Rules".<br>Since from what I'm seeing there are all the rules that are being enforced except a certain few and would clarify everything up for everyone. And make sure its the&nbsp;<b>final</b> rules until the tournament actually ends or whatever big event you have ends before editing those rules as we don't want another toggle sneak incident.
