You can do it on the old site, you'll have to ask the person to go to the site to accept it though.<br><br>It'll be added next website update:<br><br><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/4PMNcJd.png">

Just keep in mind that <b>you</b> may see many of these threads but other newer people <b>haven't.</b><br>If someone asks a question that many people have asked before, they may be new to Avicus. <br>All you gotta do is answer their question.

As 99250 said, the old website (old.avicus.net) has been taken down.<br>As a result, you cannot add friends at the moment.<br><br>But, I'm pretty sure it's planned to come out in a future update though.<br>So look out for that!

For now, just wait for the updated website in order to add friends.
