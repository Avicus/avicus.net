As per title.<br><br>I realized that the TNT maps aren't really gonna fit in with the normal maps.

He will not be permanently banned for instigating a flame war. Maybe, just maybe, you could stop feeding him :)

Anyways, back to the OP.
I disagree, just because OCN already has a TNT dedicated server. TNT is also chaotic, and it'll only encourage team griefing.

I'm gonna have to take his side on this one....<br>It's true. The average avicus randy doesn't know how to even build a whiskey or even a potato. The only "cannon" they know is "blow up my teammate cannon." I got tked many times in the existing tnt map, and what Jozz said is right. Even in OCN it took at least a year for people to start using tnt cannons heavily in nostalgia. At first it's total chaos. The mods have to enforce the rules severely until people start adapting to tnt.

Perhaps, maybe.&nbsp;<br><br>I'm just experimenting with ideas that could work. Permissions that allow the usage of TNT. If a person messes up on purpose then they pay for it by not being allowed to use TNT.

Imho, I agree with what Gibbo said. Even though some players may know how to use TNT and make cannons, the majority&nbsp;probably don't. I didn't really see anything pessimistic about his post, he was just giving his honest opinion, which I respect. Sure, he can be a tad rude with how he expresses his opinions, but it doesn't mean we should shoot down everything he says. (Hopefully this doesn't cause another argument, I just wanted to give my 2 cents).

I know that someone asked that it's impossible to detect which team places tnt, to prevent teamgriefing, yet OCN has these shears that stop tnt that came from your team. How is this possible?<br><br>On-Topic: I haven't even tried OCN medium level, but trying some tnt by myself is pretty fun. +1 if there is some kind of good griefing protection, like active avicus members.

It is not impossible to detect.<br>You can detect who placed the TNT, then check what team that player is in.
