<div>Hello people of avicus!<br><br></div><div>Me &amp; Javi (The new developer) have recently come up with a new idea for a gamemode. It is called <i>Destroy the Orb</i>!</div><div>Basically instead of having monuments, there is orbs. Orbs are pretty smart. When you destroy them, you will receive points (Different orbs gives different amount of points). After a certain amount of time, the orbs will respawn and the team will be able to destroy them again. When the team have come up to a certain amount of points, they win.</div><div>So it's pretty simple, but I think it will be good. But me and Javi couldn't agree on one thing.<br><br></div><div><b>Should it be "Attackers VS defenders"? Where the attackers need to get a certain amount of points before the time runs out!</b></div><div><i><b>or</b></i></div><div><b>Should it be "Team VS Team"? Where both teams have orbs, and the first team to reach the amount of points win!<br></b><br>Remember, this gamemode is not confirmed. It is just a small little thing that Javi might be working on and in the end, it will hopefully be released :D<br><br><br></div>

Both sounds good, but otherwise, I'd go team vs team

Up to the map maker. In the prototype there were several endstone blocks around the maps which were the orbs

Well there would be more than one orb i would think.<br><br>but if they are all broken at one point, maybe the team gets bonus points for their score by killing the other team?

Let he map developers decide, make it highly configurable. That'll give more map variety.

This sounds like a prtty cool idea. I think in team vs. team, points should only be awarded for breaking orbs, but kills award emeralds which could be traded for better gear at the team's spawn. Also, in defenders vs. attackers, how would the defenders get points?
