Tower is around Y:100, ground level is Y:64, I broke it down to about Y:20. Took a while, was the only defender (while my teammates endlessly tried jumping in it and going into the void).<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/xFQGrzH.png" title="Image: http://i.imgur.com/xFQGrzH.png"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/e6T9zCU.png"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/puV17pN.png"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/9CzJVxU.png"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/yR9cNsb.png">

I was going to, but time constraints and the fact I was the only defender: people started making skybridges and I had to fend them off. I singlehandedly made the match last about 45 minutes, which isn't bad.<br><br>I did lose.

After that overkill of a trench, you should have made a fence box and bow spammed to give your team maximum time possible.&nbsp;<br><br>Wonder what you would've achieved if you had two hours with help... O.o

I was in that match as well defending it from the beggining of the match. It was pretty fun tho cuz people were constantly rushing my monument and they would die in 2 hits with my Sharpness 2 or 3 sword :^)<br><br>Also nice defence

(sorry for late response)<br><br>Yeah I'm pretty sure it's a pretty old map. The one with 2 towers, one behind the spawn on top, and the other to the side. And if you go to the side of the bridge, (part of the bridge's wall) there is this "hallway" type thing that you can use to quickly run to the other side.
