I completely agree. I might get a lot of hate for saying this, but I actually like the amount of players we have right now, as opposed to a few months ago, when it was about 600 players average. Nowadays I can actually find a peaceful Nebula match to enjoy, without randys spamming and hackusating. Before this, you couldn't even get a Senex match with less than 50 people.

I agree with Snow.<br><br>It may sound like i'm just making excuses, but you could blame the drop mostly on school starting, of course it isn't just that.<br><br>But just look at the player count drop in early September were school starts for most of the US, the player count went from 300 to 150.<br><br>As Fluenza said, we still get 300-500 on the weekends.

The server isn't dead.<br><br>I used to play on a server that averaged to 30-50 players on WEEKENDS until the owner quit minecraft.After that the moderator bought the server and he quit minecraft as well.This server is far from even dying.Its only beginning to blossom.

Everyone is overreacting.&nbsp; I love this server (basically grew up here) but stop sounding desperate.&nbsp; These posts aren't helping.&nbsp; Think about it, a new player joins, he notices the amount of players on, then he joins the forums.&nbsp; He sees these posts about the server dying and says to himself, "This is server is for noobs.&nbsp; My should i spend my time on a server that is going to die."&nbsp; <b></b><b><b>NEWS FLASH!!!!!!!</b></b>&nbsp; This server isn't dying, so please just drop this topic.

Bring back Hunger Games, exactly how it used to be in MC Zone. Avicus has lost so many people because Avicus removed HG.

Also, loosen up a little. When a new player makes a post about their prestige, someone comes along and says, "These posts aren't allowed." That is obviously going to put people off the server.

Sfk was lagging whether he was or not. He's a great rusher, yes. But too many excuses ;-;&nbsp;<br><br>He didn't have the best ping, but you can't die from block lag evey time :P.

I think you're missing my point.<br><br>People are always worrying about getting more players to play on Avicus.<br>I'm saying that we need to focus on the community we have today.

I agree, but new gamemode would be fun too. Anyways everytime I play Nebula, I try to join the games with the lowest player amout. I get lag from too many players in one game and I hate teamgriefers and no sportmanship ppl. Avicus has a great community, but sometimes some ppl are annoying and maybe a little bit stupid. (pls noone gets offended). The server gets slowly a community server. I really like community servers, cuz I know everyone.

Im perfectly fine with the amount of players that there are today. Of course it would be better if the server could get somewhere in 600-800 but like he said, its about the Quality not Quantity :)

Remember the first week of Avicus where it was virtually impossible to join unless you were donator? I'd rather not have it like that, but maybe another 100 on the server during the week days would be nice..
