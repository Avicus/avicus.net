In the Map Testing event, we test maps that are <b>fully working</b>, in order to decide which ones should go in the map rotations.

Thanks Evocal - great answer.&nbsp;<br><br>In my feeble attempt to get better at ymls - &nbsp;If you have to fix any of my map yml's , would you please tell me what you had to fix, so I do not do it again? And if any of my Ymls are so messed up you cant get them to work please let me know as much info as you have so I can spend some time working on them. I really hate not knowing if my submitted work is not correct ( I make&nbsp;&nbsp;all the new ymls from scratch)&nbsp;- I don't want you to have to clean up my mess. - Thank again, and please let me know if your able to<b> add </b>the lost island map.

Walls maps will go last, and they will last the usual 10 minutes prep and 5-10 of gameplay, however I do not know the exact timing it will take place.

Uh... bad news. Ivy wasn't able to properly update the maps repo as it glitched; our changes have not been made and I assume he will be trying to fix it soon. Just a heads up that the event may NOT occur due to these difficulties. Do not get angry at the dev team as these things sometimes happen.<br><br>Any questions you can forward below. Once the issue is fixed, a topic will be made reintroducing ME2 and the maps list will be updated. Sorry for the last minute troubles.<br><br>On the positive side, we've gotten a lot of work done. MDs will be regularly released and the work will finally pay off!

You guys need to pay attention more and read the post fully before replying.<br><br>&nbsp;It says map testing will be at 2 pm GMT, which by my clock at this time of posting is in 2 hours and 19 minutes.

I think they are asking about if the map testing will happen at all, as Para just made a post about how some things aren't ready.
