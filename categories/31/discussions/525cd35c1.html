Hey guys! Behind the scenes of Avicus, Wulfcaspice and I have decided to make this and make it a new gamemode. This gamemode is called "Lanes" which consist of 2 Lanes with 3 endstone monuments and stone pickaxes. Only 10 players can be on a team (not counting donor space). You can only build in a specific region to get to the other side. So far, We have 3 maps for this. Here are the maps:<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/wrSYGlT.png" alt="" title="Image: http://i.imgur.com/wrSYGlT.png"><br>Jungletree Bazooka - Made by Wulfcaspice<br>(/sn JungletreeBazooka)<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/CiRLRry.png" alt="" title="Image: http://i.imgur.com/CiRLRry.png"><br>Cavum Lanes - Made by GrapeSmoothie + Edans<br>(/sn CavumLanes)<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/3h6yRBo.png" alt="" title="Image: http://i.imgur.com/3h6yRBo.png"><br>Meritux - Made by Wulfcaspice<br>(/sn Meritux)<br><br>We encourage map building for this and to be as unique as possible. Hope you guys enjoy and hopefully this will be a thing in Atlas :P<br><br>Regards,<br>Edans and the Map Development Team<br><b><br></b><br><b>NOTE:&nbsp;</b> Lanes is subjected to be changed in the future. This is just to get maps flowing through from the community if players make maps. Please be reminded that this is not the finished product and this might be changed in the future.

What's so new about this game mode that it needs a bunch of new maps? Your post, no offence, is minimally informative and does not give any guidelines as to rules and intended playstyles or mechanics. Also, did you base this game off of much older games? If so, it'd be nice to mention that as well, considering that you are trying to somewhat emulate the style of those games.&nbsp;<br>It is very good that you came up with a new gamemode, and that you are building up excitement and encouraging the community to get involved, but please be more specific as to what you want and what your end goals are. Otherwise, there will be a good deal of confusion that could have been avoided.

Why? It would be fun with a giant fortress thingy and 40 players. Especially with the stuff that Atlas will provide.<br><br>1 giant lane for building... arrows soaring through the air... swords striking blocky flesh...<br><br>We'd have a blast.

This really wasn't a thread asking for new maps. I was encouraging building. Not asking for it. There is no intended playstyle or mechanics. I already stated the mechanics such as having only 1 area to build in as well as having 3 endstone monuments. The playstyle can be created by the map maker. It depends on how they make a map. We did not base this game off a much older game. There really is no end goal other than encouraging map building as well as informing players that this will be a thing and that they should be expecting this in the future.

You seem to have misunderstood my first question. I did not mean to imply that you were asking for many new maps. Rather, because you were encouraging players to build their own maps, I was asking why you were doing so. How much playtesting have you done and on how many different maps? Do you think that it would survive long enough to see the implementation of many new maps with their own styles of play? Because what you're asking is for people to spend their time working on an, as of yet, not publicly implemented gamemode that you have just introduced instead of working on already in place gamemodes. What do you see in this gamemode that you believe is worth this switch? How sure are you of this?&nbsp;<br><br>So the only rules people have to build off of is that there is 1 build area and 3 endstone monuments? Are you implying, then, that people can add anything else as long as these fundamental components remain the same? Or are there specific things you want to avoid in these types of maps? You're giving a lot of lee-way, and with a nascent gamemode I dont believe that venturing too far from the intended core game will turn out all too good. Feel free to disagree, but that's what I've seen so far. You want to give people a taste and give people time to adapt, not overwhelm them.&nbsp;<br><br>I mean, you're telling people to build maps and to play around with this gamemode, but you never stated when you are going to test the maps, or ask for submissions, etc. It just seems to me that you're saying "We're doing this gamemode. Go make some maps and play them with your friends and see how you like it", which, quite frankly, I believed was the purpose of Avicus betas.

<i>Pro tip</i>: Good idea to have the map at Y=0 on the super flat world type. Handy when you're writing the XML and it's better for gameplay (shorter falling time).

This only works for when you're in a moderate sized enclosed space with enough room, then the void fog will start to appear.

If I remember correctly a MapDev told me that Avicore (now Atlas) will automatically remove the dark light at low y levels.
