@Midnight - a question that everyone can answer or take part in, that does not bring attention to me, and is on topic with Avicus, about a Gamemode, &nbsp;is not Spam.

I don't think Mooch is trying to start a Flame War, I believe he is aware of the fact that there have been too many threads pointing out the lack of players Avicus currently has, and well, it's sorta annoying (and spammy) to have even more threads about it...

I'm going to lock this thread as it's considered spam. <br><br>The reason being is that you are creating a topic asking players to join In-game. As it clutters the forums, and is indeed considered "Spam."
