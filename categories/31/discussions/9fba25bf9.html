I've been playing this server for quite a while and still been wondering who were the first people to join the server? (first people as in first 5-10 or so). &nbsp;I just thought it would be interesting to know! &nbsp;And for those who don't know i mean way back when the server was still mczone. Thanks.<br><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Critz :)

I believe it was either Gill, Blackhawk, or ParaPenguin. Don't quote me on this, this is just what I remember from an older topic.

Kylo (formerly known as funky) was the first to join.<br>Blackhawk was the second to join.<br>ParaPenguin was the third to join (I believe).<br>ParaPhoenix may have been the fourth.

So a long time ago, someone got the old mczone records back, and I decided to screen shot and it, and...<br><br><a href="http://gyazo.com/d6eda054a7ac6571ca43f7ad7c966562" title="Link: http://gyazo.com/d6eda054a7ac6571ca43f7ad7c966562">http://gyazo.com/d6eda054a7ac6571ca43f7ad7c966562</a><br><br>The very first on avicus were the staff (obviously), but after that, I'm not too sure.

In your profile, or someone elses, go to where it says "info". Then go to where it says "joined". Right below that it will say how long ago (1 year ago, ect). Hover over that and it will tell you the exact date that player joined.

I definitely have been on the server for a long time cuz I remember the maps were always just rendezvouz or ternio or even Senex. Good days :D. And then I stopped playing for like a year cuz I had a break from MC or something :P.

I've been here IMMEADIATELY it stopped being a faction server. Ah, the good old days when you automatically got put into a walls game the second you joined... No rules, many glitches, was fun.
