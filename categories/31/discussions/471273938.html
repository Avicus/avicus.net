Sorry to be negative but it looks like it is. Avicus is dying, the staff team is dying, everything is dying. Ex mods are coming out with a terrible ending, players have lost faith in staff, tensions between players are rising to the point where Avicus can be fully split and nothing has been done. You spend more time denying that the server isn't dying than helping the biggest death sentences, the community tensions to staff and other players.

With this attitude I am telling you "You need to fix something." I am not sugar coating anything. Mods have communication problem, they have "can't really handle the forums" problems. Also if you think I don't understand I don't. I am an admin of a server that has 4 other admins and 31 mods. We don't let community problems run on too long, we don't let problems go on at all. Also if you are wondering why a player base looks for the negatives that is completely normal. Apparently block lag is fixed but it was presented so badly it didn't knock the negative feedback that has been coming from players for months of bottled up frustration. I do have to hand it to you. You are the first mod to answer my concerns in a while. You can't just walk into lava and act it isn't there. You have to think of a way to over come the lava way to get to your goal. I honesty think you are the best the mod team offers but it is a long road and if this keeps up the server will eventually collapse on itself.

<p>Guys, I think the first thing we need is positivity. <br>We all need to get along, once that is done, the rest will just fall in place. I know it seems dark, but if we give up, we submit to the darkness. We allow it to control us, to turn us against each other. Please, for the sake or our server, be kind, forgiving, and don't be afraid to be wrong (This includes the staff and the community) A city cannot reach it's peak if there is a civil war within it's walls. The same applies for this sever, OUR server. Please everyone, if we can&nbsp;be supportive, we can build back&nbsp;what we have lost. Share the love, abolish the anger, salt and frustration. We need this to step forward. </p><p>(This is for everyone, not some people specifically. We are part of the server, and it doesn't matter who the specific person of the server is, because it all comes back to the entire thing all together...Avicus) </p><p>&lt;3 :D &lt;3 :D &lt;3 :D &lt;3 :D &lt;3 :D &lt;3 :D &lt;3 :D &lt;3 :D &lt;3 :D &lt;3 :D &lt;3 :D &lt;3 :D &lt;3 :D &lt;3 :D &lt;3 :D &lt;3 :D</p>

But could you guys at&nbsp;<b>least</b> improve? First off all staffs are not just a regular member, so could the staffs at least be mature always? Give an example to other members that you guys are actually mature and be respectful.<br>And if you guys are not mature how can the others be mature and respectful too.. So ye remember ain't calling you guys trash or something bad, but please improve and there is a lot of members are hating the staffs, they only fucking talk they don't fucking prove it.

Peachy told us a while ago that staff are allowed to temp retire&nbsp;<b>once</b>, and if they retire a second time, they'll have to go through the process of applications or handpicking. Basically they just have to start over again, rather than skipping all that and returning to their previous position in the team just because they were a higher rank than everyone else. Vlad was just stating a rule :P

i honestly dont know what to say here. everyone here who lost faith, you aren't helping at all. if you lost faith, why are you still here? there's always room for improvement. &nbsp;just because some things have happened doesn't mean its all over. i still think avicus has a chance. for everyone who still cares, we need to try to do something to get avicus back up. just because we lost some staff doesn't mean the server is rip. we need to figure out something to get everyones faith back, something that will attract more players, i dont know. hopefully staff apps will be coming soon or some way of getting staff so the numbers can rise again, because i cant lie, we do need more staff. i remember when there was 3 admins, 8 sr mods, and 42 mods. alot of them retired, and for good reasons. and all you people who dont like the staff, dont just say they suck, give them a reason that can help them so they can actually improve, dont just say "oh i hate this staff member", give them something to make them better, because im 100% sure, that that is their goal. i dont think avicus is rip. i still think there is a chance to get back in the run as it used to be.

Well part of the reason for this is the people that are<br>salty/mad/trolls<br>are just giving up and saying avicus is dead and basically causing flame left and right, and the people who actually still care about avicus try to defend against that because they have different beliefs. i've seen alot of people who are retired/mad about something just saying that avicus is going to die here

I agree with the staff, and I agree that things can be changed for the better, avicus isn't rip, hooray, etc etc. &nbsp;One thing I do have a problem with is this "I don't want to leak anything" business. &nbsp;What? &nbsp;Isn't that the point of the community? &nbsp;Shouldn't you be able to tell us what you're doing so we can give feedback? &nbsp;So we can make suggestions? &nbsp;You're not some game company trying to build hype, you're our only hope of this server lasting. &nbsp;The best move for you now is to tell us your ideas, run them by us first. &nbsp;Tell us what you're hoping change, and admit where things need fixing. &nbsp;We are your best source for doing thing that make the community happy, because as it happens, we are the community.

There is information that's meant to be confidential, though. We don't need to be nosy and get up in the staff teams' faces in order to get information out of them. Just respect their privacy.

I agree that we don't have to know everything, but I don't think we should have to "be nosy and get in the staff team's faces" to know what they plan on doing. &nbsp;They don't have to tell use everything, no, but there shouldn't be anything you're afraid to say for fear of "leaking".

Still, there is the kind of information that's best kept hidden for a while, though I agree that they could be a lot more... liberal about the things they keep secret.

We're trying are best. Please, let us try. You guys can't expect things to happen in a snap of a finger. Things take time, Kylo developing stuff with Java and whatnot doesn't take 3 minutes.<br><br>Staff trying to organize and get ourselves together doesn't take a minute either. Don't you guys think that people retired because of flak from both sides?<br><br>When you make unnecessary topics like this one it severely drops our morale (Staff: Mods) and makes us think that we're doing our jobs in vain. Absolutely no appreciation and recognition.&nbsp;<br><br>When I was a MapDev and when I was a simple old regular, I was busy criticizing the Moderator team and being constructive with them. A senior approached me for some advice, the mods knew and understood what I was saying. I swear, you won't be bashed. In fact, I was hand-picked to this position even though I created my topic.<br><br>None of us will shoot you guys down for creating constructive posts perfectly. Not create a travesty of a topic like this one. What is the point of this topic? It only induces disunity and lessens morale.&nbsp;It allows negative elements to come on and bash the server even more.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Speaking of an element...</b><br><br><b>@Aphelion</b>, yes yes that's nice. But why are you still here then? If you've lost faith why don't you leave? I know that if I lost faith I would leave the server to rot in peace. If you don't want to be bothered with the server yet you have the impulse to go on and spread negativity then perhaps ask for a forum-ban?&nbsp;<br><br>It makes no sense saying you've lost faith yet you're still here.

Here is a few things: Staff barely know how to handle themselves. This has improved looking at this thread but some staff still haven't shown they can handle themselves. You are one of the higher staff members that can act better than most. Just a reminder to staff but you ARE the leaders. You have to act as leaders all the time and getting swept up in children games of personal insults or just placing the blame game is never acceptable.<br>A good way to restore my faith in staff for me and others is by making your presence known on the forums. When there are threads like these it is the only time a staff member indicates that they do something. This is a little rant but a few days ago there was a flame heavy thread and there would of been a flame if a leader didn't come. Who is this leader? It was me. That isn't me bragging because I was sick of it. No staff indicated that they were acting as a leader when I asked a question a few times in the middle of the thread about the rules. and for 6 hours of waiting and seeing staff in other places on the forums I lost full faith in staff. Look at all threads, if there is little indication that a staff is needed don't look the other way. Help.&nbsp;<br>Next is the secrets in the staff team. The devs are more open about their work and if that is happening you have a problem. The tensions between players and staff and other players are rising. Being so secretive is not helping. The players feel left out and if that is happening they want no part of the staff. Just try to make players know a few things so if you still want secrets you can.&nbsp;<br>Also a little into my mind. I am anti BS and I am a realist when it comes to situations. Avicus will die if staff vs community relations don't improve.

Really good point. I don't want to take any sides in this argument, but Pie is pretty much saying it all, especially near the end. If staff wants to make the server better, their main priority is having a good staff to community relationship. If the community just hates on the staff all the time, and the staff doesn't do much to try to establish a good relationship, nothing will change, I&nbsp;<b>guarentee</b> you.
