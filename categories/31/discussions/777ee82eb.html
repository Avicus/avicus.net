Just talk slowly and get used to it. If you just want to do what I used to do its fine. I set a hot key that mutes my mic so I talk then after I finish I mute it again and when I want to talk I unmute until I got used to it.

If I were you I would start talking with someone more in a private chat (Maybe someone more out going so they could do most of the talking) and then when you're in a larger group of people just make sure your friend is there so you feel more comfortable. Just talking as much as you can whenever you're on ts helps. Hope anything I've said might've helped

Heres a tip for you, try and identify whose voice is whose, it'll save you a lot of awkward moments ;)

I haven't talked in TS yet, plan to, but i'm guessing you go on and tell everyone your most embarrasing moments in your life in deep detail XD

I think you should just go with it. Just think about it like this. Why be afraid if nothing bad will realisticly happen.

Saw you on earlier, trust me. When I first got on Teamspeak I was scared to death. You just kind of get more comfortable with the people as you get on more :) You don't need to rush talking!

if ur nervous just use the chat. dont feel obligated to speak, but if you want to learn to not be nervous just start. people on ts are generally nice, i wouldn't worry about it. just ask yourself what the worst thing that could happen is, and then realize it probably won't happen and if it does, it's only one moment in this tiny existence on this tiny planet spinning through this comparatively tiny galaxy.<br><br>hotkey is good too, so you only talk when u press it, then if you don't wanna talk just don't press it :)

I was like you when I first got TS (and still am a little, ;P), but you do get used to the folk after a little while. You can always go into a chat with a small group of people if you feel to pressured around a large amount.

When I first joined TS, I had no real intention of doing it, I was just delirious from cough medication.<br><br>So I joined.<br><br>I have a few insecurities with my voice, due to being teased as young, hence why I joined when I had laryngitis. It sounded husky and hid my voice.<br><br>After a long while, I got used to just talking. Now it's like chatting to a group of friends, it's easier to meet new people, and it really is great!<br><br>I guess my point is, don't worry. It'll be awesome :)

Come on team speak and start using chat, then after you are a little bit confident start talking. Everyone on team speak is nice and welcoming. Once you go on team speak regally you will wonder why you didn't come on sooner xD<br><br>The first time i joined team speak i was a little bit nervous but the mod that was on welcomed me and we talked for ages.

I remember my first time on Teamspeak.&nbsp;<br>I was thrown into Jozz's office with a bunch of staff members as a regular.<br>Definitely jumped into the deep end there.<br><br>Maybe, that's an approach worth considering?<br>Just dive in and start talking to people. <br>The Teamspeak community are a friendly bunch.&nbsp;<br><br>Whatever you do, you'll be fine :)
