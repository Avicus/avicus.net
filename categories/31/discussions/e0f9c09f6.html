Recently I know people have been speaking about me as arrogant. I'd like to say that I don't mean to come across as such, nor mean to act like so. Yes, I make excuses, they're at least partially legit, but I mention them too much and it makes me seem like I reject the fact that I lost a 1v1 for example.&nbsp;I aknowledge that I lost, I just forget to say that sometimes. I also tend to say things as-is or as I see them, which a lot of people resent me for. Another thing I do is mention certain things I can do or my vids too much when Im just trying to make a point unintentionally. I tend to mention certain things a lot as well, and I'm not trying to brag directly; most of the time I'm just proud that I'm able to do such or did something really cool. Usually when I am proud of such things, I tend to mention them way too much and subconsciously "fish for compliments" or recognition, and I think a lot of people do too.<br><br>I do not mean to come across this way nor do I try to act so. Maybe I am arrogant, maybe not. I just wanted to let everyone know I'm going to try and shift my habits a little to avoid coming across in such a manner, and I apologise for this, as I'm letting my bad habits prevail and letting them influence others. <br><i><u>I know people have trashtalked me behind my back and I'm very aware of who these people are</u></i><u></u>&nbsp;<br>But it was deserved and know I'm not mad, just a little disappointed in myself and certain individuals who've done so (some I just expect it from). <br><br>If anyone has suggestions or ideas on how to improve the generally poor perception of me by some. Or any habits that tend to give a bad perception&nbsp;<u>that are not listed above</u><u></u>. Feel free to say so below.&nbsp;<br><br>I'm going to try, but nothing's ever garunteed, and I can't garuntee that I will change super quickly, or ever for that matter. If you could politely mention in chat that I'm going off the rails or falling back into these habits in-game, that would be great :)&nbsp;<br><br>P.S: I don't expect positivity from people, nor do I need those "It was brave of you to apologise" comments. I just hope that I can start anew with some and try to reinstate myself as a player/person. I expect to be torn down a bit, and it's not going to be fun. But I guess it's all part of it :P&nbsp;<br><br>Thanks,&nbsp;<br>Shadow

Some examples would be much appreciated. I'm not denying anything, I'd just like some to help remove such habits.<br><br>I expect this kind of comment and I'm not going to go crying to people over it.&nbsp;<br><br>@OP I'm not holding what's said here against people. Even if you don't feel right doing so or feel rude mentioning it, I do appreciate it.

I'm actually pretty glad you made this. I could honestly care less about anyone's (or my own) PvP abilities, I just don't like<br>people who try to act better than others because they are good at something. Anyways I also apologize for being a douche. I just thought you seemed to think you were an almighty god or something.

OK, ty. You're right, I could have avoided mentioning myself there and I was debating and in a way trying to give Juano a compliment. But this is true, regardless. Thanks

It's k. When I tend to get pissed and/or get into things I do act arrogant and I realize I do give off that feel without recognising I do.&nbsp;<br><br>Tbh, I'm not spectacular at too many things, so I tend to show off that because it's one of the things I'm good at.

Naw, I wanted to do such and I did this out of my own will. I've come across wrongly to many and I want to fix that, or try to. This also helps me try to fix bad habits that I know I have and would like to fix and avoid coming across poorly because of these habits. It's also apologising to those who may have seen me poorly or still do because of this. I'm trying to let people know that these are not my intentions, that I mean well and that I am aware and accept these flaws and are trying to fix these things as they may become detrimental to me in the future.&nbsp;<br><br>That ended up helping me more than anything.&nbsp;<br><br><u><i>The hardest part is acceptance of such things</i></u><i></i>

IDK what you have done, you taught me the 8 block, I except you apology.&nbsp; So I don't make this post completely pointless, next time you are getting angry because you lost, take out on your pillow.&nbsp; You don't have to type it into chat.&nbsp; You can even say it out loud.&nbsp; Just don't need to type it into the chat for everyone to see.&nbsp; That is when you get in trouble.

It's not so much that I'm over-competitive or get pissed. Just more that I feel this wierd need a to kinda explain why? I find myself stating things or reasons why I lost for no reason, kinda explaining myself I guess. I accept I lost, I guess I forget to say so, or seek the perfect fight, with no bull so I say these things. I've always been a bit of a perfectionist with certain things. One of the few real thing as that actually gets me heated is repetitive stupid stuff that shouldn't be happening (blocklag, potlag, a good amount of lag period, bad hit detection), but it takes a while to get to me unless it's ultra-lag. &nbsp;<br><br>This is a good strat and could be helpful with other things in life though, and for that I thank you.
