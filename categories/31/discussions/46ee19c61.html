Everyone has their own reasons. Some people left because of bad decisions some people left because they can't play this game as much as they did.

Game does are really dull and chat is spammed up with hackusations and other things. Plus Avicus moderators don't really do much apart from talk in ts. Not a majority do this but some do (NOT THE PEOPLE I TALK TO ON TS &lt;3) I have seen moderators in games where spam and griefing is happening and they are doing nothing.
