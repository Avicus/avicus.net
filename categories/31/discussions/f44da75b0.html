Hey everyone!<br>As you may know that the PlugDJ Team has been inactive lately, we all have our reasons but one of the reasons is that we do not have many people attending.<br>We aren't too sure of the cause but we have decided to test out something that might be implemented in the future. So here is the testing idea:<br><br><b>The PlugDJ Friday Theme Suggestions!<br></b>Pretty much what this post will be is that&nbsp;<b>YOU</b> guys fill out <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/rcxK8kyVJh" rel="nofollow" title="Link: http://goo.gl/forms/rcxK8kyVJh">a form</a>&nbsp;with your&nbsp;<b>IGN</b>&nbsp;and what&nbsp;<b>Theme</b> you would like for the upcoming plug dj event!<br>&nbsp;<br>We thought that we should bring in&nbsp;<b>You're</b> opinions into our choosing of themes.<br>How it goes is that every <b>Thursday</b> we will be asking you guys to fill out <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/rcxK8kyVJh" rel="nofollow" title="Link: http://goo.gl/forms/rcxK8kyVJh">the form</a>&nbsp;with your IGN and Theme you would like for the next plug dj event. On&nbsp;<b>Tuesday</b> the <a href="https://plug.dj/avicus" rel="nofollow">PlugDJ</a> Team will be looking through the answers on the spreadsheet and calculate the total amounts of themes given to us as a recommendation. The&nbsp;<b>Top 3</b> voted themes will then be pulled out and the Team will be getting a final decision out of the Top 3. The decision for the Theme will be given out 2 days before the event (Wednesday)<br><b>The following criteria will be taken for choosing Themes:</b><br><b></b> &nbsp; &nbsp; 1. How many times has the Theme been used in the past weeks?<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2. How explicit will the Genre be in lyrics and videos?<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3. How many people voted for which Theme?<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4. Which one is our preferred Theme?<br>If you were not able to get the words with the link attached to the form here it is:&nbsp;<a href="http://goo.gl/forms/rcxK8kyVJh" title="Link: http://goo.gl/forms/rcxK8kyVJh">http://goo.gl/forms/rcxK8kyVJh</a><br>Votes&nbsp;<b>will</b> erased and reset each week for fair voting.<br><b>No theme will be played two weeks in a row.</b><br>Thanks for voting! The PlugDJ Team Appreciates it! :)<br><br><i></i><u>If you have any Questions please ask below :)</u>
