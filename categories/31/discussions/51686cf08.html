I currently have a really old, laggy and somewhat painful laptop!<br>However, I have been saving alot for a while and would love to get some DESKTOP!!!<br>build ideas. Now I am not really concerned about the price as long as it is not like $1500 <br>or something. Plz I have heard there are some real computer genius' here and I am expecting<br>great things.<br>P.S really sorry &nbsp;as I'm sure many people have asked this question before<br><br>Cheers,&nbsp;<br>Hudmister14<br><br>Conditions: <br>Minimum of 8GB of RAM<br>Cost is not over $1500 AUD<br>Must include a monitor preferably "24" inch<br>This is just one website that could possibly be used&nbsp;<br><a href="http://au.pcpartpicker.com/parts/partlist/" title="Link: http://au.pcpartpicker.com/parts/partlist/">http://au.pcpartpicker.com/parts/partlist/</a>

So are you willing to spend $1,500 or not? If you are, this would fit your budget<a href="http://au.pcpartpicker.com/p/jRR2Mp">http://au.pcpartpicker.com/p/jRR2Mp</a>, if not, please give me a specific budget to work with. Also, if you want, I can help you over skype as it's just better for me and I can give you more information.

Okay, this is what I would recommend for you:&nbsp;<a href="http://au.pcpartpicker.com/p/2rFQ23" title="Link: http://au.pcpartpicker.com/p/2rFQ23">http://au.pcpartpicker.com/p/2rFQ23</a>&nbsp;I'll give you the rationale below as to why I chose these parts in particular.<br><br><b>CPU:</b> <i>Intel i5-4460&nbsp;</i>This one has 4 really strong cores, it can handle any game you throw at it. It's also good at video/image editing and rendering, not as good as an i7 but still very good.<br><br><b>Motherboard:&nbsp;<i></i></b><i>MSI H81M-P33&nbsp;</i>Good motherboard for the price, has all the basic features the average user needs. I actually have this motherboard and so far it has held up well. The only downside you might encounter with it is that it doesn't have front USB 3.0 ports however it does have 2 on the back. I don't use any USB 3.0 devices so that's not a problem for me.<br><br><b>Memory:&nbsp;<i></i></b><i>Kingston HyperX Fury Black 8GB&nbsp;</i>Really any RAM will do, Kingston is very good and in my opinion looks very good as well. 8GB is plenty for anything you will be doing.<br><br><b>Storage (HDD):&nbsp;<i></i></b><i>Western Digital Caviar Blue 1TB&nbsp;</i>Yup, 1TB of space, it will take you quite a while to use it up. It's one of the most reliable hard drives out there, I also have this one.<br><br><b>Storage (SSD):&nbsp;<i></i></b><i>Samsung 850 EVO&nbsp;</i>Very reliable piece of hardware as well, fast speeds and great performance. Things get a little complicated here though, this part is&nbsp;<b>NOT&nbsp;</b>required for your computer, in fact, it's what caused me to go over the budget. However, if you want really really fast boot and loading times, you will want to get this. Your computer will be in the desktop in less than 5 seconds. Games like Skyrim and Fallout will have really short loading screens. It's perfectly fine if you don't want to spend the extra cash as it's not really necessary, but in my opinion, well worth it. If you don't buy it, the HDD will be more than enough however you will have to deal with slightly longer loading times. Also, buying this will give you a bit more extra space apart from the 1TB.<br><br><b>Video Card:&nbsp;<i></i></b><i>Gygabite R9 280 3GB Windforce&nbsp;</i>This card will handle pretty much anything you throw at it at 1080p resolution, it has a good cooler and 3GB of VRAM. This should get you well above 60FPS on most Steam games. It can also run Minecraft at above 500 FPS, max settings.<br><br><b>Case:&nbsp;<i></i></b><i>NZXT S340&nbsp;</i>Not much to say here, good looking (in my opinion), has a lot of space, good cable management and good airflow.<br><br><b>Power Supply:&nbsp;<i></i></b><i>EVGA SuperNOVA 650W&nbsp;</i>Reliable, leaves room for plenty of upgrades. I have an EVGA power supply as well and so far I've had no problems.<br><br><b>Monitor:</b>&nbsp;<i>BenQ GL2460HM 60Hz 24.0"</i><i>&nbsp;</i>BenQ is very popular for its monitors. 1080p, 60Hz, everything you need from a gaming monitor. It's also the size you asked for.<br><br>Well, that's my rationale. I wish you luck in your build and hopefully you enjoy it.

Oops, didn't look at your best before my posting my other one.&nbsp;<br><br>1. No, it's not necessary, it's actually a bit excessive unless you're going to be doing extremely heavy rendering and editing. It wouldn't fit your build and budget anyway.<br><br>2. No, you can install Windows with a USB. Don't get one if you're not going to use it.<br><br>3. Doesn't matter, you can upgrade to Windows 10 from both anyway. I recommend Windows 8.1 for now though. Also it's cheaper and available.<br><br>4. No, they are actually very good cards. However, at your price range, the R9 280 beats the GTX 960. The model I recommended has 3GB so it will handle games better.<br><br>Also, I don't recommend going with an AMD CPU, Intel is better for gaming as it has significantly stronger cores than AMD. Most games only use 1-2 cores, some games are starting to use 4 which means you will still be covered by Intel.

Really nice build, The i5-4460 is definitely a bang for the buck processor, The R9 280 will do just great fro any game, at medium-high settings and honestly really good build, nice parts b0ss :)<br><br>(As for AMD Processors, they're still really good, I just hate how AMD lied about the 390X and The Fury X, they still fall behind far from the top tier Titan X and 980 Ti)

It's not necessary at all, unless you want a more silent fan. I strongly suggest you get the video card I recommended as well as the SSD though. The R7 260x is is not nearly as good as the R9 280. Also, the Samsung SSD will save you some money as well as changing to the motherboard I recommended. Everything else looks good though.<br><br>I did the same mistake of getting a cheap graphics card in the beginning and I'm starting to regret it. I can't comfortably run the newest games. The R9 280 will last you a few years without needing an upgrade.

I have a Dell Optiplex 790. From what I understand, Dell custom build their parts so that replacing them is a struggle. Is there any way I could upgrade it or is a whole new computer needed to be bought?<br><br>Thanks in advance

No they don't build their own custom parts. The thing that makes it a struggle to upgrade is the case because it is so slim.<br><br>You can definitely upgrade it. Assuming you don't gave a graphics card, you would need to get a new case in order to make it fit.

Maxed out Minecraft would run at about 500 FPS, probably more.

That's why I get 300 FPS? Good to know. In all seriousness though, &nbsp;his budget doesn't allow for much more and he can easily upgrade to an i5 or i7 in the future without changing anything else.<br><br>He can also overclock it to 4.0GHz on the stock cooler.
