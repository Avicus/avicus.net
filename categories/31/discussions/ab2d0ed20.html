Ok so most of us on the forums are regulars but at what point in someones adventure in this community do you become a regular? What is the term regular mean to you? How do you think people become regulars here on avicus? Is it when they join the forums or when they are actively on the server over a period of time?<br><br><b>Basic Question ,&nbsp;</b>When does a player become a "regular".<br><br>Your thoughts below,

I guess if you go to the forums and the server often, you're counted as a regular? I dunno. XD

Usually if you are active in game (and usually on the forums). A good rule of thumb is if you see them a lot, they are probably a regular.

I'd say if they're on the server at least once every 2 days for an hour or two, then they're a regular (unless they're on vacation or something), and also participating in other avicus related things (skype, teamspeak, forums). I would say someone who posts maybe once a day is enough to be considered a regular.

Someone who finds themselves regularly involved with Avicus, whether it is in-game or at the forums, hence the word 'Regular'.

Someone who has played at least 10 days total. You dont really have to be active on forums to be a regular, Ik lots of people that are active on the server but havent posted a single thing. Anyways, forums are a good way to also be a regular. If you dont play Avi at all, but you are active on the forums, I'd consider him as a regular. A good example of this is Spartemex a couple months back, before he was a mod. If youre perm banned, and your still on the forums, tbh, thats the best type of regular, because it shows you know you did something wrong, and you wanna get better at it. A good example of this is EricV4/Electra/MapDev when he was banned =P.

There's no exact measure or definition of what a regular is, A vague "definition" of it is someone who actively plays on (example) Avicus, and who may or may not also actively on the forums.&nbsp;<br><br>Let's use me as an example. Let's pretend that I just joined the servers. Avicus is my first MC server ever, and I'm excited to find out what the server is like. I spend the rest of my day (Atm it's 3:23pm) playing Avicus, then fall asleep at 11pm. Since I'm not in school, I have plenty of time to play Avicus, so I play on it everyday for several hour (let's say 6 hours a day). After a week, someone says "Oh hey Prae!". I say hello to them back, and we start to have a casual conversation. Several other people, as well as 2 moderators join in the conversation. Someone says "Hey, as me on the forums!" I reply "Forums? What?".. That's when I learn about the forums, sign up, then start posting. At first, I post a lot, due to excitement. There's some fun forum games that I happily participate in, as well as some AMAs. I see these AMAs and think "You know, these are really cool. I should make one!" I make one, people get to know me better.. All of that happens, while I still play ingame.<br><br>A month passes, and I get a "Hello" everytime I play. People know who I am, because I post on the forums everyday, and I play on the servers everyday for several hours. This has happened for 1 month now. That's 30-31 days, 180+ hours of non-stop Avicus time. I could now be considered a "Regular".. but what if others disagree? Let's go further into this story.<br><br>It's now August 29th, a few days before I start school again. I started being less active on Avicus, but I still play 2-5 hours a day. I recently joined another server similar to Avicus, and learned that people from that server play here, and people here play there! I become active on that server as well, and some people there recognize me from Avicus. I start talking to people there, as well as people who only play on that server. Starting to become quite the social butterfly.<br><br>Back to the main story. 4 months later, staff applications open up. I've never moderated before, but it seems like it'd be really neat. At the same time, it seems rather stressful, so I don't bother applying. I hear about some good friends of mine applying, and I wish them good luck. We start to have a cute little discussion about it, and other people start to join in. This is what happens on Avicus. This is just your average game.<br><br>The point is, there's no exact science to it. As long as you regularly play on the servers, and enjoy playing on the servers, you can become well-known (as a regular) in just a couple months. If you've been playing on the servers for 1 year, 2 years, or even more, you can still be considered a regular.. It just depends on what you've done in the past, and what you do present day. Not everybody wants to be a regular, and not everybody is able to become one. You don't need to be well known, or even "popular" to enjoy your time on the servers, which is all that you need to remember about this lengthy post.&nbsp;<br><br>x) Nobody is going to read through all of that lol

It isn't really a measurable thing. I guess a regular is just someone who plays avicus often. They don't really need to be on teamspeak or the forums often.<br>I consider regulars as the people who are on teamspeak quite a bit, but also the ones who I see post often on the forums and pretty much those who I see whenever I'm in game.

I read it :)&nbsp;<br><br>Anyway, I think a regular is someone who plays maybe around 3-4 days a week and for around 2 hours maybe? And they would probably have to be on the forums and maybe TS?

I reckon someone who regularly engages in community activities and is friendly. Is maturely partaking in discussions on forums and helping out as much as they can. Being a frequent player doesn't really apply to being a "regular".
