Anyone know the proper way to upgrade a rank? If you have Gold to Emerald or Emerald to Diamond?

pretty sure you go about buying the rank you want as normal and it will show you how much the net cost is later in the purchase

Yeah, either do what Mooch said, or buy another Emerald and have a senior staff member merge it to diamond for you.

You have emerald and a gold rank you would need to buy another gold then contact a sr staff member to get diamond.

It would be faster contacting them on skype or in-game.

When it says that you have to be upgraded to play/join the game it means the game is full. And the only way to play when a game is full is to be a donator by getting one of the three ranks in the shop (<a href="http://www.avicus.net/shop)">www.avicus.net/shop)</a>.<br>Otherwise I would recommend doing /join exactly once you get teleported to the new map to join.

Please note that you're only required to have a premium rank to join games when they're exclusively&nbsp;<b>full&nbsp;</b>(or exceeding maximum player capacity on both teams).<br><br>If you purchase a premium rank you'll be able to join full games and you also are given a credit multiplier (you earn credits faster).<br><br>To purchase a rank you go to&nbsp;<a href="https://avicus.net/shop" title="Link: https://avicus.net/shop">https://avicus.net/shop</a>&nbsp;and follow the steps given.<br>If you have a problem with your purchase you can email support@avicus.net or contact a Staff Member (perferibly a Senior Moderator or Administrator) for assistance.
