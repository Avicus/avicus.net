So, Minecraft servers can now sell items? I don't have much thoughts on this but I suppose it benefits hunger games servers and such.

It's good, however , I would've thought that they would've put some restrictions in place. They mainly removed servers selling game changing stuff because on some servers people would either be paying hundreds of pounds/dollars for op stuff. For example, on one server you can pay $300 for the 'emperor' class rank. On skywars everyday you get /kit emporer. You receive 64 diamonds, op armour and 64 bedrock. BEDROCK. On their ctf gamemode players normally start with no armour and stone tools. Emporers receive full iron armour, diamond tools with a fire aspect, sharp II iron sword. Out of their many games they offer this is two I can remember but I assure you that this server is literally the definition of pay to win. ._. Although small things, which a lot of small servers have, are normally good and help the server receive money as the ranks/items are somewhat worthwhile buying.

Well it's the player who spent $300 on a pixel game's fault, just to kill everyone with no skill, lucky for the owner then.
