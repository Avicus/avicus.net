As most of us know is that we are losing a lot of Ood members like JKawesome etc. I know that its horrible to see the people go. But haven't you noticed that more people are coming? The next Generation of this Community is coming and we cant stop it. Though so of the Old members with still be here and some will leave. Don't lose hope in the Commuinty. Cause the next Generation of this community will be just as amazing as the last. It looks like Avicus/Mczone has gone through 2 Generations of the Commuinty and it looks like the new on is coming very soon. Don't lose hope :)

It is sad to see all the veterans go. We are a dying species. The veterans who are still here are mostly inactive. I myself am guilty of this. Yes it is nice to see the new people however pretty soon no veterans will be left. One leaves. Another follows. So forth.

In case you havent noticed, you dont get anymore of these horrible posts trying to describe how much the community needs to improve anymore.<br><br>There is no longer a need for them, due to the simple fact that the problems have been solved...<br><br>EDIT: you spelled community wrong in the thread name.

Compare the amount of leaving posts to the "introduce yourself" posts. There are atleast twice as much introduction posts, yet people say Avicus is falling apart.
