<b>1 </b>- They are currently private however Ivy has teased a lot on his twitter.<br><b>2</b> - Most of the development stuff is private, so stay in the dark<br><b>3</b> - AvicoreV2 is an update to Avicore. All I know right now is lots more YAML features, possible new gamemodes. Ivy streams it sometimes and no I don't do plugin/web stuff however I can do docs and maps. It will allow for hopefully more customization and enjoyment from the player. Website will have a lot of stuff like an API page and more, but for now most of that is private.&nbsp;<br><b>4 </b>- Those are private too<br><b>5</b> - We don't give ETAs

@TheMasterCow : I just looked at the twitter and I must have missed what you are talking about, I looked at both the Ivycode and avicus twitter. I do see some updates, but nothing but bug fixes and optimization of the forums and the like, alos avicore is more backend correct? &nbsp;and the API is not really for the end user is it?.<br><br>I really like your #2 "&nbsp;<span>Most of the development stuff is private, so stay in the dark" great answer - really gets me excited!<br><br>How is the API going to help the average player? &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;an&nbsp;<b>application programming interface</b>&nbsp;(<b>API</b>)&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification">specifies</a>&nbsp;how some&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_component">software components</a><span>&nbsp;should interact with each other correct? Not sure how this will help , but if you say so.<br></span><span><br>So everything is pretty much Private? So you really&nbsp;don't&nbsp;have anything to contribute to the&nbsp;thread, other than " Private" and we don't give ETA's?<br><br>The purpose of the thread was to share information about what the avicus network is working on, what great things are in the works, and why we should be excited, and what we can look forward to. Please only respond if you have something to contribute, saying <b>"Private"</b> ,<b> "Stay in the dark"</b>,<b> "We don't give ETAs"</b> Really does not belong in this thread as it states from the beginning <i>"&nbsp;</i></span><i>Anything at all that raises the bar, gets the player base excited, makes us better / different than the other servers? Post if you know about anything official!" &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></i><span><br>Thanks @TheMasterCow<br><br><br><br></span>

@Arachadonic - IKR?<br><br>The post was made &nbsp;so that if anyone knew of anything exciting in the pipeline it would come to the surface, nothing more , nothing less I just haven't seen a lot on the forums about new stuff other than the maps thingy and since I may have missed a post I though this would be a cool way of resurfacing anything exciting.<br><br>&nbsp;Was just a question :)

You can send an email to support@avicus.net stating why he/she was punished and why he/she should be appealed.&nbsp;<br><br>I'd recommend not posting things regarding the players infraction as it will drastically affect his chance of being appealed.
