Also apologies, I really want to watch the stream and give feedback but Australia is in a storm at the moment and the internet is dropping in and out. Will it be exported to youtube somewhere to watch afterwards?

If it goes well, yes. I just have to find a way to fill out chest gear and add a time limit. It would be nice if I could have the mao crumble.

I was thinking of having Sky Wars be more mixed up so it's more interesting:<br>- Two team Sky Wars<br>- 12-16 Team Sky Wars<br>- Free-for-all Sky Wars<br><br>These would be better in a rotation, and attract more players. I could make the rotation switch off each one so you would know when one of your favorites are coming on.

Great to see you're trying to make skywars again Para! Just one question the old skywars from MCZone was created by JTCool? Or something like that?

Was thinking about getting some maps from Throwback (e.g Dust Devils) and chopping parts of it up into islands.
