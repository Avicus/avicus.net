Well, as many of you have stated it would be difficult to find a group of Avicus Community Members to create a new lobby. Well, an idea came to mind. I'm one of two owners of a build team called Raging Builds (Rage Inc.) And we have created multiple maps for Avicus already. So now all I need is feedback. Do you guys want Rage Inc. to build the new lobby instead of Hyperscale? (Nothing against them, they are phenomenal builders.) Feedback would be greatly appreciated.<br><br>Regards, -Jake

No offense, but hyper scale is one of the best solo builders. No one on avicus can really get near him. You guys are map makers, which is great, but hyper scale is a detailed builder. I would suggest hyper scale, honestly I would love to see you guys make one, as jake ROX, DE END. But yeah, have a go at it!

There should be a competition of Avicus build teams for the spawn.<br>But sure, Rage Inc. Is good. :)

Honestly, its just a hard comparison. You guys are map makers, which might have a not as good looking lobby but with great fun and gameplay on it. But hyper scale would be sure to turn out a masterpiece of a build, but the game play aspect is leaning either way for them.

But Hyperscale isn't solo... watch his streams. And I think the staff team probably has a new lobby covered.

:/<br><br>And hyper scale is pretty much solo. There is one terrain guy, but he usually doesn't too much. One guy does all the builds, and most terrain.

@Koo: Well yeah, obviously Hyperscale would put out a masterpiece of a lobby. But think of it this way, we have Para and Evo, both of our map developers on Avicus, Slicorn, just an insane builder, Cobalt838, and many more outstanding builders. I honestly think we've got a good shot at this. If not, Hyper can take over.
