I would just like a formal response from a Senior Staff or above on whether "Fake Hacking" and trolling the staff by doing this is allowed. When I was an Admin, it wasn't allowed, but I am not too sure about it now. I highly believe that fake hacking with the intent to troll should be against the rules, but things are changing. If this isn't a rule anymore, then I will be sure to be testing the skills of all staff.

There is nothing against it but, now that the Staff have stirred a commotion, people will want to do it now.

Don't act like it was the Staff who "stirred up commotion"<br><br>They made one post and there were players apparently posting rude comments. You may as well just say 'Avicus' started it up.
