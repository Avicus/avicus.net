Please do something about the server lag. Minecraft is a very simple game there is no way that Avicus can't possible lag this much, but it does. Everyone wants more players to come to Avicus well first get rid of the crazy lag spikes that ruin the gamplay. (I know its not my computer now, its 100% server related I don't get this much lag on any other server). FPS lag, block lag and random damage lag fix one of them please.

I don't notice anything and I am European. You sure its not your ISP? As for the fall damage from 3 blocks, I've had it happen in survival singleplayer before so I don't think its server related.

Yes. It could be your ISP and their connection to the Avicus host.

If it would be the ISP it wouldn't be just one person it would be people with that ISP. I doubt it is anyway but it could be.

I don't think it could be, my connection to the server is completely fine (around 15ms). As Zeus just said its not just me that's laggy everyone gets random fps drops probably at the worst times.

Nope, it isn't, heck, when I'm going down a staircase with no stairs, without jumping, I randomly take fall damage...<br><br>@OP I agree so much, with all my soul, I just want the random freezes when a mon gets broken gone, the block lag, the countless times I've died after MLG block placing on Quintus ( probably 50 mons in the last 3 months gone, and that's ONLY on Quintus.) and th block lag while wall walking, just, please. This is a block game, it makes no sense anymore.

I take damage from jumping... The random half a heart damage taking can really mess things up. Like when it messes up your jumping momentum, your jump fails mid way
