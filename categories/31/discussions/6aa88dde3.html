Since this is all opinion based and usually can't be backed up with facts I am going to put me in this, I lead PPB when I rush. I am the only defender to get a touch in the unofficial tournament. It was even against the big team called Bad Players. This is why I am the best in Avicus. Now people are going to call me arrogant because I have an opinion and even if someone else believe I am not, I am not going to tell them they are wrong but I still will be called arrogant because players want to look big.

When I think best rusher I think armorless badass that has a 99% black skin and doesn't give a shit and gets the monument in less than a minute so I'm gonna say JKawesome/Hacktivism and Sethskye... there's also MasterProX who gets monuments alone without telling the team when he's gonna do it...

Best rusher I think is Remus. It's unbelievable how he carries the offenders in every scrim no matter what team he plays for. He always gets the wool or the monument while screaming HELP MEEEEEEIEIIEIEIE and comes back, usually double caps or double monuments, he's a god. Jivexd tazz are really good as well. There is also the holy carry Lego, he's a legend
