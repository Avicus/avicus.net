As you can most likely tell - I've been demoted.<div><br>I got this message.<br><br></div><div>"Unfortunately, the Sr Staff team has decided to revoke your Moderator rank, and demote you during the reassessment. This is due to the fact that you havenâ€™t been very consistent with your job in detecting hacks, and overall moderation (<a href="http://avicus.net/infractions?staff=awesome_apricot." title="Link: http://avicus.net/infractions?staff=awesome_apricot.">http://avicus.net/infractions?staff=awesome_apricot.</a>) If you have a concern, message me or another admin."<br><br>Apparently I am not up to standards. <br>[15/08/2015 23:46:51] Tyler / DoctaPop / PoppaDoc: Well, it was also the fact that yes, you did do reports a lot, just wasn't very...<div>[15/08/2015 23:46:51] Tyler / DoctaPop / PoppaDoc: Right<br><br>I still can't make sense of that. ^<br><br>Oh, and if I did all of this (below) what was the problem?<br><br><div>[15/08/2015 23:44:27] Tyler / DoctaPop / PoppaDoc: You did a lot.

Take Tyn for example. He was on leave - and got demoted for inactivity. When he challenged the decision they said it was from before his LoA. Fishy.&nbsp;<br><br>I had been working on a Social Media project and was only really getting started. I'd become more active on the Twitter handle that it had ever seen before and was literally just about to pay real moneys into promoting the server on Facebook.&nbsp;<br><br>This work went mostly unnoticed and I didn't really mind - I'm not that attention seeking.<br><br>To be frank, I loved being a moderator, but will never come back to that shit. People I thought I trusted stabbed me in the back. And for that I'm pretty pissed off. Oh, and yet to mention Steven was promoted. Not to be mean Steven, you're a nice kid, just not a mature moderator.&nbsp;<br><br>Oh, and did I mention it was without warning.&nbsp;<br><br>When I came back I was told by the senior staff they wanted me to change the way I moderated chat - to be less casual and be stricter. And I did. I constantly asked whether I was doing ok, but only got "yeah, fine"'s.&nbsp;<br><br>A warning would have been nice, to be honest, so thanks for that.<br><br>But ya, a bug SMH to Avicus. I'll stick around for a bit to play around and have shits and giggles but i feel I've been well and truly done over here after all.&nbsp;<br><br>PS seniors don't tell me to take this to a private place, I have nothing to hide and you shouldn't either because it's a community thing.</div>

You weren't a bad staff member, just some of your recent actions kinda made certain people upset. I know that isn't the reason you were demoted but those actions played a role I'm sure, they could have been prevented using common sense. I do want to say thank you for your dedication &nbsp;as mod and streamer, you volunteered your time thank you for that.

Apricot, no. You established a lot of contributions and basis for things that I've not seen other staff members do, and I feel like out of the moderator team, there's only a few that go above and beyond moderating. You did a lot more, you were willing to do it, and you had so much more potential than you ever got credit for. By standing on the sidelines, I saw you act not only mature and well conducted, but one of the most approachable and kind staff members that, even, impressed me. Your infractions seem to be consistent and you did take reports a lot -- probably more than most, and even me, but I still have to honor everything you did as a moderator.<br><br>I don't know the context or story behind your demotion, but with the vague answer given, that I do not agree with. I do not agree with how there may not be evidence provided or presented to you, and I don't agree with demoting you withholding absolutely no warning. There's been a lot of disorganization and misconceptions as it's been a rough couple of weeks for the staff team, going through admins and senior mods a lot, but you had upmost potential to go farther and it's mind boggling how you were completely booted out. I can only say for now best wishes, but you were quite so an honor to work with, an honor to talk to, and an honor having you as a map maker for the time I was map developer - so many interesting conversations sparked.<br><br>You were one of a kind, I hope to see you back in the staff team soon, and hopefully with all ends tied. I think you deserve another chance, and I hope in your name and honor that you won't behave salty about your demotion. You helped author the next chapter to avicus, you should finish it. So many good ideas and helpful motives wasted if you don't.<br><br>You actually even helped motivate <u>me</u>...

You are a better staff than the admins and Sr mods. You acted as a leader and you never got yourself into stupid posts and when you did you acted mature. Staff should look at you and say "this is the type of attitude I need" It is a shame that you were demodded and it is sad you won't come back.

lol u were a good staff member but why bring Tynvale in?<br><br>He was reported to tel when he was admin that for the time period of his jr mod position and mod position (first month and a half I believe) he had only given 6 infractions... meaning 2 months and a half and only 6 infractions. Not sure what happened afterwards if he got a warning or not but I'm sure that was put as a not in demotion, so don't be saying he was active xd

Lol, the staff team just lost one of their best moderators on the server, this guy is far better than some moderators I have seen on this server, heck, better than some senior moderators, just wow. Billy, had potential to become Senior Moderator, and he would have done more than the current senior moderators. So stupid. I'm so pissed. And I'm not one to get easily pissed. It's a shame that a wonderful moderator is gone tonight. Shame on you staff team.

Even though you don't particularly like me. I still have massive respect for you. The day you joined the TS, I was with you and spoke to you for ages. I was begging you to come back to the staff team. If the Senior staff don't like you, then kiss goodbye to your rank. It's how it operates. No warnings, they don't even attempt to help you improve. The staff team is lost since Jozz stepped down. Anyways, thanks for everything Billy.

We had a reassessment day like you guys wanted. One thing I think we need to do is work on our communication because it's a pile of shit right now. Another thing is, when the community continuously release their anger on the mods and seniors, they aren't doing anything. WE don't develop anything, when it comes to that, it's up to Pav, Kylo, and Javi. Trust me, if I could code, I would implement anything you guys wanted as long as it was reasonable. Of course, you guys also try to tell us about problems we can fix, and most of us try to fix it. I disagree with a lot of stuff the seniors do, but I respect them because they try.<br><br>now, answer my question

Sorry about that, m9. I know we hardly know each other, and our only 1-on-1 conversation, was... edgy, to say the least.<br><br>I also got demoted without warning, though I can't say I didn't see it coming. This reassessment day had some good decisions, and some bad ones. Your demotion was by far the worst of those decisions.

Truth be told, iunno why you were demoted, Petlas, but that's not what I'm here to talk about.<br><br>Apricot, you really do deserve a second chance. I know I deserved my demotion, but I saw no reason to demote you. At all.

I'm so sorry I did not see this thread before, but certainly senior staff made a huge mistake in demoting you.&nbsp;<br><br>Whatever they may say, I still consider you my friend as you have always talked to me with kind words and always with enthusiasm in what was done. Always bear in mind, regardless if you come back as a staff (some mistakes can be fixed, I guess), you're a great guy, mature and fun to chat with, &nbsp;and in my opinion a great staff member I'd love to have back with us.&nbsp;<br><br>I'd also love to talk a bit with you when I get back this Saturday from holidays.&nbsp;<br><br>:)

First off, Mods not doing there job proper: Locking post while it shouldn't, and disagreeing with points that are true.<br>Secondly: With staff, I also mean the developers as you would probably know, in the community eyes they look like they are lazy af, so many bugs and you guys know of it, but has anything been done, no.<br>Third point: Giving people like apricot and others a reason to hate the staff team.<br><br>EDIT to my second point: Dev's don't start freaking new projects if you have so many problems, think about it listen to the freaking community, if you don't listen like you've been doing for the past 6months the server will basically die.

Seems like you have some problems with me I guess, as I'm kinda the most active right now, correct me if I'm wrong.&nbsp;<br><br>I'd like you to give some constructive criticism to me, personally if you wish, about what would you like to see done.&nbsp;<br><br>But what I really find unfair is that you see me being "lazy af" &nbsp;when I'm constantly doing stuff and trying to get feedback from the community and creating key ass long threads about improvements when I'm supposed to be on a 3 week break. You can call me whatever you want and I'd probably not get as shocked as in here. If you think we are not doing stuff, check the development logs and revisions page, and if you are going to call me lazy for having a holiday, I'm afraid I will ignore that comment.

Hm what interests me most is why if you were 'really' doing something wrong did they not tell you / help you. Since the best way to make a good team staff &nbsp;is to not do a reassessment , kick , kick , kick.Instead , re-assess them then help them. After &nbsp;a week then kick perhaps.

Apricot = God. Seniors are shit lately, some more than others. They demoted you, petlas and planned to demote greg. All three of you had top 5 spots on being good staff imo. The seniors have a huge disconnect from the community and major issues with bias and bullshit. :) Sad to see you off the staff team but stick around TS kiddo.

A reassessment has always had them be demoted on the spot, and I myself prefer it to be that way. If A staff member has glaring flaws, they should demote them and tell them what they did wrong. It takes a long time to do one of those fucking assessments, lots of writing and thinking and if some seniors dont agree on the majority? They can debate for the verdict to be changed.

I agree with it to a quite small extent, as maybe not seeing things directly in the game is already a "you guys are lazy". I don't agree with that though. Also you say it looks like we are lazy when there are clear signs of stuffs that are about to happen or that are being worked on. &nbsp;I also disagree with that mean definition of "lazy".
