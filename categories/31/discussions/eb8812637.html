I realized I didn't make a post after the tournament asking for feedback and improvements for future streams. (even if I don't return to the media team, this can help for streams for other games/tournaments. I streamed the majority of last tournament so any constructive criticism can go towards me. I have a couple of questions I'd like you guys to answer regarding the stream as viewers. With that said, please disregard the first stream during qualifiers round, It was static cronus vs cacal, a great match but was ruined do to my poor stream which was fixed afterwards. I'm going to list my suggested improvements for myself and future tournament streams and hopefully I can give you guys what you want to see. I also streamed from 7am-1pm, and 8am-3pm so cut me some slack :P. I think the best part was my commentating in my opinion.&nbsp;<i>Shout out&nbsp;to my co-commentators&nbsp;last tournament Pokerface, and Tomqss, and streamer Xtra.</i><br><b><br>Future Possible additions<br></b><ol><li>Nightbot(which includes commands such as !bracket which will send a link of the bracker) and much more commands</li><li>Possible facecam? (thoughts?)</li><li>More after game/before game interviews</li><li>More interaction with viewers(GIVEAWAYS)</li><li>Possible way to bet credits(doubt its possible but the g0d developers may be able to) But more strawpolls</li></ol><br><br>I'm also thinking of the overlay, what could be done to improve it? I am thinking of a facecam box(if you guys are interested in some streamers using it) and also an area where it shows the commentators and who they picked to win the match. So, if you want to comment below on your thoughts of these ideas, and if you watched last tournament, some improvements to be made. I will be adding ideas to the list above. Thanks guys!

if you don't like my stream quality, then you stream. You are just as qualified as me. Or just don't watch it.

That's quite a retarded attitude. As a watcher I give you feedback and you should consider it in a serious way and not just tell me to stream

Giveaways can only happen if the streamers are sponsored credits/items.<br><br>I did one in the TDM tourney and that was pretty much the end of that.<br><br>Facecams might be cringy like&nbsp;<img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/fa83f6f2ef214dc3b11a2b21d16e2b8c?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/Rombeyy.html" style="color: none">Rombeyy</a> said.<br><br>All the other stuff I completely agree with and have suggested before.

Facecams are unneeded in a competitive stream. In a stream where you are playing a video game alone and it is about your experience, that is about you so it would make it more personable if you were to put your face. <br><br>Now in a competitive setting, this is completely different. People want to see the teams play against each other. The main goal of a commentator is to help the person who is watching to understand the situations better and give facts that help them understand the team more.
