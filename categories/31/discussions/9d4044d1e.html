Hello.<br><br>I would like to issue a notice that Senior Staff and Developers only will be allowed access into scrimmage servers, even during active scrims. This is just to provide more efficiency in solving any issues that may occur which pertain to scrimmage servers. If you see a senior staff in a scrimmage server, now you know why!<br><br>Seniors will not partake in the scrimmage when they are spectating.<br><br>Feel free to share your opinions below.<br><br>Regards,<br>Senior Staff Team

What if the teams who are scrimming don't want a member of the staff in their server?

You can politely ask them to leave and they'll do so; we know scrimmage servers are there for your enjoyment and we're not going to babysit you the whole time. However, if a report or issue occurs that involves a senior staff member coming to the scrimmage server, they will proceed to do so, and that can't be stopped. <br>Don't worry, we won't spoil your fun. ;p

This does not apply to moderators simply to prevent abuse. We are testing this permission with the senior staff first, and we may change this in the future, if all goes well.

I can assure you iron the seniors won't do that. This is simply just so we can start dealing with player reports and issues on the scrim servers.

Assuming this is in place already, can infractions be held of until the scrimmage is over?
