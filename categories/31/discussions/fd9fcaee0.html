Avicus Staff Team

</h1>
This thread is about the Avicus Staff team being biased and unorganized.<br><br>The organization is terrible; a guy that I know was denied, one sr staff member said that he got 2 greens on his staff app, another one said that he got 1 green and another one said that he had no greens. Other then that, Peachy gets added back instantly to sr mod while for example pelpelajax asked Para to come back but has been told that he needed to start from the bottom. ALM gets promoted to dev while he hacked on the network, hmm seems nice.&nbsp;<br><br>Literally, Avicus get your shit together.&nbsp;<br>Whoever locks this you should be proud. If you try to lock this because the community is going ham on you, just don't. Let people say what they want to say, let them share their opinions.

Peachy said he'd be fine as junior mod, but the administration team offered him a space as senior; being a retired admin who left on good terms, you can't expect much else.

But why did someone else who wants to get back from retirement not get sr offered like Peachy?

I don't understand? Care to rephrase?<br><br>-What do you mean PelPel asked Para to come back? Also, if you get demoted you do have to start from junior moderator.--&gt; Unless, you get a vote to come back as senior mod/mod. Lastly, Para retired from senior mod.<br><br>-Peachy was a very good administrator, he left on very good terms. Hence, he was allowed back under some consideration from the senior staff team. (As Jack said, Peachy wanted Jr Mod first.)<br><br>-ALM's promotion to Dev is not something that we would know about, nor is it related to the staff. Only Funky picks each Dev; therefore, only he has the final say on who gets Dev or not.<br><br>Just my opinion.

Budah ily but this is just stupid you know.<br><br>To start of. Ur first statement is related to Senior Staff, and therefore not Staff. You should make that clear. Also, I have no idea how Sr.Staff is being unorganized by giving of application results when requested. It could simply be a mistake, seeing as you only provide one example.<br><br>2nd of, pelp was admin for literally 1 week or something. You couldnt really say he was a proper long time admin. Peachy however, was admin for around 2 months.<br><br>To finish it up, you have 0 proof of ALM hacking. From all I heard, it's rumors.<br>Edit: if what you are saying is true, that ALM hacked 5 months ago, why do you care? It was 5 months ago and he got appealed. If he truly hacked, and there is proof, he would be banned. I really dont understand why you would bring up such a stupid topic.<br><br><br>Avicus is pretty bad, but not because of ur reasons. It's because of the stale and boring maps aswell as the pvp being quite bad when you cant shoot through enemies and the KB being fucked af.

I cant detect the sarcasm, assuming it's there... I'd you would like an example, the mentoring team was not completey a senior staff decision AFAIK the mods did have a say. They also have the ability to voice opinions about the promotions and demotions of people. (On slack)

I agree, but they have improved over the last couple of months.&nbsp;<br><br>We told them to get their shit together, and they are doing that, so give them a break. I honestly think we've complained enough at this point, they get what we want and they are working on it.<br><br>And remember, this is from a guy who used to be toxic af against Staff, and has multiple infractions, so I'm not being biased here.

Budah ily but this is just stupid you know.<br><br>To start of. Ur first statement is related to Senior Staff, and therefore not Staff. You should make that clear. Also, I have no idea how Sr.Staff is being unorganized by giving of application results when requested. It could simply be a mistake, seeing as you only provide one example.<br><br>2nd of, pelp was admin for literally 1 week or something. You couldnt really say he was a proper long time admin. Peachy however, was admin for around 2 months.<br><br>To finish it up, you have 0 proof of ALM hacking. From all I heard, it's rumors.<br>Edit: if what you are saying is true, that ALM hacked 5 months ago, why do you care? It was 5 months ago and he got appealed. If he truly hacked, and there is proof, he would be banned. I really dont understand why you would bring up such a stupid topic.<br><br><br>Avicus is pretty bad, but not because of ur reasons. It's because of the stale and boring maps aswell as the pvp being quite bad when you cant shoot through enemies and the KB being fucked af.

Not necessarily true that if there was evidence alm would still be banned. I hacked blatantly a while ago because I thought it was just so funny and got appealed around 4-5 months later. Obviously I apologized and all that jazz, but he could've hacked and still been appealed.

Another thing, people like ALM &nbsp;get treated differently in the fact that they break the rules but go unpunished purely because they help the server, in reality if they were really dedicated to the server and cared about it they wouldn't break the rules in the first place.

Ok seriously, why the heck do yall care who gets senior and who doesn't?<br><br>Staff are supposed to maintain a fair, friendly and efficient server. &nbsp;So this guy gets sr mod and another guy gets a trial, why do you all care? If it gets us closer to maintaining that fair, friendly and efficient community, then why is it questioned? &nbsp;If it works, then it works, who cares if it seems odd? &nbsp;The Senior staff can shift the rules around if it means they are trying to make the server more ideal. &nbsp;I have no clue why Peachy got Sr Mod and Pel has to start at Jr, but you know what, The Seniors decided that it was for the best so be content with it. &nbsp;<br><br>About people getting different answers from mods, let me tell you, that's going to be the case wherever you go, some people are in charge of staff apps, and they know the facts, others know a little bit, and will give the best of their knowledge, so you might get different answers, the only thing that can fix this is for mods to ask the person who knows best about the question, before giving the asker an answer. &nbsp;But sometimes that person isnt available, so mods will give it their best to answer to their ability, someone is keeping track i assure you.<br><br>Now i understand wanting to know whats going on inside the staff, its natural to want to know, but the community criticizes everything, "ALM IS DEV, WHY, HE HACKED", he must have gotten appealed? Cool? Cool. &nbsp;And now he is helping out, for the better of the community! &nbsp;Why are you mad? He's already working on alot for the server! Who cares if he hacked? He was sorry, and he was appealed. &nbsp;If he hacks again, he'll get banned again. simple, no need to get angry over it. &nbsp;<br><br>Ultimately, the Senior Staff don't have to follow the mass's criteria if it is impoving the server. &nbsp;They are doing it for the best, don't outrage over stuff like this, or when someone gets demoted. You can get mad if someone decides to make a change to the server and you disagree with it, if someone gets promoted, demoted or anything, its for the better for the community, the staff arent your enemies, I know im technically a part of the stuff, but this is coming from the standpoint of a player, not a staffer.

We care about who gets senior mod so the server can maximise its potential, if you don't care who's in the senior staff team then you obviously don't care for the server.

Actually, just to clarify. Nowadays, interviews aren't done for senior. Its just a senior staff vote afaik. However, I do actually agree somewhat with your statement. I cannot/We cannot deny that what you stated is inevitably the outcome of promotions like such. However, as someone who has wanted Senior since I got demoted, I am all up for Peachy getting senior if he can prove himself! :)

It's not that I don't care who is in the senior team, but I trust that the senior staff aren't doing it for no reason. &nbsp;They have a reason for giving it to peachy and not to pel, there must be a reason, I am just tired of people getting angry over every decision the senior staff makes, I'm not saying your one of them but there are many who question every dang decision. &nbsp;Too many have zero trust in seniors decisions, but of course I know you want the best for the server, I do too, I just feel that the seniors deserve some slack, they get crap for doing anything and for doing nothing.

I do agree that the active mods should be considered first, but the point I'm trying to make is. Maybe the seniors didn't consider any of them ready yet? Evo was promoted to senior so it's not like every senior has been coming back from retirement, but I do agree with your statement, the mods ate working hard and most of them would love an opportunity at senior

You say seniors have a reason, you can't be so sure, you've never been close to the senior staff team, trust me it's a lot different on the inside. We're not angry as a sense of rampage, more like frustration, because we know they can do better, that's constructive criticism. Also, have you ever thought that an opinion from someone who's not in the staff team who's looking at from a completely different angle can see the problems the staff members are blind to?

You guys say we didn't give you info on Para's demotion when 1) There's a thread on it, so yes we did and 2) usually when a staff member is demoted, we don't explain it in depth unless the former staff member wants to.<br><br><br>I realize our team and communication needs work and I realize many members of the community need to look on the bright side and try not to care about things that don't affect them at all. Ever since Michael got Sr again, he's managed to have every staff member at least TRY to be more active, and if they fail to do that, they end up losing their teamspeak rank.&nbsp;<br><br>We are improving and although it is slow, it's much better Han what was happening before. I've accepted all the feedback one the feedback spreadsheet even though it wasn't much, and I think I'm improving quite a bit.<br><br>Demotions and promotions are inconsistent, but you need to think of it experience wise. If an admin named Bob was admin for a 3 days (pretty normal for Avicus) and decided to retire, and an admin named Joe was admin for 6 months (haven't sent that in awhile) then obviously, promoting Joe to a senior position and Bob to a junior position would make plenty of sense since Joe has so much more experience.

What gets me to listen to Avicus players is when they actually put proof and good reasons behind what they are saying. Caleb has done this earlier in the week and I have asked a few staff members to look at his thread carefully. If more people acted like him in threads like these then I would make sure the staff listen or at least talk about the problems. Threads like this will be answered less because I do not see anything useful in the thread. Just someone complaining and letting off steam. People are complaining about something yet no real reasons have been explained well for action to be done.

Thus the Avicadian Civil War begins...again...<br><br>Regarding ALM's promotion to developer, if he really did hack and it's not just a rumor, he got unbanned, obviously, since the infraction is gone. If he was brought back, the senior staff team let bygones be bygones, so I suggest you guys do the same. And if he's caught hacking again, he'll be demoted, no questions asked. Simple as that.<br><br>And going off of what Vlad was saying (kudos for saying what you did, Vlad), these immediate Sr. Staff promotions are really...annoying, for lack of a better word. While I do ardently believe that Peachy was/is a good staff member, it comes at the expense of the opportunities of others. I know when I was a moderator, I tried my hardest to become a senior after a few months (and naturally, that never happened, but I still tried :P). I'm sure the majority of the current moderator team is striving to do the same thing, but instead of giving them a chance, the Sr. staff just pull former members from out of nowhere and say "Hey, want a free Sr. mod rank? It won't take any effort at all!" The other moderators already put in a lot of effort as is, but all these efforts are pretty much in vain because the former members of the Sr. staff steal the spotlight. And I get it, these "former members" worked for their ranks back when they were Jr. mods and moderators, but then why is it that only certain ones immediately get Sr. while others have to start from scratch? It just doesn't seem right to me. The sooner this new rule that Arigenn is talking about gets implemented, the sooner this problem will be solved (hopefully, at least).

I suggestion I could offer is to help promote the Avicus community slack. It was made for a reason. Hell, there's even a whole section dedicated to discussing relations between community and staff. If we could get more people on that, it could help (or you could completely disregard me, the guy with no charisma :3).

I do have to be honest and admit that the staff team is having a few problems. However, as Elsa stated above: "We still aren't perfect" and we may never be. There will always be problems, but we are trying to do what we can at the moment. At the moment the senior staff team has been working hard to improve the staff as a whole.<br><br>It would be much appreciated if the ones who are involved could provide constructuive criticism that could help us improve rather than complaining and providing no information at all.<br><br>Please contact me if you have any issues and would like to discuss it privately. Otherwise, let's tone down on the rude remarks.

Any staff can confirm my ambitions for the community slack. I had a lot planned for the slack that I now can't do due to my demotion. I may pass off some of these ideas to the admins, but I can't set things in stone anymore. Some of those was using the feedback channel more, asking frequent questions of improvement, and usually I got the requests done immediately, or to try a representation system of those that could provide rational argumentation for things, much like a debate team of sorts.<br><br>Hopefully the community slack isn't abandoned... it's really a useful tool. Pretty sure the admins wouldn't revert my progress like that.

I'm in complete agreement, and it kind of annoys me that there are only 22 people that are in that conversation. I would tend to think that a lot of staff would be there, but it turns out only half the staff team is part of it.

We just seem to rotate through staff.<br>Moderators, Senior Moderators, Admins.<br><br>Instead of focusing on keeping staff around longer by training them and giving them appropriate criticism/warnings, we're more concerned with recruiting more and more staff. And if a staff member isn't doing well then they just get demoted after having one chat with a Senior. <br><br>It's like a rotating door and it's been like that for a while.

I know how it feels dude, I've seen many like you during my time as staff and if you really want that rewarding red rank then you have to go out there and try your best, that's all the staff team can ask for.

In my opinion, I see nothing wrong in what you've been doing as a junior.<br><br>My advice for you is to keep asking questions and show the seniors that you're keen to learn and become better. <br><br>When I was a mentor I would always prefer my Juniors to ask a ton of questions and learn from them as opposed to keeping quiet and struggling in silence. <br><br>I encourage you and the rest of the juniors to keep asking questions. <br><br>There is no such thing as a stupid question and don't be afraid to make mistakes, every mistake is fixable and there is always something to learn from a mistake. <br>That's how you get better.&nbsp;<br><br>If you show them that you're passionate about this and if you show them that you want to learn and do more, you will go places.

I just read the last 2 pages of this postand i died laughing, please staff and snow get back on topic, snows demotion and him not getting seniorcan be discussed privately over skype or ts.&nbsp;<br>On topic: I do agree we are kind of unorginized but we are constantly working to improve that. I can tell you that admins are contacting the staff team (including jr mods, contacted me) abd asked for feedback, which wasnt done by past admins and imo is great. Thats just an example, but i assure you that the new admin/s are doing a great job compared to previous ones.

True Dat,<br><br>Recently the staff have all received ratings compiled by seniors in a variety of sectors. This has been pretty cool to see, I think that the results could be compiled and then averaged. The averages for each section could then be shared with the community.

Gah what. A rating system? Its not a job, you're not getting paid and there should certainly not be performance reviewers. The staff team should be a group of friends, passionate about supporting the community.

A rating system designed to provide feedback and suggestions. Some people find it useful, some don't. Its intention is good, hence I have no problems with it. The rating's are not public and are only for your own general sense of where you stand. Also, "<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; ">Its not a job, you're not getting paid and there should certainly not be performance reviewers." is highly invalid. Although not a job, it is our job to maintain the servers quality, hence getting a performance check is quite useful. If you didn't realize you were shit at using TS, getting a 1 would awaken you, hopefully making you use TS more.</span>

Why are you stereotyping the staff as a whole? As I've previously stated, the majority of the staff try and they are good at their jobs. This is not just directed at you, by the way. I'm talking to everyone who is insulting the staff team.<br><br>As Iron said, give us criticism that we can use to improve, or stop insulting us. The choice is yours. As a former staff member, I thought you'd understand the difficulty of the staff team's jobs.

Hey, I can ensure you that we are ALL working our hardest to improve upon feedback given to us. From my position, I am definitely able to see significant changes in certain individuals, after receiving feedback.

Why are you stereotyping the staff as a whole? As I've previously stated, the majority of the staff try and they are good at their jobs. This is not just directed at you, by the way. I'm talking to everyone who is insulting the staff team.<br><br>As Iron said, give us criticism that we can use to improve, or stop insulting us. The choice is yours. As a former staff member, I thought you'd understand the difficulty of the staff team's jobs.
