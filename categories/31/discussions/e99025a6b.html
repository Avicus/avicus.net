Maybe he was too stressed, or couldn't handle it? I feel we shouldn't be discussing it too much as it may invade Awarrior's privacy. He was a good map dev while it lasted, and he made many great maps for Avicus.

I guess it's fine if Awarrior's okay with it. I'm just that type of person who feels really bad if I hurt someone's feelings unintentionally.

He quit both Akane and Avicus, I think he has more important goals in life and I seriously hope he achieves all he wants. Building didn't really make him happy so I suppose he's now going to spend his time on real life things like school and hockey. I wish the best for him, he always wanted to be a Map Dev and he achieved his goal, it didn't last long,&nbsp;<b>but he achieved it</b>, he climbed his way to the top and even though he didn't get to fully enjoy it he did a great work :)<br>Best of luck Awarrior, if you ever read this, I'll be always cheering for you :D

I'm guessing he wants to be a pilot or have some type of job in the aviation field.
