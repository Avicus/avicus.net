The flippancy here must be insane, for me to have trouble discerning what the joke is or what's so humorous — or are you actually being serious? I'll just wait cordially for this thread to be locked; it really isn't necessary, nor will it help your hopes of getting unbanned.

<div>What you did was insane. You went with an alt to alexanderjoe's server and asked from me to help on the building, I said no, and you started griefing a build I worked on around 7 hours which is now the tournament lobby. If seth wouldn't come and tell me a command that brings the block data back, the current tournament lobby wouldn't exist. Plus, around a year ago, when you used to call yourself 'one of the best pvpers', you were hacking, and you were hacking on your alt which you griefed with, and then ban evading with your main.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I have no problem with you unbanned, if I see you have changed, because if you keep acting like this, you'll get in more trouble. Also, making a post about unbanning you just decreases your chances of getting unbanned, you should post an appeal under the 'Policy' category on the 'Appeal an infraction' section, when following the guidelines, you can find them here:&nbsp;<a href="https://avicus.net/forums/4f955d6ab" title="Link: https://avicus.net/forums/4f955d6ab">https://avicus.net/forums/4f955d6ab</a>. Also, I think this post should be locked.</div><div><br></div>

But Alexander's server isn't part of Avicus, so why would anyone be factoring that in?

<br>You threatened to ban evade by saying "<span style="color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  ">So recently, I thought that I have spent quite a fair bit not playing Avicus, so I decided to come back much Bigger and Stronger. Well, you know I have been IP-Banned so I cannot join. But I am thinking of changing my IP or use a VPN Or Proxy. Thats all I have to tell you, to make sure I am not going to be caught. Muhahahahaha. Avicus, Four Words "You Can't Stop Me". I belong here and I will do everything to stay here."<br><br><br>You were also caught hacking on this server.&nbsp;<br><br>I advise you appeal here:&nbsp;</span><a href="https://avicus.net/forums?topic_id=50">https://avicus.net/forums?topic_id=50</a><br><br>Making this petition won't help your chances of getting appealed. If you did appeal, be patient. Also, bringing it up in other threads like using the hashtag #unban me won't help either. You have to go through the system like how everyone has to.
