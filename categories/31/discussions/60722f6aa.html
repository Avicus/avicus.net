This staff team needs to be more interactive because honestly whenever I try to talk to one of ya'll, I either get ignored or you guys honestly dont care. And I know this isn’t just for me, other players also experience this. Like yesterday, I tried to ask one of you guys &nbsp;a question and clearly they were online and talking in public channels but I never got a response. Don’t &nbsp;think of this as a post for trashing the staff team but its the truth for most mods. Like none of yall even look happy to be doing ur job besides&nbsp;<img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/075b5514293a4bd5bcef367e687d3556?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/KojaCola.html" style="color: #FF5C5C">KojaCola</a>&nbsp;<img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/58b9ab0f83cf43c1b53baecd64ed2838?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/twopump.html" style="color: #FF5C5C">twopump</a> u should do something about it bye.

Im pretty happy as staff if im going to be honest, and i can agree my interactions with the community could be a 'little bit' better but it get hard to balance good old avicus with real life. This isnt in any way of an excuse as to why me personally have not had the best interaction but this is usually what happens general in the staff team. Real life takes over minecraft because at the end of the day, its a game. (Im writing this half asleep so i can guarantee i sound stupid but yeah its here)

I'm not going to be rude or point anyone out, but I'll give a few answers you and other people might be ignored when you ping a staff member or all moderators.&nbsp;<br><br>First one. It's pointless. I've been pinged about things before that I literally can't answer even if I wanted to. I just simply don't know the answer. I've also been asked things that I just can't answer, even if I know the answer, it's leaking if I told you.&nbsp;<br><br>Second. It's a random ping that's bringing me into a conversation while I'm at school, not at home, or in the middle of something. If I'm already doing something I'm not going to jump into a conversation on Discord that doesn't involve what I'm doing or something I need to be updated on in the first place.&nbsp;<br><br>Third. It's something that happened 4 hours ago and it's like 500 messages up in Discord. At that point, the person who sent the message probably forgot they even pinged me and would be very confused if I responded.&nbsp;<br><br>Fourth. It's something completely stupid. I can't even tell you how many times I've been pinged or messaged on Discord (just since I've gotten Senior) "hey can you unban me" or "help I got banned". Like, that's your problem dude... Appeal it then we'll talk. Until then, I have no reason to respond to you or start a conversation that isn't going to go anywhere at all.&nbsp;<br><br>Fifth. (kind of like the fourth) "Hey, @moderator @senior moderator @admin @developer @junior moderator look at my appeal *links appeal*" Those are probably the most annoying. They don't happen very often but like fam. Why.&nbsp; That actually makes me want to just deny the appeal (or whatever they need) without even looking like that's just annoying.&nbsp; lol<br><br>Sixth. (And probably most relevant&nbsp;to your point.) Sometimes, we aren't online. I know, shocker. Obviously, we aren't&nbsp;<b>always</b> at school or doing something, but most of the time, if we don't respond quickly it's because we can't, and by the time we do it's 6 hours later and no longer relevant or taken care of by someone else. The people that you see responding are the ones that are online the same time as you are (usually in the same timezone). I rarely see Rilo online, but he also lives across the world. He also isn't going to have as much community interaction as a moderator in the EST timezone, simply because of the time that he's around, there are way fewer people online. And the few people that are online, probably aren't in the Discord or involved in the community for the same reason.

Yeah... as Avicus has developed the staff have been moving away from the community. Back in the day every single staff member had the expectations of interacting with the community and it was heavily encouraged to know 1-2 more players every week. We needed more people like Dustin who was probably the nicest person I have come across.

Not here to make an excuse, but I can say community interaction has always been a weak spot for me. Even before I was promoted to moderator I only talked a few individuals. Of course moving forward I want to keep improving on this, I just gotta keep working at it. There's always room for improvement for each individual staff member, even in the areas they excel in. Hopefully this is something all of us can take note of and try to improve on, even if some already have great community interaction. :))

100% agree with you, the cycle for pretty much all staff. Hope they can do something about this to further improve the quality of the current staff members because the most effort given in the staff team is the recently promoted Moderators and the current Junior Moderators.

To be honest, there are valid reasons for certain staff members being more distant. They don't excuse them from not talking to the community at all, but in general there's nothing really wrong with some moderators being slightly more communicative than others.

As someone who is pretty much in charge&nbsp;of a weekly event of this server, this is something I want to highlight.&nbsp;<br>With the communication posts I have been posting I have been extremely confident with the events for the future. I feel this because of the certainty that I am able to provide something the community will enjoy. I don't receive terrible backlash because of the certainty I give or the communication I give. I feel that the negative feelings towards my fellow workers are when uncertainty happens and when you are confused it brings out the worst in people. The worst in people bring in negativity and no one wants to go on a server with negativity. I don't want to brag but if the whole leads of departments were as communicative as I have been with the nebula event this server would be doing 10 times better.

Yep, completely agree.<br><br>The last few times I've come back to the Moderation team, my personal goal was to increase communication in all sectors of the staff team.&nbsp;<br><br>This will obviously help the staff team as a whole grow and help staff-community relations which will help grow the server.<br><i>blah blah blah it's a snowball effect</i><br><br>Unfortunately it's hard to do that when the people you're trying to work with are prioritising their time on other projects and aren't communicating with each other.. funnily enough.

To be honest, I really don't know what you are talking about. If you have a question for the moderators to answer in general, I'm pretty sure it's answered 100% of the time as long as it's not a stupid question. The seniors, however is a different story, but in your post you said "most staff" so I'm not sure who you are referring to particularly. If you are talking about general small talk with staff members about random stuff, it is not required that we have to "interact" with you. If you pm one moderator and they don't respond, why not just ask another moderator?<br><br>Also, if you can give specific examples about your complaint, that would help very much.
