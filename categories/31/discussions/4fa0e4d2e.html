I am really embarrassed to make this post but I was just wondering. I go the forums regularly and I see people that&nbsp;<i></i>I have never heard of leaving. They get a lot of posts saying "you will be greatly missed" and "you were like a brother to me" But how does everyone know these people so well to be considered great friends? I am just wondering, not jealous by the way xD

Yes and no. Not enough to be IRL friends but enough to make me sad.

It's pretty easy to build relationships on Avicus, then there are the relationships that have lasted for a very long time.

If two players are really friendly with each other, and see each other very often in-game, having a great time together, one will obviously be sad to see the other go, because they have memories together on server, and they won't be able to have those great times together anymore.

Avicus is like a classroom. Everyone who joined at around the same time will be really great friends. People who join later will feel out of place for a bit (like you) but the community still welcomes that new person, and eventually they feel like they belong. Everyone has their own different personalities, interests, and opinions. Everyone gets along, and everyone fights. If someone leaves, everyone is sad because they won't be able to make more memories with that person (like Porky said.)

Some people have been here for a while so they get too know lots of people who joined at there time. Basically what everyone above has stated.

I didn't know anyone when I just came to the forums as well. People that I've never seen before, and such good pvpers.<br><br>I was very confused at the first, and I started to try and make friends. The biggest thing is joining a clan. I met Porky, Vlad, and 99. 99 is the first friend I made on avicus. I would recommend you to just be nice, and try to talk to people ingame constently.
