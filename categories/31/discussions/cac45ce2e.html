</h1>
Basically, when you kill a player, you get a message saying something like:<br><br><u>ImRaging was slain by Legoche using iron sword (+2 Credits)</u><br><br>So, what if me and Budah both hit Raging to get the kill?<br><br>This should happen:<br><br><u>ImRaging was slain by Legoche and JustBudah (+1 Credits)</u><br><br><br>One credit for each player. Just a suggestion, it would help against kill stealing. Feedback?

I think this would be good, but only to prevent kill stealing.

I like the idea, but not always helpful. Sometimes I shoot people of a bridge, and then someone else hits them while falling. His shot didn't really help in killing much, so i reckon he then shouldn't get credits either. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Those are nice shots then though ;)

Then I think the 2 who did the most damage should get the credits.

This could be hard because you could just be killing someone and someone gets the last hit you should get it but I like this idea! :D

I think the person who hits the enemy first should get 2 credits, while the person that kills him (if he's another person) gets 1 credit for assisting.

It would be hard to track who is doing the most damage to someone. Personally, while kill steals are annoying, they will just be part of the game.

This exists in call of duty block ops 2, but the amount of damage you deal is equal to the amount of reward.<br><br>For instance:&nbsp;<br><br>ItzSevo was slain by Legoche (2 credits)<br><br>The assist guy gets a notification in the chat saying example<br><br>[Legoche got 1.75 credits and ou got 0.25 for killing ItzSevo because you dealt 2.5 hearts]<br><br>See what I mean m8s?

I think that its a great idea. But if someone hits them one second before they die the person that did that should get the assist.

It's just a kill. For the most part in Minecraft you should be able to kill your opponent once you start fighting, unlike call of duty.

+1<br><br>But I think it should depend on how much damage you did. For example, if "Player" was fighting a diamond guy and Player did 95% percent of the damage, and "Randy" comes along and finishes him off, the credit's should not be split in half.<br>"Player" would get 95% of the credits<br>"Randy" would get only 5%

No, nononononono. Let's not try to make minecraft into a FPS. I really don't agree with this being implemented, if you don't finish someone off, it's your fault.

I would only agree with this if the assister would have to give a percentage to kill or I could just hit everybody once and I would get a ton of credits.

Actually with our current database this is impossible and would lag a lot. We already track every death and every kill, so imagine tracking every hit.<br><br>I kind of like the idea, but it's absolutely not doable at the moment.

I think that this should be added but to were it has to be multiple hits instead of just the final blow so you can't killsteal
