Hello! I recently bought a new account called "MechanicalYoshi" and I was hoping that you can transfer my gold donor to it. If you need the transition ID ill provide it.

Keep trying, but if they do not respond, try messaging others via Skype, or re-send an e-mail to support@avicus.net with the transaction ID along with your request.

It is my concern when people like you spam the forums with things that people don't care about.<br><br>Being a donor offers no protection. If you break a rule you will receive the same punishment. Best of luck to you on your forum punishment.
