Today i was playing casual game on Nebula, and there happend to be a "Hacker"on and he was flying and breaking monuments, and he admitted he was hacking, and i took a screen shot of him saying that, and I was wondering if it would be worth my while of posting that pic so the staff can take action. Should I?

If someone says that they hack, they could just be trolling, so it is not punishable, unless you have proof of them actually hacking.

Many players joke around when it comes to hacks. This evidence wouldn't be sufficient enough for a punishment. <br>Us Mods have to see them actually using the hacks that they&nbsp;supposedly&nbsp;"stated" they have, so we can take further action.<br>It's highly recommended that you post a video ^-^ to the "Player Reports" section.^.^
