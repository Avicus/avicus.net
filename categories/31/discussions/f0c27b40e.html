Hi guys! I was wondering what you guys would think if u could be any animal other than a human! It could be anything from an orca swimming in the arctic ocean, to a jaguar prowling in the dark. Could you also put why you would choose this animal? Thought this would be a fun forums idea! Cant wait to hear what u guys have to say! :P

Actually, I would be a Jaguar cuz they are epic :3. They can swim well, they're nature's assassin and they can lift entire Deer up into trees to eat in safety. And they're the least racist animal out there: they originate from Asia, they're yellow, have black spots, have white bellies and sometimes they're completely black! (There' s no such thing as a "Back Panther", only a Black coloured Jaguar). I did a report on them once, they're very interesting animals.

A human.. Jks, probably a dog to be totally honest, i know that may sound cliché or whatever but think about it, you get a nice big chunk of 15 - 20 years of life, you are energetic, playful, loyal, wondrous athletic and strong about 95% of your life, you have a chance for companion ship with both other dogs and humans, you have separate emotions, you get fed, you can be lazy, you sleep alot, the list goes on BABY!
