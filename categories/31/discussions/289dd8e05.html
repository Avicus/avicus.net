Do you have any screenshots of your past maps that you could share to us? I could give you some suggestions&nbsp;<img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/a7daca96cf1f40bc91506bd1a5561af8?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/Limidi.html" style="color: none">Limidi</a>

Look at the maps that I just found, when I say go, be ready to build a good map. Go! Build a good map, not a bad one! Ugh, let's try something else.

I personally like your maps, but yeah, as mep said try to integrate patterns in to your build, and create interesting, and supporting structures.

Make something new!<br><br>People dont like the same map over and over again, switch up the theme. Make interesting themes, like idk a mushroom palace with spruce forest. Or a Candyland 2??<br><br>Just some suggestions :) Good luck, you have potential, i can sense it xD

Nah, your maps look good but there are some problems.<br><br><b>The first one:</b><br><ul><li>Make more structures and add somethings that are special like towers, spawners for arrows and gapples.</li><li>Maybe you should rotate the map instead of mirroring it? It would look a lot better tbh.</li><li>Add some cobwebs or other things like mob spawners possibly :P</li></ul><b>The second one:<br></b><ul><li>Rotate the middle instead of mirroring it</li><li>Give the spawn side more stuff, like a trench full of hostile mobs, some cobwebs and like a walled fortification</li><li>I wouldn't follow through with the guy who said "remove mountains, they're useless". They're for decoration of the map and should be kept as such.</li><li>In fact, I'd suggest improving the mountains even, make them taller and like real-like mountains! No gameplay impact and it makes the map look 1000x better.</li></ul><b>The third one:<br></b><ul><li>I don't know where to start on this one, it needs a lot of improvement but it's looks okay though. Perhaps going to Alex's build server we can improve the map together.</li></ul>

Thanks For the feedback. Rn I am making a map similar to the second one, With most of your features included. I figured out how to use WE to make mountains, so they look so much better than man made ones :P

I have made a few maps now and these are a few things I have gathered from personal experience and feedback.<br><br><ul><li>Use interesting block palettes no matter what the gamemode is and have a unique layout that hasn't really been tried before, but make sure it is sustainable and works effectively depending on the gamemode you have chosen.</li><li>Always make sure you have fair sides and make them fluid and easy to run through.</li><li>Add unique spots and slightly hidden areas with potential bonuses so the users are more explorative, so to speak. This always improves gameplay if you can add it right.</li><li>Do not spend a few hours on a particular map. I have done this in the past and it has never succumbed to anything. Always check over something after you have made it and think "can I make this better in anyway?" Always investigate with different designs of parts of a map and allow your imagination to flow freely. This is a key fundamental for an interesting and good map. Spend days on a map, you will be really proud afterwards.</li><li>Take breaks after finishing a particular map. This will allow you to relax your mind for a while and potentially design more in your head.</li><li>Make a smaller version of the map first as a base layout and then add more to it in the final, big design once you have the layout in front of you.</li><li>Have a good idea of the map theme you want to incorporate into it before you begin.</li></ul>That's all I really have to say, hope it helps.
