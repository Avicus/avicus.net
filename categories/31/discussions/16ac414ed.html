So me and my brother recently made a server (just for us and maybe our irl friends) and I was wondering if I could get any help coding some custom plugins. I know there are some really talented people who are amazing at coding minigames to commands, and was wondering if I could get any help. If so, contact me through skype which is on my profile, or tell me yours and we can talk through there.<br>thanks in advance :p

There are a few really well done Bukkit coding tutorials on YT, you should try there and start slow first.

What kind of plugins do you need?<br><br>How big are these plugins like I'd out going to be a full game manager or just a few listeners?<br><br>I learnt bukkit by using PogoStick29's tutorials but it really helps to know a little Java first<br><br>Another note be persistent when coding, honestly it took me 20 attempts to code my first plugin and get it to &nbsp;work. Make sure you do ALL the capitalisation correctly that's were most beginners go wrong.<br><br>I can code a basic plugin and give you the code with loads of comments if you want to explain how it works.<br><br>I'll like to point out I'm still fairly new to bukkit but I'm quite experienced already. I've been using bukkit api for 2 months and known Java for 6.<br><br>Best of luck however you choose to learn, I really think programming should be a skill everyone should know ;D

Use Eclipse, never use capitals for package names, but use capitals for the each word in a class name, like: Main or JavaSQLAdapter.<br><br>I learnt Bukkit from PogoStick29dev. Good luck!

Survival games will be very complex to code<br><br>Rank plugin, why not use PermissionsEX works perfectly fine<br><br>Punishment plugin is a good plugin to start with ;D

I started with kennethbgoodin on YouTube. His channel is a great way to get to know the basics of plugin development. After you go through his tutorials, you can start making your own custom plugins. If you want to do some advanced stuff, there are some great YouTubers out there who will help you. Or, you could just check out the Plugin Development tab under the Bukkit Forums<br><br>I have had over a year of experience so do consider this.<br>Hope this helped :)

Whatever you do I highly suggest watching YouTube videos, best way in my opinion as a good YouTuber would explain it really well

Hey. I don't really use skype a lot because of security, confidentiality and quality reasons, I also use Linux as my main OS and believe me that is skype for Windows is already "ew" you'd better not see the linux version. Try to ping me Ingame whenever you see me snd I can maybe hop on skype for some time.<br><br>Regards, javapepe (it's spelled properly)
