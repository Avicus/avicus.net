Good Morning/Noon/Afternoon/Evening/Night<br><br>Well I want to start a discussion about bumping Threads.<br>I want to start this new discussion, cuz there already were discussions on bumping threads, but they were kind of Offtopic.<br><br><b>Questions we will be discussing:</b><span>&nbsp;<br></span><br><u>What do you think of bumping threads?<br></u><i>(Express your opinion on this question)</i><br><br><u>How old must be a thread to be unbumpable?<br></u><i>(For example: 1 month, 2 months or should be there no timelimit?)<br></i><br><u>Is bumping okay&nbsp;wherever why? or should be all bumps illegal?<br></u><i>(All bumps legal or illegal?)<br></i><br><b>Extra:&nbsp;<u></u></b><u>Should the rule of bumping be changed?<br></u><i>(If yes, why? If not, why?)<br></i><br>Please keep this discussion clean. Don't attack each other, everybody has a valid opinion.&nbsp;Inappropriate/smartarse comments aren't really nescassary so don't post them here.<br>I can change rules anytime, even without telling you this, so please look at the rules!

1. Only if it contributes to the topic<br>2. No Timelimit<br>3. Only if it's a stupid bump, then action should be taken.&nbsp;<br>4. It should stay the same.

As robot said I don't mind about bumping if you contribute to the topic, otherwise you shouldn't be posting and especially not acting like you are a mod and tell other to not bump. <br><br>I would say no timelimit, see my first answer, if your post contributes to the topic I wouldn't call it a bump.<br><br>I'm not going to namedrop players but we have a bunch on Avicus who actually do bump topic or post crap that doesn't even have anything to do with the original post. If you do this, don't, I understand if someone thinks it's fun, but no.<br><br>I would like the moderators to be more strict when it comes to the rules, no only the bump-rule, but all rules. I expect the staff to follow the same guidelines&nbsp;too&nbsp;but they do not.

<u>What do you think of bumping threads?<br></u>I like for others to bump threads especially map posts. Maps that haven't gotten an answer on rather it was accepted or denied. Other topics I could care less or find something I haven't even heard of before. If the bump reply is on topic leave it. If the bump reply is not on topic, then moderators can take action.<br><br><u>How old must be a thread to be unbumpable?<br></u>No time limit.<i><br></i><br><u>Is bumping okay&nbsp;wherever why? or should be all bumps illegal?<br></u>Legal, what is a post for if you can't post on it? This is a forum website and not being able to post on topics because they are too old just doesn't sound right.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Extra:&nbsp;<u></u></b><u>Should the rule of bumping be changed?<br></u>Completely<u><br></u><u><br></u>

<u>What do you think of bumping threads?<br><i><b></b></i></u><b>It depends, I don't mind if someone bumps with something that contributes to the topic, but if a topic is answered, and someone bumps it with something unrelated, or if the post doesn't contribute, then it shouldn't be allowed. Also there are special exceptions for bumping sticky/news threads.<br></b><u><br></u><u>How old must be a thread to be unbumpable?<br></u><u><b></b></u><b>For answered help threads i'd say 2-3 weeks, depending on what the bumping reply is, for normal threads, i'd say 1 month, depending on the importance of the thread (i.e news/sticky) and if the reply pertains to the original post.<br><br></b><u>Is bumping okay&nbsp;wherever why? or should be all bumps illegal?&nbsp;</u><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bumping should be illegal except for news/sticky posts and if the reply is important/contributes. &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></b><u><br></u><b><br><br></b><u><br><br><br><br></u>

Bumping topics is fine as long as you're on-topic.<br>If you're bump is off-topic then the thread will be locked.<br><br>Also, bumping stale threads is lockable (on-topic or not)as the thread has already been answered.<br><br>There is no limit of how old the thread is for you to bump it, as long as you're on-topic and he thread is still relevant, then all should be fine.

Well I forgot to say my opinion xD This post is also a bump, I want to see more and diferent opinions :D&nbsp;<br><br><u>What do you think of bumping threads?<br></u><i>I think it's really annoying if a thread got bumped. I understand if the creator is bumping it for more opinions or feedback, but if the thread is like, I got 2nd prestige in nebula, then it's useless. I also understand bumping in the map section, if the mapdevs didn't accepted/denied it.</i><br><br><u>How old must be a thread to be unbumpable?<br></u><i>I agree with Nolan, sticky or news threads there is no time limit. Answered Questions are unbumpable (?) after 2 or 3 weeks, as long the bump is nescassary, like a new question or the same problem occured again. Normal threads are unbumpable (?) after 1 month.<br></i><br><u>Is bumping okay&nbsp;wherever why? or should be all bumps illegal?<br></u><i>I think bumping is okay, but if the bump is not contributing to the OP, then it should be illegal. If all bumps were illegal, then the creator don't have the chance to get more answers or feedback.&nbsp;<br></i><br><b>Extra:&nbsp;<u></u></b><u>Should the rule of bumping be changed?<br></u><i>Yes! I really want a change in the bumping rule. If someone bumps a thread without a legit reason, then the thread gets instantly locked. Without a message.<br>If the creator is then sad and wants more feedback, then he has to go to a director and he has to ask if the threads get unlocked again, but he has to say why( he has to give the director a legit reason). The "bumper" should get a warning, if he/she does it again then a Web-Tempban for bumping threads. (After 2 warnings, a Web-tempban)</i>

Just for the irony. I may bump this when it gets to third page xD. 

Bumping is k if it's relavent, but at the same time after 2 weeks I feel like you should lock the topic if bumped.
