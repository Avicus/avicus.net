Yes, I'm aware that tons of threads like this have been made already, but honestly, Avicus is so new and fresh right now, that this is the perfect time to pay for some good advertising, to get the player count back up.

If you want new players tell your friends! If you have a successful YouTube channel, make a video about the server and how it just got a clean update! There are many other things you can do without getting banned on the forums or in game on servers because you said, '<b><u>JOIN</u></b><b><u> AVICUS avic.us, SO MUCH BETTER THAN THIS SERVER</u></b>" . No, that will make people that join hate the server because you we're telling them that it was better than the server they were on. Just do simple things and people will join.

Going on other servers to advertise won't be good.&nbsp;<br><br>1. You will be banned from those servers and their forums if you will advertise on them<br>2. It won't cause a big difference in the player count. Maybe a couple players will come but won't stay, you will just get hated and so will the network.<br>3. You will make the network look very thirsty for players, making it look desparate and will only shine a bad light on the network.<br><br>Some places where it would be worth advertising are:<br>&nbsp;- Twitch (would have to pay big streamers)<br>&nbsp;- YouTube (would have to pay big youtubers)<br>&nbsp;- MinecraftForums<br>&nbsp;- Planet Minecraft<br>&nbsp;- Other websites made only for promoting servers (like server lists sites)<br><br>Those are the best options for the network where it won't look bad on the network (compare to going on other servers forums and such) and if successful it will bring tons of players on the network.

I like the idea of Paying You Tubers, that's how i found Avicus. Woofless, and i'm still here. So a you people saying that people won't&nbsp; come from YT or Twitch. I don't believe you ;) Plus if the You Tuber likes the server, they might play more often and we wouldn't have to pay them :P

<a href="https://avicus.net/assets/banner.jpg">Avicus Banner</a> - put that up on billboards. &nbsp;No, I don't care about things that you have to do in "real life," this is way more important. &nbsp;Literally you need to be prepared to take out loans to put this up everywhere. &nbsp;Then, write a book about Avicus and how amazing it is, have it translated into every known language, and publish it in every country. &nbsp;For the more daring, you can rent a prop plane with a giant banner and it could just have the basic black and white Avicus logo followed by "Avicus Network." &nbsp;Be prepared to neglect everything from school to work to personal hygiene.

Very good idea! Like you're saying we should advertise avicus on other servers by using Banners? Clever!
