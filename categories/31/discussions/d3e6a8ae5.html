Hello guys.<br><br>Since we have had a PlugDJ party and we have had certain events in-game, I think it is time to have a TeamSpeak party.<br><br>Therefore we will be hosting a TeamSpeak party in the forthcoming weeks. Nothing is confirmed yet apart from a TeamSpeak party occurrence but there will certainly be prizes such as rank giveaways/upgrades to be handed out! What would you like to see in that party?<br><br>Also, if you have no idea what TeamSpeak is... TeamSpeak is a program where everyone who is playing Avicus can talk to each other on. All you have to do is download the TeamSpeak client and then join the players that you are playing with so you can talk to them! Simplez!!!!!!<br><br><b><u>Download link for TeamSpeak:</u></b>&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.teamspeak.com/?page=downloads"></a><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.teamspeak.com/?page=downloads">http://www.teamspeak.com/?page=downloads</a><br><br><u><b>The Avicus TeamSpeak IP:&nbsp;</b></u>ts.avicus.net<br><br>For any further instructions on how to work TeamSpeak, either contact me or create a topic where other regulars can help :D<br><br>Don't worry if you log on and no one is there! There will always be someone logging on soon! :DDD<br><br><br>Ya boi - Teli &lt;3
