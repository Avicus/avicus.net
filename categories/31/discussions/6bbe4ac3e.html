</h1>
So as many people have been saying lately, Avicus is almost dead. To me, it is currently on life support and won't recover. The only choice is to turn the life support off and let it die.<br><br>So here is my question:<br>Who's ingenious idea was it to kill McZone and bring in Avicus and why?<br><br>I'm sure I speak for many others when I say I had so much more fun on McZone and would love to see it brought back. Who knows, we might even get some old players back!<br><br>Anyway guys, what's your opinion on this?<br><br>Cheers,<br>Keatoboy

McZone wasn't doing too well at one point, which is why it was changed to avicus. This is what the staff says, however, I am not sure if this information is accurate or not.

What exactly did you like about MCZone that's not in Avicus? I'd assume you would say the player count.<br><br>What would you like to see re-implemented in Avicus?

Ahhh..<br>Avicus was brought as an update, at the time, McZone wasn't doing very well...<br>Avicus has a long time ahead of it, problems can easily be fixed, and it's growing&nbsp;<br>actually, it just needs a bit of a revamp to accelerate that.<br>It's getting a lot of users on it, a lot more than most servers..

My question is, why do people have to keep bashing Avicus for what it is now, explain to me why you think Avicus is worse than MCZone (excluding the player count and gamemodes).

Okay so u think that avicus is way better than mczone in the condition right now?? Mczone was just perfect what it was from the top to the bottom.<br>And it is a mystery.. WHY<br>? WHAT HAD HAPPENED??<br>But.. We MADE MCZONE BETTER!<br>WE CHANGED IT INTO AVICUS!!<br>THE BETTER, STYLISH, UPGRADED SERVER OF ALL TIME!!<br>BUT WHY?? WHAT'S WRONG??<br>BUT THIS WASN'T THE IDEA!!<br>WHY IS PEOPLE LEAVING?!<br>BUT WE MADE THE SERVER BETTER THAN IT WAS!<br><br>So tell me..<br>What's the big deal?!

This is what i said in Spicey's post:<br><br>Actually, i say we just wait. Maybe we're just in a low patch kind of thing; like you know how famous sportstars always have the highs and lows of their careers, well McZone was the high, and maybe now is just our low.<br>For all we know a spark may happen tomorrow and people may start finding out about the server through various ways.. I think its a matter of time before our numbers begin to slowly accumulate, rather then decrease to nothing more than 3 or 4 people... i cannot imagine this at all&nbsp;happening, i actually, genuinely think that with the patience of our most dedicated players, the numbers will trickle in and "Life support"&nbsp;won't be in action. Hope.

Anyone see a pattern? 1. Mczone was great then started to go away. 2. Avicus was "ok" now is going away ... Every server deals with school, but the good servers grow this server could have been great, the leadership just gave up. The simple fact is that, and nothing more. /rip 2015.

I do not understand why you dislike Avicus so much.<br>I used to play on Mczone with a different account, which now belongs to my friend, and yes, there were more players, but "Avicus" is not the reason why the player count dropped. Servers' player count go up and down, and that is based on the players and their lives outside of Minecraft. If you do not like Avicus, don't make posts to bash it.<br><br>EDIT: This goes for the people who are talking bad about Avicus.

Everything is dying, thing die faster than others. Of coarse Avicus will die.<br>But I believe Avicus isn't like those servers that die quick, Avicus might last for many more years. Avicus is special. I'm sure IvyCode will not give up now. He will update this server, and he wil eventually make Avicus even better.<br>Avicus is a strong server. The only thing I'm worried about is what the heck are mojang doing?!

Just because an updated server is slightly dying doesn't mean the old server was automatically better, yeah sure, it has all your memories on it, but in terms of popularity, it wasn't doing so well; Avicus was a change for the better.<br><br>It just needs a revamp, which is coming up soon I believe...

Ladies and gentlemen if I could insert my two cents here... So far I'm seeing people either placing the blame on change or Mojang. But I do believe it would be better to credit the school year(my short term memory just made me forget who exactly mentioned it) for the lack of quality or business.<br><br>I have been a part of a community that has had its ups and downs. I will not mention the game this is on but the community is mainly known as "Scarecrow" or "Death Tower". I've been part of said community for years before my friend introduced me to MCZone and there's always a pattern of it's yearly population. Some people came, some people went. But during the summer it was at it's busiest and during school years(fall through bits of winter and spring) the population would drop to a handful still being active and would then pick back up where it started. This is what usually happens to any forum/community. No need to worry so much. Addtionally, I'd like to point out that Avicus was mainly to help improve the way the server ran, correct? In terms of game quality, I say it's only increased save for Elimination's lack of players. But that's another rant for another day. Agreed?

McZone has already been confirmed as never coming back. All the copyrights, IPs, domain etc that would have to be changed again would be just way to expensive so stop looking in the past... You will have your memories of McZone but that is all they are and ever will be: memories.

I'm pretty sure it was Ivy's idea.<br>I did have a ton of fun on MCzone with the Neb tourney, being in game, on the forums, making maps, but I couldn't make friends that easily. I see videos from MCzone mods and players and saw how much fun they were having with everyone. Avicus has lost a ton of people but, NOT EVERYONE left because of the server. Most left because they were getting bored with minecraft in general. (good examples) Hunting_chick and (the old) Hypernatormc left to go to collage and have no time for MC anymore.<br>All servers are taking big hits because people are going back to school and as people get older they figure out they don't have enough time.

Well, if you really feel the way you feel, I guess you are giving up on us. I accept that, but don't be surprised when we turn around for the better. The reason we changed MC Zone to Avicus was because of the player count going tremendously downhill, the numerous bugs, and all around lack of design in the games. I guarantee if we would have stayed as MC Zone, we would be in the same (if not worse) situation we are in now. MC Zone was relatively the same thing as Avicus, except with 5 times as many bugs and a pretty bad website. We barely changed anything when updating to Avicus, this includes took out games that were not being played (had 5 players on maximum), updated anticheat, released updated website, and made the server less laggy. If you see any problems with the above changes, then I respect that. I really don't see your logic, but whatever floats your boat. And don't give up on us too quickly, we have a major update planned, so I suggest that you don't miss it.

I don't understand why everyone wants so many players on this server.<br>(My thinking)&nbsp;<br><br>Woohoo! We have so many people on Avicus/McZone!

Well, if you really feel the way you feel, I guess you are giving up on us. I accept that, but don't be surprised when we turn around for the better. The reason we changed MC Zone to Avicus was because of the player count going tremendously downhill, the numerous bugs, and all around lack of design in the games. I guarantee if we would have stayed as MC Zone, we would be in the same (if not worse) situation we are in now. MC Zone was relatively the same thing as Avicus, except with 5 times as many bugs and a pretty bad website. We barely changed anything when updating to Avicus, this includes took out games that were not being played (had 5 players on maximum), updated anticheat, released updated website, and made the server less laggy. If you see any problems with the above changes, then I respect that. I really don't see your logic, but whatever floats your boat. And don't give up on us too quickly, we have a major update planned, so I suggest that you don't miss it.

mczone was fun and, sure, there is a lot of nostalgia involved in it, but that's all it is. nostalgia. avicus changed it for better and if people don't like it, they don't like it. there&nbsp;<u></u><i>are&nbsp;</i>less people, but soon there will be more. #avicusrenaissance

The thing that would help the server is not another " Major life changing update, that does nothing more then align us better to like servers". Avicus does not have the Dev staff to start talking about a update that is " Network" changing. We don't compete in the space with the big servers that create unique games and unique functionality. Add to that a network owner that has very little activity on the server, and even less voice and you get a Network that is by default going to fail. I do hear a lot of excuses and history lessons like " McZone was on the down slide", and school is back in, and "Life" and time zones, and a million other excuses that are really nothing more than smoke screens for Avicus being neglected by an owner that no longer has the time or the desire to invest.<br><br>&nbsp;Don't get me wrong, I really like the Avicus Network, I like the staff, and have nothing against the Owner,but the facts are what they are - Other servers are growing, other server owners are active in the server and in the forums, other networks have game modes being updated and changes that improve the server on a regular basis. We do not have that, sadly.

welp if ya think about it, if you're saying that avicus is on life support, we need those people to help it stay alive and thriving<br>we need people willing to help the server grow as a community (other than staff) to actually help the community instead of just saying "avicus is done."

Every single post about the server dying gives Avicus a 2x booster in collapsing.&nbsp;<br><br>I can agree that Avicus is at a dying state, but not going down any further (until somebody does something really bullshit).<br><br>So just stop making these and Ill consider giving somebody the cure for cancer, ok?

Agreed. Way too many posts on this.&nbsp;<br><br>And continuously saying avicus is dying isnt going to help our morale. It's going to convince all the players that it IS dying.
