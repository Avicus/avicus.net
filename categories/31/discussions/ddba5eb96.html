Relatively good defense, but if a person comes with a spanky spade, you're screwed.

Hahaha nah, I don't see how a "spanky spade" would remove the wooden slabs, trap doors and the multiple layers of obsidian. Of course, you would be able to remove the soul sand quicker, but you will at least be up there 3 - 4 minutes before you get to the actual monument and somebody will see you in that amount of time.

He means that if they knock you out of the world with the spanky spade knockback, they'd have enough time to mine away the necessary blocks and destroy the obby.

Lol, it's pretty good, but then again, if a guy comes charging with a spanky spade, you're screwed. Maybe put fences or something? If you put something on the sides that keeps you from falling, then it's perfect.

When you spawn, if you turn around, you will see iron with ladders on obsidian. You will at least find 10 - 15 blocks of obsidian there! :)
