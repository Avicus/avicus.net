<p style="margin: 0pt 0px;">Welp, its been fun but as you can see from the title, I am stepping down from my remaining staff position. Its been fun being part of the official team and my previous teams (Senior staff &amp; Map Devs) but my time has come to an end.</p><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><p style="margin: 0pt 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">The reason i’m retiring is because I haven't been the most dedicated person to the event staff for the past few months and the other teams since before August 2016 when I had a minor setback. Since then I've noticed I have lost a lot of interest and now I feel that I'm just wasting space for someone who will be more dedicated and fit for the position. To my successor I wish you great luck. To the Map Development team, Developers, Staff &amp; Event staff I wish you good luck as well.</span></p><p style="margin: 0pt 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;"><br></span></p><p style="margin: 0pt 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent;">I wish I could say I would return but at this point it's highly unlikely. Life is getting crazy with Sophomore year, Friends, starting a job soon and Its all made it hard to juggle that and try to remain active here. Can't please everyone. Now I'm just focusing more on school and getting rid of my roles made it easier. I may stop by from time to time but I doubt id be active like I use to be.</span><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;</span></p><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><p style="margin: 0pt 0px;">I'm not good with goodbye's but thank you everyone for making this server enjoyable. I wish everyone great luck here &amp; in life. It's been a great 4 years here that has shaped my life in many ways. It has made a large impact on me and I will never forget all the people that made it great and developed my character into who I am.&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0pt 0px;"><br></p><p style="margin: 0pt 0px;">I love you all - GrapeSmoothie &lt;3</p>

On a more personal level, thanks for being one of the people who got me into Avicus, and who not so subtly hinted that I should apply for mod (and if I didn't, you would have made a referral anyways lol *wink*).
