Hi everyone!<br><br>When avicus was introduced, we also introduced a ton of cool new services for our users to enjoy and be part of. One of these was the teamspeak server, which for those who dont know is like a channel based Skype, where you can talk to people from all around the world who also play on avicus. You can also talk to the staff members who are always happy to help and support you and your needs or if you just want to jump on and have a chat with one of them.&nbsp;<br><br>So I just wanted to ask a few questions about teamspeak and what you all think of it.&nbsp;<br><br><span><span><b>Today's Topics:-</b><br><br><b><i>Do you use teamspeak and if not, is there any reason why? (Nervous,&nbsp;couldn't install etc)&nbsp;</i><br><br><i>If you do use teamspeak, do you like the general layout and design&nbsp;of the teamspeak channels?&nbsp;</i><br></b></span><b><br></b></span><b><i>Do you feel that the staff talk regularly enough to you or other players?&nbsp;</i><br><br></b>

<span><b><i>Do you use teamspeak and if not, is there any reason why? (Nervous,&nbsp;couldn't install etc)&nbsp;</i><br></b>I'm on TeamSpeak fairly regularly, mainly on the weekends. If I'm playing on the server then you'll often find me on TeamSpeak too.<br><b><br><i>If you do use teamspeak, do you like the general layout and design&nbsp;of the teamspeak channels?&nbsp;</i><br></b>The current layout is perfectly fine in my opinion. Very intuitive and simple to use! :)<br><b><br></b></span><b><i>Do you feel that the staff talk regularly enough to you or other players?&nbsp;<br></i></b>Unless I'm talking to other staff members about something in particular,&nbsp;I try to stay in the 'regular' channels as much as possible&nbsp;. Players can always&nbsp;poke me if they need special&nbsp;assistance. However, I do agree with Jozz. Some staff could be more "active" in the general chats (rather than sitting in a staff channel).

<span><b><i>Do you use teamspeak and if not, is there any reason why?&nbsp;</i></b><i></i> I use TS a lot. It's practically where I met all my friends.&nbsp;<br><br><i><b>If you do use teamspeak, do you like the general layout and design&nbsp;of the teamspeak channels?&nbsp;</b></i> I wish we could still make custom channels, but there are a lot more cons with that.<br><b><br></b></span><b><i>Do you feel that the staff talk regularly enough to you or other players?&nbsp;</i></b><i></i>I consider myself to have pretty strong ties to the community through TeamSpeak. If myself and other staff members are doing only reports, we like to stay in Moderator chats. Also, if we are talking about confidential things, we have no choice but to talk where only other staff can hear us. For the most part I think that there is great staff to player communication on TS.

<span><b><i>Do you use teamspeak and if not, is there any reason why? (Nervous,&nbsp;couldn't install etc)&nbsp;</i></b><i></i>I'm always on whenever there are some regs around. Meeting new people is great, but it's hard to get&nbsp;involved&nbsp;in a convo if you're an outsider.<br><br><i><b>If you do use teamspeak, do you like the general layout and design&nbsp;of the teamspeak channels? &nbsp;</b></i>I think it works rather well. There are always additions being added like the "Music Room." It shows you guys are hearing our requests and taking action. Super pleased with everything :-)<br><b><br></b></span><b><i>Do you feel that the staff talk regularly enough to you or other players?&nbsp;</i></b><i></i>There are definitely particular staff members who hardly go in public channels. But, being online so you can receive a poke or text is better than completely avoiding it. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Me, along with many others would like to see custom channels added. When certain player(s) are annoying a larger group it'd be nice to be able to avoid them somehow. Waiting for a staff member isn't really practical. Also, it'd be nice to choose who you talk to. It may be exclusive, but it's the only way to have peace and quiet. Aaaaalllsssooooo, 2 private scrimmage chats would be great :D<br><br><br><br><b><i><br><br></i></b><b><i><br></i></b>

Nope, I kinda worded that the wrong way; I meant to say that I don't blame them for hanging in private channels as some people in ts are really immature.
