I am looking for a laptop that i can buy, but i am not very experienced with knowing which i should buy that could run daily activities as well as some gaming, i would like it to be able to get me an easy 60 fps on mc and should be good enough to use for some programming. Also, i would like if it were durable and would not break very easily. My limit is around 800 and i'll probably have to wait a few months for that. I could also do something like get a really nice laptop maybe with a range from 700-2000 USD or maybe a little more but i would have to wait maybe a year or so. this is because my older brother said that after a year or so, he said that the amount of money that i have saved up and some that he will give (depending what i might want). What should i do, and what should i get. Also, my older brother is going to college and his desktop (not that great, but i think its better than my current laptop which is not even really mine) will probably be mine to use.<br><br>What should i do in terms of time, and which should i get for each of these ranges. Please Please Please help me. Also a LAPTOP not a desktop. Thank you for reading this post and please reply if you know. :D

700-2000 USD has so many options, could you narrow your price range a little bit? &nbsp;<br><br>This is because around 80% of laptops are priced between $1250 to $2500.

yes for like a year from now when my brother will help, the range would probably be 1500 to a little over 2000 maybe 2200. also should i wait or not considering the situation?

Just look for something in the areas of intel i5 - intel i7 or AMD A8 or A10 with at least 2.0 ghz and 4gb RAM, a video card is optional but if you are just playing minecraft I would not recommend it.

MSI GS60 GHOST-012 is pretty good, the only cons that I can think of is that it heats quite easily so the fan can be loud at times

You dont need a budget that high. With money like that, you'll overlook cheaper stuff when they are probably better than overpriced stuff
