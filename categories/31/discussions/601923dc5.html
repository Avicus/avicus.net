I take a short break for a couple of days and I come back to a friggin cesspool. All the salt dipped on flames. Unfair demotions, arguments all over. Unfriendly relationships and intentions exposed and brought to light...<br><br>Is this how we're gonna operate? Are we gonna keep on going like this until we're reduced to 50 players like last time? Probably even 10 players? Or <b>none</b>?<br><br>Something has to change. It's&nbsp;<i><b>everybody's fault&nbsp;</b></i><b></b>this time. Kylo, please update to 1.8 xD We're not gonna get new players if we stagnate for the minority.&nbsp;<br><br><b><u>Staff (Moderators):</u></b><br>As a MapDeveloper I observe the other half of the staff team and compare it to my own and the things I see is utterly unprofessional and childish. You guys have created a Clandestine environment for yourselves. Too secretive and distant. If you don't know what I mean take a gander at the CIA, US Secret Service or ONI from the Halo Universe.&nbsp;<br><br>With this type of environment you create a tense atmosphere. You create rivalries and animosity amongst yourselves. You get distracted from your&nbsp;<i>true&nbsp;</i>work as a Moderator and you start to fuck up. Make poor decisions (Apricot's demotion) and you regret them sooner or later. <b>With heavy backlash.&nbsp;</b><br><br>Stop being too secretive amongst yourselves and be more open and casual among the community. Take a gander at the MapDeveloper Team. We're real friendly with ourselves and we even joke and eff around a lot. A lot of people and staff see me ingame and I actively talk with the community and have fun among you guys.&nbsp;<br><br>Our job as managers of the Repository doesn't get to us and we cope with this by creating an open and amiable atmosphere.&nbsp;<br><br>Moderators, you have to follow this example. Please. You've lost a lot of good people and your credibility is really low right now. I was shocked when Apricot mentioned on his post that you guys told him to act more strict and less casual. This isn't how you build trust and relationships. They may be kids playing but they aren't&nbsp;<i>your&nbsp;</i>kids or siblings. Outsiders don't always respond well to this type of behavior. So be more casual with approaching infractioners... of course, do your job all the same but don't have a cold approach. Have an approach of a calm counselor dealing with an unruly child.<br><br><b><u>Players:</u></b><br>You guys don't exactly make it easy on the staff as well. When I test certain maps you guys respond with "This map sucks!" and etc. We need actual feedback. What makes the map suck so much?&nbsp;<br><br>And you aren't helping the moderators much either by giving them such a hard damn time. I'm gonna be real honest and tell you guys that y'all can be a real sore and annoying bunch. In fact, you guys help push along the salt of Avicus the most. But when a Moderator effs up or makes a very poor decision I'll admit that it pushes the salt the furthest because it's horrifying to see that these people are the ones with such game-changing commands. But you guys push the salt the most.&nbsp;<br><br>Stop being a thorn in our sides and try to be nicer. It is so awesome and soothes me when I get to do an event with you guys and y'all are so cheerful and full of amiable feelings. It annoys me when you guys are so hostile. Stop it.<br><br><b><u>Staff (MapDevs):<br></u></b>Allow for players to accept and deny maps. Was suggested by Excellence. If the others like it, we can give this a trial run and see how it pans out in the long run. Only concern is maybe some biased feelings and unfair judgments but I have high hopes for the forum community.<br><br><b>Staff</b> = Be more open and friendly.<br><br><b>Players</b> = Stop giving the staff a hard time.

To be honest I'm slightly concerned about transparency some times, I really like it and some stuff isn't exactly how I'd do it, however I have to accept it and that's a fact.&nbsp;<br><br>I'm actually working on something that is more community-interest than anything, and I think it's going to be really cool and that the community will love it.

I know this is my personality type, but it isn't exactly what should the staff should be: I've been noticing that I'm indecisive, and can never go through with a plan without knowing for sure that it's right. I've been very unwilling to experiment and reach out during my time on the staff team, and I now know that was a very big mistake on my part. But, that doesn't mean that the current staff can't do so now. You need to start making some large-scale changes for the better, or I can guarantee the Avicus economy will look like this:&nbsp;<img src="https://acheson.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/1929crashandbeyond.png" title="Image: https://acheson.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/1929crashandbeyond.png">

So far we're at the rebound and stagnating. The original crash was when we had only 50 players on at a time. We can go up if we fix a lot of things.

Most likely all of the servers you just named are 1.8 compatible not completely 1.7 also Some mc gamemodes are completely 1.8. Also I don't think servers can just downgrade without a few of their plugins breaking. -20 bad idea

Why can't it be like the community in 2013 where staff and players didn't have any secrets with each other what went wrong? As a player I know that we drift the salt but staff have got to cooperate with that as it is their job but don't do it in an immature manner. &nbsp;Let's get back to that nice community that avicus once had and even had over 500 players at one time!

+1 Glad someone said it...<br><br><b>@DaGoldBrick</b>, you only came here to ridicule this post and the server. Seriously, if you don't believe in the server then just leave.<br><br>You can continue to try with the rest of us but I'd say that this post that I made hit a lot of accurate points. A senior even msg'd me directly asking me what they should improve upon. With constructive criticism you get a lot of results.

Yeah well done, 1 senior. I was able to get all of the seniors and admims attention apart on kylo not only here but the staff equivalent of mcpvp through my way in a matter of 1 post. Also I would think you were intelligent enough to see that I still enjoy playing here and would rather play for the time the server is here than waste that time with shit like this.

No? I would rather play the game than waste time trying to make it better when there's a high chance it won't.

If you enjoy playing the game but people just give up on trying to save it it'll eventually die out. We might as well try and do something about it.

I apologise. Next time I see mods in game I'll pretend to hack and get falsely banned to make the server look bad again.

True but it doesn't help at all when he isn't even doing anything but be a nuisance at this point. He is just being very negative and pessimistic. If he loves the server so much why go to great lengths to show people the opposite?&nbsp;<br><br>It gives a very confusing signal when he acts like this and claims that he likes the server so much.

That really doesn't matter when it comes from you, when you are "pretending to hack." The moderators and staff on this server aren't GCheat or any NCP/AntiCheat robots, although staff can act like them at times. Expecting something and everything on Avicus to be perfect can exist when you imagine that happening, but everything is not perfect, and it's a proven fact. Plus, you actually play in game like normal person should be, or you get your friends and have a tendency of trolling. Comparing this to mcpvp doesn't change anything either, since it's a matter of an opinion. If you are trying to help and fix the server, then it would be nice to just be kind on forums, in game, etc. and not be a prick at all. Then maybe you could possibly get staff if you wanted to, that would help more. And don't call that a waste of time when you spend<br>enough time playing on the server that you want to try "fixing."<br><br>Just giving my opinion here. Don't act like it hit you in the Achilles or anything.
