Alright, so I was waiting for a match of Crusade to begin, and just before it began, I was kicked out of it. I tried to access it, but got a message saying that I was banned by an operator. I thought,. "NOOOOOO" Checked my infractions page, no ban. I tried to access Avicus, and I could get on fine. Tried to get back on MCZone02, but got kicked by the same message. Tried to go to MCZone03 as a test, and it worked. What the hell is going on?

Check to see if it is only you encountering the problem or if its the same for everyone. If the server is bugged then I am sure it will be fixed soon enough. If it is just your problem then i suggest contacting a senior staff member or emailing support@avicus.net . Good luck, it sounds like a strange problem. :3

Volt, ignore all posts which do NOT help, such as the one above me.<br><br>However, I can assure you that this is a glitch, and I've been contacted multiple times that many people have the same problem; but on Nexus07.

It could be a Server-side Bukkit error. Maybe someone did something bad (*cough* Ivy *cough*) causing a big random error or something like that on McZone02.
