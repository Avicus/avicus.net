&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Right, so in recent times it has come to my attention that a multitude of issues have arisen both within and out of the teamspeak. (Avicus Teamspeak) So, One. The 18+ Chat was removed, the source of most happiness within the actually active Teamspeak community. Two, the suites are no longer 18+. Teamspeak is basically a "PG" utility. In past, (The last 2 years of TS) no problems were ever really created and nothing was done about it. Causing little to no disputes.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;However, to be honest. The senior staff have recently pushed away a huge demographic on Teamspeak. The actual quote on quote oldies. These people are the ones who really hold the teamspeak together. We as a demographic are quite pissed off by the recent changes on teamspeak. Overall, the problem has grown so bad (No its not rude) that many people have been pushed away so far that a new Teamspeak has been created... Is this really how the people who have used the service should be treated after almost 2 years of service.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Overall, the senior staff have grown so insensitive to almost any comment that they find the only way to deal with problems is spark even BIGGER ones. Not only does this aggravate me, it aggravates a whole bundle of people. Making me produce posts like this.<br><ul><li>JOHN_CENAAAAAAAAAAA (Former Admin)</li><li>SkyBeats</li><li>Iron (Former Senior)</li><li>Zaccc (Got banned)</li><li>Steven (Former Mod)</li><li>MLGTino (Former Mod)</li><li>Pop &nbsp;(Former Admin)</li><li>Zeus (Former Admin)</li><li>Peachy (Former Admin)</li><li>Emmaye (Former Mod)</li><li>Glitchy1 (Former Senior)</li><li>Merlin (Former Mod)</li><li>Kavinsky (Kind Of, Current Senior)</li><li>Zero</li><li>Buster</li></ul><br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not only is Avicus running on its final legs, due to lack of funding. It is making the issue worse by making those who actually help shape the server leave. For example, Robo (Cyclops) was a TS frequent who we all enjoyed to play with quite a bit, especially because he hosted UHC's FOR AVICUS. Alas, now he has moved on to mumble because of the butchering of teamspeak. To those who comment/think "So What" you have to actually be active on Teamspeak to understand how big this issue is....<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Anyways, the recent rule changes have made little to 0 sense. Before the recent change, swearing was allowed in short bursts/batches, but now its just no tolerance whatsoever. This has made some question it so much. That EVEN SNOW disagreed with it. (sorry) Overall, these are just a few issues currently. I suppose I could go into more detail another time.<br><br>NOTE** I'm not being salty, I'm simply voicing my opinions. If you archive this staff it really will stress my point. I only care about TS and its being pissed on by people who don't use it.

It was both the "oldies" and the staff who caused the 18+ channels to be removed. I partially agree with them being removed since a lot of the TS regulars wouldn't stop doing what they were doing even after we told them to stop. The part I disagree with is just removing the channel as a whole, where as we could've just edited the description of the channel and wrote "Any form of racism, bullying, or overall disrespect towards other users is not tolerated." A handful of the Teamspeak members you listed have actually been causing all sorts of problems since their retirements/demotions, but the staff play a part in that too. Overall, I'm not exactly happy about the channel being removed, but all I really care about is being able to listen to conversations or have a small conversation with a friend.

Not gonna lie, Im happy the teamspeak +18 channels are removed.<br><br>If you're going to make jokes and stuff about certain groups or religions in a public teamspeak, Id recommend them going into a private teamspeak or a Skype call.<br>But, I will also say that I understand ur point of the view and I get the people dont need to go to the +18 channels if they dont want to hear those kind of jokes.

All the Teamspeak fallouts were created and sourced from the 18+ chats. We were fed up with all the issues we had to deal with so we simply removed them. I'm sorry, but I know you guys know that there have been just as many issues compared to "positives" with 18+ chats.<br><br>Whether or not you decide to go to another TS server or program in general is not in our control, and quite frankly you can go ahead and do that if you don't like 18+ chats removed.&nbsp;<br><br>Additionally, I personally have been recieving many complaints on 18+ chats and how players "disconnect" themselves from the TS community because it was so toxic.

Alas, now there is little to no tolerance for anything. Whether an issue or not, the 18+ chat was the one place where you could be somewhat more free, with less restrictions. It was limited first, and then removed. The solution is not removing things.. Tell me this, do you use Teamspeak enough to say that you legitimately have a proper viewpoint that isn't based mostly of facts (as opposed to actually understanding the dynamics of Teamspeak)?

Restricted or not, it just was causing everyone issues. A lot of disputes were - like I said before - sourced in the 18+ chats. Its not a matter of "there's no tolerance for anything now" because like you said, we were fine with it since it was created X years ago until there were months on end of arguments and issues regarding the channel. <br><br>I do, infact connect to Teamspeak... I am online Teamspeak most of the time when I am actually playing Avicus.

Except that isn't often is it? xD Anywho, saying "everyone" wasn't very correct was it. Also may I say, the only issue that has really ever been produced is Zac being rude with Michael. So please what are the many disputes? You are active on Slack yes, but you are not active on TS bud.<br><br>&nbsp;I will say, I cant deny that Zac and Michael have been toxic lately but one of them was taken care of, and the other one is hardly that rude anymore. (THAT) I do agree that 'a' dispute has occurred, but maybe if it was handled better the result would not have been as bad as it is right now. There really is no reason for the 18+ chat to be removed. Honestly, if you want to make 50% of Teamspeak go, your doing pretty good at it.&nbsp;<br><br>Again, there has been a lengthy dispute, alas that is not 'many' and definitely not enough for the removal of a chat. If you are going to remove the 18+ chats, you might as well remove the suites now. I just find it saddening that TS is being changed by 7 or 8 people who don't even use it. (give or take 1)

Yo, I hate how everything is handled right now, but you realise I have racked up probably around 3-5 months of Teamspeak use.

I play on AVICUS for its Teamspeak. Some random TS is not something I will ever enjoy. The overall experience of the Avicus TS is what keeps me on it, and many others. I am simply trying to state that the recent changes have felt a lot more like corraling the last few people who actually keep the Teamspeak being "TS.''<br><br>EDIT: Please respond to my questions in the other posts. Other "disputes" etc...

I understand and respect your opinion, but I am seeing no objective with your posts.

I agree with Jozz on this. Staff had a discussion for about a week trying to work out a solution to keep the channels, they came to the conclusion that it was better to get rid of them all together than keep them. You guys were given multiple warnings to act respectful on Teamspeak but you didn't, as Snow said it was a privilege and you ruined it.

Quotes aside. Will the staff team really risk losing a 50% of their player count and eventually kill the server for some non-serious issues who made the rule change a thing? If that's the case then I'd rather move on to another community than stand here being babysitted by a bunch of mods who don't know what they're doing.

You can't just "not get offended." Being offended is a feeling, and it's pretty hard to change them unless you look at it from a different perspective. You and your group were doing all sorts of uncalled for stuff even after we told you not to and well, this is the result even if it may not be the best for some people.&nbsp;<br><br>Also, did you not make your own TeamSpeak server because you disliked the Avicus one? So why are you still complaining about it?

It was originally Gill who made the 18+ channels way back when he was staff for the very purpose of being more suggestive, by removing it you're essentially making it worse by moving the toxicity to the non 18+ channels.

Iron chooses not to get offended by cancer jokes even though he had it (Iron = champ btw). It's having control of your emotions and its a basic human function.

Well, maybe if you 15-year-olds actually acted your age we wouldn't be having this conversation? That list mentioned are the bunch of 5-year-olds, acting like 2-year-olds.

I don't see you little brats being called a squeaker when you were young, and don't give me the bitchy comment "Leave if you don't like it". I am sick of the one leaving, you know why?

Oh boy, a teamspeak thread. Hold up lemme type something.<br><br>Now, i havent been active on ts or minecraft in general, but the 18+ chats made so many people happy. The people that joined knew what could and would be said and if they didnt want to hear it, they could join another channel. Simple as that.<br><br>When i was a senior and using the 18+ channel, not fucking once in my months of staff on ts did i hear a complaint about jokes in 18+, and if there was a complaint, well i probably wouldve done something idk<br><br>the fact that the ataff team decided to remove a room that has caused, one somewhat large issue over the fact were "disrespectful" is downright disgusting.. The room says "18+" if you cant handle offensive jokes, dont join the damn room.<br><br>Also, what jokes made the room be deleted anyway? 9/11 jokes? Give me a fucking break. The staff team needs harder skin if they get triggered from someone saying "9/11 was plane wrong"

I agree with Jozz on this. Staff had a discussion for about a week trying to work out a solution to keep the channels, they came to the conclusion that it was better to get rid of them all together than keep them. You guys were given multiple warnings to act respectful on Teamspeak but you didn't, as Snow said it was a privilege and you ruined it.

Alright, so.<br><br>&nbsp;"No, it just shows that people can't handle dark humour."<br><br>That's not necessarily the case. I'll give an example.<br><br>Say that someone is sitting in a TS channel, minding their own bussiness. You guys rock up and start taking about, let's say, rape jokes. That person may have been affected by sexual assault, and essentially what you're doing is digging up traumatic memories. This whole trauma ordeal applies to many situations.<br><br>These people might be able to handle dark humour, but when you stir up memories, it's fucking hard to push them back down. Especially if they've left an emotional scar.<br><br>Can't you just be considerate and take your conversations to Skype?

I'm glad Channel 18+ rules were removed. They were causing to many problems with players being rude, immature, and disrespectful. Now after the senior staff have done a good decision, they get bashed on for non valid reasons. Its not there fault, its the players fault for abusing the privilege to have 18+ channels.<br><br>Not to mention people were bullying/being racist to other players there in fact, and players did there best to stay away from those kind of players in the chat room. They shouldn't be afraid to go into the 18+ chat.

Ranting helps a helluva lot more than talking to Sr mods. For example, lets bring up Iron's demotion. Pretty much all of berzerk was talking to admins about him being demoted, however it wasn't till they went on the forums and bitched about it everywhere that he was actually demoted. Just goes to show you the power of ranting on the forums.

Zac made his own ts server, so why not use it? You said yourself that you made it because you got banned, so why don't you use it? And I'm sure all of his friends are allowed to join too, so I really don't see why you care so much about it since you already took the initiative to fix the problem. All your rules are allowed on your TeamSpeak, all your friends are there, you don't really have a reason to want those channels back unless you just want to feel like you're right.

Just a friendly reminder that this thread is for constructive criticism and opinions on the channels being removed. There is no need for the "Avicus is going PG" posts, they don't help with anything. So if you really want to try to get your opinions across it'd be best to write up useful replies that might end up bringing the channels back. Thanks guys!

I think what we said was enough. The reasons of why they should be there are the same as they were when the 18+ channels were added. This is why Avicus is going downhill. I mean, give the players what they want. You're not going to make the jokes vanish or to make them decrease by just deleting those 18+ channels; there is a reason why it is called a 18+ channel, and it is your choice to enter or not. But, if you enter, you should handle with 'jokes'. I mean, it's the staff who should be more active on the TeamSpeak channels and moderate them. I mean, they could moderate if someones passes their limits, but, come on, it's just a channel when you could 'express' a little more.

"Avicus is going PG" is called constructive criticism there. The staff team literally just reads through threads like this and discuss about it and then make comments like this. Bringing the channels back just sounds like a lie coming from staff. You take opinions too harshly and act so irrational when you see the community telling you feedback. Go ahead and request an IP check on me in #requests if you want, because I know you are, and I don't care.

Some may consider that constructive but I don't. It doesn't really give any ideas, just the usual comments about how bad Avicus is. And sorry if you think I act irrational towards feedback, but it's not a problem to me. It would just be a little nice if we could get feedback that wasn't in a package that said "You guys suck" all over it.<br><br>I somewhat do agree with the channels being brought back because of how easy it is to just leave the channel, but it's going to need more than that to fully convince me. :&gt;

&nbsp;He's just sharing his opinion of what's the server becoming. It's the reality, may you like it or not. THIS is in what the server has turned. I mean, by what he's saying, you can understand why he thinks so and that is something you should fight, it's something you should review and think 'why is this one saying so about our server!!?!?!?' . That's why feedback is for.

If the demographic that is holding the Avicus teamspeak together are ones that want to be racist, offend groups, and be overall toxic, then by all means we would want to change TeamSpeak. That group is welcome to go somewhere else, but Avicus is a Minecraft server for everyone to enjoy, not just to be insulting.

Buddy boy, we're not trying to convince you. We're trying to convince the people who can actually do something. Not to mention that being irrational towards criticism, which I did not claim you are, is your problem since it showcases your abilities and maturity as a moderator in a rather negative manner.&nbsp;<br><br>Adding to the above post, I don't know what deleting 18+ will accomplish. The same assholes will continue to be assholes no matter what you do about it. The only difference is that they'll just drag their attitude into other channels now while moderators aren't watching, or even while so.&nbsp;<br><br>By the way, learn about harassment. If you have some kid sitting in the 18+ getting pissed on by other people, they can leave, after all it must be better than being intimidated and offended by others, right? That is punishable. But it's 18+, so 18+ content should be allowed, which doesn't exclude most adult topics that are generally discussed there now. Nobody should care if there is racism if you can just leave the damn channel with two clicks of the mouse. If the person is followed, that's an entirely different story.<br><br>From my perspective, this post is just staff and players once again wedging themselves apart from each other. You blockheads can't even get along over deleting a damn Teamspeak channel. It's stupid. Are we 12?&nbsp;<br><br>If I could make a suggestion, because apparently you want constructive help regardless of the fact that you'll just ignore my suggestion just as any like its grass in the wind, all channels should be stripped of their limitations, all chats general chats, and make a set of rules for Teamspeak that caters all varieties of players and has little to no grey area.&nbsp;<br><br>None of you are thinking about the big picture, the server as a whole (which is a big mistake for the situation this server is in).

The bad thing here is that the rest of the channels will become the old 18+ channels and it's the same thing with or without them, it'll continue to happens. It's nearly impossible to stop these jokes and stuff... I repeat, there is not more solution than having a better moderation on the channels. It will be worse than it was before. Please, staff head, reconsider it.
