I have many opinions. I do not understand your question. Greatest moment was when Avicus was MC Zone and /gamemode 1 was given to all players for like 10 hours. Fun times

@Okiba Don't have opinions on current staff. Don't know all of them well enough. The ones I know are good though.<br><br>@FallingDamag I don't think I know you... So no opinion? The alphabet is pretty solid, but I think they should get rid of the "and" before Z. It always threw me off. Green and 19.<br><br>@BoldAndBrash The order should have happened after the first breach of internaitonal law. I fully support it and I hope we continue to help the Syrian people.<br><br>@Original Pretty solid, how is ebirdy9 doing? (P.S. Amazing name)<br><br>@Claf Damn, I recognize your name. You were one of those badass players that always destroyed me. I've been pretty good, just living life. How're you? Unfortunately, I was not on the team. I honestly can't think of the name, I'll try to find it. And didn't you guys win (I think pmheys was on the team??)
