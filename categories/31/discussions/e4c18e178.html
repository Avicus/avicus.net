I've had my run and it's been a blast, thank you to everyone who's helped &amp; supported me along the way. Everyone single one of you had your own little spark and don't let that stop.&nbsp;<br><br><br>Team Rocket: You guys were a blast to play with and I'm sorry it had to end this way, Devon - I wish you handled this situation differently; you really made me feel bad and that had an impact on this decision - I hope we can forget and forgive once this is all over.<br><br>Apollo: As much memes as you gave me and the amount of jokes I made about runner up etc. you were fun to watch play and fool around with.<br><br>Cronus: My first competitive team I spent playing a tournament with, you gave me a chance and I know I'll never forget those who I made a friendship with.<br><br>Staff Team: You guys rock &amp; as much hate as the community gives you, you still are hardworking individuals who volunteer their time for this server.<br><br>ALM, Liz, Greg &amp; Jess: You guys were the best friends I never had, you guys are the ones that welcomed me into this place and helped me expand my friendliness to everyone, I thank you for that &lt;3 Keepthestreaks.<br><br>Thanks for the amazing runs guys, it was truly a blast to be a part of.<br><br><br>P.S. I'll be staying as ref :^)

Thank you for the service you have given towards Avicus (as a moderator). We are gonna miss you as a mod... but I'm glad you are going to remain as a ref :D <img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/38cc237d92724e01ad24f5b0110130c1?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/Acceqted.html" style="color: #009396">Acceqted</a>
