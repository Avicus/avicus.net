Hello,<br>I was wondering if u were allowed to have a mod that lets u sprint without double tapping the sprint key. Is this allowed or would that be considered a hack? Thx for the help

You can set a sprint key in default minecraft without mods.

You don't have to have a mod to do this anymore.<br>In the settings, you can now edit your sprinting key.<br>When you're editing your other keys just press the shift button when you get to the sprint section.<br><br>Hope that helps :)

A mod That would let u hold down the sprint key and U would auto sprint. I don't know if this is allowed, I was thinking of getting it but I wouldn't want to receive a ban

Like a toggle sprint?<br>No, I don't believe something like this is allowed.<br>It'll be best if you stick with what you have now.<br>Sorry bud.

Wouldn't setting it as caps lock be kind of like a toggle sprint key? Or does that only work for shift?

It doesn't work with caps lock :C<br>Also, setting your sprint to a key that's close to the arrow keys, such as 'R', helps you spam it and get insane knock back :D
