Yup. It's true. I feel like i gotta go.<br><br>Reason 1: PVP is so bad I cant have fun(my fault)<br>My pvp skills have dropped from 50/200 to -1/200. I guess it's because of the new maps that im not used to. This one is 100% my fault.<br><br>Reason 2: B-B-B.....Bored.<br>Not much to explain. I ain't digging the new maps and stuff.<br><br>Reason 3: Friends.<br>It's either they dont remember me, they don't like me anymore, or they /hub right when I say hi (its kinda funny lol) i feel many friends i had in the past dont remember me/care about me anymore.<br><br>Thanks, Avicus! For all the fun.

Well I am in the process of taking a break from playing minecraft altogether :/ I have gone 9 days and have 6 days to go. I too was getting slightly bored, but now i can't wait to return!<br><br>It's hard work, but i recommend a break; it'll do you some good. ;)

NO, don't leave. It doesn't matter if your good at PVP or not, it matters on if your having fun and experiencing new thrills.<br>Bored? New maps are out and new mini games, try to enjoy them. Give them a chance and you'll see what happens.&nbsp;<br>And you have tons of friends and we all motivate you to stay!

well remember, it doesn't have to be a long break. &nbsp;You could just take a week break, and then decide on what to do ;)&nbsp;

Im really sorry for the negativity, But if you have not decided on whether you are going, why create a post? Fishy did take a break from minecraft and did not need to make a post about it.&nbsp;<br>Its a moral decision and its entirely up to you. Maybe create a post on how to make yourself more productive while playing? But please make up your mind first&nbsp;<br>Thank you!
