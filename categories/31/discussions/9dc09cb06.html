Toggle Sprint illegal?

I was wondering If it is illegal. I've been using 'Toggle Sprint' Not 'Better sprint' for the past 2 years and it really dosen't do anything that people do already.<br><br>Example:<br><br>Toggle sprint makes it easier to walk or in a sense run in minecraft.<br><br>By pressing a button, For example mine is 'F' making your sprint toggled to where all you have to do is just hold down 'W' or whatever your walk foward button is, Instead of holding LControl and W.<br><br>Toggle sprint also comes w/ Toggle Sneak meaning instead of holding shift and while mining to a monument or something you unshift to message someone / reply to somone, your able to type in chat while still having your Shift toggled.<br><br>IMO: It does not really set an advantage over other players because all it really does is help us play minecraft alot easier with the Toggle keys.<br><br>It does not have anything to do with any Hacked client or Anything like that.<br><br>Note: I have not been in the community for the last 5 months so if it is legal forgive me, But it should be legal due to it not having anything to link with a client or any advantage over other players.

I think it should be allowed considering this is pretty much already in Minecraft. (CTRL for most people)

Well, I've an extra sprint button on my mouse which I always press. It is really overrated. Its only handy for rushing. I mostly walk back and forward in battles so I don't use it that much

Toggle sneak in reality does nothing besides your able to chat while still shifted, allowing rushers that are mining to still be sneaked.

It's not allowed because it gives an unfair advantage when you do things such as opening your inventory or the menu, you can stay crouched. It's for things like tunneling under the enemy's side and whatnot.

As that is true, it may give unfair advantages but making it legal more offensive players would probably download 'ToggleSprint/Sneak' to where alot of people having it and even defenders could use it.<br><br>I mean your 100% right but people will use it anyway :P.

Should the sprinting part not be allowed as well? If it is what he says it is, its pretty much like better sprint, you know when you hit someone while running and your sprint stops? Maybe for a second if your using the hotkey that Minecraft gives you. This would allow you to run 24/7 non stop no matter if you hit someone or not giving you an advantage.

Better sprinting toggles your crouch, but doesn't make it so you stay crouched when opening chests and whatnot.

What you stated is true, but it's more of a disadvantage than an advantage, stopping sprint and re-engaging is far better...

It'd seem like keeping the sprint toggled while being hit would be far less practical then stopping and re-engaging anyways.

No, while hitting as well. When you are running and you hit someone they get hit and you continue, with the hotkey minecraft gives you makes you stop for a second and then lets you continue sprinting letting your opponent get a bit farther. It's an advantage as you always staying pace with your opponent if chasing.

In my opinion it shouldn't be allowed because it gives you an advantage over other players.Every player should have the same chances to win the game. The already added "sprintkey" can be used by everyone. The toggle Sprint/better Sprint mod has to be downloaded to use it ingame. That means people who don't have the mod installed have a disadvantage.

Hmmm you can try re-binding your sprint key to a closer button or side mouse button or something that works for you.

The hotkey in minecraft can be held down you know, so holding it down and hitting players doesn't stop your sprinting. Toggle sprint should be allowed but the rules need to be re clarified for the enhancement of sprinting capabilities.

I don't think that it's an unfair advantage.<br><br>If you have a good trigger finger then you can sprint pretty much straight away, having instasprint doesn't make much difference imo.

how do you get toggle sprint to work without a mod that is not allowed (apart from permanently holding down the sprint key)? because i had it working on my laptop somehow idk if its a glitch or something but i have a new pc and i want to get toggle sprint on it because it really helps in pvp(especially when i block hit because it means i can sprint inbetween each block) but yea.... how do you get it to work??<br><br>is it an option through optifine or something??<br><br>(sorry for the bumb but i thought this would be appropriate here instead of making a new discussion)<br><br>thanks

If you hold your sprint button constantly during pvp you will be sprinting between each hit that you do. On my old laptop my sprint key was caps lock, the fact that this button is already toggled (like number lock etc.) meant that I could basically have constant sprint even without holding the sprint key down. So if I touched a block that would cancel my sprint I would carry on sprinting without having to press the sprint key again.&nbsp;<br><br>However i I think this was a glitch or something because I can't get it to work on my new PC. Is there a way of doing it and are toggle sprint mods legal??
