Whats up with the support email? It seems like no one is able to get a response.

We are always actively going through support emails. If you do not get a response within one week, I'd recommend resending it.

Don't worry, the staff do deal with support emails but replies may take some time. However, I will be sure to notify the Sr Mods about your support email. Do remember that the Support Rooms on the Avicus TeamSpeak can be used. Just poke any Sr Mod or higher and they will deal with your request.

The inbox is all clean right now. If you haven't received a response the email either didn't go through or was passed by for some reason (lacking username or other info).

As stated above, if you don't get a response within a week, I guess you can re-submit your appeal. Good luck with your appeal! :)
