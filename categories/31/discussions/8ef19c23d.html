Well, considering the past porn spam attacks and keylog attacks, I don't see this as being an ideal change (no seniors were able to punish until much later, when kylo would come on).<br><br>I'm sure training for this will phase out when we train for teamspeak -- if not, i'll add it to the mentoring sheet.

1) I don't really think he cares if you post that, in fact I think it allows him to have the post he made on the forums up.&nbsp;<br><br>2) a good tip is to not do things like this, doesn't look professional at all.

I don't think guidelines will fix the locking and deleting posts, seeing as they didn't really work previously with the locking. But this topic just seems like a argument to be made, I guess in the guidelines this topic will be locked.
