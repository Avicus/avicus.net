<b><u></u>What is this?</b><br>Alright, so this is an event organized by me and Jojo. Basically, we haven't seen anyone playing Elimination in months, and we decided to give it a try. It was actually pretty fun, and we don't understand why people don't play it. So, in an attempt to bring back the attention it deserves, we're going to be doing a monthly elimination tourney.<br><br><b>When is this?</b><br>This will be held on Friday, October 17th, at 5:00pm PST.<br><br><b>Who can join?</b><br>Anyone! Just leave your Skype name here, so we can get an idea of how many people will play, and decide whether we want to do this again next month. If you don't have Skype, that's fine. Just join the open Elimination server at the time of the tourney.<br><br><b>Why should I join?<br></b><b></b>Well, the winner of each tournament will receive a rank upgrade for one month, whether it's from nothing to gold, gold to emerald, or even emerald to diamond! Diamond donors can't receive an upgrade, but they can receive an upgrade on an alt, or give it to a friend for a month.<br><br><i>We hope that this is something you might be interested in, and it will really help if we can get players.</i>
