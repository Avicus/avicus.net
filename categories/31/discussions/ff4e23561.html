<div>Hello,</div><div>In our recent Map development meeting have we been discussing a lot of things. And one the things we'd like to introduce is something we call "The community removal". We're doing this to get the community's feedback on maps, if they would like to keep the maps or not.<br>&nbsp; This thread will be rebooted every week with 4 new maps!</div><div><br></div><div>So, how does this little thing work?</div><div><br></div><div>Every week on this thread you will see 4 maps. These maps are being discussed if we should keep or not. Under me you will right now see four different maps. We, Map Developers would like you to share your thought of this map. Do you want this map to stay, or get removed? When you give ur opinion on the map, please do motivate why you think like you do. Maybe we wont have to remove the map and instead make a certain change to it instead!</div><div><br></div><div>The following 3 maps that will either be removed/stay:</div><div><br></div><div><b>Fantasy</b></div><div><img src="https://avicus.net/maps/Fantasy/image" title="Image: https://avicus.net/maps/Fantasy/image"><br></div><div><i>We chose to discuss this map because in our eyes it's too big to provide a good aspect of gameplay.</i><br><i>We also chose this map because the monuments were poorly placed and came with confusion.</i><br><br></div><div>-------</div><div><br></div><div><b>Planks</b></div><div><img src="https://avicus.net/maps/Planks/image" title="Image: https://avicus.net/maps/Planks/image"></div><div><i>In our eyes the monuments are poorly placed and is kind of hard to defend.<br></i><i>We also think that it's very hard to rush because of how the map is created.</i><br><br></div><div>-------</div><div><br></div><div><b>Port town 2</b></div><div><img src="https://avicus.net/maps/PortTown2/image" title="Image: https://avicus.net/maps/PortTown2/image"><br></div><div><b></b><i>In our eyes the proportion of islands doesnt seem like it provides good gameplay.</i><br></div><div><br></div><div>This is when you can make a change, please motivate why you think like you do. Hopefully this will improve and create a better avicus experience.<br><br>Thank you!</div>

1) Remove it. Many people dislike it, some people even get lost, and I don't think the map is even. Could be edited.<br><br>2) Turns out stalematey most of the time, but I guess we can keep it.<br><br>3) Keep it. Good gameplay, no stalemate.

Fantasy: Classic and aesthetically pleasant. The Gameplay can be good if people are defending instead of rushing. (Keep)<br>Planks: Sometimes very stale since both monuments are at the same place (Remove)<br>Port Town: I like the map, also sometimes stale, but it offers great gameplay (Keep)

Well that's sadly the kind of issue we're dealing with. We want to improve the rotations with maps based on good gameplay and not memories :/

Fantasy: Keep! Classic map and is still quite popular.<br><br>Planks: Remove. This map can last for ages and its design isn't the best.<br><br>Port Town 2: Indifferent. I like yet I don't at the same time. It has a good design but the gameplay is a little stale.

<b>Fantasy:</b> Please <u>remove</u>, it's way easier to win if you're on red team (at least for me, I know a few others think this way too) and the gameplay isn't very good especially when it stalemates because it just ends up being a lot of running just to end up dying and it becomes a boring cycle.<br><br><b>Planks:</b> The only bad thing about this map is the monument placing, if you can make it so it's not as easy to stalemate that'd be great, otherwise <u>remove</u>.<br><br><b>Port Town 2:</b> The gameplay on this one is very good and it continues to be fun even when it does stalemate because there is a lot of space for combat and there are a lot of paths you can take to get to the other side, please <u>keep</u>.

Fantasy: Too big bad, monuments are really hard to get, long, the speed, sword,<br>Planks: All right apart from the fact that you have to mine two monuments on top of one which requires a long process<br>Port Town 2: Beautiful map, no stalemate, everything is equal &lt;3 keep it

1.) I really loved playing this map in back in the days, but somehow, it has a become a shitty gameplay.<br>2.) It's really hard for rushers to get the monument, when you are alone as rusher or when the defense is big. My suggestion: Add Efficiency 3, 4 or 5 to the diamond pickaxe, so you can mine it faster.<br>3.) Either change to whole map, or remove it. It's a bad map imo.

1. Keep. It's a true classic that many people still love, and it's one of the last remaining maps that requires clever tactical knowledge (eg. routes players can take).<br>2. Remove. The monuments are poorly place, and it's just a little awkward in terrain proportion as well. (I'll be honest here, I've always disliked this map)<br>3. Keep. It may not be aesthetically pleasing to the eye, but it's great for PvP and rushing tactics.

<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; ">1) Rushed very quickly! But I gotta admit it is a fun ass map with great aesthetics.

1) Remove, way too big and way to easy to rush<br>2) Keep, I really enjoy the gameplay as it does take a tad bit of skill to get around all the players as the map is narrow either by killing anyone who goes in your way or rush it silently<br>3) KEEP, I love the map, you guys may think it has bad gameplay but tbh the PvP aspect of it is amazing, you have so many choices to go on each platform which is flat and big enough for amazing PvP experience but all the different places to go make it that you have to think strategically where you must go to actually rush.

Fantasy: The Orcs side has the advantage. It usually ends quite quickly. Gameplay isn't very good. <b>Remove<br><br></b>Planks: Can be a bit of a stalemate at time, but has still decent gameplay.&nbsp;<b>Keep</b><br><b><br></b>Port Town 2: Tbh I don't anything wrong with this map, fun to rush, fun to defend. <b>Keep</b><b><br></b>

Keep-edit it maybe but don't change it that much so people don't think it's been deliberately remade. Who cares if its gameplayee one of the worst maps, nostalgia must live on.<br><br>edit or remove - bad mon placement, bad mid, too narrow. If we take that multiply it by pi, an divide by x we are left with stalemate on boring<br><br>remove I hate this map. Maybe just remove the water and move the mons. At least on planks the defenders can't respawn and jump 2 feet to mon. Bad mid as well

<p>&gt; 1: Keep it, it's one&nbsp; of my personal favorite maps and most other people like it too!</p><p>&gt; 2: Remove it, IMO, a good defense will most likely keep the game going on for a while and it's pretty stalemate.</p><p>&gt; 3: Keep it, it flows nicely and isn't that much of a stalemate.</p>

I mean the aesthetics of this map are pretty dang good, its just the gameplay that isn't the greatest. <br><br>2) Remove, I really don't enjoy its gameplay, and its definitely stalematey <br><br>3) Gameplay is pretty good, along with pretty decent aesthetics. +1

Hello,<br><br>Due to the massive feedback (which we are really happy for) I've decided to reboot this every "week" with 4 new maps instead of 3. You may already see some edits to the main post, this is for next saturday.<br>A system for maps will also be added soon. In the system you'll find a score "0-0-0".<br>Each 0 stand for Keep-Edit-Remove.<br><br>Regards!
