I assume it was after he got demoted. Yes, maybe he is salty, but unlike many other staff, he was staff because he likes to help, not because his aim was to become Sr mod or just becauss he was power hungry, he was actually really efficient and helpful.

There are a lot of people that want to help. Doesn't mean they are good. To be a mod you need to be a leader, someone who makes their server look good, someone who can lead the staff team, someone who is helpful to players. If you want to know, I said everything in order to most important to least important. The two top things he was not. Also this was when he was Sn Mod. He raged at players that were raging at him and made himself look like a bad mod. This happened from my knowledge more than 3 times.
