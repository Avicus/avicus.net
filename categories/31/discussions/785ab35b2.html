Hello once again,<br><br>I am making this thread today because I want to know why Avicus gives players so many chances when that player should be Permanently Banned from the Avicus Network. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/AJ2iWbW.png" title="Image: http://i.imgur.com/AJ2iWbW.png"><br>&nbsp;<img src="http://i.imgur.com/92ZcSCy.png" title="Image: http://i.imgur.com/92ZcSCy.png"><br>&nbsp;<br>As you can see this player, who will remain anonymous, was given many chances to stop being rude and to be nice to others and still continued to do this rude behavior and will be able to join the servers again on July 27th. This player should have been permanently banned a long time ago, but this player will be able to come back onto the servers and probably break the rules again. IMO it should be warn -&gt; kick -&gt; temp ban -&gt; perma ban no matter how long the last punishment has been because they did learn from that mistake. Something needs to be done about this.

When a mod punishes someone they don't instantly know how many punishments they've gotten in the past unless they randomly check.<br><br>I do agree that this player should be perma banned though.

There is a new command that let's you see the infraction history (from what I heard)

Yes there is, but it comes down to if the mod manually checks their history or not, also the strictness of the mod.

It's better (at least to me) to think things through instead of just diving in head-first and giving out a false ban. That's why I always doubt myself before issuing a ban. Never said I was proud of it, but this is definitely something up for discussion in the meeting.

No, he doesn't and I apologise for that as that was my fault.<br>/History is still a relatively new command that I'm personally still training myself to use properly.

There is a /history command that lists all the previous infractions and their dates. I use this 100% of the time before punishing.

As Lego said,there is a /history command, and from when I was mod (not sure if it changed) you were obligated to use it, not a recommendation nor is it optional

It's much more better to be stricter on our judgement of players. We shouldn't be just giving them chances if they are doing what they are doing constantly. It only doesn't effect them but everyone else therefore warn- kick-tempban-ban should be applicated.

I definitely think we'll be discussing how lenient we should be in the staff meeting. This is a pretty controversial topic on the network (imo) and I think it needs to be put to rest soon.

Lately, I've just been feeling like I'm not being strict enough, but I don't know if I'm really doing what I'm supposed to. So, hopefully, we can all at least try to clarify how many repeated offenses (within a certain time period) it takes to have a drastic punishment issued.<br><br>It's just been a bit unclear to me for a while, and I'm tired of feeling conflicted everytime I give out an infraction.

You shouldn't feel bad or conflicted whenever you give out a punishment. Let's say that you saw a person being rude to someone and they have multiple temp bans in the past three months on their record for being rude. What would you do? You would permanently ban that person because of there history, no matter how small the punishment is. That's how I feel it should be because just giving out temp bans and then allowing the player to come on again and be rude to other people isn't right.

Yeah, that's something I've been meaning to work on: I gotta stop second-guessing myself. Never said I was proud of it. And yes, that's exactly what I'd do in a situation like that.
