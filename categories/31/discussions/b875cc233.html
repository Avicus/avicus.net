I have seen some threads are locked because someone commented on it a few days after the last post.<br>The thing is that it was on topic, there was really no need for the thread to be locked.<br><br>I always thought that commenting on old threads was OK as long as your comment is constructive towards the thread.<br><br>Bumping threads with irrelevant comments isn't allowed.<br>Bumping threads while contributing to the thread is OK.<br><br>Am I correct? Or have I been misinformed?

On that note, I have seen a thread being locked just because it was bumped, but the comment was relevant... <br>Perhaps the Jrs need to make sure they know the rules correctly?<br>Not being a dick, just suggesting.

Well bring back old topic will make it a bit spammy. Think of it as a debate within a debate, when you bump topics.

It's not really spam if the comment is contributing to the discussion though.

You may bump a thread if the comment contributes to the thread. If it's completely useless, then it should be locked.

This has happened again with a recent topic about Minecraft being purchased.<br><br>I have seen to many topics being locked simply because someone bumped a thread even though they were contributing to the thread.<br><br>Moderators need to learn that bumping topics is OK as long as it's contributing to the thread.<br><br>To many moderators lock threads simply because it has been bumped, had they cared to read the post, many threads would still be up today.

Also to add on, locking a thread may not necessarily be because the post is a large bump and does not contribute. It could be that it was a large bump and it very very relevant to the thread, but the thread itself is redundant.<br>e.g. "Minecraft 1.6 is released! Name all the features you have found!", and someone were to say that there are some very pretty horses.<br>Very relevant to the topic, yes, but the topic itself is completely redundant.

Although that may be true, I have seen moderators lock threads with the reason that it was bumped and not because the thread was out of date.<br><br>This is why I started this thread, to address the problem towards the moderators.

That's true, but in the op, you were also asking for clarification, at least, I interpreted it as.
