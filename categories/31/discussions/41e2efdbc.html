Recently my application got denied because of immaturity. I'm sure this has happened to others as well. But I don't get what this "immaturity" means, I have seen so many different people who are staff now using slang words and stuff in game, for example: "ez,dux hax,nu,/bun". I just don't get it... I don't have an infractions due to vulgarity/disrespect. Anyways if any of you have been denied because of immaturity then I feel sorry for you as I have too.<br><br>Screenshot:&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://i.imgur.com/D5uOx4L.png">http://i.imgur.com/D5uOx4L.png</a>

I feel like it. But be mature means that you DO THIS.<br>Control your self. Doing this on the forums isn't good and it will be locked.<br>If you want an answer, contact via skype someone.

You know what you've done wrong, but you don't want to admit it.

The immaturity for getting declined is because the staff does not think you would use the commands given to you properly, and abuse it.
