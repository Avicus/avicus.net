</h1>
Hey everyone, I'm not trying to sound angry or diss anyone or anything, so try not to take any offence, but I'm just simply wondering when the staff will fix this 'timed out' problem, because this problem just won't leave for me and is starting to eat away at my patience..<br><br>I know you can say just be patient, its just my two concerns is that the server has recently been gaining people, and it has been more alive, but if 50% of our players are going to time out every 30 seconds to 2 minutes, then i don't image they will be here long..<br><br>But also, I'm starting to run low of time to play, as i am busy with end of school stuff and i will be gone from the server for a while in the holidays, so id love to play some more while i actually have time. And i don't want to sound selfish, but I'm sure there are others who can relate with the time to play thing..<br><br>Anyways, I'm simply wondering - from a mod or player - when you think this will stop?<br><br>Thanks all - OPTOBAT

Direct connect helps for me. Like a specific server on Avicus.

Please report the bug and <b>be patient.&nbsp;</b>Plus, I'm pretty sure Ivy is already aware of this, thus he might be working on a solution.

I reported a bug once, my report was removed and I got "We know" as an answer. I think, in my opinion, you shouldn''t act like that, so I will not report any bugs anymore. Please, do not think I target you, as you don't&nbsp;have anything to do with Github. I just think it's the wrong way to act against people who actually try to help out.

I never said guess.. not once.. I just asked if anyone knew when it would stop, it doesn't always have to be a mod, which is why i said&nbsp;<b>anyone</b> can tell me..<br>And yes, thanks for adding the be patient, i have been told this before. Alot.<br>So thanks for telling me that Ivy is on to this and ill be sure to stay as patient as i can :S

If it still isn't working for you, I'd give it a few hours. Or even try tomorrow, it's not permanent :)
