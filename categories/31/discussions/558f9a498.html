Is it allowed? Cause I had a teammate today that stole my iron at the last seconds and it ended up getting me killed since I didn't have enough armour to combat... don't tell me to report since I reported TWICE and no mods came. I get they are busy but this is team trolling!!! IT GOT ME KILLED.

They should make it so furnaces and chests can be private

Can vouch for that one. I was in the game and Vlad&nbsp;<b><i>RAGED&nbsp;</i></b><i></i>on Skype when it happened.

Hey vlad!&nbsp;<br>I'm so sorry there weren't any mods to come to your report, but there wasn't much staff today.&nbsp;<br><br>Try these options:<br><br>File a report in player reports with evidence.<br><br>or:<br><br>Send a message to any of us staff and we'll try and deal with it as soon as possible!<br><br>Most of the staff team have Skype so if you have evidence of him greifing, please just send it over.<br><br>Thanks! :)

That still doesn't solve anything. You need furnace locks.

I agree that it's hard to catch the team griefers in action.&nbsp; I don't want to record all the time since it effects my fps. Plus, a screen shot doesn't prove anything.<br><br>Here are some suggestions:<br>1. Team with players you know won't steal (gold, emerald, diamond)<br>2. Cook iron in a private, secluded location (less traffic)<br>3. Don't cook it all at once (one or two pieces at a time using multiple furnaces)<br>4. Get more iron than you'll need (30+ when possible)<br>5. Announce to all players that someone griefed you and usually that person will get killed soon after drop (revenge is sweet)<br>6. Always do /report (mods will come if available)<br><br>Griefers stink.

To answer your question, no, it is not allowed.<br>Your teammate stole from you. This can be classified as playing against your own team. Which is not allowed and can be punishable.
