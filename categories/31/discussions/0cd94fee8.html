Should I be banned for this?

This only happened about 30 minutes ago so I unfortunately I don't really have evidence, so anyway:<br><br>I was enjoying a chilled out game of Nexus whilst on Team Speak (I didn't have my mic plugged in though) and at times I would quote in the Nexus chat what the people in ts were saying (quite immature I know).<br><br>At one point I accidentally said the word rap* (I'm not sure if it needs to be sensored) and for about 20 minutes this 7 year old by the name of spainethechamp or something like that started shouting at me saying I took his "innocence away". After a couple of games, he started making up lies such as:<br>I threatened to kill him&nbsp;<br>AND<br>I threatened to rap* him.<br><br>He also demanded that I should be banned for this.<br><br>The irony is, even after I said sorry for saying the word, he continued to say it in every sentence.<br><br>So the question is, should I be banned?

From your infractions, you aren't punished for anything.<br>If you do not like the language in Team Speak then join a different channel where the rules are stricter such as the swearing forbidden channel.<br><br>

Personally, I'd refrain from saying anything rude in chat. <br>I was in the game, but I wasn't really looking at the chat much. You would definitely not be permanently banned for saying something like that don't worry :D<br>You'd most likely receive a warn if anything.<br>

You won't be banned. Actually, he was pretty much trolling. We're dealing with him at the moment.
