There are wayyy too many TDMs and OiTNs (IMO) in nebula right now and I believe that's not how nebula should be played (still MO) I know there are still quite a lot of DTMs (70:30 ratio) but in MCzone I believe it was more like 90:10.<br>I just think DTM has so much more gameplay possibilities and people can play it TDM style.<br><br>post your opinions and I'm sure I'm gonna get a lot of hate :D

Ahhhh<br>So. My opinion is good for me.<br>Many rushers have Shitty K/D. No one actually cares from K/D But clans are denying them for that :/<br>So, OiTN Is awesome game for make your K/D better. I guess some people requested that.<br>I love rushing, I don;t know what to say.<br>+1 Because i want more rushing<br>-1 because i want higher K/D<br>:P

If you want TDM I dont get why you cant play it on Nexus....&nbsp;<br>IMO what makes Nebula, Nebula is the DTM.

Exactly what I was trying to say. TDM is just unkitted nexus and why not One in The Nexus?<br>(there would be quite a few issues with that)

Nexus is Kit TDM but Nebula isn't. That's why they have TDM in normal nebula. Some of those maps are void to kits.

It gives players more of a challenge on the OiTN for dust devils. Just plain old nebula isn't always going to catch the attention of non-community members as much as a challenge of sorts. One hit kill on a DTM match? The players always have to be on their toes. Nebula without it would probably be the same old thing every time.

I'm not saying it should be removed because I'm sure almost everyone likes to play a TDM I just think there should be less of them. Also I used to luv venomous OiTN but then my internet got worse and my ping is too bad for it.

I love Nebula TDM but I'm not a huge fan of Nexus due to the kits..<br>I just like everything to be even, no matter what level you are.

In my opinion, I hate Nebula TDM and almost never play it, with the exception of Venomous TDM. I think they should just be removed completely.

Maybe there should be a sub section of neb as TDM and OiTN only because it's different to nexus, many people enjoy it and many people dislike it. There are enough maps for a large enough rot and can give people what they want instead of waiting for a good match.

I'm not saying it's a bad thing and if my ping is under 350 I will give OiTN a chance. But TDM just offers soo much more gameplay.

Well for one thing, team death match is fun. And you don't have to complain about kits. And you can break/place blocks. And the nebula shop.
