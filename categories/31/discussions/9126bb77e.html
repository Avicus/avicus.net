Due the account hacking, he was banned and the rank are gone. Don't worry not for long, like jozzy. He only have to change all passworts, then he would be back as Mod and MapDev. Now he is playing in his old account TheMasterCow (sadly)

ParaSpider's account was compromised like many others, for secruity purposes, we moved his ranks to TheMasterCow, his old account.

Thanks for the input. Account hacking? When did that happen?<br>I got a bit scared because I thought he retired and Evo would be stressed out as the only MapDev :P

Well there has been this link going around skype. If you go to the website nothing bad happens untill you enter you passwords and usernames. The link starts like <a rel="nofollow" href="http://fourm.hive">http://fourm.hive</a>. And you get a keylogger or something. Then bomb. Your accounts hacked.

If the website is closed or if there's a 404, change your passwords and do a full virus scan. &nbsp;Usually if they do that, it's just an installer for a trojan or keylogger.
