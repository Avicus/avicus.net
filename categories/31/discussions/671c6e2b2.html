</h1>
There have been recent events that concern our former Administrator, ViceWatercolour, also known as ParaSpider. We understand that it has caused confusion, and this thread will address the situation.<br><br>Vice had had his Administrator rank removed, due to him ultimately misusing his Administrator permissions.<br>We won't divulge what exactly happened.<br><br>Furthermore, Vice has chosen to retire from the Staff Team completely.<br><br>Thank you for your understanding.

Thanks Para for all you've done for us. You were a great person to us. You'll be missed as staff ;(<br><br>Why can't we have any Staff member to last for at least a reasonable amount of time?

Well it must have been bad (I'm not sure myself) because all of the Senior Staff voted for his demotion, and I'm sure this was taken seriously since an Administrator had not been demoted in quite a while.

The person this thread revolves around, but Vice won't be because the senior staff team will stick to their policy.

LOL, the staffs decisions make me cringe sometime. Vice was the hardest working staff member I've ever seen. He's done so much for the server and then he lost Admin which doesn't really matter I guess but then you take away MapDev and Official from him... He was a pretty decent MapDev but I don't know anything about what he&nbsp; did as an Officical... I would like the full story as well so someone please send it to me over skype.

What's done is done. Will you explain to me how he abuses his powers? I still fail to see. Did he demote someone for no reason?

I was demoted for abuse on the server. Though a thread was made for this, and I still disagree with the decision, I have that right to express my opinion. I was demoted by the senior staff team, and I finished up all my projects in one single TeamSpeak session. The demotion reasons I can explain, however one of them was where I wasn't thinking straight and ended up abusing TeamSpeak permissions, where I got a revocation of my TS Dev rank, and my admin/senior rank. It seems after talking I got my staff rank back (concluded as an accident). Following my demotion, I have retired. The abuse in question was lava'ing a friend only I was with in TeamSpeak (who did not care and played along), another was making a "life support" lounge and "weed lounge", and having fun on an empty walls server with other staff who also abused without penalty. With no staff warns, I was promptly demoted.<br><br>As for if I'm leaving, I'm just taking a break. I'm still actively involved in many Avicus projects.

People have the right to discuss the topic if they wish to. For it being the first admin demotion and left with no clarity, which took a while to be cleared up, where there's no system for admin demotions, I can kinda see why.
