So lately I've been having some connection problems on Avicus. I get the "World Downloading" screen for about 5 minutes, and once in the lobby, it takes me another 5 minutes to actually get the game menu. I only get 1 bar, and when playing, people practically teleport around me, making Avicus unbearable. I play on plenty of other servers, but this doesn't happen to me. Any help?

I get this same stuff lately. Long loads and then huge lag spikes. Avicus staff is usually pretty good at figuring this stuff out and getting it together so im just waiting it out. I really can't play avicus the way its been for me where I usually get a ping from 30-50 then I spike up around 350 pretty consistently.
