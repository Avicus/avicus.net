Eyo, after quite some time I am back with another update! There is quite a bit too talk about so let's get straight into it....<br><br><br><i><b><u>Where has this update been?!<br></u></b></i><br>To be honest, these were hoped to be weekly; however, as it is Spring Break for Michael and I we have been quite busy and unable to produce these literary masterpieces. If you want to know my whole amazing story to put it short, I went to Vietnam. Got a cold, and did <b>NOT </b>go to the beach and then almost missed my flight! Michael has been busy with multiple tournaments, conferences. If you did not know, Michael is the most pro Taekwondo person ever!!!&nbsp;<br><br><b><i><u>What's cooking with the Management Team? (Admins + Managers)<br></u></i></b><br>Recently, quite a few things have been discussed and thrown about among the higher ups. However, we are currently focused on creating a new staff policy, the goal of this overhaul is to rehash the ideas within the document and also to make it a lot more up to date. This policy has some orientation to the community as well so stay tuned! In the end, we hope to provide a very concise and clear policy that all staff will be required to uphold.<br><br><br><b><i><u>The Atlas Update and what is to come!<br></u></i></b><br>I may not be a map-dev; however, with the new update coming into its own soon I highly recommend everyone give map making a shot! With a variety of new features and such able to be implemented, I am sure the creative minds that all of you have would be able to produce the next Quintus, OR EVEN BETTER... The next Quintos.... I for one am really excited at the prospect of seeing a Rendezvous CTW/DTM! (Which I hear is in the making!) Anyways, seriously. With the huge update inbound I look forward to seeing a new generation of map-devs sprout and hopefully some really interesting maps be churned out from both you guys and the map-devs! Damn son, you see that<br><br><b><i><u>A new tournament approaches..<br></u></i></b><br>I am not sure whether you guys have noticed or not; however, Bloodoh also known as Max has taken it upon himself to host an unofficial TDM tournament! Also known as, Bloodthirsty... This tournament was somewhat unendorsed at the start so Pokerface, Jozzmcozz, myself and Kyoal have joined together to try and promote this tournament. Jozz and I hope to try and make a lot of these unofficial events hosted by YOU, a lot more official. The fact that many people actually want to try and host events is quite nice to see and frankly, it encourages the officials to host more frequent events.<br><br><b><i><u>Staff Applications!<br></u></i></b><br>Assuming you read the forums you probably know that we are currently holding staff applications! However, dont be shy. Anyone could get a chance at an interview.. Its a matter of how you represent yourself and how you go about yourself ingame and out of game on places like TS and the forums. Although few will get junior mod, and maybe even mod there are a lot of people who probably wont get to be a junior and hence, might get demoralized. Alas, this is not a reason to fret! You might not always get a chance the first time.. I for one got moderator on my third attempt at the rank! Not everyone can go 1 for 1. Its a matter of persevering and being able to brave and tribulations you might face! Anyways, enough with the chit-chat. Some of you may not know this; however, this staff applications standards were raised quite high and we do not expect that many people to get to junior mod. Hence, I recommend you do not feel bad if you get denied this time as we are only looking for the best of the best. If you do not think you are the best you can be then definitely think to yourself. "What am I doing wrong?" If you cannot tell, ask someone to help you out. On the other hand if you know what you did wrong, look at the issue and try and see how you can fix the problem. Thats enough inspirational talk for me, I wish you all the best of luck!<br><br><b><u><i>Promotions and Demotions!<br></i></u></b><br>Not much has happened in the past few weeks; however, a few things have indeed happened!<br><br>-ThePizza or Pizza334 has returned from retirement and is currently a junior moderator. Lets hope he doesn't bite off too much to chew... (hah hah haaa haha)<br>- Sho or Spicytunaroll9 has returned from retirement as well! The staff team is glad to have him back and are S<i>ho&nbsp;</i>happy to see him back on the staff team.<br>- Sadly.... GrapeSmoothie was temporarily returned back to the moderator rank. This is a temporary situation and is based off of some performance issues.

Yay! Missed reading these. Lots of information and a great way to distribute the information.<br><br>I have one question, what has happened to The Avicus Newspaper? That was a great thing and basically like one of these but more appealing to the eye and includes events or hot topics on the forums.

Any particular reason why my post was removed? It contributed to the thread... and it was a valid suggestion... just because you don't agree with it doesn't mean it should be removed.

I enjoyed it quite a bit. I stayed in two cities, denang and Saigon/Ho Chi Minh City. Denang is a place for beaches. I stayed in a really nice resort. Sadly it rained quite a bit and there was almost no sun so I could not get a proper chance to swim. :/ Otherwise, Hoi An is an area close to denang that is full of history. I must say though, the Vietnamese are quite proud of winning the Vietnam War they have quite a proud feeling about it
