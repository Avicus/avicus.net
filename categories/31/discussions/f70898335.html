Quintus, Once my favorite map, has now turned into a really unfair kill farm map which has made me come to the decision to write this. At the beginning of Avicus, I thought quintus was the coolest map. Everyone seemed to love it, everyone always talked about it over and over again. Now a days, quintus has turned into a kill farm map. Where'd that come from? This is more like spawn kill farming, players can't escape the bounds of their spawn area, without getting pegged by swords, and have the constant dread about being killed rather than enjoying the game. Imagine you were a brand new person to the server and you were on the team being kill farmed. You would probably be really mad about what is going on, and confused as well. You would be like, I can't escape my spawn, players with full diamond are hitting me just as I step out of the protective shell of spawn. Wouldn't that just be annoying? Then imagine that player thinking of leaving the server, and never coming back again, because of the experience he/she just faced.&nbsp;I'm quite pissed off that this is happening on avicus. The legacy of quintus being such a unique map is almost a mirage to me now. Where has the old quintus gone?<br><br>Please respond to this. And thank you for reading this as well<br><br>-peace

Killfarming is a tactic and is allowed on the server. If people think the Players are Spawn Killing and being unfair they can report them.

In other circumstances, kill farming puts new challenge on players. It makes them want to pvp more to get out.

Honestly you can legit just avoid them, it's not hard. I don't mean this in an offensive way but get good and avoid the killfarms. Honestly I hate threads about people saying kill farming being unfair it's usually just people who don't know how to rush that automatically start complaining saying killfarming is spawnkilling. I am mainly a rusher but sometimes I like to killfarm with friends on TS. Once again: get good and find ways to avoid killfarms.

I agree however the thing what I play or any other players do is when they get diamond armor they go and kill farm .Then when they die we go rushing to get monuments.<br><br>For example yesterday I was kill farming (not successful) I got 33 kills not bad then I died .

That could backfire... Just imagine a wave of diamond people with strength pots :o<br><br>@OP As others have said you could simply just avoid them. It can be tricky at times, but with the opposing team kill farming there is usually no defence that will prevent you from breaking a monument, unless you fall into the void... .-.

I know exactly what you mean canuck_pro, it used to be all about strategy and desperately trying to defend when you're losing 4 - 0, or digging to the back and stealthily creeping toward the back monument, and now its this evolved landscape for impenetrable, importable, non killable kill farmers..<br>its lost its touch :(

It really depends.... Mostly on the amount/aggressiveness of the killfarmers. Generally I feel kill-farming should not be allowed, but seeing that most staff do kill farm it will never become a rule.

Think about it like this, if your first match on Avicus was essentially trying to figure out how to get out of your spawn, would you want to play more? Why not go and find a server where you can actually play the intended gamemode.&nbsp;How would new players know what too do if they were being overwhelmed by un-killable players.

You can report staff if they're&nbsp;<b>actually breaking the rules</b>, but you can't report <b>anybody</b> for kill farming because it's not against the rules. You can report people for spawnkilling though.<br><b></b>

But the thing is I&nbsp;<i>want&nbsp;</i>to play quintus. I know there are other rots, but only a few have Quintus. This is just what I think.

In my opinion, kill farming and spawn killing are two different things. Kill farming you can get by. Spawn killing is when they won't let you by. If you go around the sides and they leave you alone, that's fine. If they don't let you by, that's technically spawn killing. Spawn killing is punishable. Therefore, you have the power to use the report command or record (I've already given examples before using vladrhegreat's video) the spawn killers.<br><br>someone's probably already been through this, but I'm not reading the 5 pages of this thread.

Honestly you can legit just avoid them, it's not hard. I don't mean this in an offensive way but get good and avoid the killfarms. Honestly I hate threads about people saying kill farming being unfair it's usually just people who don't know how to rush that automatically start complaining saying killfarming is spawnkilling. I am mainly a rusher but sometimes I like to killfarm with friends on TS. Once again: get good and find ways to avoid killfarms.

100% agreeing with you, I have made a video of kill farming and how it is, no one seems to care unless the negative side hits hard. Best to leave it how it is and wait for the predictable to happen and help build the server back up into a new and better server.

If you look at the map, if one team pushes harder than the other then they will start kill farming. I do not mind killfarming but I do mind kill farming on that map. There is no real area for players to get around kill farming which for good gameplay there should. To all the people who want to say "But there should be a way to stop them if they are good enough." There isn't. Unless the other team actually is respectful and pulls back to the main castle area than there is a chance but lets face it, we play minecraft. The iron location is too far from the spawn and so it is easy to kill farm with just diamond. It is a bad map.

That's not selfish tbh, he's a rusher mainly and it's true. It's actually quite easy to avoid killfarms and there are plenty of ways around it. You can leave the game if you're being kf'd as well. I fail to see how stating the truth is selfish.&nbsp;<br><br>When I'm being killfarmed I just rush. As soon as you're by the killfarmers it's easy monuments from there. As long as you don't fall it's easy to end the game because everyone is up there. I'm not the greatest rusher out there, but It's an easy ending from there. You're also likely get past them again, even if you die or fall off.

ehh killfarming is a legit tactic. It should not be banned. However, if the people kill farming are spawn killing, thats when it should be illegal.
