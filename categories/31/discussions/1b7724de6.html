Hello all. I hope you all are doing well and hopefully are enjoying your holidays! Today's edition of the D.S is going to be relating to super heroes! Today's question(s) is, If you could, what kind of super powers would you want to have? They could be anything! If you want you can include the following;<br><ul><li>Who is your favorite superhero?</li><li>If you had to make up your own superhero what would his/her name be?</li><li>Are they dark like batman, or friendly like superman?</li></ul>You decide! I hope this edition is fun for all of you!<br><br>Peace!<br><br>-C_P

I'd love to be able to fly. Fly across the beautiful Atlantic to visit beautiful people. &lt;3<br><br>Dreams aside, I actually never thought about creating my own superhero. I have, however, thought about creating my own "Z Fighter" (Dragon Ball Z fans, you better know what I'm talking about). She'd have similar powers to that of a Saiyan, even with transformations, but they'd be different in some way. She'd also be the only female fighter. x3

Whoops I forgot to tell you all what powers I would want!<br>1. My favorite super hero is the HULK!!!<br>2. I would like to have super intelligence and telekinesis so that I can both fly around and move things using my telekinetic forces, and&nbsp;<br>3. If I could create a super hero, I would name him, Virus. I thought the name "Virus" sounded cool because by having super intelligence, Virus could hack into anything, and could steal valuable data/control computers around the world, hence the real virus, "computer virus"
