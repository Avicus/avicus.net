Well, it's been a while......a long while. So, I just want to say what I have seen in my short visit here.<br><br>&nbsp; First, where I have been. Tbh, I not only quit Avicus, but Minecraft in general. Playing a game for a year straight. However, Avicus.....is really boring right now. More on that later. I now spend a lot of my time perfecting Mega Man games and doing smart stuff. (Algebra 1 in 7th grade. Yez.) And school has never been better. Awesome friends, awesome girls, (I can now say that a smart blonde chick is possible.) and awesome classes. (Engineering is so awesome, might become an engineer. Or a chemisist. Inside joke.) So, that is a brief outline of where I have been.<br>&nbsp; Now, what I have to say about Avicus. The server itself....is one of the laggiest ever. NCP just annoys the hell out of me, and server quality is just awful.<br>Community? I took one look at the front page, looked through some topics. And I can quite honestly say that you guys have gone bad. Hostility, and just plain annoyance. All you people tryharding to be mod...forget it, there is no point getting mod on a server which will not last the end of 2014. (It's true, admit it.)<br>That's what I have to say. Deal with it.

I know it's laggy/terrible right now, but (possible) new devs and new staff, along with the rest of the servers, will TRY to make it better. If not, :/

To be honest this isn't a very strong rant.<br><br>While I understand that the server is lagging right now, that's no reason to criticize Avicus.

What topics do you see on the forum page that annoys you? You need some evidence in order to prove that our community is terrible.<br><br>"Don't try at Mod, it never lasts." This part of your rant I did not like.<br>Trying for Mod is beneficial, it gives you a chance to experience what it's like to be an adult. When you get older and want to try for a job, you have to go through a long process such as writing a resumé, and having the skills and attitude to keep the job. It places a great amount of responsibility on your shoulders.&nbsp;<br>When I see the applications open, I see a chance to get better prepared in life. You can carry the responsibility of leading this community only through a long, hard process. That is life.<br><br>My overall view on this rant.<br>It's not the best.

Yes the server is laggy, yes the server is at a low point. But I have seen worse, a lot worse. I am currently staff on a small survival server that was huge back in the day, about the same size as mczone. It has now died down to a point where it is rare to seen more than 6 people on. The main downfall of this server is because it was survival and survival isn't that popular anymore. But Avicus is pvp, which is a HUGE part of Minecraft right now. Avicus is far from dead, we just need someone to improve it then get youtubers on here to advertise.

This server isn't dying. It's many many people's favorite server since MC Zone beta. Even if only 3 people were still here, guess what. I'd still be playing it. This is my favorite server and I will play it until it's complete end, which won't be anytime soon. Nebula, CTH, Walls, it's all fun! And the staff? They're the best! Community? Awesome! If people don't like the server, please just leave instead of attempting to make a flame war. ;)<br><br><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/WVJ9WHV.gif">

If you compare this Community with another server, with a different Community, this, Avicus Community clearly stands out. People always accept each other, always have laughs in game and just enjoy talking to other people. If you look at other servers, their community is absolutely horrible, you could say Avicus is heaven and the others are hell. In game it might be bad, but the regulars and the forums user know what there doing and know how to keep the Community together.

Agreed. The rant was weak on its own and the blond thing was too far.
