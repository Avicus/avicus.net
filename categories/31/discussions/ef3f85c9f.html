Hey guys! This post is called a "discussion starter." The purpose of this post is basically to just start a random but interesting conversation. So here's the question: What does your skin symbolize? Like did u create your own skin? Does it symbolize a character or an animal? For example, my skin is basically me in nice clothes, wearing sun glasses, which symbolizes my love for being outdoors. And the orange shades symbolize my favorite color, Orange! I hope that that this will be a fun way to know about everyone's skins!&nbsp;<br><br>-Peace ^_^<br><br><br>p.s: I'm planning to one of these "starters" every two or three days or so..

I chose this skin a while ago when I was playing a lot of tekkit. I figured I'd need a futuristic/spacey skin so I found this one (not sure where?), and I've used it ever since! It's really detailed and I like it.

With the exception of a Zombie Pigman, I create my own skins.<br>This skin is purely random and doesn't represent anything.<br>I had another skin that I made based on me IRL but it's currently on my old broken computer and I have yet to retrieve it.

My current skin is my first I have made and last skin I will make. I have made a couple of edits here and there though.<br><br>It doesn't really look like me, but I believe it mirrors my personality rather closely.

My skin is something.... I make all my skins myself but I generally keep the same body/arms/legs and edit the face. Currently I'm designing a face that will end up being perm.

I got my skin from Evocal, as I'm really bad at making skins. xD I&nbsp;found this one skin online that I loved, so I asked Evocal to make it even better by adding more detail and so on. Nothing much on the skin that I can describe other than the fact that I have blonde hair and brown eyes IRL. :P

I currently have a Slenderman skin, after using an enderman one for a while. The reason I chose it was because someone told me that I seemed to disappear every time I hid and they looked for me, and that I seemed to teleport somewhere else and kill them unexpectedly. I thought those were pretty much the characteristics of both Slender and the enderman, which was why I stuck with it for so long. I also like the solid colors a lot.

Well, goes back a long way, when I first started Minecraft. About 2 years ago I used to play on a server, where the Admin had the skin of a One Eyed guy in a suit...my username was also very similar to the Admins name....so I use the same skin....anyways I began to like the eye, but not the suit, so I made my own skin, with a different body, and a better looking....and I've kept it ever since....(I dont like hcanging my skin often, I feel like this skin is now my mc identity :D)
