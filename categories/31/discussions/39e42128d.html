so i was enjoying a match of nebula whilst recording and some noob comes along and starts to grief me i say ' stop please ' he doesnt i say ' STOP PLEASE ' he does'nt i say ' STOP OR I WILL REPORT ' he doesnt stop i reported him and a mod didnt come so i reported him again &nbsp;because he griefed me and i was really sad because i spent alot of time on the house and he just recked it so yea. then a staff member came and he was blabbering about and saying STOP IT MRME and he gave me a warning and then the noob/griefer didnt get kicked or not even a warning. so if a Mod or SR Mod or better the Directors could talk to [removed] it would be greatly apriciated. &nbsp;<br><br>p.s. i think some of the new [removed] are getting a bit full of them selfs and are kicking ppl for ' fun '&nbsp;<br><br>Mrme2298

Firstly, if you want to complain, contact a manager or Director via Skype or support@avicus.net.<br><br>Secondly, please use proper English and grammar whilst writing "mature" topics regarding other players. It's very hard to understand and makes you seem less believable. Another thing that makes you seem less mature is the "xD" at the end. It makes it seem like a joke.&nbsp;<br><br>Asking other players to report is extremely annoying to other players and staff. I can see why the staff member warned you. It was within his right. And I will defend all of the jnr mods on this one. They're doing an excellent job and I will vouch for them all. None are getting "full of themselves".

He did only his job, I think you was reported by many players and the other player only by one, you. Then he came to warn you, that this is not good and you have to stop.<br>I don't see why he isn't good enough to be a Mod. Or a Mod+ have to talk with him.

Players who do not check themselves, they will not know. Would you like it if someone created a post about you? Just trying to limit the visibility, I guess.<br><br>Sorry if it sounded rude, but I can't think any other way to put it c:

Um, I warned you because you said multiple times in-game "Everyone /report (player) Team-Grief, Which I heard was against the rules. And I didn't punish the team-griefer, because I never saw him do anything, while you were spamming the phrase I mentioned above.

If you have an issue as to how this was handled, you can email support. Also, don't post this kind of stuff on the forums it's really not needed.
