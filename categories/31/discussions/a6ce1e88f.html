Making this because of transparency reasons and maybe the fact not all of this is known from you all.<br><br><b><img src="http://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/minecraft.gamepedia.com/7/72/Grid_Diamond.png?version=68731c762ced408f1b7a3f3991b4558f">&nbsp;Shop Discounts </b>First, we're starting off with some discount goodies. KyloCode himself said, quote, that he "Made it possible to have sales on the shop... Means Avicus will have a sale soon!". This brings some hope into giving chances for the ones who can't quite make a payment to the server to be able to receive some sweet perks, and for lesser the price. Also, there's speculation that the shop will be revamped, as in the revisions page there was not only possibility for sales on the site, but quote, "Better announcements and shop", "Make discounts red", "Fancy ribbon", and "Support shop products", all within a short timespan. Looking forward to the changes, it'll be great to have a long-awaited sale for the server!<br><br><b><img src="http://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/minecraft.gamepedia.com/a/aa/Grid_Map.png?version=dfc020c64dcd92b0bfa2d952d16d79bf">&nbsp;1.8 Overtaking other Versions</b> In data released, we have the new charts of player versions to see exactly what players play mostly on Avicus. Being the most notorious for "breaking pvp" by the Avicus community and not highly regarded by the Minecraft community in general, the players who use 1.8 have been documented to be within a precise range now of 55,000. For 1.7.2 to 1.7.5, the numbers are actually pretty differing. The number is 10,000, which is roughly 13% of the server's players. For 1.7.9 to 1.7.10, which most Avicus players seem to currently play on, it's at only 19% with 16,000 players documented. This makes 1.8 <b>67%</b> of the playerbase, even if it's discouraged. The statistics are changed from when we first tried to merge to 1.8, so it's interesting to see how the server has grown in that regard.<br><br><b><img src="http://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/minecraft.gamepedia.com/f/fb/Grid_Flint_and_Steel.png?version=71a3675f646b66e7cfd8402dbdabce7e"><img src="http://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/minecraft.gamepedia.com/d/d5/Grid_Iron_Sword.png?version=b1f0be5510d633b843d6dc979ffb64ea" title="Image: http://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/minecraft.gamepedia.com/d/d5/Grid_Iron_Sword.png?version=b1f0be5510d633b843d6dc979ffb64ea">2 New Gamemodes</b> Two new server gamemodes may make their way to Avicus -- and with that, a contest! Though not released, the next contest is going to be entitled Pluto and encase Capture the Flag, which is a capture the wool hybrid without picking a chest and with a different map layout, similar to that of an automated CTW, and a Free for All gamemode where you fight everyone in your way without alliances or teammates. For both of these, they've hurled their way up to the player favorites and will be further developed by the map developers and the developers themselves.<br><b>Pluto and Testing</b> Now with contests mentioned previously, we're wrapping up this contest and opening Pluto very soon. The maps in the contest pool now are going to be tested accordingly and scored by the judges, with best luck to the map authors and contributors.<br><br><b><img src="http://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/minecraft.gamepedia.com/e/ec/Grid_Book.png?version=c359675894d8a682e4e5391670aade99">&nbsp;docs.avicus.net Updates</b> In regards to website development as well, let's take a look on the docs site: There's been updates recently including documentation for Survival Games, bug fixes, documentation for capture the wool, cleaning up old gamemodes, and a few other edits that weren't included however it's open to see everything that changed for yourself.

There have been changes on Tab Completion, message enhancements, which now show the rank and team from which you PM someone, some cool color changes in chat, new staff commands and utilities such as report clicking, namehistory, and go enhancements, as well as new command aliases, global punishment messages, a new combat logging detector which sends automatic reports when caught, some trails changes, and particle changes. All of these have been within a very small span of time, and already have had a big impact on how Avicus runs. It's on a streak to be continued, so we'll absolutely see how things run from here on out, and for the better.<br><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); "><br><b><img src="http://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/minecraft.gamepedia.com/5/59/Grid_Boat.png?version=da07814013ed71301ef07fc43e17886d">&nbsp;Recent Map Acceptances&nbsp;</b></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); ">There have been some maps submitted to the server this week through our new program Trello, and the two maps accepted are Maisosen by ParaSpider and FlyHacks and Sketch Vapor by dilpickel.

The mapdevs discussed Sky Wars and seem to be interested in bringing it back, and Polar made a hacky way. We'll probably have Sky Wars returning, and as well as that for advertising the seniors probably know that it's something around they have to do, and it'll be done eventually. I'd prefer for it to be first over all, however.
