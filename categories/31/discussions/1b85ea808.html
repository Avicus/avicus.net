Alright, so the problem that now exist is that in 1vs1, I am rubbish, I can't do it properly. All that I am asking is that, tell me how I can improve! Please tell me how! I know that I have to practice but please, list the techniques down below!

You are a very good jitter clicker. BUT<br>-Lower your fov to normal or at least 80-100. Trust me. I used to use QP until i switched to 80 and it helps so much. Some can do better on QP but again, this is just my advice.&nbsp;<br>Other than that, you have to develop your own style. Practice practice practice.

I find that doing full circles out of all strafing gets you hit the most, so basicly trying mix up your directions to confuse the enemy. I'm pretty bad at PvP, though I haven't done PvP like this for as long as other people.

The thing with me is that, I just go head on, I like charge at them, like a bull! And even if I was on 3 hearts and the other person had 9 hearts, I would just try and kill him!

I should add that the best way to improve at sword PvP is Pot PvP on kohi (I won't give the IP) and the best way to improve at bow PvP is the Archer ladder on Badlion (Not giving IP) or public games of OCN and Avicus.

I've just started strafing "good" and I think its a good strategy. Strafe a little then if u both get low health start to block hit.

Show me the chat logs. If continuously abusive is asking if you "Can speak English" after you make a string of illiterate statements, yeah I must be the equivalent of Hitler.

I'm going to lock this topic to prevent further argument and to stop this flame war. Please do not start more flame wars on the forums since this is not a good way to represent Avicus. Please talk to me about it or take it somewhere else as this is not the place to have it.<br><br>Thank you<br><br>tel
