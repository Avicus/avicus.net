How much do Emerald donors have to pay to donate for Diamond? I'm talking about the Emerald's who get to keep their rank forever.

I'm guessing you would need to buy another emerald and get it combined for diamond unless you want to fully pay for diamond. But don't quote me 100% on it :)

I found this out last night but apparently Avicus doesn't offer upgrades anymore for ranks. If you want diamond you will have to buy diamond for the full $50<br><br>EDIT: directly from the shop page<br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/NpNDKb9.jpg" title="Image: http://i.imgur.com/NpNDKb9.jpg">

It's $50, and you can mix the ranks together from what I'm being told off the shop

Mixing ranks? Isn't that a bit op? Gold+emerald+diamond=1.5x*2x*2.5x= 7.5x= omg thats a bit op in terms of credit boost o.O or even if it didn't multiply the added ranks: 1.5+2+2.5=5x. Op from what I can see... P2W?

The ranks have different durations, upgrading wouldn't make much sense. For those who have a permanent rank, you can have both Emerald and Diamond by purchasing Diamond. The multiplier isn't doubled or anything. Shows your support with multiple ranks.
