<div>A non-common first name.&nbsp; People with this first name are associated with having these traits: having creative ability, imagination along practical lines,&nbsp; and very observant over little details.&nbsp; These people are attracted to technical, scientific, and mechanical fields but often do not pursue this interest as it takes time that they do not wish to use.&nbsp; You have a pure heart, good humor, charismatic, and make friends with fun people.&nbsp; You are charitable, but also are not afraid to spend lavishly on yourself.&nbsp; You often can suffer health problems due to eating unhealthily with the lavish lifestyle.&nbsp; You are often very energetic.&nbsp; Source: <a href="https://www.kabalarians.com/Male/avicus.htm">https://www.kabalarians.com/Male/avicus.htm</a></div>

I don't think that your name has anything to do with your personality, but this is kind of interesting. :p

Meh, the numerous descriptions of my name that I've seen are pretty accurate, barring one or two things.

there's a few tricks to writing them to make them seem accurate to people. mostly it's all about making vague statements that can be applied to the majority of people, focusing on positive attributes, and covering all your bases by bringing up an attribute and saying that its opposite is also true (<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; ">You are charitable, but also are not afraid to spend lavishly on yourself.).</span><br>further reading<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnum_effect">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnum_effect</a>

NOPE. Name was supposed to be "Atticus" for some reason. Keenan was deciding between Atticus and Avicus, leaning more towards Atticus. I talked to him and tried to convince him to go with Aviucs (better sounding name). I don't know where he got those two from, but those were what he was deciding between. Eventually he just decided Avicus and stuck with it.<br>What Avicus was supposed to be - RPG Minecaft server based off of Skyrim. Project was given up on and thus, we decided to use it as a revamp of MC Zone.

I was just reflecting on the word avicus itself, I didn't know why they chose the name.&nbsp; I did have speculation on the reasons they chose the word Avicus, but I had no idea of the reasons why. Thank you for telling me and answering that question.&nbsp; I just with this post hoped to discover my findings onto what the word itself might have meant as I was curious and wanted to share my findings.
