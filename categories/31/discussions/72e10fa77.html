Skype/TeamSpeak interview

After I submitted my staff application and I was replied with a "Review" tag, With my anxiety my first thought was "When will the interviews take place?". What I am really inquiring is, How are they going to let me know that an interview is going to take place? Are they going to reply on my application discussion? Or will they make a whole new post about when the interviews will take place?<br><br>If you could answer this question, many thanks to you :)<br><br>- MiningFlamingo

I think it happens when you get the approval of 3 senior staff members<br>I may be wrong so it is probably best to ask one of them yourself :)

I may be wrong but I remember a general thread being made for those who got accepted, that detailed the times that the interviews were going to take place?<br>Don't quote me on that though.<br><br>What I can tell you is that you will be contacted after you app is in review so look out for that and good luck mate!

Hey!<br><i>Congratulations on your application being reviewed!</i><br><br>I have not planned the exact date and time yet, however it is planned to be hosted a few weeks after the applications close. Applicants that are accepted for an interview will be added on Skype; and they will receive information regarding session times. There will also be a thread regarding the times, and who will be interviewed!

It's normally split into 3 - 5 blocks, each block can last about two hours. You are able to pick which block you are in depending on what time zone you are in and what fits you. I believe you are put into a skype group and then when it's time the title will change to something like "Book times now! [LINK]." Don't worry, I don't think that people have been invited to that chat yet, there should be a thread telling you to contact a Director about the interviews. I hope this helped, and good luck with the interviews!

I think there will be a thread after the apps close as Jozz said.<br>Interviews are done through Teamspeak primarily or Skype as an alternative.<br><br>Does this help?<br><br>EDIT: Just got ninja'd by the two mods ^<br>xD it'll be best to listen to them. Good luck dude!

Ouch! I hope my parents aren't home when we do the interview then xD, they allow me to talk 2 hours from time to time but they get really mad xD, do you know if it is possible to listen and type if none of the dates/times are good for us to be able to talk but we can be there? cause my problem kind of is that I can be on A LOT but when it comes to talking my parents are really strict about it :$

Skype and TS3 are voice calls/message calls. But most likely interviews would be in Voice calls.
