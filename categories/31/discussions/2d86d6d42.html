Well hello guys,<br><br>Recently today I was demoted from Moderator for inactivity. I had been moving from Arizona to Texas, and was living in a very big house with plenty to pack, this move took a long time and lots of work. Therefore I had been inactive for quite a while. However staff are supposed to fill out leave of absence forms when they become inactive, and I forgot to make one, but I did comment on a certain staff post saying I would be moving and would be inactive. However again, I did not know the move would take as much time as it did. I have had time in the last week or so, but just didn't have the energy to moderate, but in the last 2 days I have been on reports and back on Avicus. I guess I was too late.<br><br>I spent I think a little bit more than a year dreaming of becoming staff here, and trying my best to get the position of Moderator, and I guess that's gone. No hate to who demoted me, as they didn't do anything wrong, I just lacked communication. MAYBE one day I'll make another staff application, but maybe not. I have loved my time as Avicus staff and hate to go, but what happens, happens.<br><br>I may be inactive on Avicus as a player for awhile as well (not completely inactive but just less) as I have to work on other things regarding my network, I would be more active if I were still staff, since that was part of the struggle/fun of Avicus for me.<br><br>Now sadly I'll be going and you won't have to worry about receiving infractions from me anymore :P<br><br>Cya guys around...

Why is this a big deal, all you would have to do is contact one of the managers or directors. Also I don't think making a thread would help.

I'm not making a thread to try to get mod back, I made it just to let people know that I'm not staff anymore. I have talked to a director but to no avail.
