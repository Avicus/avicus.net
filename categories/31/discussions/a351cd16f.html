STOP THE BICKERING. You know where to send complaints, you know not to discuss this on the forums. Go ahead and complain how the staff are evil, because it may result in a punishment. Same applies to anything directed at other players.

I sent in a polite report with evidence and talked with staff about this behavior specifically and got nothing...&nbsp;<br>I'm just saying the staff selection is a bit weak- this is an example of a staff member who has recently been homophobic and rude, and slightly less recently thought it'd be jolly to cuss and swear at me on the forums when critical feedback was left on a map. Staff aren't evil, in fact you're an example of a staff member I like, but some of them are pretty rude/immature.
