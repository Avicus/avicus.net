<b></b>Well, if any of you guys didn't know, I run this small youtube channel called&nbsp;<b>BlackSniperPvP.&nbsp;</b>Basically I started when I was shiet at pretty much everything. Recently, I've got better after I figured out what the sprint key does (<i>after some confusion xP)</i>. Last week, I did his kinda cool montage with both nexus and nebula which went pretty well. What I'm asking is that, is you haven't already, to subscribe for the following reasons.&nbsp;<b><u>1.</u></b><u> When I wake up on a Saturday morning, I really can't be bother to do a vid for my 15 subscribers.&nbsp;<b>2.&nbsp;</b>It gives me more of an incentive to be epic at pvp!&nbsp;<b>3.&nbsp;</b>When we get to like 50 subs I'll do a giveaway!&nbsp;</u>Cheers guys<br>PEACE!!&nbsp;<b>&lt;3</b><u></u>

Don't beg for subs. What I did is too tell people too check out my videos if they enjoy they could sub not beg for them. And you can post your Avicus videos on the forums.

Try alternating in what games you play. And be patient, there are trillions of humans living on the planet (With all these countries... some ranging in billions themselves... the world population is most definitely not a&nbsp;<i>billion... pfft...)&nbsp;</i>Some way along the lines ppl will sub you.

Yeah well you're not exactly conveying the message you want. All this seems like is a post craving for subs. Don't beg for subs, EARN THEM. It'll be much more rewarding in the end. This is why I hate those musicians who spam "check out my channel" on famous music videos from youtube.

This exactly ^<br>@OP I don't even want to subscribe anymore now that I know that even though I would subscribe to you and be your 16th sub you wouldn't even be bothered to record anything because people wouldn't appresiate your content. If you want appresiation give us back some in change. Jut look at this kid, he appresiated 1 like that much that he actually made a video about it, and look at him now chilling at over 100k subs -&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vZcDjcaSHvc">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vZcDjcaSHvc</a>

Don't take this as hate, I only want to help.<br><br>Please, do not beg for subs. I know how it feels not having the motivation to make a video. I started posting videos when I was in 5th grade and I did purely for fun. It may have taken me 2 years (enough time for some people to have reached thousands of subs) but I am now at just under 100 subs. I am perfectly happy catering to my small but supportive fanbase. I make videos to show others what I can do, and because it is enjoyable. I never advertised or begged because I knew from the start it was a selfish and foolish thing to do. I suggest you take it easy and post at a leisurely pace. Post videos of Avicus and share it with us; I'm sure we will enjoy it. :)<br><br>P.S. Typing on a phone in a car is hard :P

You want subscribers to stay and look forward to your next video, a forced subscriber won't stay and look forward to anything if you beg him or her.&nbsp;Yes, that&nbsp;is the issue.
