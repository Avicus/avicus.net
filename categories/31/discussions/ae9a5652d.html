I want to start by saying that this should be kept serious and mature. I would like this thread to be somewhere where the community can give their input on who they feel would do well in a staff position. Just give your recommendations, don't bash on other people. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions. Seeing as their was a thread similar to this before Avicore was released, the presence of one shouldn't be a problem, assuming that everyone behaves like they should. So please do.&nbsp;<br>So, who do you think will be the next staff member?&nbsp;<br><br>A few guidelines:<br>Please do not suggest yourself<br>Please do not say rude or antagonistic things about others' posts: if you disagree with something, be mature and keep it to yourself<br>Please support your recommendations. A few words will do.&nbsp;<br><br>I'll start it off by saying that Merlinmaster is a pretty cool guy. He's calm, he's mature, and he knows how to handle himself. He'd be a great candidate for Junior, in my opinion.<br>Also, I can see&nbsp;jozzmcozz and NolanDalton doing very well as Senior Moderators. I think both of them have what it takes to take on the next level of responsibility.&nbsp;<br>That's just my list for now, I will of course update it as necessary.&nbsp;<br><br><br>

Adding onto this, barely anyone is supplying reason for their recommendations, and most of those that do cite "they're nice" as a reason. Moderators should be calm, mature, and able to conduct themselves. They should actively positively contribute to the network.&nbsp;

Yeah, he was having issues getting TS set up. Figured I'd spare him the trouble of trying to use an online tutorial. And thank you for your comment, I appreciate it.&nbsp;

By the way guys, it's not entirely about being "nice" or anything. It's usually just who should be the next mod because they'd be efficient at contributing to the server by dealing punishments, helping mod the forum, and just overall being a "moderator".

I agree with this but we aren't robots. I think being nice is a pretty large aspect of moderating because whilst acting this way players will be more comfortable to ask questions and just have a more enjoyable game.

M.... In my opinion, he (or she...) has to be very active, very good person and player, and do what he/she should= Moderate. Immaturity is a theme some.... complicated because tons of good people were rejected in interviews/apps for it.<br>In fact, no one of us can judge how that person will act as Avicus staff member, if fine, or bad.... &nbsp;IMO The master cookie lover&nbsp;<b>should</b> be the next Jr Mod/Mod (He already is staff member, he is Map Developer) because he never was, or is (I don't know right if he will be) immature, and he knows very well how to act as a Staff Member. #<i>HoopsForMod2015</i>

M.... In my opinion, he (or she...) has to be very active, very good person and player, and do what he/she should= Moderate.

Thanks Ivi! <br>Even though I may fit into the right quality of a Moderator,&nbsp;I'm a bit hesitant towards the fact of applying. <br><br>I think just Map Developer is enough for me. I'm not too sure that I have enough time to Moderate as well, with all the things that are going on in real life and such. I still might though :)

This is true. But it really drives me crazy how a few mods use to be fun and energetic people but they end up changing because of their ranks. I know they'll probably get demoted if they act all energetic again, but it still just bugs me &gt;.&lt;

I'm just going to touch up on something real quick here, nobody&nbsp;<b>deserves&nbsp;</b>to get mod. That's not how it works, even the most "deserving" people may not get to be a moderator if they don't fit standards. The application process rewards not the people that "deserve" moderator, but the people that have what it takes to be a mod. You can be an active nice member in the community, but if you can't write a great application or have the ability to speak in front of others, then you don't qualify to be a moderator. It's not about deserving, it's about earning.&nbsp;<br><br>(Sorry for the mini rant :P)

They don't make us look bad, they make the community look good. You can't accept a moderator to keep an eye on every aspect of the server for a variety of reasons. One is, staff can't always be on. In that case, as I said, help from community is appreciated. :)

I'm thinking of Tino, yeah, he might be cheeky in the forums but he's a great guy, I remember he did a great job as staff before. Also, pretty good guy overall.<br>ShadowSlayer/Stimulating might be a good choice too, good at detecting cheaters and contributes a lot in the forums, also pretty good guy overall and it's good to spend time with him sometimes as well.

I don't think it usually is a big factor? There's been staff banned for hacking and teamgrief (some many times) and still got mod, even if it was true. Usually if it ages it a bit it's fine.

I don't think it usually is a big factor? There's been staff banned for hacking and teamgrief (some many times) and still got mod, even if it was true. Usually if it ages it a bit it's fine.

Thats what i thought. I got banned for team killing, like a year ago, and my only infraction since i got appealed is swEaring. Plus ive matured Alot. I didnt think it wpuld matter, if some, not.

+1<br>Same with promoting people with more than 3 infractions.<br>With the first infraction, fair enough you may not know the rules but if you get another, there is no excuse and you are choosing to disobey the rules you already know and yet the reward these people with sometimes up to 9 infractions be promoting them to mod.<br>A while ago, I really wanted mod so I used to obey every single rule in the book and report people online as much as possible but really, I could have been banned for forcefield and appealed saying I wont do it again and make it to mod.

This is why I really don't like this thread. People wish they could have their name on this thread, and then when they don't see their name, they feel down. And when one comment is off, it can cause a whole ruckus to start. I discourage these type of threads because I know some people who wish that their name was mentioned, but isn't. Now I'm not saying this for my sake, because I probably not going to apply because of personal reasons I have shared with a few select others, but please keep the comments nice and respectful towards others by not putting others down.

Honestly, I feel that anyone can be a mod, just that he/she needs to follow the rules, set a good example to other players and have good leadership qualities. Doesn't matter how old you are, or where you live or whatsoever, as long as you can live up to moderator requirements.&nbsp;<br><br>One thing that is bad about the players (not all of them) is that when people try to help others, they accuse them of Staff Impersonation and insult them.

Those people shouldn't be perceived as rude then, there is a fine line between being assertive and being rude. Regardless, I think there are certain traits that should be encouraged for staff member hopefuls and that isn't necessarily one of them.

Those people shouldn't be perceived as rude then, there is a fine line between being assertive and being rude. Regardless, I think there are certain traits that should be encouraged for staff member hopefuls and that isn't necessarily one of them.

Apologies, I misworded myself.&nbsp;<br>However, I disagree.

This is why I really don't like this thread. People wish they could have their name on this thread, and then when they don't see their name, they feel down.

To be fair, the staff do value the&nbsp;<i>quality</i> of a player's character and ability to communicate and moderate, potentially evinced through their application, over the&nbsp;<i>quantity</i> of hours they're able to come online — a copious amount of sloppy work is, ultimately, sloppy nonetheless. Therefore, yes, you would be correct in saying that the staff are less concerned with activity... however, that doesn't entail "bias". I'm sure others can see your "immaturity" (or, for the sake of a more accurate term, "naivete") in your posts as well; this is probably what warranted the staff's denial of your application, which is not biased in any way.

First of all, I would like to congratulate those who have been accepted for review. However, I hope everyone keeps this in mind, even if your name is not said here you are still going to have the same chance at getting Jr. Mod, as opposed to someone who gets mentioned 100 times. Personally, when I got promoted 0 people "vouched" for me, and guess what. It did bring me down, however; I let my lack of inclusion within this post propel me farther then I ever would have, had I been suggested 20 times. Let your underdog like characteristics send you rocketing into the interviews! Overall, what I'm trying too say is don't take this post personally, if you aren't on it don't sweat it!

That's incorrect. I haven't scratched the surface of this server in almost half a year and I can tell you that's wrong. If they wanted active staff members they would select solely regular players who come on more often than others (basically pick your favorite from top 15). Now most of those in or near the top 15 have been staff. The argument towards this was that they were "more active" and it wasn't biased. As much as that is true, their success wasn't based off of how much they played the game and never was. They likely had good applications for the time and were promoted because they were entrusted with the ability to run the server. Now getting denied for... mod tryharding? Seems a little silly from my perspective. I don't understand how you can't tryhard for mod.&nbsp;<br><br>Oh oh yes and to my original point, staff are going to be flooding the server after promotions. Basically there will be too many staff online and they will simply hog each other's reports. So your problem will essentially be nullified by the time of the promotions.&nbsp;<br><br>@MasterPro If I can make a small suggestion, try not to be as verbose as that. I know it sounds odd, but there are some people on this server that can't comprehend your level of literature. If they can't read it then it basically defeats the purpose of writing out the post. If it's habitual then I don't care, don't listen to me, I'm just some guy on the internet<br><br>Just back for this one post.

I suppose there's irony in that I purposely went out of my way to simplify that reply before posting it, which I usually don't spend time doing... nonetheless, I see no point in doing so all the time, since what I post generally isn't that insightful anyway. I get what you mean, but unless I was given a significant job, such as relaying an announcement to the entire community (in which case I'd do so in a manner such that every person who reads it can understand), there's no crucial need to speak conversationally — I never seem to get acknowledged anyway, regardless of the circumstances.<br><br>Also, I deliberately make my posts hard to comprehend sometimes; you can say almost anything you want on the forums, as long as you say it the right way... but, I digress. I'd love to see <a href="https://avicus.net/Hacktivism" rel="nofollow" title="Link: https://avicus.net/Hacktivism">Hacktivism</a> as a staff member again, but, in light of recent events, I don't think that's going to happen anytime soon.

This isn't the correct thread to get feedback on a map. I suggest you private message Arigenn and ask him or patiently wait for an official answer on your map submission. Other then that, try not to advertise your map too much and stay on topic please.
