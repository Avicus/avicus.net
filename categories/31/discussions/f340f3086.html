So, sometimes I see my friends, they will fall out of the world without getting hit ect, but they log out whilst in void, so jump out of world, then they log out.<br>Is this considered a combat log? &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; -Thanks

I think that it is, because if you die, it will affect your KD, and it's called "Void Logging" which is basically the same thing as "Combat Logging", so yes, it is against the rules.

Yes it is combat logging. Cuz when i die you got a death, but you can't see who kill you on the profile..<br><br>Correct me if I'm wrong

Well they haven't been in combat so it's not combat logging

No, if they don't get hit out.

But if you fall of the edge, you get an (invisible) death.

I'm pretty sure this is known as "Void logging" and can be punishable&nbsp;

I'm fine with it as long as they were not hit/shot off.

Not everyone thinks like that...<br><br>As for the OP, I personally would count that as Void Logging, thus making it illegal, since "falling out of the world" affects your KD. Since the person logged, they do not get that death, thus their KD stays the same as before.<br><br>tl;dr, it should be illegal, and I don't see why it would be legal.

Yeah, I agree. I don't think anyone should get worried about it.&nbsp;

Combat logging? No; but; what they did was wrong and illegal.<br>it's amazing what people get to do for the KD, and that should be penalized.<br>

As rule B. 8. States...<br><br>Combat logging is strictly not permitted.<b>&nbsp;This involves logging off&nbsp;</b>or leaving your team&nbsp;<b>in anticipation of dying.<br><br></b>So no, this is not allowed.<br><br><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/JXVLg.jpg"><br>

But if you jump out, and it says 'title screen or re spawn' and you click title screen is it reportable?

No, because they have already died, so the death has already been accounted for.
