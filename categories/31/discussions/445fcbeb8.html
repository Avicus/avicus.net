As the thread's title states, I'm all ears for any constructive criticism the community can give us.<br><br>Think of this as a forums alternative for people who don't want to use the community Slack, but still want their opinions and suggestions heard.<br><br>Ill be forwarding these up to higher staff, so post away.<br><br>Rules:<br><br>Dont be rude.<br><br>Do not point out flaws and not give a way to improve after.<br><br>Please, no flame wars.<br><br>Good luck, and I hope his will help.

Pretty sure out of all the feedback spreadsheets, documents, and polls, the staff are aware of what to fix. Most of it lies with the devs or seniors, so there is a delay.<br><br>We can pick out feedback from the other thread. Shouldn't be too difficult.

I have these two posts that a Map Dev should have at least replied to, no reply. I personally haven't had any issues with any Map Devs in the past, but I have heard of some people complaining because walls maps/complaints/ideas are not being tested, or even looked at. A lot of people stopped playing walls because of different reasons, and they have said this before, in-game and on the forums, yet no one does anything about walls. From what I can see, walls is the second biggest game mode on Avicus, and even though a lot of people prefer Nebula, there are people that like walls as well. Completely ignoring this game mode will only work until people get bored of Nebula and have no where to go, so they just leave. I understand that Nebula is more popular and has more maps that need to be tested. But completely ignoring a game mode that could be a lot better if you paid attention to it, that's not going to help this server at all. -- All I ask for this one,is just pay attention to more game modes then&nbsp;<b>only</b> Nebula.&nbsp;<br><br>Lag- I know this can only be fixed in certain ways, and it is very hard to fix, but it is very annoying. Para had mentioned before that the server needs to be full 1.8 before the lag can be fixed. And right now the server is still 1.7/1.8, and only allowing 1.8 players to join. Just update the server, I don't know how hard this is, but I'm pretty sure it will be worth it.<br><br>These are two posts that I have already given my opinion on, and seem to have just gotten completely ignored.If&nbsp;you could show this to a Map Dev, that would be great. And preferably someone who will actually do something. :) (<a href="https://avicus.net/forums/3023ab9da" title="Link: https://avicus.net/forums/3023ab9da">https://avicus.net/forums/3023ab9da</a>) (<a href="https://avicus.net/forums/954e6d247" title="Link: https://avicus.net/forums/954e6d247">https://avicus.net/forums/954e6d247</a>)

Patience is indeed a virtue that the community needs to have.&nbsp;<br>I understand that it takes time to achieve these goals, and know the limitations that come along with them.<br><br>But if the staff really are working on all these issues, then updating the community of their progress would settle some of the tension the community has. It will also give players an understanding on where the staff team are at.

I had no part in the making of this thread, I assume it is FrozenSolstice wanting little suggestions and such from the community.

Correct, I made this thread on my own accord.<br><br>I'd like to keep this thread clean so I can easily see suggestions. Snow, if you want to rant, go to Budah's post, or contact Ari privately.

The Moderator team should already be well aware of all the community suggestions and what needs improvement.<br>I don't see why another thread needs to be made when suggestions and criticism that have been made in the past are still being worked on.

I might have a few ideas, but I don't want to say them to the Avicus community just yet (if it ends up being smiled upon, though, I'll definitely make a forum post about it). FrozenSolstice, my Skype is cynergy14 if you want to talk about it with me. If it's OK with you, I'd rather not discuss my suggestion(s) in public. Yet.

Kylo isn't active enough to notice problems with the admins considering he has college and developing to worry about.

I don't really care about the staff anymore considering I just get on here to play the tournaments and else but I'd still like to see tons of maps being removed due to not only their aethestics but their gameplay as well. A large amount of maps that have been put in the rotations suck ass (Ex: Bermuda, Sector Six, etc) since they're most likely easy to be rushed by anyone who has an idea on how to hide and make quick moves. Also, I'm aware of the spawnkilling troubles you've had with some of the maps that have been added recently and if you're so concerned about it then why include them in the league (Which was apparently well planned..)?<br><br>You can't expect a tourney to be good while the maps are a complete garbage, just look at the spawn that TDM map has (Can't remember it's name), you can literally get inside it and kill everyone in there or just shoot at the cobwebs while the players are trying to get out.

The only complaints he would be getting is about admins... And we only have 2. Not hard at all. Any other complaints towards lower staff he would probably pass it down to an admin/sr staff depending on the situation.

Experienced staff like you deserve a promotion over retired members. They left for a while, and WORK ETHIC DOES CHANGE, so it'll be like promoting a new junior moderator to sr mod! Someone who commits to their mod work, deserves a promotion.

Well earlier you wanted Kylo involved in demotions which I don't disagree with but I believe he shouldn't have the power to completely over rule the Senior staff. Though I see where you are coming from but I believe there is no point to continuing this argument.

Well earlier you wanted Kylo involved in demotions which I don't disagree with but I believe he shouldn't have the power to completely over rule the Senior staff. Though I see where you are coming from but I believe there is no point to continuing this argument.

I did say that, but I <b>didn't </b>outline that he should be the SOLE decider. Also I don't think this is an argument - but rather a discussion about leadership :)

Because all they see on the forums are arguments - so it's more of an assumption :)<br>ok &lt;/end&gt;

Have they actually developed anything? I was banned for a month and the only thing I can see that's different is bolded chat when you die or get a kill .-.<br><br>staff team, mods are mostly good seniors are fucked admins eh<br><br>and the block lag has been slightly less for me

The dev are actively working every day to improve the server. Just because stuff isn't happening on the revisions page, that doesn't mean stuff isn't happening. Trust me, some special stuff is happening behind the scenes.

I never said you weren't working hard...I know you guys are. I'm just saying I think it was a bit slow when it was only Kylo and Javi. Now that you were promoted and pave is back, I believe we're on a great track.

I was just making a general statement since there have been similar complaints of a similar nature. Just quoted you because you mentioned it. =)

They have developed a few things (crates and related things). The Developer team seem to be more active now and are probably working hard to develop new things to benefit the server and so the players enjoy it. Rather than people saying things like "Has anything been developed", people need to respect them more because people can't do what they do, so they should just appreciate what they do and wait patiently because they can't do better.<br>I do think too that Kylo should be part of demotions/promotions and be the core part of the senior staff team but he has other things to do and needs to have a life too.
