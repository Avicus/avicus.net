Recently we have had some leadership changes within the Senior Staff Team, so&nbsp;we thought that now is the most appropriate time to make a community update and inform you all of what has happened and what is to come.<br><br><b><u>Retirements<br></u></b><u></u><b>Pelpelajax</b> retired from <u>Moderator</u> &amp; <u>Translator</u>.<br><u></u><b>PieZ</b> retired from&nbsp;<u>Moderato</u><u>r</u>.<br><b>Rinn</b> stepped down from <u>Administrator</u>.<br><b>Palaemon</b> stepped down from&nbsp;<u>Manager</u>.<br><b><u><br></u></b><b><u>Promotions<br></u></b><u></u><b>Posighdun</b> was promoted to <u>Administrator.</u><br><b>Eteh</b> was promoted to <u>Junior Moderator.</u><br><b>Kyoal</b> was promoted to <u>Junior Moderator</u>.<br><b>CrazyCreeper_521</b> was promoted to&nbsp;<u>Moderator</u>.<br><b>Palaemon</b>&nbsp;was promoted to&nbsp;<u>Senior Moderator</u>.<br><b>Fouled</b> was reassigned to&nbsp;<u>Senior Moderator</u>.<br><b><u><br></u><u>Regarding the manager rank<br></u><u></u></b><u></u>After discussing it with Ethan we have decided to remove the Manager Rank for various reasons. It won't be returning, the decision is final. We will be tweaking the Senior Moderators roles in the near future to make up for this removal.<br><br><b><u>Regarding Staff Applications<br></u></b>Staff Applications closed on the 1st of May but we are still dealing with some applications here and there. Please be patient, we hope to have all the responses out ASAP.&nbsp;<br><br><b>What to except in the future (this month)<br></b>- Updating the rules.<br>- Some gameplay changes :^)<br>- Possibly a tournament.&nbsp;<br>- Small changes to the policies.<br>- The staff system/structure being redone, to make work more effective.<br>- Other minor stuff.<br><br>As always, the Administrative Team is open to feedback and to opinions on a wide range of issues. Whilst we cannot incorporate every idea and opinion you have, we can take it onboard when we make decisions. We need your support to fix Avicus. If anyone has any queries or concerns please hit me up on Community Slack.<br><br>The Administrative Team is very excited for what is to come of Avicus and what the future holds. We hope you all are too :P<br><br>Regards,<br><br>The Administrative Team (Peter, Ethan &amp; Keenan)<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><u><br></u>

I would say "neato" but I really don't like seeing:<br>&gt; <i>Change in staff structure/system<br><br></i>Seen it 1000 times, and when has it actually been effective? If it is, it's usually reverted soon after.&nbsp;<i><br></i>

I want to change the staff structure so that we can make stronger decisions and stop reverting things. It's quite obvious that the current structure is not working.

I forgot to add, Ethan made himself official because he wanted too. He threatened us managers because we voiced our opinions. He also worked completely by himself not even asking his fellow Admin for help. In fact this sessp fellow was more involved in administrative work then the managers and admins combined. To which I say, "sucking up." Also, don't forget everyone sessp is the same person who got himself ddosed for a few weeks,for being a nosey Tom. Finally, your Admin sessp has such terrible grammar I cringed. Twice.

Not agreeing with anything else you said, only the part where he made himself official. I remember seeing that promotion in a thread, and when I PM'd him about it he said something like "we wish not to speak about it right now" or "we'all say later"<br><br>Cant say j agree with anything else, though mainly because I didn't see any of it happen.

Sorry, if you hadn't commented I wasn't gunna join in but that official nonsense is a lie. I was involved with the decision for who stayed on the official team and who got promoted along with the managers. You then took the decisions we all made and decided to go about your own decisions which initially resulted in robo's demotion. It was only due to the pressing of myself and several of my associates that you gave him his position back. The official demotions/promotions were something handled on an administrative level with feedback from me until you took these actions upon yourself.<br><br>The manager argument more valid but not entirely, but ofc Idk about what goes on between yall Sr. staff. ;)

I admitted to that first part, but I am pointing out that the official team reverted my decisions, and then made a re-vote to promote the people that currently are on the team.

The revote was held on prompt of you, in order for it to be an official made decision the officials would have taken the initiative of forming the vote. Had you wanted to use official policy you would have retired from the position and let them take initiative. This was you using your administrative powers to your benefit. Until that point you hadn't even broached the subject of you or jozz becoming official.

To clarify for people I will recount my experience in this situation that I find relevant.<br>First, I had a meeting with Peachy and Ethan in which I requested the demotion of all officials. They made a statement which was "Show me proof the community wants this". I then collected statements from over 60 avicus regulars and for the majority tournament competitors who stated that they wanted all officials demoted and for interviews to be given to new prospects as well as the old officials; this list included 4 officials. Ethan then contacted me and we held another meeting in which he asked me who should be demoted, because we both agreed there were some good officials. <br>The two of us and michael then decided on a good list of officials. The list was: Sli, Seth, Javi, Robo, Tazz, Jive, Michael. Michael was told he would be head official. The day of the officials' demotion came and as I watched them drop off the staff page I was suprised to see robo go. At this point I got in a call with robo and told him I would get him his position back. After talking to Ethan he did indeed grant robo his position back but also promoted both himself and Jozz to the position, which had never been discussed or agreed upon. Ethan also left people such as Vobaseball and Pelpel in the official slack which bred anti-Michael sentiments. Michael later told me he felt his reign as Head official would be ineffective due to these feelings and thought it would be better to retire as &nbsp;to allow the other officials to do their job unhindered.<br>Ethan later decided he wanted to work with the officials on a smoother level so he gave them the ability to vote him and the rest officials (both demoted and current) back in or out of position. These votes were run by ethan and in order for an official (many of which held other staff positions) to vote against him they would have to directly confront an administrator of a server and tell him they wanted him demoted, not to mention this same administrator had just demoted several of their fellow officials. These re-votes led to the return of GrapeSmoothie and Vobaseball along with justifying Ethan's position along with the positions of those who he promoted: Seth and Jozz. <br><br>"I know Ethan is Hitler'ing the server but I can't do anything about it" -Peachy when he was Admin
