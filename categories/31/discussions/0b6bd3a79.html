Alrighty, so I'll make this clean and simple then.&nbsp;<br><span><br>Goodbye and thankyou.&nbsp;<br><br>Working at the avicus network has been one hell of an experience in itself and has taught me many lessons about leading a team of people, managing a community of people from around the globe, but more importantly has taught me more about myself then most girls or guys would ever experience, at my age anyways.&nbsp;<br><br>I've decided not to give&nbsp;shout outs to people who&nbsp;particularly have influenced and changed me as a person as for one, there&nbsp;will likely be way&nbsp;too many, second, many will be left out, and third, as of late many of the relationships established since I worked as director of staff have since diminished.<br><br>Feel free to ask any questions below if you're into that sort of thing, I will be both very truthful and </span>unfeigned about each of my answers, something which definitely hasn't been shared among most of the current staff team. I also reach out to those new staff members who look for guidance or advice, I am more than welcome to accommodate.&nbsp;<br><br>So, er, yeah, its been great, but as likely said by some old guy hundreds of years ago, 'Good things always come to an end.'

Alright thanks for the elaboration! Essentially I took a break from minecraft. Where in which I realised, OH WAIT, I don't enjoy managing a network or playing this game. So I didn't return. Where in which the senior staff very professionally retired me as they were aware that I was not returning. Any other queries you wish for me to address?

As stated previously, I no longer wish to remain director of staff on the avicus network. I worked at avicus for pure enjoyment purposes. This incentive has slowly diminished since the summer (my winter months) to the point where I can no longer remain on board without being completely unmotivated. Sorry xP

Girl*&nbsp;<br><br><br>Good bye Howsie, you were a HUGE influence on Avicus and always will be. I am lost for words as this may be the biggest leave in Avicus history. Fare well in life and even though I didn't know you much, you seemed to be a great person. you were always here through the good and the bad times, managing the forums, keeping the chat clean and generally just making sure people were enjoying themselves. You will be so, so missed and always remember you have stamped your place into the Avicus "Hall of Fame". Good bye one more time and good luck in life &lt;3

Wow... Well Howsie, I just want to say a couple of things. Firstly, thank you for everything.

I couldn't think of a better person to take on the role which you did.&nbsp;<br><br>Secondly, good luck in life. I'm glad you've decided to move on from Avicus and I'm certain life will reward you greatly for that.

Is there still the video you and avigill made when there was the avicus 2.0 release plug dj? idk why but I want to keep it to remind me of one of the best directors ever on avicus. You have helped me soo much since I came to avicus. I would want to try to persue you not to leave but it is your choice and I respect that. But if you do still have it pls upload it to youtube or give it to me on skype &lt;3 Just so I don't forget you. Not because I will become a pedophile (which I wont, don't worry xD)

Is there still the video you and avigill made when there was the avicus 2.0 release plug dj? idk why but I want to keep it to remind me of one of the best directors ever on avicus. You have helped me soo much since I came to avicus. I would want to try to persue you not to leave but it is your choice and I respect that. But if you do still have it pls upload it to youtube or give it to me on skype &lt;3 Just so I don't forget you. Not because I will become a pedophile (which I wont, don't worry xD)

I have it privated on youtube. It was a one time thing on plug which I was very exclusively privated the moment it was aired.

Wow... Well Howsie, I just want to say a couple of things. Firstly, thank you for everything. For allowing me the chance to be Senior Mod, for being a great person to talk to, for your kind attitude... I couldn't think of a better person to take on the role which you did.&nbsp;<br><br>Secondly, good luck in life. I'm glad you've decided to move on from Avicus and I'm certain life will reward you greatly for that. Whatever you choose to end up doing in your life I believe in you and wish you all the very best of luck. When I return to Skype if ever you want someone to talk to, I would be more than happy to.<br><br>Adios friend &lt;3

You're saying wow...?! I took a minute to register that it was actually you. I litteraly can not believe you would post this for me. Its so good to see from you again man. Thank you, so, so very much for your kind words. I really hope I'll be able to chat with you in the future. Take Care &lt;3

Jake, out of all the moderators I've been able to interact with, you have likely been one of the kindest. Your great to talk to and I truly wish you luck in future endeavours. Thankyou &lt;3 Also, yeah maybe, I'll try and keep in touch. I've stopped using my main Skype account due to the number of people on it now so if you can find my personal one I'll add you xP

Thank you, Howsie. That means the world to me. Thank you for always being there, when I didn't have anyone else. You'll be missed. &lt;3

This may sound like a joke, but I've recently left as Admin on a smaller server than this, got bored of pvp, faction, skyblock etc. I retired and explored servers, found my place here. Staying. Take care my friend, one staff member to another :)
