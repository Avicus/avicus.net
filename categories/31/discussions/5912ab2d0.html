<br>So, some of you may have already noticed... I've pretty much quit avicus. I've never been a popular member of the community, and I wouldn't have ever been. After i didn't make my staff interview, things went pretty downhill from there. I didn't feel like a part of the server anymore. Less people said "hi" to me in the lobby (or responded), and I found it less enjoyable to play, just in general. I didn't enjoy myself. But anyways. I'm not going to reapply. School is coming up, and it's one of my most important years. I'm trying out for a specialized high school, and i need to study hard, etc.<br><br>Now, i'm not going to lie, I have made some pretty damn good friends from avicus. You guys know who you are. c:<br><b><br></b>In terms of gaming, i have pretty much moved on from minecraft pvp. It really isn't fun for me anymore. I've started playing a lot more games based more around tactics and strategy.<br>(If you want to add me on steam, my steam is&nbsp;Irex ツ)<br><br>If you haven't noticed already, i am a shitty, shitty writer. So it's pretty hard for me to get my point across clearly. but basically, Avicus just isn't fun for me anymore. If you want me to say more, contact me on skype.
