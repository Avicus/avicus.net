All I see is regular users thinking, "I'm the boss. Why don't I just go and pretend&nbsp;this&nbsp;server is mine! I think I'll just tell the staff everything they ought to do and say, "U bad!" at what they don't do." Srsly, guys, you can offer feedback, but now all you're starting is a flame war. Tell the Mods what you think they could do better, and let them decide. Whatever happens, there's a reason for.

Let yourself be complemented, don't say "i'm the best" &nbsp;and brag about yourself. If you are good, other people will tell you.

if this is directed to what i think it is, we never said we were "da baws" or anything like that, you didn't really need to make a forum post for this, and we did give feedback ._.

Yeah, I guess you didn't directly say that, but once you suggest something, you demand it be carried out, as if you had more authority than the MODs. You also don't give specific feedback, you just say, "The mods are doing rly bad." just you cant expect mods always to listen to you, and if you're gonna give feedback, be specific. And no not just about you, about many people.

Ok, point of this topic is so that your "feedback" is actually feedback. So try to listen.
