So after the nominations, and the voting, we have come down to one player who receives the title of "Player of the Week". The person who received the most votes was JozzMcozz, but he decided that since he's staff, he shouldn't be eligible, and decided that the win should be passed on to the person with next amount of votes. So,without further ado, our player of the week is...<br><h2>RCMP_Mountie!</h2><br>Here is his interview :D<br><br><i><b>What inspired your username?</b></i>&nbsp;Hiya! I’m Mountie! I wanted something to represent that I resided in Canada, so why not, I picked Canada’s national police force as my username, and “Mountie” denoting a member of the RCMP. There are the occasional times where someone ingame asks me “Mountie, do you live in Canada?” :P<br><b><i>What is your favorite Avicus mini-game?</i></b>&nbsp;When I first joined MCZone back in the day, I immediately got hooked on Nebula. I like mini-games that have an objective you have to do in order to win the game, so Nebula was perfect for me :)&nbsp;<br><b><i>Where are you from?</i></b>&nbsp;I already said it didn’t I? It’s the place where we live in igloos, chop trees for a living, and continuously say “eh” after every sentence.<br><b><i>How long have you been playing on Avicus?</i></b>&nbsp;From the first day I joined MCZone/Avicus, May 25th of 2013, I have been loving the community ever since.<br><b><i>Anything you would like to add?&nbsp;</i></b>Just wanted to keep it short and sweet here. I’ve mentioned this before, but here is one of my favorite quotes I always go by.&nbsp;<br>Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving.<br><span>Thanks for the support on “Player of the Week” guys &lt;333<br><br><i>Stay Tuned for next week's nomination Period :D</i></span>

Awesome, Mountie deserved it. I also hope he gets moderator too, since he'd be a great mod :D

Good thing Mountie deserved it. If it was someone stupid I would've torn my eyes out.
