Sigh... okay... my behavior has not been good lately. Pertaining in regards to the subject of MapDevs especially...<br><br>I was disrespectful and came off as coldhearted... I was rude and I often responded with "A lot of people on the MapDev don't deserve their ranks". True or not, I should've kept this opinion to myself.&nbsp;<br><br>Its just that after almost 2 years of work in Avicus&nbsp;<i>and&nbsp;</i>old.avicus I got weary and felt that my work was not being rewarded&nbsp;enough. After some time I got deep-rooted anger and frustration. And it eventually exploded into snarky comments and rebuttals.&nbsp;<br><br>Just know that this isn't who I truly am, I can be a kind and fair person. Its just that when I work <a href="https://avicus.net/forums?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;topic_id=43&amp;user_s=&amp;user_d=&amp;tag=&amp;author=Zintenka&amp;query=" rel="nofollow" title="Link: https://avicus.net/forums?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;topic_id=43&amp;user_s=&amp;user_d=&amp;tag=&amp;author=Zintenka&amp;query=">this</a> hard and I get nothing to show that my work is appreciated then I get angry.&nbsp;<br><br>I should've gone about this a different and more peaceful way. Contacted the head MapDev or something. Instead, I let it pile up inside my heart and bad things soon&nbsp;happened.&nbsp;<br><br>I just wanted to say I'm sorry&nbsp;to all the MapDevs. I really am :(<br><br>I apologized to most of them via skype, though I have to wait for em to respond...<br><br>The mods that were promoted: I might not know the reasons why you were promoted. I might not agree&nbsp;with the reason if i were to learn the reason. But the point is that I should've kept my opinion to myself, especially when it causes stuff like this.<br><br>But im really sorry and would like to apologize for my behavior. Hopefully we can put this in the past and move on

I understand the anger build up, if not let out it goes bad fast. And letting it out isn't always easy. Take a break from what makes you angry, I mean, wow, that's alot of maps. I don't particularly know you, but I did get a feel that you had a bad rep. Take a break, get a clean slate. Its alright, (Basically about to say what Frozen said so, yeah. What she said.)

Thanks guys :)<br><br>However, I don't plan on taking a break anytime soon, in fact I'm making a unique map right now that is based on one of my most favorite movies.<br><br>It is the movie that i based most of my maps around. :)\<br><br>James Cameron's Avatar :D

I personally believe TNT maps are a somewhat hard and complicated concept to introduce to Avicus so suddenly.<br>Perhaps you should try making a map that doesn't contain TNT for once? and see how that goes?<br>You know, trying to vary a bit and stuff. You're a really great terraformer so I'm sure that the result will be good!<br>And then you could slowly start working once again in TNT concepts and stuff, and very carefully!<br><br>Apologies accepted, also ;)

I made one map that didnt have much tnt, just 2 chests but they're hidden :) Its called EridaniCTW.&nbsp;<br><br>I'll take your advice and make more maps without TNT usage. However, I'm re-introducing villager<a class="bmhoncmu" href="#90178265" title="Click to Continue > by couponcheapchea"> trades<img src="https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"></a> since they can work on Avicus now :D
