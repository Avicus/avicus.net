Title says it all. Did you find Avicus through someone's Youtube? Stream? A website? A Friend? Many people have played the server, but never say how they found it. I found McZone by googling cool Minecraft servers and the first thing that caught my eyes was McZone which was actually the first server I ever joined and I enjoyed it a lot. Eventually after several months it became Avicus and like many others out there (didn't recognize that it was still McZone but was just an update) left because they didn't know about the update. That's why I wasn't here for 7 months and finally decided to play again and found out that Avicus was McZone *facepalm*<br><br><b>Sooooooooooooooooooooooooo.........&nbsp;</b>How did you find the server?

I don't even remember how.<br><br>Seriously, the earliest time I remember playing it was back in August when I was in China, and I was looking through the Minecraft servers I had and found this was in my list.<br><br>So I played it. And I had a damn good time.<br><br>So I played it again. And again.<br><br>But I still have no idea why it was originally in my list.

Some of you may be surprised by how old this makes me server-wise, but I came with Haribo98/ParaPenguin. &nbsp;I was a staff on his old server, and when he made nebula for this network, I came with him, along with Phoenix and Bumblebeetle. &nbsp;Of the four of us, I am the only one that remains. &nbsp;Through my connection to Haribo, I was a moderator before I even got on the server. &nbsp;It's interesting to think of how he brought here, where I stayed, while everyone else moved on.

I came here around April 2013 during mczone. I think I saw the server at the top 10 on a server list, and it was like "walls" so I joined. Played it for a while, then near the end of mczone (~1 month) I stopped playing, and came back to avicus later. Been playing ever since (except when I got banned on teamspeak and went rip for like 5 months)

Porky showed me. Was such a noob at PvP, and actually knowing how to play avicus. Took a week to actually figure out the objective of the game xd.<br><br>Happily it grew me into finding new friends that we have today, and old ones that are no longer here and to know how to properly PvP. Because before I was a person who would play on mineplex. And not to win easy games xD, I was the one who would be gg 10ed.<br>Not anymore ^_^

I heard about Avicus like a year ago, but I never actually joined the server. But how I first joined the server was through a few friends who had a team on Avicus that I already knew from another server. They invited me to play with them and that's how I first joined Avicus. \o/

April (awesome_apricot) and Me wanted to find a server for something. I don't remember what. So we went to minecraftservers and found MCZone. I stopped playing minecraft but then saw that April got Moderator. I was jealous due to that and that he had so many friends there so I came back and here I am today, known as a Regular, part of the Avicadian Family.

Back when I played singleplayer, my friend told me to play multiplayer with him, so I did. He showed me this server, but he said it was a server for "famous people" and I didnt believe him, but I played along because he seemed offended every time I told him I didnt believe him when he did this sort of thing (he also told me he was a famous youtuber with 500k subs) and afterwards he just stopped playing. I continued, and it was fun, but I sucked, until I joined some other server, which exploded (damn owner didnt pay!) and then I joined Avicus for good, joining the competitive PvP part of minecraft. I was bad back then, but I played anyways, and with time I became pretty good :D
