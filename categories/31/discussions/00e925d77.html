It says im level 24 on Nexus, but I cant use it. It says its for premium users only, but isn't Gold Premium? Im just really confused cuz I want the kit. Or do I need to upgrade to Emerald to use it?

Dang....I was gonna upgrade...but my dad say no. He said I just bought something a month ago. I think it was because he was watching tv and didn't want to get up.

Pyro isn't that good Imo. It's a wee-bit op in my opinion, but it's fairly easy to deal with considering that most people who go pyro run into a horde of 6 people and killed instantly. If you know how to use it's deadly though.

There was a glitch before in the beginning when nexus came out that non-emerald players could use it.

You do stone sword damage and light people on fire. On top of this, you have better than standard armor.&nbsp;<br><br>The he fire not olny makes it harder to aim, but it prevents you from running, making you vulnerable to combos and unable to escape. Did I mention that it's better tuna heavy?

Like I said it's a wee-bit op but most people do not know how to use it.&nbsp;<br>Also it's pretty much like kit snake except the afterburn can kill you and you have better armor.&nbsp;<br>Being a donator should give you in-game advantages, most emeralds would be angry if they nerfed it.<br>But I can see how some people would be angry with it.
