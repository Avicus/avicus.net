<h1>Guide to making friends 101</h1>Welcome to the community. If you are taking time to read this guide, May I suggest you check out this information for beginners!<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://avicus.net/forums/c3723efec">Beginners Guide to Avicus</a><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://avicus.net/rules">Avicus Rules</a><br><br><h2>Tip One:</h2>Under the Navigation, The category "Introduce Yourself" will come under Community. Making a thread here will greatly help people recognize that you're here to join the Avicus family, There are so many ways you could introduce yourself, Usually a Simple thread called "Hi I'm ______! [AMA]" will help people get to know you much better.<br><br><h2>Tip Two:</h2>After you've introduced yourself you should get active. Under "Recent Discussions" are the most recent categories of our forums, I recommend starting to get involved more with what happens in Avicus. Giving feedback and sharing your input is a great way for the community to see who you really are.<br><br><h2>Tip Three:</h2>After you've been playing for awhile, It's time to speak up. Literally :). You should check out our Teamspeak, [IP-&nbsp;<i>ts.avicus.net]&nbsp;</i>Lots of our community communicate through teamspeak, The channels are all labelled with general guidelines, e.g [Cursing Forbidden, Cursing Allowed and 18+] and we also have special channels for Spanish and Greek Users. The community are usually around, so Join a channel and say Hi! For guidelines on Teamspeak click <a rel="nofollow" href="http://avicus.net/forums/20b8f59f7">here</a><br><br><h2>Tip Four:</h2>One of the best ways to get friends is apply for a team. The teams are all put under the Category "Teams" They don't show up on Recent Discussions! To start off, Teams aren't all Scrim or Tourney, There is most likely to be a team that applies to you. Replying with the teams given application format will notify them. The Team will make their decision, Don't worry if you don't get accepted first try, Getting better and re-applying is the right way to go!<br><br><h2>Tip Five:</h2>So by now, you should be very close with the community, So its time to think about more ways on getting in-touch, Skype is an awesome way to keep in touch with everyone. If you're in a team, you're probably already on Skype :), Some people have their Skype on their Profile page, If they don't, Ask them in-game or on Teamspeak! Skype is a way you could get really good ties with the community, Its also a good place to ask Staff members questions and stuff like that.<br><br><h2>Other Tips!<br><br></h2><ul><li>Just say Hi in-game, Be friendly :) [Suggested by <a rel="nofollow" href="http://avicus.net/SenorSombrero">SenorSombrero</a>]</li></ul><br>Those are all my tips for now! I hope these will help you join our wonderful community!

I like how you organized this together, Jolteon! One other thing to advise, if it is not already on here, (I did not read this.. too lazy ._.) One way to make friends, is just to say hi to someone in chat. I never really used skype, really until now, but say hi to someone, or everyone, in gameplay chat, and start a conversation. Seriously guys, iv'e had some pretty funny convos on gameplay chat xD...
