Hey, I'm on my iphone right now. Yesterday I made a post called "Woah..." I accidentally put it on the "avicus lounge" category. Just now, I went on my phone to go check on it and it wasn't here. Is it just my mobile phone, did somebody archive it or what? If somebody archived it please tell me why.<br><br><br><br>Cheers! :D<br>26763

It was probably archieved because it was spammy/a flame war started. Most likely it was spammy like this topic.

From what I can see, the thread was not archived.<br>It's probably a glitch; as it's happened before...

This isn't spammy, its just merely asking a question ._.<br><br>and you probably don't even know what my topic was about.
