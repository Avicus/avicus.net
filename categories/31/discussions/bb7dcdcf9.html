I've been thinking lately about how long I've been here and some of my favourite times at Avicus, &nbsp;but then a question popped into my head that actually got me thinking for a while:<br>How did i even find Avicus?<br>After some thinking, as i joined a while ago, I remembered in the summer holidays last year (December) I was going through all the populated SG/HG servers, and found - at the time - McZone.<br><br>BUT, i also thought this question may be interesting to ask in the forums, so:<br>How did YOU find out about Avicus?

Ok. I found Avicus when i was in Overcast. When tension from Avicus and Overcast arose, i was curious. I began even to be more curious when Overcst and Avicus about having war, tourneies, etc.. So i asked Turtles what was Avicus. I decided to check it out for myself. I thought it was a pretty good server so i decided to play. I mean, i still like Overcast better IMO (no h8 pwease just my opinion) but Avicus is like a second home and is my second favorite server almost close to OCN because of its similarity to Project Ares and IT was less intense and more relaxed and i enjoyed it! Avicus is actually one of the only servers i usually play on.<br><br><br>Nowadays, i cannot really play Avicus cuz for some odd reason, my internet is slower on Avicus so im waiting to get a new router!

Almost 11 months ago, I was on this small survival server that evolved into a mini game server, with games like skywars and CTW. I really enjoyed Skywars, and searched for more servers, which led me to finding the skywars.co IP. But when I joined, it was already Avicus, not McZone.

I was just derpin around this public library where some people hanged out just to play minecraft of the computers. My friend introduced me to this random server called MCZone. He pressed the "games" tag, and I was pretty excited when I saw those gamemodes that I honestly never saw before. (Whao he dunt kno wallz und skiwarz whata nub) Unfortunately, the library banned minecraft since there was a one a huge group of gangstas yellin around breakin blox, and only cracked was available. Once I got home, I tried out each of the game modes. Skywars didn't have much people, I played walls and it was a meh, maybe play later. Ghost squad was interesting, Nebula for me was laggy, and I had no idea what to do. I didn't know where anything was, so I made a nubby skybride and sniped people making iron (hue). Nexus was the best. I loved how I had good armour, a good sword, a bow, and some other stuff. It was great. (Especially arc) I guess I might have deleted it from my server list. Much much later, I looked up MCZone and whoosh, what the hell is an Avicus? The end.

Ok. I found Avicus when i was in Overcast. When tension from Avicus and Overcast arose, i was curious. I began even to be more curious when Overcst and Avicus about having war, tourneies, etc.. So i asked Turtles what was Avicus. I decided to check it out for myself. I thought it was a pretty good server so i decided to play. I mean, i still like Overcast better IMO (no h8 pwease just my opinion) but Avicus is like a second home and is my second favorite server almost close to OCN because of its similarity to Project Ares and IT was less intense and more relaxed and i enjoyed it! Avicus is actually one of the only servers i usually play on.<br><br><br>Nowadays, i cannot really play Avicus cuz for some odd reason, my internet is slower on Avicus so im waiting to get a new router!

</div>
hahaha i can relate recently, i have been hearing more and more about this Avicus/Overcast controversy and inquiry, so I've been checking out OCN, which i seriously dislike in comparison to Avicus :D

I was just derpin around this public library where some people hanged out just to play minecraft of the computers. My friend introduced me to this random server called MCZone. He pressed the "games" tag, and I was pretty excited when I saw those gamemodes that I honestly never saw before. (Whao he dunt kno wallz und skiwarz whata nub) Unfortunately, the library banned minecraft since there was a one a huge group of gangstas yellin around breakin blox, and only cracked was available. Once I got home, I tried out each of the game modes. Skywars didn't have much people, I played walls and it was a meh, maybe play later. Ghost squad was interesting, Nebula for me was laggy, and I had no idea what to do. I didn't know where anything was, so I made a nubby skybride and sniped people making iron (hue). Nexus was the best. I loved how I had good armour, a good sword, a bow, and some other stuff. It was great. (Especially arc) I guess I might have deleted it from my server list. Much much later, I looked up MCZone and whoosh, what the hell is an Avicus? The end.

Well, I remember being a totally noob coming from Minecraft PE. First week I had Minecraft I spent about 1 hour a day trying to figure everything out and messing with my controls (how I got used to using opposite controls) Me being a totally noob and not having any friends that played Minecraft decided to search for servers. Stumbled across Avicus and became obsessed with Skywars xD

Let's put a long story short: i was hooked on a gamemode called skywars, but on the server i played on there was so much lag it was unbearable, so i needed another skywars server. The first thing that came on youtube about skywars was JJtCool's video on skywars on McZone. That's pretty much how i got here.<br><br>Before skywars however, i was also hooked on a gamemode called capture the flag on one of Zek's servers and i played that for quite some time. That's where my pvp journey started. After getting a bit bored on that i was introduced to skywars and that's where it began.

One day, I guess I added Avicus (in that day it was MCZONE), to my servers list.. and I never really checked it out. Later that year, I was scrolling through my server lists and clicked Avicus, thinking it was just another one of those lame pvp servers. But guess what? It was nothing like that. I still remember my first map I ever played on: Luar. Avicus is now my favorite server, I'm glad to call it my favorite place to play MC.
