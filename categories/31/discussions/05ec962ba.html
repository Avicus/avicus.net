Hey everyone!<br><br>Recently in game, I have seen lots of people ask why they got denied on their staff application for lack of community interaction. So here is a guide to stronger community interaction!&nbsp;<br><br>1. <b>Be active on the forums!</b> This means asking questions on AMA, or making an ask me anything post yourself. This is a good way to interact with the community.&nbsp;<br><br>2. <b>Join a competitive team.</b> If you are into pvp, or just want to see what the competitive scene is like, post a LFT and try your best to join a competitive team. A good portion of the Avicus community is involved in the competitive scene so this is a good way to get to know people. This will also help grow the Avicus competitive, which is needed at the moment.&nbsp;<br><br>3. <b>Be friendly in game, and say hello to the fellow Avicus players!</b> Many of us are very approachable, (we don't bite!) please start a conversation!<br><br>4. <b>Join the Avicus TS. </b>&nbsp;The ts channel is ts.avicus.net, and I suggest you talk to people as much as possible. You will find Avicus regulars just having a friendly conversation while playing Avicus, so this is a perfect place to make new connections!<br><br>5. <b>Follow the Avicus rules, and be friendly to others!&nbsp;</b>Being friendly toward others will help you make connections and friends. Follow the Avicus rules, and try to be as supportive of others as possible.&nbsp;<br><br><br>I really hope this helped, if you have any other questions please ask bellow. One reminder though, please don't ask questions that can start flame wars, and please don't complain if your staff app was denied.&nbsp;<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>Koja

please note some people may prefer to have arguments instead of all that "friendliness" stuff

Yes I did think about that... From my experience, however, arguing only leads to breaking the rules of Avicus, so I decided to leave out "fighting" as a way to make friends and connect with the community.
