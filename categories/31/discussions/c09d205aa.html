<p class="MsoNormal">Hi everyone,</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">After about 15 months as a staff member it's time for me to
leave. There are a number of reasons behind this, however I'll make it quick. I
essentially have very limited time for these things now, and my motivation to
administrate the staff team has gone down. For these two reasons plus a few
other factors, I have decided to permanently retire.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I’ve been a member of Avicus for a very long time now, and I’m
sure many people will agree that there’s something special about this
community. The amount of awesome people I’ve met through this experience it
ridiculous, and I’ve certainly learnt a lot from being a player all the way through
to admin. I’m not really interested in writing out a huge list of all the
people who have helped me along the way, but I do want to mention a few:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">A huge thanks to Howsie for introducing me to the staff team
earlier last year. Not sure if you still check the forums but you were a great
guy to be around, so thank you! I’ve also known Jozz since 2013 and it’s pretty
amazing how we ended up being admins together. Just wanna say a huge thanks to
you, and I’m sure we’ll keep in touch! The final person is Kylo. This man is
extremely talented with what he does and is just a great guy in general. Best
of luck with this ongoing project Kylo!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">There were dozens upon dozens of others who came to mind,
however I would rather say a general thanks to everyone who I’ve met during my
time here; whether it be in-game, on TS3 or on the forums. I’m sure you know
who you are, and this includes all the former and staff members. Focus on the
positives and keep up the great work!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">If you need to privately contact me about anything you can
do so through the Skype account listed on my profile. After a while I won’t be
checking it anymore. Any questions you may have for me can be posted below and
hopefully I’ll get around to answering them. So once again, just want to say a
huge thank you and good bye to everyone here. It’s been a pleasure!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">NOTE: Jozz will be retiring too as he mentioned in his “3
year AMA” thread. Information regarding the new admins will be released soon,
and when that’s finalised our ranks will be transferred over.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Regards,</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Liam</p>
