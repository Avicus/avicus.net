^^^^<br>That idea needs to be implemented otherwise someone can take all the other iron of a team and leave the game and the team is basically screwed for the whole game. Happened today on Rendezvous. I'm not going to name and shame but I recorded them and am reporting them.

I think its a good idea but the amount of people leaving and items will be quite a lot, this can also result in lagging the server :/

Why would&nbsp;you mine&nbsp;all the iron? I don't even have words to describe it, it's just stupid. No offence if someone feels insulted, but, it is stupid, if you do it, you clearly need to acknowledge your stupidity. When I played, this always happened, a teamplayer mines&nbsp;every iron block&nbsp;(nebula) and jumps into void or runs without armor to the enemy and dies with everything. He/she would then say "I was helping out the team and making armor", I just facepalm, so hard it left a bruise on my face, honestly. xD ._.

It's not directed to you my friend, I agree with you and I'm talking to those who actually do this and I know there's players active on the forums who actually do this.

i guess its a form of "trolling" even though they're just ruining what time we actually have to play nowadays... i agree, it really is pretty stupid :/

This seems like a good idea, but it also seems kinda hard how it would work. If a player left the game with the resources, where would the resources go for example?

If the person takes all the iron on his team than that would/should count as team grief so I +1 the idea on that basis.&nbsp;<br><br>I often would steal the enemy team's iron though as a tactic and to my knowledge that's okay since it's a tactic that affects the enemy and not your team.

I know that but thats not the point. I only used that situation in the OP cause it happened to me like 5 mins before writing this. It could be useful in other situations like if a teammate has defense materials and he has to go etc.
