I will be arranging applications for those who would like to contribute in hosting for my UHC matches during AU &amp; EU times.&nbsp;<i>(US Players are not needed, sorry!)</i><br><br><u>Application Format:<br></u><b>AU or EU?:<br></b><b>Why would you like to host?:<br>Any Experience?:<br><br></b><u>Application Process<br></u><b>Step 1 (Applications): Your main point is the&nbsp;<u><i>WHY</i></u></b>.&nbsp;<b>I will be looking at that the most, so good luck :D<br><br>Step 2 (Testing): Once you have passed applications, I will give you a rundown on commands and how to set up a match. Once I feel I have showed you a sufficient amount of times, you will be tested on doing this by yourself. I cant help you all the time you know.<br><br></b><i>(I will be basing you off of past experiences too. Mainly maturity level)</i><b><br></b><b></b>

EU (GMT)<br><br>I would love to help out with your UHC and seeing as all of your current UHC's are as Killerbye said around 2AM for me also. I have not been able to attend any of your UHC's however i have attented others. I have never had experience hosting one although i think i pretty much get the basics of how to.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;If by hosting you mean hosting the actual server then no i would not be able to help you as my PC is not good enough to host a server but if by hosting you mean organising, starting and running a UHC then i would by all means love to help if the server that the UHC would be carried out on was already set up. &nbsp;<br><br>P.S: Even if you don't think i am fit for hosting the UHC then i could still help out with the general organisation if you would like. I guess like a co-host.

AU / NZ<br><br><b>Why would you like to host?:&nbsp;</b>I have participated in several of your UHC games I found them quite entertaining. I would like to contribute in managing the games and sharing any ideas that could potentially help the server run better and more effectively.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><br>Any Experience?:&nbsp;</b>I am (obviously,) a Moderator for Avicus which gives me a leadership / moderating experience. I have also ran multiple servers using the panel and setting up plugins and advertising the server.
