Just thought of this. Hopefully there's not another post like this.&nbsp;<br><br>But anyways, what was the scariest moment of your life (anything allowed that is appropriate).&nbsp;<br><br>I couldn't think of one but maybe I'll add it later.<br><br>Now... Begin!

omg, this is really hard to believe, but one of the freakiest, creepiest moments of my life was when i was in the sixth grade, and it was summer. 2 of my friends came to sleep over at my house, and we decided to sleep outside on the trampoline, to make the sleepover funner and unique.<br>Anyway, being like 12 or something, we wanted to stay up all night and have a great time, etc. So we tried. We horsed around for a while, we had a charged up laptop, lollies, phones, etc. and it was all good until about 2AM-ish. By then, we were beginning to get real tired, and it was fairly cold for a summer night, because air was getting through the little tiny holes in the trampoline pad thingy, so we were just chatting and telling stories, etc. But we were literally in the middle of talking when a seriously loud, weird noise filled the air. Looking back, it was probably not that loud, but it seemed it because everything was silent at 2AM until then. So anyway, it was this loud building up whooshing noise, as is someone was saying "shhhh" but it was getting increasingly louder, and after about 3 seconds of hearing it, it made this weird electronically noise, as if something was blasting off, but it had this sort of laser-like tone to it. its hard to explain. So all three of us were DEAD silent and still and we watched toward the noise and saw a triangular aircraft hovering about as high as a plane above us. It was a lot wider then a plane and has three blue lights one each corner. I remember the whole scenario. The scary part was that it continued this weird hovering noise RIGHT ABOVE US. It could have been miles away, but it was moving along the sky directly above us. it rotated and moved forward at the same time too, so it was spinning and going forward away from us. We were staring, stiller then ice and we just watched it fly off. It was so weird. technically we witnessed a UFO in the middle of the night, and god knows what the hell was operating it. And if it somehow saw us move, then that would have been frightening as hell. Thats probably the freakiest thing ever to happen in my life. Yes its long, but oh well

The scariest thing that ever happened to me was a long story, for about 4 years!!! It all started out with a dream where my father was going to comeback from another country. For some reason, I didn't have my sis (yaazey) or my mom with me, just my brothers( Suli7 and SpankySpade). So we were alone in this store waiting for my father to come in a car. So immediatly I saw a black car parking in the nearest parking lot. I quickly jumped up and was happy. When I looked behind me my brothers were scared. They told me that that wasn't our father... he was a fake. I denied it, I was too much into the trance of happiness. My brothers literally became white as my (father) came out of the car. They walked back and went outside and locked the door. Thats right locked it without me. I didn't pay attention to my brothers... Thats when he came in the store. My so called father opened the door and started chasing me and ripping my clothes off. He was using his hands to rip off my skin, I can't really remember what happened next, honestly all I remember was me screaming and running away from that man. But I couldn't the freaking door was locked because of my brothers. So I was basically brutally murdered, barehanded.<br><br>I had this dream when I was seven.<br><br>And it has been effecting me ever since. It's so bad, it affects my emotions and decisions. I can't live right with that memory in my head.

I was playing football, we were playing the final of a big tournament and it went to penalties, I had to step up for the last penalty and if I would score we would win the tournament. I stepped up for the penalty, took a deep breath and shot, full power, straight at the top middle like I always do and I hit the crossbar, &nbsp;I was really scared when I saw my shot hitting the crossbar and then I realized that it had still gone in. Probably the scariest but also most amazing experience I've had with football :3 Wrote this on my phone so don't expect good spelling.

One night, I was sleeping (duh). I woke up to a really scratchy tickle on my face. I turned on my light to see what was there.<br><br>There was this GIANT centipede crawling in my face. It had a black body with yellow separators and legs, I FTFO because it was like 8 inches long and centipedes are poisonous. I had no idea WHY we had those monsters in our house, let alone my state.

I watched Avatar the Last Airbender when I was 4. I didn't get scared but I think my parents freaked out when I started to lift my chair over my head and try to throw it like they did in Avatar.

a very bad dream like this:<br>I was in a full white room like a void and as I awakened I saw these things with tweezers&nbsp;and they were gently taking out each and every one of my organs only to stuff them into these transparent long tubes and when they were done unexpectedly they start shaping the tubes into a very large maze and after the I wake up.

One night last year I was home alone, it was something like 10 or 11 pm I was just playing on my computer, it was pretty silent (like normal in my neighborhood,) then I see this guy just walking down the road, may not seem like a big deal but I thought he was going to come into my house and murder me... I was really timid back then.

If anyone here is a gymnast, you'll know what a gainer is. To those who don't, a gainer is a backflip in a forward motion. In other words, if you do a backflip in one position and either land a foot behind where you started or in the same spot, a gainer is a backflip but ending up landing in front of where you started, so a backflip moving forward. Anyways, I did a double gainer off a 35 ft bridge,and I honestly think the scary part was getting the nerve to do it.

I work in technical production at school and while I've become accommodated to it in recent years, it was always a very, I guess scary, but not really...<br>Like its just a ton of pressure to edit video live or get sound/lighting cues right on the mark. First year was terrifying xD Also, last year I did live video editing that was broadcasted straight onto a screen for 500+ people to see. Oh gawd that was scary as.
