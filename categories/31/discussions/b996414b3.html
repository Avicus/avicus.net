You can split two into three, if they contain enough information. or just make a conclusive paragraph

Ok.<br><br>I could help out with this. <br><br>Let's be honest though, who's going to write three detailed paragraphs about a bleeding social media position? <br><br>And as far as I did it I got little to no recognition.&nbsp;<br><br>The criteria is also a wtf to me.. For someone that regularly uses social media and has managed pages etc, spelling punctuation grammar are important but you're missing something here. Also why would the length of an app be criteria? Ehem, what is a "long application" or a "short" one.. Come on! Give a hint about word count or characters.&nbsp;<br><br>Another thing. Be more imaginative. Make the candidates write a tweet or two as examples - or make them tweet (within the characters) their application. Then they would think like you'd need them to.&nbsp;<br><br>"Application Process" - let's be honest here, it's a bit drawn out here...<br><br>Finally (1) please please please, before you state things on an official post about grammar etc, make sure grammar is correct!!11<br><br>Ok, I did say that you missed one thing, and that is:<br><br><b>A sense of humour!</b><br><br><b></b>Posts need to be funny! You need natural comics to promote a page via social media. Content creation is soooo hard and you need people that can do that.. Gaming related memes etc. Don't ask them to write three paragraphs about why they can be part of the team, make them create content to entertain you, then you'll see the real candidates. People on Facebook don't read articles, if that's what you're looking for. And Twitter's character limit won't allow it too.&nbsp;<br><br>So think about that. As I said i'm more than happy to help.
