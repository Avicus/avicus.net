Hello there everyone!<br>As I've been inactive for more than a month now,some of you new-comers won't recognise me (but welcome anyway :3) but I'm NesaFairy (yes I thought I was punny somehow for making that name… my name isn't even Vanessa..-.- *facepalm*). Anyway, onto the point of this post..<br><br>As my summer began, I had a realisation about all of the things I'd been missing "out there" (I know, I didn't think it existed either). A couple of weeks ago I managed to see an exhibition of my favourite artist in London and it made me think.. what is my purpose here on this tiny speck in the universe :3. I'm not sure if many of you guys know this either but art is a HUGE part of my life. I will be having my very first exhibition in a local gallery in my village (EEEEK) so I've really got to concentrate on painting. I hope one day that I can make people feel the sense of wonder which I felt seeing my favourite artist's paintings. Aside from this, ever since I applied to be a moderator on Avicus, I noticed how many wonderful people (shoutout to the new Jr.Mod's!) are dedicated to making this server a place of happiness and kindness, and it made me realise that I am not needed here anymore. This server has grown alongside me for a while now and I feel like I have reached a point where I am happy to say, "this is me, leaving". Keep in mind that not many people on other servers would feel this way. I am not happy because I now 'have a life', 'got away from online-bullies', 'have no more lag'.. no… I am happy leaving because I see that each day Avicus grows, filling with more and more beautiful people making the most out of their creativity and friendships, just like I did.<br><br>So thank you everybody for making my experience here on Avicus incredible. I feel inspired by the wonderful people, stories and creativity I have seen here on this server. Thank you for being such a huge part of my life &lt;3 If you want to keep in contact make sure to add me on Skype and tell me about your fantastic lives &lt;3<br><br>All my love (and cyber-hugz),<br>NesaFairy xx
