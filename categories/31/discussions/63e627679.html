I just realized that we haven't seen CherryLandMC in the rotations for a couple of months. It was one of my favorite maps, and I know there are others out there who agree with me, despite the occasional griefer/troll. Was there a reason it was removed? Could it possibly be brought back? Thanks.

I removed it because it was too hard on the staff. There were too many griefers and even if I lessen the TNT, it won't help much, as long as it's out there. Once I saw 2 pages in a row of teamgrief punishes on it, I had to call it quits.<br><br>If I finally get a proper anti-TNT grief filter like I was working on a while ago, I may be able to readd it.
