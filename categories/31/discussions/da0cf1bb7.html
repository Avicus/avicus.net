Hey guys, it's that time again! Time for the second discussion starter! Today's question for all you wonderful people out there is, If you could add a creative and fun minigame to Avicus, what would it be?&nbsp;It could be anything! It could be having a horse race (Avicus Derby) or it could be something such as zombie tag! Anything works! I hope this is a fun way to know about each others ideas! Think creatively, and have fun at the same time!!<br><br>-Peace, C_P&nbsp;<br><br>p.s: If any mods/staff members find this un relevant for the forums, please tell me, so that I know what to write in the future/know what should be on the forums! Thanks

Definitely&nbsp;a Creative server where we would all have one or more plots each. <br>The roads between them would be quite small so that it would promote that "community feel" to it.

Gladiator: &nbsp;<br><br>Players spawn in pits full of mobs and other players. They can earn points for 2 minutes. &nbsp;Killing a mob is 1 point, players are two points.&nbsp;<br><br>After 2 minutes the player with the least points is eliminated. If there is a tie all the bottom players are eliminated.&nbsp;<br><br>This repeats. It goes on untill there are 4 players left. They will be set in a death match in the pit with no mobs. If there is a tie getting to the 4 player death match , any lowest players are eliminated bringing it down to 3,2,1 players in the death match.

I agree SnowSX3, I love creative personally. Having a creative server on here would be a hit!

@tarheelkiwi, u have a point, hunger games is seriously addicting<br>@kycrafft, Why would creative be bad? It will give the map developers a peak at peoples building skills! I play more creative than survival on my single player honestly.<br>@SnowSX3, Dude what if we had something related to the hive's: draw something, instead u have to build it! Like build an igloo out of sponges!....guess what they are building xD

Quite a long time ago i actually thought of a mini game that i thought sounded basic, yet fun only i never really got to explain it, so i might as well now:<br><br>I think it would be cool if there was a game where you are on a rotation of mini maps, almost like large room-sized maps and you had a full inventory of Bottle O' Enchanting bottles, and when the game begins you have to run around and throw the bottle o's at each other.<br><br><b>Aspects of the game:<br></b><br><span><b>.

Your own bottles can NOT effect you<br>. basically you have to throw exp at&nbsp;each other and fill up their levels until&nbsp;they get to the required level to be eliminated.<br>.Last man&nbsp;standing wins.<br><br></b>I thought this idea could work so please tell me what you think :)<b><br></b></span>
