I'd like to think that the Avicus community is pretty mature, so why can swearing end up with an infraction?<br><br>Thanks.

Swearing itself isn't really punishable, it's how you use it.<br><br>Swearing excessively in the chat or towards another player is what is not allowed and punishable.

if you were mature, you wouldn't swear.&nbsp; you would put into account that there could be little kids in the game.&nbsp; just don't do it and you won't get in trouble.

You can still be mature and swear.<br>Swearing doesn't define someone's matureness.

Swearing does effect how mature you are. People who are mature have self control, which means they refrain themselves from swearing.&nbsp;<br><br>Action will be taken if your language is taken against a certain player, or if it's excessive.

If swearing disrupts the game play, or is offending someone, then its punishible.

Can agree.<br><br>I think as long as it's not toward someone(s), it's allowed.

The rule is:<br><br>Swearing is allowed, as long as it does not offend or hurt others.<br><br>Just because you swear doesn't mean you're immature; I guarantee a lot peoples parents swear here.

You can be very mature and swear, but to be mature you should know when swearing is a bad idea. There are always going to be people who do swear, not knowing when it's a bad idea <i>because</i> they aren't mature. <br>Also, saying words like "fu*k", "sh*t", "damn" and "hell" is completely different from saying words like "f*g", "b*tch", the "N" word and other words that have been used to be oppressive and/or offensive. Saying those words can hurt someone in real life and drive them to do very bad things, whereas saying "Fu*k! I died!" is not necessarily bad.

This is true.<br><br>Minecraft is a game of all ages, we can't just assume that all of the players in the game are fine with the language.
