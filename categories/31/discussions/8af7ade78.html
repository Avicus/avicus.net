They still have it, but they turned the snow into grass (most likely to reduce entity lag from snowballs) and reduced the diamond block count.

It basically got its snow replaced by grass and later removed

It wasnt a great map. It was really annoying when one team killfarmed, which was almost all the time, and it lagged a lot for people who didn't have good enough computers

You can find the map Zalidor at the Left Board on Nebula.

But its ruined, the grass makes it far more laggy, you are given full leather armour and there is barely any diamond. Everything fun and unique is gone.

Wrong: tall grass, flowers, mushroms and blocks of that kind do not lag players as much as snow layer blocks, translucent blocks (like ice) and leaf blocks do.<br>I don't really see what's the problem with full leather armor either, it's&nbsp;<b>completly</b> normal and having a single leather helmet is completly unfair against a full diamond guy (here the reason why some of the diamonds were removed, also).<br>We try to make it fair for BOTH teams, so both can have fun equally. A lot of players, I'll include myself, enjoyed camping around the opposite team's spawn on Zalidor when it had more diamonds, players only spawned with leather helmet and it was full of lag, but it was terrible (it brought a lot of complaints, and overall, it was just unfair.)<br>It's not my fault if you don't enjoy any maps now, since there are a lot of players that do enjoy them the way they are.<br>The point is: full diamond vs leather helmet + stone sword may be fun for you, but it pisses off others.
