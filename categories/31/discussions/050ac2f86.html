I don't know who did it, but whoever archived the threadthat was a discussion over the staff, you had no right to. That thread was needed as a community discussion. I know alot of people were bashing on staff, but I also saw some good discussion in there that should've stayed.please don't take this as hate or anything, I just want to know why this was archived.

It was a giant flamewar that was taken onto Skype and TS. If you were there and were involved, you can explain the rest. The forums just isn't the place to discuss that. If you really want to have a nice conversation, PM me on Skype. However, when it gets on the forums spam is created and the thread no longer serves a purpose.

Looks like you weren't here today. As I said, it&nbsp;<b>was taken onto Skype and TS.&nbsp;</b>The situation was acknowledged, but the way everyone (players&nbsp;<i>and&nbsp;</i>staff) were dealing with the situation was horrendous. People complain. We can't make everyone happy. The issue was discussed already, and the point of this thread was already cleared up by the original poster, so I don't really see why it needs to be dragged on. I'd prefer that players who weren't directly involved in any of it stay away, because it'll simply cause another wave of havoc that was created today.

Thy is valid. You say all threads will be locked equally if a flame-war is started.

There are certain extents that discussions can go to before they get out hand, and in this case, that was that situation that drew the discussion to a close. Watching&nbsp;people crumble under numerous conflicts and speculations that were being flung around like tennis balls whilst fending for our own individual dignities is exactly what a community doesn't need. Most of the decision is done for&nbsp;<i></i><i>everyone's&nbsp;</i>sake. Answers will be given - All that we ask of you guys is that you have the patience.

I understand your point, but we did Web Ban one of the players, and his/her friends started doing the same thing anyway. I'm not the person who normally gets involved, or archives the thread, but that thread was clearly going in the wrong direction. I find Skype and TS a lot better for this type of communication. The forums aren't where we should be arguing, at least in my opinion. I wouldn't have a problem if players who weren't aware or involved didn't pitch in on making the thread rotten. I mean, even Glitchy stated that the thread was an argument of "We are a community pls stop" and "The staff are shit." Those were pretty close to his exact words.

The things they were saying are the exact things they've been saying for as long as I can remember. As I said, I will honestly be happy if you messaged me on Skype to talk about issues, but it actually gives me a headache looking at people reiterating the same thing the last person said on the forums. A lot of the comments aren't/weren't suggestions, they were/are assumptions and accusations. If you message me with good reasoning, evidence, &nbsp;and suggestions, I'll do something about it. If you're just here to vent, don't comment.

But it was a valid discussion nonetheless, cos why else would you finish it in private?&nbsp;<br>I mean if you don't think the forums are the best place for this, you should start moderating more or try new things. These avicus forums was coded for players to talk and stuff and for a community as a whole to discuss. Skype ain't made for that purpose man, it was made for stuff like calling my relatives back in my homeland :3.<br>If you dont want any more discussion, at least give us a conclusion. Unarchive the thread but clean it up and lock it, and at the end post a summary of what you discussed, the key points, etc. Right now you're burning down the house to deal with termites, instead of quarantine and fumigation.<br>Pls fix!!!!!!<br>kthnx y'all

The things they were saying are the exact things they've been saying for as long as I can remember. As I said, I will honestly be happy if you messaged me on Skype to talk about issues, but it actually gives me a headache looking at people reiterating the same thing the last person said on the forums. A lot of the comments aren't/weren't suggestions, they were/are assumptions and accusations. If you message me with good reasoning, evidence, &nbsp;and suggestions, I'll do something about it. If you're just here to vent, don't comment.

OH my god that's my point right there. I'm not going to private message but this is the last I'm posting because its not getting through. "<span>The things they were saying are the exact things they've been saying for as long as I can remember". If its a problem and people have been saying it for so long then&nbsp;shouldn't&nbsp;you find a solution, and I'd rather talk on here about problem with the Avicus Community where the community can see it (:</span>

But it was a valid discussion nonetheless, cos why else would you finish it in private?&nbsp;<br>I mean if you don't think the forums are the best place for this, you should start moderating more or try new things. These avicus forums was coded for players to talk and stuff and for a community as a whole to discuss. Skype ain't made for that purpose man, it was made for stuff like calling my relatives back in my homeland :3.<br>If you dont want any more discussion, at least give us a conclusion. Unarchive the thread but clean it up and lock it, and at the end post a summary of what you discussed, the key points, etc. Right now you're burning down the house to deal with termites, instead of quarantine and fumigation.<br>Pls fix!!!!!!<br>kthnx y'all

This is from a random Australian who is bugged when registering and just posted:<br>When you have this much frustration, this much "want" to fix a huge problem in a community of course people are going to get annoyed at the service and are going to question it if it is not fixed. Take internet service if it is really bad you go to another service and in this case people will go to another server and this service will die slowly. This is avicus's biggest problem and if you don't think so look at your forums. You have countless threads starting to have arguments with players and it look like more are coming and that is the biggest problem. What ever you have to do, what ever you need to do, you must have a list or a pyramid of needs and so does this service, first need is to make sure the community is intact, and it doesn't look intact from what I can see. Now back to the main point. Admins, Sr Mods, Mods, what ever else you have on this dang server, these excuses that you do are weak and useless. You look lazy, inexperienced and it doesn't look like you know what to do. You are leaders of the server and leaders usually help solve problems. Instead of trying to make this a whole, "Staff need to fix everything" because you have proven you can't, let some of the mature community members help out so they can have a voice for the community. Next, get one of your butts off the chair and into something that can fix this problem. From what I have heard this problem has been going on for far too long. That is longer then what I want to see. You are seeing the cost of this problem getting out of hand and soon you will see it is too late. Fix it tomorrow, fix it the next day, fix it when ever, it will look better then what you are doing now.&nbsp;<br>~K_Cord<br>He has a bug with registrations right now and I will be posting for him. Anything you want to say to him reply to me and I will just copy and paste off of a google drive. I put full responsibility on my profile and if his words get me an infraction I am open to it.

I will be honest right now, this issue regarding the staff bias had <u>nothing</u> to do with the ddos, yet the staff thought they "solved" an issue by focusing on another issue.&nbsp;Am I the only one who thinks it's just plain stupid? Yes you had your talk on TS and "solved" the ddos issue, but what happened with the original post by Jozz regarding the staff? Did you even read it?&nbsp;Excuse my french but not a&nbsp;single fuck was given, as always. You never solved the staff issue, never&nbsp;the less tried to, why you archived the post and supposedly said it was solved, it's bs. I just think it's sad how this community is falling apart and your friends become you enemies.
