I'm considering posting this in general discussion, let me know what you guys think:<br><br><br>Hey guys, Nolan here.<br><br><br>This post can help you make a good player report that can get the player you are reporting punished.<br><br><b>Title and Body:<br></b>Make the title of the report [Name] [Rule being broken]<br><br>In the body, follow Funky's format:<br><b>Reported Player(s):&nbsp;</b>Exact username(s)<b><br></b><b>Rules Broken:</b>&nbsp;Be specific and accurate.<b><br></b><b>Evidence:</b><span>&nbsp;In&nbsp;the format of unedited and&nbsp;images or video (not cropped, straight from the game).<br></span><br><b>Hacking:<br></b><ul><li>Include the type of hack (Forcefield, Aimbot, Fly) that the player is using in the title/body.</li><li>Video is the suggested form of evidence for hacking, it is hard to tell if someone is hacking based off screenshots.</li><li>Make sure the name-tag of the player is included in the video.</li><li>For hacks such as fly and kill aura, I personally suggest recording while watching the player in spectator mode.</li></ul><br><b>Team Spleefing/Team Griefing</b><b>:<br></b><ul><li><b></b>One screenshot of the "has been spleefed by" death message is not enough evidence to punish.<br></li><li>Make sure the name of the player is captured in the video/screenshot.</li><li>Video is preferred for team spleefing, but multiple screenshots can work as well.</li><li>For Team Griefing, video evidence or multiple screenshots can work, make sure the name of the griefer is clear.</li><li>Team Griefing includes (but isn't limited to) blocking spawn, destroying in-use crafting tables, and destroying team-structures.</li></ul><br><b>Chat:</b><br>When reporting a player for chat-related punishments such as advertising, spamming, using language or using caps follow this:<br><ul><li>Make sure the name of the rule-breaker is clear.</li><li>Screenshots are preferred for chat-related punishments.</li><li>When reporting someone for advertising, make sure the IP points to another server besides Avicus, as Avicus has multiple IP addresses. (mc-hg.org, skywars.co, wallsmc.com)</li><li>Make sure the player is breaking the rules enough to be temp-banned, example:</li></ul>Language:<br>Player: *** you (Not Temp-bannable&nbsp;said multiple times)<br>Player: **** you you ****** ***** ***** **** (Tempbannable)<br><br>Caps:<br>Player: GUYS GO TO THE MONUMENT(Not Temp-bannable)<br>Player: GUYS GO TO THE MONUMENT (6 times) (Temp-bannable)<br><br>Spam:<br>Player: Hi guys, Avicus is awesome.&nbsp;(3 times) (Not Temp-bannable)<br>Player: Hi guys, Avicus is awesome.&nbsp;(10 times) (Temp-bannable.)<br><br><b></b><b></b><br>
