<b>At the moment I am gold and I was wondering if I got emerald would it only cost $25 because I have Gold and it would be a rank upgrade because I don't really want to buy my rank like two times please tell me because there Is a coupon on and I want to buy it as soon as I can before the coupon runs out&nbsp;.&nbsp;</b>

Yes. Upgrading from Gold to Emerald costs $25.<br>There also is currently a 20% discount which you can use to upgrade. This brings your cost down to $20 :D<br>

what he said ^ but rank upgrades are down right now, just buy another gold rank and then contact a manager or higher on skype and give them a picture of the receipt you got purchasing the second gold so they know they have to change it to emerald<br>&nbsp;<br>-IN SECOND NOTE - I am still waiting for my diamond upgrade<br><br>

Message one of the managers on skype, then when they reply, buy a second gold upgrade, and send them proof of the purchase and they will do it for you :)
