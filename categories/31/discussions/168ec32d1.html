alright, how many regulars have a rank on this server? How many people are willing to purchase a diamond rank?<br><br>Ranks on Avicus are simply way to expensive for a minecraft server. To put it blatantly. I believe that Avicus should either A) Decrease the price, or B) Have more sales/higher value sales. <br><br>Basic economics states that when the price is increased/ing demand decreases as consumers are less willing and able to purchase the good at a higher price. This is Avicus now. I don't know how many people purchased ranks this year, but I do know that many people aren't willing to purchase ranks as they are too expensive for their "proposed" value. The prices for ranks are significantly high. The players are less willing and able to purchase a rank. I think that if Avicus decreases the price, to a suitable price, then people will be willing to purchase one. Currently lifetime diamond rank costs $129.19 NZD for the following things:<br><ul style=" margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  "><li><strong>DIAMOND</strong>&nbsp;name prefix</li><li>Earn credits&nbsp;<strong>2.5</strong><strong>x</strong>&nbsp;faster!</li><li>Access to&nbsp;<strong>3</strong><strong>0</strong><strong>+ more items</strong>&nbsp;in the credit shop</li><li>Join the team of your choice using&nbsp;<strong>/join&nbsp;</strong>!</li><li>Join&nbsp;<strong>FULL</strong>&nbsp;matches!</li><li>Teleport to players on the network instantly with&nbsp;<strong>/go&nbsp;</strong>!</li><li>View username history with&nbsp;<strong>/namehistory</strong>!</li><li>View your kills, deaths and K/D history over time with&nbsp;<strong>/stats</strong>!</li></ul><div><span>Personally these "perks" are simply not great enough for a server in this condition. People wouldn't purchase diamond rank for the "join full teams" because Avicus never actually has the players for full teams.<br><br>This shows that these non tangible goods are simply too expensive. Demand is extremely low. By reducing the price for the ranks (and adding more perks - which ALM is doing), demand will increase as it becomes more and more appealing at a lower price. &nbsp;Cause currently almost all the regulars and a few staff don't even have a bought rank.<br><br><br>Next more sales. &nbsp;Avicus never has sales, but when they do it's still to expensive encourage purchases. Servers like (dear I say it) Hypixel constantly has sales almost every "holiday" or special occasion. But not just any sale where 10% gets reduced, but things like up to 50%. If Avicus were to add more sales, with an increased percentage off, it would encourage more purchases and value for other things on the store. Because these sales that happen don't really reduce the price to make it appealing for the average player.<br><br><br>Too sum it up, I think Avicus should reduce prices, or frequent sales, that bring the current rank prices down to an affordable price, to entice customers. Currently ALM is increasing the number of perks you get with a rank, but it still doesn't match the stats of the server to the price of a rank.<br><br>Tell me what you think and any feedback would be greatly appreciated. I wrote this on mobile so if there are any errors or things you do not understand please tell me.</span></div>

Yeah even small things like decreasing ranks 50% might be something that makes people want to come back to the server.

The price is quite high for a network like this (in terms of player count) and it isn't worth getting a rank just for the small perks you do get in return. It's only there if you really want to support the server but most of the people who wanted to do that, have already done it.<br><br>Not allowing upgrading of ranks is also not a good idea. If I would buy gold and enjoyed the server, I wouldn't want to spend twice as much money as I already have for a second rank but would much rather upgrade.

Also are gold, emerald, and diamond really that different to be $25 and $35 difference? (Gold $30, Emerald $55, Diamond $90) The only difference is really the credit boosters that aren’t used&nbsp;<b>a ton</b>.

I don’t understand why /nh is a donator perk.. with the amount of websites and mods there is to check it just seems like an useless perk.<br><br><br>Prices ARE too high for a server that doesn’t have much to offer.

This is a topic I don't believe I have ever talked about privately or openly unless you are a really close friend of mine.&nbsp;<br><br>One of the weakest points of the server is our donation rewards and I am not putting this lightly. The weakness is not responding to our server needs with appropriate ranks and other servers are beating us widely.&nbsp;<br><br>Our lowest perm rank is $30 USD while the second highest out of four ranks is the same price on Hypixel.&nbsp; Same with Stratus, their highest rank is the same price with our lowest rank. Competition wise we lose and this shouldn't happen as we have a big enough server to sustain ourselves. So what are the options?<br><br>I don't like my best options I have thought about but here they are, either lower the prices of each rank significantly or add ranks that are at a lower cost. Lowering the cost significantly to $10, $20, and $30 is an easy fix but think about those that already bought a rank. They would probably be pissed that something they bought for $90 is now $60 less. The second option is adding two new ranks. This would need to be added carefully and both of these ranks would be lower than Gold. If this happens a lot of new options for the existing ranks needs to come around. The problem with that is we need better options for Diamond and we need them quick. I have a few ideas but I believe my ideas don't go with some of the wants for Avicus.&nbsp;<br><br>Yeah, I really don't have a solution for this problem.

Hey,<br><br>I want to start off by saying that we hear you! Even if we don't reply to every thread, it is likely that we've read it and discussed it.<br><br>Now on to the matter at hand:<br><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>To my knowledge, these prices haven't been changed in quite a while and were set back when the player base was larger. It should come as no shock to you all that purchases have been slow as of late. We as a team are brainstorming ways to get this number up again while also making it more appealing for users to buy ranks in the future. These includes adding more donor perks and making older ones better/more exclusive.<br><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>We do not discuss specific finances here but to be frank there is a minimum price needed each month to keep the network running and in some previous months (not going to give specific numbers) we have been below that line. We actively try to have sales and giveaways to give people a taste of ranks but the bottom line is that prices cannot be too low because we have a bare minimum that must be reached for us to continue.<br><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I get the points made in the OP that market fluctuations are something that needs to be closely monitored by the team and changes need to be made to go along with this flow. As I said above, the prices for ranks haven't been changed in a while. This isn't good and has caused us to drift away from the supply/demand curve of our community and others like ours.<br><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I've looked around at a few servers' stores and have realized that our store has some of the highest prices out there. These definitely needs to change. The fear we face, as stated above, is that we do not hit that minimum. Now, as the OP said, lower prices means more purchases, which is true. We definitely need to look into price changes/sales for the future.<br><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The other big issue is perks. Due to the minecraft EULA, we cannot provide nearly as many perks as to what we used to. This limits our possibilities for perks immensely. I would like to ask all of you whom are reading this what you all think some good perks would be. In the past, many perks have been suggested and either implemented or denied for various reasons such as lack of developer power. We now have more devs than we have in a while so that means we can do some more things in wider areas. So, what perks would YOU like to see? Keep in mind that these cannot violate the EULA.<br><br>Oh, and here's a coupon code for 66% off of all lifetime ranks (It expires Nov. 1):&nbsp;<b>3M49-WNB4-ZAVD<br><br></b>Feedback is always appreciated and welcome.<b><br></b>

Hey thanks for your reply!<br><br>I like the way you are going with. Adding new ranks, but with lesser donation features, but for a much cheaper price, seems like the obvious way to go. It allows for more donation encouragement and bring more people to the store. However in doing so, the senior staff (if they haven't already, I don't know) need to implement the rank upgrade. This encourages people with (for example) with gold to donate more for diamond, with more valuable features.<br><br>You said that by reducing the prices, donators would become annoyed by the changes. But I think if you offer actually valuable perks in or out of game, that don't cost any extra monetary value, it could cool the steam.

Hey, nice "Sanctioned response!"<br><br>I noticed that the store advertised for diamond "30+ items in the in game store". A suggestion I would input, would be for donators getting a specific percentage off on the in game store.<br><br>For example all diamond rank would not only get 2.5 muliplier, but a 90% discount on the i game store. It should not violate the EULA, , nor should it cost the server more expenses.<br><br>Also please read what I wrote in Kord's response, it's pretty similar but I think it may be worth it.<br><br>Thanks agin, I appreciate the admin response

Yeah, I haven’t considered even once to buy a rank (except my free gold one because I bought it during the mczone period or something) due to the extremely high prices.&nbsp;<br><br>I still feel like there should be more perks for donators for me to buy the Emerald / Diamond rank.<br><br>I honestly can’t think of a perk that is allowed by EULA and is actually useful. Though I’d say a big reason why people buy ranks is for the aesthetics now. As in, since now it’s prohibited to sell game changing perks, the main purpose of ranks are for cool badges, pets and customisation. Though the only place you can use most of these are in the lobby and let’s be honest, the only thing you do in a lobby is afk and it’s rarely used for people to just ‘chill’.&nbsp;<br><br>My point is that I feel like you should be able to use your perks more as you’re playing or as a spectator rather than in the lobby.
