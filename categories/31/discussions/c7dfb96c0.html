Hello everyone,<br><br>I would like to say that it has been one week since Avicus released the Omega Update! I know a lot of people left Avicus due to it being on 1.8 but let's not talk about that. My question to you guys is: Do you like the update? (Let me know by replying and why you like it). Personally, I do. I like how the website and the server were both&nbsp;updated, they both look new and clean. I also like the new gamemodes in game, they are pretty fun.<br><br>o/ ,<br>nintendoboy11

We need more people to fill the games, I've see CTW is a bit lonely this days.<br>Also, as far as I know, the only one that has a badge is Tanpiku/Para, so we still have more things to see.

Honestly disappointed in CTW. Not at all the coding, it's perfect -- but the map developers were pressured upon perfecting the gamemode as much as we could, making advancements that DTM didn't have. We spent months behind doing CTW work, all for nobody to play it. Not one CTW server is used and the only time that someone may play is on Mix, which already consists of almost all DTM. The only time where I see people play is if a CTW map swings by on MCZone, but then again most people leave on Divines in the first place because it'll just be rushed.<br><br>I can't really find the problem why it was the most requesting thing on Avicus yet 4 days later it dies almost instantly.

Yeah, I see your point. It's just that we need more players and if Avicus had more players this server would be amazing. Avicus needs to advertise the server for more players.

I agree, it's a shame. I'm a huge fan of CTW but there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of interest unless I manage to start up a small game. Once there's a game going a few more players join here and there.

I love it so far , few minor glitches here and there but they will be fixed in time. As mentioned above i just wished we got players like in Mczone days so you could just play any gamemode whenever you feel like it instead of being limited.

This really disappoints me. No, not anything about the update; I love every part of it. What really, REALLY drives me crazy is the use of two hyphens (--) instead of an em dash (—). You should be ashamed. (Technically they are both correct, but for the love of god, don't use two hyphens).<br><br>But yes, the update is great. I would love to see more players online, and less players complaining about 1.8.

&lt;3 everything in the update. They issue is players for sure, like most other have said. I don't want this but if we don't get more people then more and more people will leave. After that the server dies. That would really suck. &lt;/3

<p>Oh, is it my time to finally share? k get ready. no hate, just constructive criticism. </p><p><br></p><p>The gamemodes are amazing, the lobby is amazing, the maps are decent, but then where it all goes to poop</p><p><br></p><p>you all say 1.8 is for the better and that "80% of our players were on it when we switched", well where are those 80% of players? seems we dropped 50% of them in the update, which was supposed to BRING MORE... All the issues people are reporting and complaining about have not been fixed, or have been given the excuse by some staff members "blame 1.8". if so, then how is 1.8 better? it dropped 50% of players, created "unfixable?" bugs and is now used as an excuse, yet still praised by how it will improve the server.</p><p><br></p><p>Block lag, invisible people, still not lapis on all maps with enchanting, 1.8 knockback/block hitting (yes block hitting is controvercial, but it seems to not work as well as it used to for me imo). </p><p><br></p><p>Lastly, my last comment would have to be lack of staff. We just lost a good chunk of staff, and recently not many of my reports have been taken care of, and by the time staff come, the player has left or gotten accused and stopped hacking. Then I hear they are delaying apps... brilliant idea to demote staff way before they can be replaced. thumbs up to whoever decided that. Also, the inactivity of some staff imo was questionable cause some have been very inactive, yet are keeping rank or even getting promoted. Seems a bit biased, but not my problem, just more reason to leave the server I guess</p><p><br></p><p>In all, decent update, just some decisions were rushed and seem to have caused drama and negativity. Don't use 1.8 as an excuse if it was supposed to help the server.</p><p><br></p><p>/endrant</p>

Agreed! I feel like most of them have gone to the Hive server and if you look at how many people are online it's unbelievable. I feel like most of the Avicus players have gone over there but that's my perspective.

Ok, so what it looks like to me is that everyone loves the new update but the problem is that we need more players to play the new gamemodes in the update. So, how will we fix this problem? <b>Advertise Avicus!</b>&nbsp;I know Avicus has a YouTube channel and it only has one video on it. I say the Sr. Mods and Admins should do a weekly or monthly show on that YouTube channel about Avicus news and what's going on on the server and when they get enough videos they will start showing up in people's recommended boxes and that will get us more players on the server so we can enjoy CTW and SG! That's my idea, what's yours?
