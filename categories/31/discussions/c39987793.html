1. Is there anyway to search for players on the forums?<br>2. Is there anyway to view leaderboards with comparison to other players like our old leaderboard system?

1. You can search players for their posts on the forums using the search bar on top<br>2. Nope, old leaderboards is dead, you can only view each gamemode, not all side by side,

1. Well if you go to recent discussions you can search for an authors name.<br><br>2. The leaderboards can be found <a href="https://avicus.net/games#DTM" rel="nofollow" title="Link: https://avicus.net/games#DTM">here</a>&nbsp;for DTM, and you can see it for other gamemodes if you click the tabs on the left, but they aren't like the old ones.
