I bought Emerald today with the Avicore discount and I hat to pay 40$, I am confused because I had gold and I wanted to upgrade to emerald. I thought I would have only had to pay 20 dollars. Please tell me if I am wrong.

I think what happened was...<br><br>You wanted to buy emerald, and since the upgrade feature didn't work, you though that if you just bought emerald, it would register that you are already gold, so it would only cost you $20. &nbsp;But, it did not register that, so you basically bought an emerald rank, on top of your gold rank, so you now have both. &nbsp;What you should have done is buy another gold rank, then ask a manager+ on Skype to combine them into Emerald. &nbsp;<br><br>So, in the end, you bought another emerald, thinking that it was just going to upgrade you into emerald, so you now have both an emerald rank, as well as a gold one.
