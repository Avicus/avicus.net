Now this is a thing that happens. People have pets and they take them for granted. Like lets say you have a dog and you don't like them or you don't hang out with them, because they annoy you.&nbsp;<br><br>I lost my cat about almost a week ago. The chances of her coming back are very slim. Now the morning the day she went missing, I told her to get out of my room, because she was being a bit annoying for standing in my way.<br><br>Now I regret ever being rude to her. Not knowing that day that might be the last day I might see her. And now I miss her so much. Remember this, lets say you were rude to your pet in the morning before lets say before school. How would you feel that you were treating your pet with disrespect and that you might not see them again... Just keep that in mind, that the last thing you do with them, was to rude to them. And that your pet would last remember you was you being rude to them and making them feel that they are loved.<br><br>Keep this mind
