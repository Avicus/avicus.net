</h1>
Although it feels like it could be too early to discuss it, I feel we should give our side as to what we want to see next tournament, and hopefully the officials make it happen.<br><br>In my belief, I feel it should be a TDM tournament, this being that I personally see some potential in a few TDM maps here for tourney with some tweaks. I also feel that teams would cause some upsets, and we could see underrated teams go high in brackets, which would be nice.<br>If next tournament would be a TDM, some scoreboxes should be implemented to better gameplay. Tournament should be played Round Robin style, having best of out ??? each matchup.<br><br>That's how I look at tourney 3, how about you guys?

Round Robin is a tournament style where each competitor plays against each and every other one. So seeding wont really have an effect until invitationals.<br><br>Problem with classic DTM is that it is way too stalemate to be played in a tournament. Now, I'm not talking about the maps, the gamemode in general is way to hard for it to be configured to play well in a tournament, might even be impossible.

Look at my first post regarding DTM. <br><br>Also, we should go through every mode as their individual tournament, then Tourney 4 could be this, without DTM tho, or some other mode could replace it. Also, I don't think we are prepared for this yet anyways, as organization is getting better, it isn't the best yet, so don't recommend this as of now.

Before any people who have created TDM maps take offence, I don't imply any. That being said...<br><br>The vast majority of the team-deathmatch maps on Avicus have terrible gameplay and having a tournament with the best 5 maps around would be a complete disaster.

It would be neat if it was best of 3, first round is DTM, second is CTW, and the 3rd would be the tiebreaker and final round, which would be TDM (if the score is 1-1)

Imo it's kind of hard to make a tdm tourney with such broken kb and so many client users. Some people take no kb, are a bird, deal no kb, deal tons and know how to abuse server mechanics and people who are mixes of several of these traits. It's kind of hard when you have people who deal insane knockback who can teach their team how to deal that much knockback. Let's just take me for example (cuz it's easy to use myself as an example). If I were to teach all of PPB how to get that much kb, it would be incredibly easy to just steamroll over any team, there would be no competition.

You can't really just create new plugins out of thin air and you can't expect ghost clienters to be dealt with....<br><br>So how would these issues be dealt with exactly?&nbsp;If you have a solution or an idea, I'm sure there would be some value in sharing (not trying to be rude or sarcastic).

There are usually several clienters per team, without knowing the players I can still judge that about 2, which is pretty generously low, players per team hack with 8 registered teams for a tourney. Under this assumption, that's at the very least, 16 client-users per tourney.&nbsp;And in terms of kb, when you get a guaranteed three hit combo and they die from fall damage anyways, it does matter really. When there's that much kb going against you it's nearly impossible to hit the person back unless they're using crazy short aura or triggerbot.

I don't wanna be rude* but walls is not gonna get anymore popular if people don't play it. If people tried it as a tournament, they would find the competitiveness in it and strive to win. It may just work. If we actually had a tournament, people would maybe change their minds on the game itself and may give it a go, thus walls may get more popular.

+1<br>Except probably make the TDM Bo3 too just because they're shorter and then have them be 15 min max each so the max is 45 like the other maps.

Well it is fair to say I have been working on a TDM map in secret, but I would love to see CTW, DTM and TDM altogether like Budah said.

If DTM and CTW got therre own tourney, I think a TDM tourney would be fun.

Also, lets use this tourney as an example. Cronus lost to bad company 0-2, meaning cronus were out of the tournament forever. There should be a deathmatch with the loosing teams so they're not just out of it in a click.
