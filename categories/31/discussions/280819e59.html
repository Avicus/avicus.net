I guess everyone has to move on &nbsp;I think when your friends leave you don't want to be left behind so you leave to, &nbsp;ex. &nbsp;The old moderators

Well, this is correct in a sense. One main reason most of the old gen. mods left was that we'd been mod for long periods of time. The only remaining staff (not sr staff) from there are Jake and Ben.

Yes you can only take so much of doing the same thing, &nbsp;I respect all the old Gen moderators

They're leaving for personal reasons. Some of them (might) have family issues, some just want to take advantage of their summer, some do not feel like they can moderate anymore, and more reasons.<br>If you really want to know, ask them on skype privately, because they may not want to share why they are leaving.

Personal reasons I guess. You can read my reasoning on my resignation post. Some got demoted for inactivity and other things.

my question is why are the new mods quitting/retiring... I get it, they have a lot of stress, or like tino, video uploading, but when you apply for mod be serious about it... &nbsp;I would be fine if they stay 3-4 months but its barely been a month that the new mods have come in and they are already leaving, therefore giving more stress on remaining staff and having kind of wasted the time of the people who looked at your application...<br><br>I am sorry if I have you feel I insulted anyone, its just an opinion where I have been wanting to lash out today, even if it is only 2 mods who left...

Are you kidding me -_-<br>Dude, I'm really sorry this happened to you..<br>This is a very unlucky string of events and overreaction.<br>I'm actually quite angry that you got demoted.. this is ridiculous.

So he wasn't going to be "demoted", he was simply warned for leaking a confidential chat.. This seems like it was all blown out of proportion. This video in my opinion just made MLG look bad and I'm glad he quit if he can't handle the responsibilities.<br>If he couldn't keep his mouth shut and not spread stuff from the staff chat then how can the staff trust him to ban people and deal with people? Without trust between staff members the system falls apart so I guess its for the best.

The Mods get older, they cannot stay on Minecraft forever so Howsie recruits some younger staff members that can continue in the steps of the old Mods.
