Hi. Im sure I am right in saying that nexus was a great gamemode and many loved it. This is a petition to bring it back. Help me and sign this (By commenting) and hopefully we can get it back!

Almost no one play there, so for now it is closed cause of server keeping high price.

Would you rather shut down unplayed servers in order to save money and make way for the new, long awaited ones arriving in the near future?&nbsp;<br><br>I certainly would despite Nexus and CTH being old favourites, it's time for change. Be excited!

As much as I would love to bring bring back Nexus, not going to happen. &nbsp;It was almost impossible to get another person to join. &nbsp;Sometimes I would wait ten minutes for someone to join. &nbsp;All we can hope now is the new game modes in Atlas are even better

@Tarheelkiwi. Well not really. Lately my bro and I encouraged more people to play and constantly there'd be like 10 on a sever

<br>This won't work mainly for the fact that we are wasting performance and room with these servers because no one really plays them :l. If I saw an improvement in people wanting Nexus back I would talk to Staff about it. I used to love Nexus.

no thanks had too many glitches and bugs and I doubt devs would want to work on it when they have atlas bringing in better updates and new things

Nexus was cool and all, but it wasn't played at all. It also has glitches like fast death/hit. So rip
