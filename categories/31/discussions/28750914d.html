<b>DO<br></b><ul><li>Use a bow on your opponent if they are more than 5 blocks away. A bow inflicts more damage than a sword.</li><li>Use an iron sword vs. a stone one. It makes all the difference. On some nebula maps, you will spawn with a stone sword, but there are iron blocks so you can craft an iron sword.</li><li>Use a bow on your opponent if on a sky bridge. Then you will have a higher chance of not getting knocked off the bridge.</li><li>Get the first hit in. This way you will be able to kill your opponent faster as their health points have already depleted.</li><li>Force your opponents into water/off the world</li></ul><b>DON'T<br></b><ul><li>Use a bow in melee combat</li><li>Allow your opponent to hit you first when lower than him/her</li><li>Fall into water while in melee combat</li></ul>

Your first point isn't that great. Bows only do more than swords if they're fully drawn. If someone is 6 blocks away, you're not gonna be able to full draw, and you'll do half a heart to their 2.5.<br><br>Here's my list:<br><ul><li>Use a sprint key. Mine, personally, is set to F, so I can spam it as I run into fights. This will allow you to combo easier.</li><li>Use strafing to the best of your ability. This will (obviously) make it harder for you to be hit, while still getting shots on.</li><li>Use block-hitting <i>in the right circumstances.&nbsp;</i>Don't run around block hitting. It won't help. You need to be as mobile as possible. If you're in a 2v1 in a small room, for example, it's your best bet. If you're cornered, it will also help.</li><li>Don't shoot first-drawback arrows. They're useless. Shoot on the second drawback if absolutely necessary.</li><li>Have an arrow knocked as an opponent runs at you. Shoot the arrow when he/she is 7 or so blocks away. This will knock him/her back and set him/her up for a nice combo.</li><li>S-Step. It's commonly a PotionPVP or SoupPVP tactic, but has many practical implications. Google it.</li><li>Know your weaknesses. Don't run into 3v1s. Don't take on diamond people in no armour. Pretty straight forward.</li><li>Move. All the time. Even when you're bowing. I find hitting my sprint key after shooting, and moving forward a bit helps get into this habit.</li><li>Take note of your hearts, constantly. Badlion UHC will help you with this.</li><li>Don't jump into people's faces. You'll get combo'd to crap.</li><li>Learn to dodge arrows effectively. Try an Archer ladder on Badlion.</li></ul>I can think of a few more, but those are common sense. :3

Depends if you blockhit then get them in a combo you can strafe. Or just move when Blockhitting if you can.

Oh yeah, make sure your render distance is no higher than <b>13; and turn clouds OFF.</b>(who needs clouds, anyway?). This generally makes your game less glitchy, so you have no PVP battles when your game lags and then the other player 3 hits you with an iron sword.
