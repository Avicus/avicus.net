I don't get why people think they are hard.Although it might have something to do with the fact that I am smarter than the average human. Or maybe the fact that I am on a state where they use their own education, not the U.S. one. Or maybe because I just got out of 6th grade.Still, I have a standard test at the end of the year, and it's easy. I even got a perfect score in the math test.Something else I realized is that the test isn't that pressuring. The teachers just make it seem like the test that will decide your life. (Unless you are in China, then it does decide your life.) The only big thing that is on the line is:1. Something to put on your applications. And unless you want to be a doctor or a scientist, it doesn't need to be all that great. Just don't fail.2. More money for the teacher's paycheck.So, I just want to know&nbsp;why it&nbsp;is such a huge stress attack.

Well, some students slack off or don't understand things well, so the finals (called exams for me) could decide whether they pass or fail a course. Then they would have to keep taking that course until they pass it (If it's a compulsory course, like math or science) if they want to graduate.

They decide your future. That's why.<br><br><br>Get a good score, more opportunities. Get a low score, less.

I guess some parents are extreme about grades. :/<br>Maybe some people get money for good test scores, but are a slacker.<br>It could make or break your promotion to the next grade.

Because there the last test you'll ever do at school and will go on your CV, maybe?

I honestly have no worries about this test. Then again, I have never taken it.

When you get to high school and university / college, you will have a lot more stress than you did in the 6th grade, trust me. :P
