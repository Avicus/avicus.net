<h3>Atlas News</h3>

<p>Our developers are still working hard to squash those bugs, but since last community update, ALM and  Keenan have been hard at work eradicating those bugs, as you can see from the development log https://avicus.net/forums/discussions/c029e4189. I'm going to be working closely with Keenan this week to try and wrap up those bugs. In other news, we've almost created KOTH XML, which should be ready by the end of the month, as well as Frenzy, Skywars and a few other neat gamemodes :). </p>

</div>

<h3>Posighdun's Address<br><span style=" font-weight: 300;"> We've been very busy with advertising this week. If you want to read more about that, look at the section below.  I just wanted to talk about recently, a bunch of people keep on ban evading at specific times. During late EST and early EST a group of about 3/4 come on, with VPNs and alt generators, and decide to mess around. Our moderators have been working hard to keep on banning them, as there really isn't much we can do. I'm going to try and do something else, but please bare with us. I know it's frustrating and annoying, but the best thing that you guys can do if no mods are on is to report them on the website, that way we can ban them through the website. </span></h3><br>

<h3>Advertising News</h3>

<p>Keenan has been hard at work contacting Youtubers and organising various other forms of advertising. Whilst I'm not going to reveal exactly what we are doing,  for obvious reasons,  but hopefully by the end of the month we'll have some youtubers and be advertising on some other platforms. Keep voting for us, it does help, and if you are keen on buying/donating to Avicus, the sale is ending soon! </p>

<h3>Miso</h3>

<p><b>What's going to happen this week?</b> Well AvicusNetwork twitter only hours ago announced scrim servers will be returning some time this week ^.^ which may also mean  official servers will be coming soon as well, and we all know what that means! I'm very excited, a lot of the planning the admins are doing right now are for future gamemodes and future mechanics to gameplay, which should be coming your way within the next few months.  Keep looking at Twitter and Facebook to get sneak peaks :&gt;. </p>

Seriously if there is a group of hackers always online at the same time, YOU MUST do something! You can't just leave the whole players alone! There must be always staff members online, seriously now! Do something! I would love to report them with video evidence but this doesn't help, since they got unlimited accounts. We really need to solve this problem, or else a lot of people which don't play Avicus that much, but enjoyed it will leave
