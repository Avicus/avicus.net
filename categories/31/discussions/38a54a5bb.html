Lets say you grabbed three sets of diamond armor in Quinus, about to share it with two other friends. You throw the armor to them, and some guy runs over and picks it up.<br><br>It's happened to me too many times, with different moderators telling me different things. One said that it isn't stealing, since I technically don't own the armor anymore, but another moderator tempbanned someone for it. Is this allowed or not?<br><br>Also, if some guy gets the entire diamond chest, then dies, is it considered team grief?<br><br>If it actually is allowed, there should be a rule against it, since it's basically the same thing as mining all the iron from your team and throwing it off. Not only is it increasing the chances of the enemy team winning, but it's generally a dick move.

In my opinion, it is. But.... it maybe not, because you should work in a team, and there should be the same possibilitiesfor each member of your own team, or he maybe didn't want do it...

If someone runs over the diamond and steals it, it's considered team trolling.<br><br>If someone takes everything in a chest, it is team trolling, as well as if he/she died on purpose.

Why would it be disallowed? (when someone takes armour that you drop for a friend)<br>Someone using your teams resources appropriately? The amrour is as much theirs as it is anyone else in the game on your team.

Not really "rightfully his". They're basically stealing resources; imo it's the same thing as breaking a crafting table and taking the diamonds.

But you are giving these items to a friend, not to that person who gave the items. He, in fact, is stealing&nbsp;<b>you</b>. Because is like if you are giving something to your brother, and a person (with bad intentions) takes it and ran away.

Stealing resources from his team?<br>Basically like breaking into your own home.<br>And crafting table is different as you've already done your bit to secure the items and are now using them for your team.<br>With you dropping them, you have more than you need in the first place.

No its not. Because with armour, the other person technically has rights to use it too.<br>A better example would be if you give something your mother bought for you AND your siblings to have and you give it to your brother, then your other brother swoops and takes it.

Anyways, the point is &lt;&lt;How would you feel if you give these diamonds to x-player, and another player take it&gt;&gt; you are giving that to a player who you want to give that item, and someone else takes it. I don't know you, but I'd feel very annoyed by this, and the person who took it had bad intentions.

I personally would kick for the stealing.<br><br>"Also, if some guy gets the entire diamond chest, then dies, is it considered team grief?" If they died to an enemy, obviously not. If they grab the contents of the chest, then jump off the map intentionally, it is considered Team Grief.

Some staff are very specific with it (Team Troll, Team Grief, Team Kill, etc.), while some of us will just generalize it as either Team Grief or Team Kill. Someone walk out of the world with iron/diamond? I call it Team Grief. Block Spawn? Spawn blocking. Kill a team mate? Team Spleef/Kill. It depends on what the moderator thats dealing the punishment(s) classifies it as.

The idea is that the person who would steal the dia isn't supposed to have it in the first place. Taking it from the chest is securing it as much as putting it in a crafting table. You've already done your work to secure it and someone steals it at the only vulnerable point from there (breaking crafting table/taking when you throw it to a friend). It's Team Trolling/Griefing depending on what they do with it. First come first serve, really.

I don't like Quintus at all just because of the fact that people <b>ALWAYS</b> take more than one set of diamond gear. I understand, you take it "for a friend", but what about the other 10+ players in your team who want to play to? Nah, I stay away from Quintus as much as I can. I do spectate when others play the map and something I always see, especially when it comes to staff, they always keep more than one set in their inventory plus the gear they wear. I will not namedrop anyone, but I do not expect staff members to act like this, and in my opinion it counts as teamgriefing. Quintus is a big no no for me.

For what? Also if a player picked up armor I was trying to give to a friend, I would ask them to give<br>it back, and if they didn't give it back I would kick them, anyways those type of people occasionally try to break your crafting table too.

I'll completely clear this up, since there are answers being thrown back, and fourth.<br><br>If you were to give armor to your friend and another player runs in and steals it; if the act is done by&nbsp;<i>accident&nbsp;</i>it is very common they'll either ask you if you'd like it back, turn around and just give it back anyway, or if you ask them, they'll most often give it back.&nbsp;<br><br>However if the act is done on&nbsp;<i>purpose,</i> which is very clear to tell the difference between whether they tried to steal it or not, yes it is punishable. This is considered team trolling (which is basically the act of degrading, harassing, etc. To your own team mates) and will be punished for the same duration of time as anyone else would be who was trolling their own team.<br><br>Hope this helped, and since this topic's been going on for quite a while and you now know the answer, I'm going to go ahead and lock this. Great question!
