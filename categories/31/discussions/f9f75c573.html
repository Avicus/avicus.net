Problems You Find With Avicore

</h1>
Hello everyone,<br>A lot of people have been saying negative things or having negative thoughts about the Avicore update. I want to make the coming updates perfect this plugin, and in doing so I want the community's help. Please respond some of the problems you see with Avicore, and some of the issues you want us to fix. I will gladly present all of these ideas, changes, and fixes to Funky, and I will respond to you what the staff thinks about these ideas. We all want the same thing, whats best for the community, and this is most likely the best way to make this plugin and server perfect. <br>Now, I kindly ask all of you to stop ranting about how Avicore didn't meet your expectations and isn't as good as you thought it was going to be. I understand that having an opinion isn't against the rules, but it does get quite annoying when it gets posted in a topic that is completely unrelated.&nbsp;Please comment (kindly) what you feel about the Avicore update, and please provide real problems that the staff team can provide answers for. We don't want Avicus hate or unreasonable requests on this thread, but we do encourage any other problems or requests you have.

The lobby is too big, NO /WHERE &gt;:O, i liked the ability to hit the signs to teleport to them, no new avicade games.<br>

I think we will bring back the click on sign option. That was a big hit and I personally liked it also. I am sorry about the Avicade Games: More will be added soon. We just haven't had time to make more, if we did Avicore would have taken more time.

Add fly into the lobby, or at least allow people with pets fly their pets&nbsp;:)<br><br>Make &nbsp;the lobby less 'plain', add some buildings and&nbsp;stuff to it. I think you know what I mean.<br><br>/where needs to come back

or make the lobby smaller xD, even the flying invisible signs are a bit to far when you spawn in so you gotta walk around a bit to load the chunk you want to teleport to the minigame you wanna play

Oh, also... Maybe make it so that donators don't receive messages that say you should donate, it would remove some spam.

tbh I don't think funky has that time, that takes a lot of coding, since you need to program it to adjust automatically so donors don't get that message, unless funky does it manually it takes A LOT of coding

Never seen the /trails in action. Maybe in the shop you should add links to pictures so people could see what some of the perks do. Such as /trails. <br><br><br>If someone is trying to make a long written thought out post on the forums and then they copy and paste a link to say a picture, video, etc. Once they paste the link all there paragraphs come together and all the "Enters" they pushed to make the different spaces for those paragraphs. An Example:<br><br><br><span>Hey guys! I just made a video! I will now press enter four times to make a new paragraph and tell you what the video is about.This video is a Website Tour of the new website for Avicus! I will now press enter four times for a paragraph saying Enjoy!I really hope you guys enjoy this video! I will now post the link to the video in the next paragraph.

Like Muk said, improve YML so that there could possibly be map borders and height limits, so you can actaully contain gameplay and enjoy the actual gameplay of the map. Nobody likes a skybridge at 256 and dropping water down, cause that lags the crap out of the server.

May I suggest making Nexus less sword-based? Like, barely any kits have bows in them (only Archer and Sniper, as fair as I know), and 24 arrows for Archer will only kill one or two people, with no way to get them back. Maybe give Archers 16 arrows when they kill someone?

Well on the Walls you need to check some things out with Poseidon. So many people use it and its OP in my opinion also the height border is kinda weird I went to make a skybase thing on top of a tree in Tetris Jungle and this message kept spamming me saying you can not build in the void but I was in a tree away from the void. Lastly I get why you take away flint and steel and I like that fire charges work but I think that the fire should spread its a great way to take out a opponent camping in a tree.&nbsp;

May I ask a few questions?<br>1. Golden Apples aren't dropping anymore for most maps. Was this intentionally done? I know that the regular apples were replaced with Golden Apples that cost 8 points, kinda expensive for just 3 pieces and the fact that there are no more golden apple drops is kinda harsh to a surviving player. I'd like to think of them as an award rather than killing heaps just to get a few bits of regen. Just a thought. They are not dropping upon killing an enemy. They are kept soulbound.&nbsp;<br><br>2. I think the block-placing pace should not be controlled because what happens if you naturally just place blocks quickly? It just despawns from the whole battlefield leaving you vulnerable. Let's say making an outpost or a bridge. It makes things slower and more difficult.&nbsp;

Great job on Avicus 2.0! All round the best way to play Minecraft!

I have found something, that bothers me about nebula. Since the Update, a match starts as soon as 1 Player has joined. Like this you can be the only person in a game, which means that you can then easily farm EP by destroying the monuments. Would like this to be changed, seeing as I think that it is sense of the EP to show how good different people are. This gets spoiled by these Ep-farmers. So I would like this to be stopped, because it ruins the games a bit.<br><br>LG Forscher<br>

There are people who sucked at aiming at their target that they just throw them all and wadah! they missed or sometimes they only hit one person and that person even didnt die. Ky, if you're a donor, you can tell how hard to throw and aim them to enemies who are good at dodging or when they're too close if they're wearing iron/diamond armor. One time i was trying to throw grenades at my friend and he survived by dodging. That's one of the cons of grenades. Easy to dodge if you practice. Also another con is, for 5 grenades, it will took you 10 points to get it and you can only kill 1-2 person if you suck at targeting. but for some people who are good at throwing grenades, they can kill 5 people with it or even more. Grenades are annoying but you can still dodge it by strafing it.

1) I would like the golden apple drops to be back too. They helped and it ensured, that you can also do kill streaks and rush. <br>2) Grenades? I am not sure if they were so good. They were very helpful of course, but they ruin the game a bit by being OP if in the hand of a good fighter. Seeing as they could only be bought, if you were Gold or higher, they normally are in the hands of good fighters. If they come back, I would like them to be for all.<br>3)For the people on the first places, there should be some kind of award. How about a damage boost: 1: triple damage&nbsp; 2-5: double damage 6-20: 1.5 times so much damage. Or this this a bit to high? <br><br>Greetz Forscher<br>

It has also happened to me while i was stacking straight up.<br><br>Also, i don't like how some of the McZone maps have changed, like in Crusade they changed the stonebrick to a mixture of a bunch of different types of stone blocks, and it just looks ugly imo. They also changed Frostbite, but it's not the bedrock i don't mind, it's just that they moved the spectator spawn.

I think we should re-add /server and /stats commands, because not being able to do /server is a right pain when your friend asks you what game you are in. I think the /stats for nexus should be like they were in MCzone. Kills, deaths K/D, and XP. I also agree with jrl on the lobby being a bit too big. Maybe you could downscale it?

@MetallicPenguin Parkour was originally on MCZone, but was never finished. I don't think it deserves it's own gamemode, but if we could find a twist to put it in Avicade I bet it'd be real fun. Sky Wars isn't really that popular, however if we were to re-add it I think it'd also fit in avicade; the only issue is the length of the games and if it would really be worth it bringing it back. (Unofficial word here..)<br><br>@RagingLumberjack It is indeed hosted in the United States, however I believe funky said a while back on Oldvicus that if we were to get another server, it would be hosted in Europe.<br><br>@cowcowl Blame Mojang's skin servers. I don't think it's a problem on Avicus's end.<br>@Tekcrezec162 It's most likely the amount of players and the maps themselves. Some maps are non-laggy and some aren't. Claustrophobia and World's End have smooth framerate, while some others can impact you bad. As for #2, you can probably see it once the stats command comes back. You are able to know how much XP you get after a match ends. For #4, I agree and hopefully we can make it less boring. Right now, we just have pets and holograms. I was thinking hats, jump pads, and lounges. For #5, I believe it's hardcoded however you can always request new kits on the forum. And.. for #6.. I don't really know, probably a coincidence.&nbsp;<br><br><br><br>

In my opinion Avicore, although it has good programming, was not a good update. The lobby is fantastic but sadly we can't explore it because after all, it was well built and it would be sad to leave it to go to waste. The new maps are hard to get used to, I want to like them but I can't. Nexus and Avicade coming does not mean that Nebula can be changed completely. I never get to play my favourite maps, Nebula is so full of new ones. I don't like how rendezvous is at night and in my personal opinion as an Avic&nbsp;I think that Avicore was unfortunately not worth waiting for.&nbsp;

Seeing as mostly good fighters(because of the rank) had them, they were way to OP. I think the op thing was the reason, they were taken away :D However, if everyone can have them for points, they wont be so OP anymore because also unskilled users can use them. Greetz Forscher<br>

Improve Nexus kits,they are severely underpowered,snake only does half a heart of poison damage,it's basically useless and we only have a stone sword,Enderman is useless as well even though there's enderpearls because the enderpearls will take sometime to teleport the player to the desired location,Make them at least average kits please.

<br>If someone is trying to make a long written thought out post on the forums and then they copy and paste a link to say a picture, video, etc. Once they paste the link all there paragraphs come together and all the "Enters" they pushed to make the different spaces for those paragraphs.

I will now press enter four times to make a new paragraph and tell you what the video is about.This video is a Website Tour of the new website for Avicus!

There is one thing that bothers me MUCH here and I am nearly gone because of this. There are way to much hackers here and also mostly the wrong people are accused of hacking. For instance, 2 days a go in Unix(Nebula) A leather guy fighted against 2 diamond guys(including me) and won(He didn't knock us over the edge) I alone had given him about 10 hits with my diamond sword. But strangely no one thought, that he could be a hacker.<br>
