Sadly I haven't gotten a chance to play it yet. I hope I can soon to see it.

Not a well made map. Currently, the map is really slow and is not appealing to the eye. Also, the /surface command does not work on it. Along with the other aforementioned things, vacuum needs more attainable resources and better chests.

IMO the it's better that the /surface command doesn't work than it putting you on top of the map and out of play. It's a broken command in general and should really be replaced with /spawn

I do not really like that idea. The /surface command is priceless when you have a friend in a sky base and need to pop up there and when you want to get to the top of a tree. Changing the command to teleporting to the spawn would make the command much less valuable ...

I've only played this map a couple of times but I already know I do not like it at all. The main issue is the height factor. The many skyways (I guess you would call them) in the mine and throughout the map make it very easy to fall and die unless you have the kit stomper. In this case stomper can be used as an extreme advantage. Lots of people are not level 32+ which means many people would not have access to stomper and can easily fall and die before the walls fall (given the skyways being thin and easy to fall off of). When the walls do fall, the map opens up to more skyways which lead to "staircases" that go down (because the mid is much lower than the mid), it is very easy to fall and die and takes a long time to get down while people with stomper can easily just jump down to the middle. Another thing is the advantage stompers have because the mid is so low. They could either build out or they could just wait till someone is near/below them and stomp them very easily (there's no really escaping this, giving people without stomper not much of a chance).<br><br>This map does look really cool but I don't think it makes for a very good walls map okay anyways

The map itself is bad. I had to say that. xD. But I like the things it has in it, whats in the chest ect.. but its not made well and its very hard to get around.

That's what's OP about it. You can just get to the top of any tree/building/skybase to get chests first or find your friends. And going up to a skybase instantly is pretty powerful by itself. Based on the wording of the command it seems like it was intended to be used to get to the surface after mining...

Well, that is why we pay the $50 for the kit. I'm sure myself, along with the other emerald and diamond donators would not approve of what we paid for being taken away.

It's just one map out &nbsp;of 20 or so walls maps. I don't mind

I'm not a fan of the map, its unique i'll give it that but its too dark. like meggs said, the fall chances are too high and the map itself is pretty bland, plus the gameplay is pretty boring

I've only played it twice.&nbsp; I really like the futuristic feel of the map.&nbsp; It is dark, but that can be fixed.&nbsp; With some minor adjustments, I think it would be more fun to play.<br><br>The first time I tried to rush mid with only my pickaxe and no resources because I couldn't find anything.&nbsp; It was discouraging, but that all makes sense since it was new to me and I didn't know where to go.<br><br>The second time was more successful because I found lots of food and iron, so I was prepared for mid.&nbsp; I enjoyed it more this round.<br><br>I noticed that you can get above the map and make a skybase up there.&nbsp; I would add a layer of bedrock to remove that ability.<br><br>I agree that the skyways/walkways were hard to navigate and I found myself building over to areas that I wanted to explore.&nbsp; Maybe more options on directions to take would be needed, especially since it seems a large portion of the map is up in the air.<br><br>I need to explore the map again to give more feedback.

From what I saw as a spec it seems rather hard to navigate &amp; reach all the rooms in 10 minutes.

I've never played the map so I cannot really talk about the /surface command or OP chests, but from what I've seen from the screenshots it's not like the other maps, but for the good side.<br>I mean, this map is different, it doesn't have things that the other maps has, I think it's provides a unique and fun gameplay.<br>As for the OP chests,a walls game has 4 teams, which means so if the other teams have OP stuff, your team has them too.
