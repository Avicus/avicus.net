Hai guys and gals! &nbsp;I wanted to know what happened to the newsletter that Ironsoldier and awesome apricot (I think) were going to be working on? &nbsp;The newsletter was to be posted monthly I think, with pictures of tourneys and stats, gossip, latest updates, new things headed for Avicus, etc? &nbsp;Has it been cancelled? o_O?

We need it back &gt;:O<br><br>Honestly it should be done with more people. As a mod, Apricot probably has more important priorities to worry about and Ironsoldier can't do it alone. I think we should create an (unofficial-ish) committee to create the newsletter.

If they can not longer manage the topic, I could try re-making it, or somebody else could if they wish.

Pretty sure someone on the admin team shut this down, not entirely sure. If you want a weeky newsletter though, we might be able to do one in admin blog.

we're working on it, chill.<br>Hold your horses that stuff isn't made overnight. I know it's been a while but since when I was given no deadline to write the article I couldn't be bothered to write a single letter. I have been working on it a bit though.<br>Thanks for worrying anyway though.

I think the Avicus Newspaper should be formatted like a real newspaper (i.e.: It should look like a newspaper that you'd find in real life, like the New York Times newspaper).
