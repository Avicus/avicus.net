"Ass" is indeed an exception. We can whip up a list of words that are considered "inappropriate", but it's common sense for the most part.<br>Again, as Zeus said, you can just ask a staff member if you're unsure if a name is inappropriate or not.

No, the lag is coming from the provider's equipment, it's not from the plugins.<br>And the only person who can do anything about the provider is Kylo.

Is this gonna be a regular thing? I'd recommend setting up&nbsp;a schedule (weekly or monthly most likely) and make it some sort of newsletter.

An autoclicker plugin has to be detecting rhythms from past clicking speed. Say my auto clicker is on 9.5 cps to 10.5 cps, but it does the same everytime, so say 9.5, .77, .92 etc, then they should be automatically banned. Also, if someone is clicking over 20 CPS consistently then they're autoclicking.

</div>
As you're probably already aware, swearing in chat is condoned as long as it's not rudely directed at anyone, and it's done sparingly as opposed to excessively. Having even an inoffensive swear word in your username would likely violate the latter condition, since it would appear not only every time you send a message in the chat, but every time you score a kill — or get a kill scored on you — or someone mentions your name (among other potential instances). That's just my guess, at least, since it would make sense.

</div>
In chat, you're allowed to swear as long as it's not excessive or directed towards anybody.<br>It also depends on the context.<br><br>Inappropriate usernames are in a grey area because everyone has a different opinion on what's appropriate and what isn't.&nbsp;<br><br>So by implementing this rule, it will makes things slightly eaiser to tell whether a name's appropriate or not.

Well done zeus for making this and really taking suggestions into account, i thank you for that.<br><br>But regarding the autoclick plugin or whatever make sure it is created well and it has had a lot of field testing before it is implemented because gee you can go wrong with an autoclick detection plugin. If it does go wrong you are going to have so many false bans.

After the summer, i think devs should prioritize fixing lag blahblah and adding an autoclicker detector. Then, after that, they can go back to adding more in-game perks and all that jazz

An autoclicker plugin has to be detecting rhythms from past clicking speed. Say my auto clicker is on 9.5 cps to 10.5 cps, but it does the same everytime, so say 9.5, .77, .92 etc, then they should be automatically banned. Also, if someone is clicking over 20 CPS consistently then they're autoclicking.

You're right, however, there are still somekind of autoclickers where you can set-up a timer to regulate your cps so it doesn't make it a sequence.

All in all - it's very hard to detect.<br>You can just click as well as using the auto clicker and it disturbs the rhythm straight off.
