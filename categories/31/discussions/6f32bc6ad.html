Since I have no idea what the admins are doing at the moment, and the fact I was planning an update thread, and I wanted one to be made by now, I'll just update with what I know for the community so everyone isn't lost in the dark. I can see some of you aren't pleased, so I might as well make this thread.<br><br><b>Translations are expected to follow through.</b><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;I was leading the translation project, however since my demotion, I gave that torch over to Arigenn. He will be managing questions and possibly directing developers, but we have two different scenarios for it: we have the website, and we have the in-game translations for the plugin. Currently, an issue was made on the GitHub tracker to do it, and as the system works, we have a language file for English that we can add more languages to, and it pulls from that. <br><br>&nbsp; We aren't looking into Crowdin, considering it costs money and it wasn't really active. However, we are getting German, Swedish, Spanish, English, Italian, and Russian translations currently by groups of people for the rules exclusively currently. There is a translation room in TeamSpeak now, and I'd consider this one of our priorities. Along with this, will come a new ruleset in English as well with a few redundancies removed.<br><br><b>ViceWatercolour has been demoted.</b><br>&nbsp; Surprise, surprise. I was demoted for abuse on the server. Though a thread was made for this, and I still disagree with the decision, I have that right to express my opinion. I was demoted by the senior staff team, and I finished up all my projects in one single TeamSpeak session. The demotion reasons I can explain, however one of them was where I wasn't thinking straight and ended up abusing TeamSpeak permissions, where I got a revocation of my TS Dev rank, and my admin/senior rank. It seems after talking I got my staff rank back (concluded as an accident), however I commend the admins for writing a non-biased story in the OP of the other thread. Following my demotion, I have retired. The abuse in question was lava'ing a friend only I was with in TeamSpeak (who did not care and played along), another was making a "life support" lounge and "weed lounge", and having fun on an empty walls server with other staff. Excluding staff warns, I was promptly demoted.<br><br><b>New Developer (ALM)</b><br>He seems to have some of the most experience, and he is more of a guy that is focusing on security issues currently. Addressing the hacking issue, his defense was listened to, and we should give him good recognition for helping take on development for Avicus for free. There may be personal trust issues between him due to "hacking", however in assurance and retaliation he is ready to support the server, and any issues can be forwarded to funkystudios. I confide in him for the server's future, and it is up to him to describe the story if he wishes.<br><br><b>Developer Return (pavilion99)</b><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;Noteworthy that we have another active developer. He's participating in development related discussions, camping out in-game, and is off of his hiatus currently. Whether or not he'll leave again, is up to himself, however he has some free time to waste on development so we can hope that good things come.<br><br><b>Arcade Development</b><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;The staff are working on the arcade. There are a lot of UNIQUE concepts in the Arcade that currently not many (or no) servers have, and we wish to preserve these in order for nobody to take them and to have development made on them further. All I will release now, is that map developers have been alerted and they are working on a new lobby/some maps for them. We're taking direction of having a good arcade, and we hope this project lasts.<br><br><b>Applications Being Closed</b><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;This is the most efficient application month I can remember. With everything being dealt with at a moment's notice, and structure implemented to where we did it gradually, properly, all applications have been replied to and are either dealt with, or are being dealt with. As applications closed a week ago, we should see this being wrapped up. Applications are not going to be opening in the next 2 months, however! The mentors and senior staff really helped make this possible, and community support/polling from the previous application feedback was taken into account. Interviews were fun!<br><br><b>New Administrator (Arigenn)</b><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;This dude got promoted on a majority vote, and he made it to senior and jumped to admin. I would like to give him recognition for leading the projects I left behind due to my demotion, and he's a very good friend. To greater heights I hope Avicus will go with him leading along MidnightBeats, though we'll see what the future holds.<br><br><b>Staff Policy Updating</b><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;Arigenn confirmed updating the staff policy today in one of his posts, working alongside the senior staff to ensure it's fair and enforced. Staff policies have always been a weak point on the server, and it's apparent that we have two leading admins and a driving network of seniors to ensure quality policies this time around.<br><br><b>Staff Spotlights in Function</b><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;One thing I always loved about the network is staff spotlights -- even though I have left the team, they will continue. MidnightBeats has control of them now from my understanding, and he'll be posting one every 17 days (at least as my pattern to inherit) and ask the staff questions. It'll be fun to see who's next!<br><br><b>Departments Changed Around</b><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;Eh, new update to departments.&nbsp;<a title="Link: https://avicus.net/forums/e87a4ca4e" href="https://avicus.net/forums/e87a4ca4e">https://avicus.net/forums/e87a4ca4e</a>. I don't have the exact changelog, but I assume it was just the removal of me and the new department of Policies and Rules/Training. The staff department was removed, along with a few switch arounds with particular departments. <br><br><b>Leader of Community Slack</b><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;PieZ is now in charge of leading the community slack. I thought he'd be a good manager for it, and if you have concerns about the slack, you may direct them to either him or an administrator. This decision was on behalf of me, midnight, and arigenn. Also, be sure to try and join it! Exciting things should come.<br><br><b>New Control the Hill Kits</b><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;I added a few beta kits that are entirely balanced and new. Try them out sometime - I think they're pretty good. We now have 11 kits, and a few kits stayed. If you have feedback, the map developers are open to hear it!<br><br>If you have any concerns about this update, then post below... keep in mind this isn't official, but what I knew before I left.

Well, what do you think he arcade is going to have? I know the Map Devs are trying to create other arcade games, just like the Map Devs&nbsp;of OCN are doing.
