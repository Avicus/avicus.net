hey man, great to see you back!<br>Ironic you say "I'm back" because while you were gone lots of people announced their leaving :( Evocal and Paraspider A.K.A TheMasterCow retired as map developers and were still waiting for the update to kick in so everyone can resume playing!<br>In the last month or two there have also been some new maps added for Walls and Nebula, and an Avicus Gazette is being prepared to update everyone on the wide world of Avicus.<br>Welcome Back!
