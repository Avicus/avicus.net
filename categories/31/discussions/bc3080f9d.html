So I decided to make a throwback thread for Avicus long term players who have some experience to share. So just put your throwback moment down below. This is just for us all to have a flashback to what Avicus/MCZONE was and what we will all remember it as for as long as Avicus lives.<br><br>Mine would be the most obvious one: Prestiges!<br>I remember getting my first prestige on the map Curabitur. Good times..<br><br><br>EDIT: Decided to make it in a list form.<br><br><b>Throwbacks:<br></b>- Prestiges<br>- My IGN being "sheamus4414" (true story)<br>- Howsie and Gil as directors<br>- Directors in that matter<br>- Team skywars<br>- Walls actually being kinda popular<br>- Avicus player base<br>- Manager rank<br>- The first Nexus map<br>- 5x5 stone lobby<br>- Sessp's majestic kd<br>- Skywars<br>- Nether star shop<br>-&nbsp;<a href="http://imgur.com/iA43Wl9" title="Link: http://imgur.com/iA43Wl9">http://imgur.com/iA43Wl9</a><br>- Spooks infractions<br>- Sandstone lobby<br>- When Senex was a new map<br>- G-Skippy<br>- <a href="https://avicus.net/forums/341d9471e" rel="nofollow">This</a><br>- Storm chasers<br>- Gonzo<br>- Tino<br>- Doozie<br>- The private lobby with ender pearls<br>- A strong player base<br>- The onion-throwing shenanigans<br>- Steampunk DTM<br>- The maps committee<br>- Howsies threads to see if staff are all still active<br>- Vice and Para making Senex 3&nbsp;and rendezvous 3<br>- Tigerman<br>- Everyone teamspleefing on Luar<br>- Vice's first interview<br>- Emmy doing mass account bans<br>- Iron winning Robo's UHC<br>- Iron's teamspeak crew<br>-&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; ">When Peachy kicked Jess for "Trolling" because they were all stuck in a hole together on Ternio<br>- The old lobbies<br>- Aura's&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; ">batch being promoted to senior moderator and finding out at five in the morning with countless slack messages.&nbsp;<br>-&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; ">FazerMC being Elimination god<br>-&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; ">Sli always getting accused of hacking in Elimination.....<br>- Elimination for that matter<br>- Awesomerp b</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; ">eing 1173rd on the leaderboard ^-^<br>- Birdy prestiging in Avicade<br>- Greg's current name (lil_greg15)<br>- The crits on Nexus<br><br></span>
