So I decided to make a throwback thread for Avicus long term players who have some experience to share. So just put your throwback moment down below. This is just for us all to have a flashback to what Avicus/MCZONE was and what we will all remember it as for as long as Avicus lives.<br><br>Mine would be the most obvious one: Prestiges!<br>I remember getting my first prestige on the map Curabitur.
