Okay, so there has been a lot of talk about DDOS recently on the TeamSpeak server. Some people have been talking about it in a joking fashion, however, some others have been using it as a threat and a form of harassment. I would like to announce that speaking of DDOS in the team speak can now be punishable since I have had multiple players come and talk to me about being scared or even quitting Avicus because of this. We don't want to be a hostile community but after giving this some thought, it has brought a negative impact and a stormy cloud onto the community iteself. We want to be a friendly community. This is now, frankly unacceptable.&nbsp;<br><br>So to sum up, all threats about ddosing, ddosing itself, or "booting somebody off" is now forbidden in TeamSpeak unless you have some issues regarding possibly being ddosed yourself. The act of talking about this can result in a tempban of around 1 week or more depending on the severity of the situation. However ddosing itself will be a perm ban no question.<br><br>If i find users are evading these rules, action will be taken no matter who you are.<br><br>-tel

So because some people are immature, people aren't even allowed to have a conversation regarding the matter anymore?

ddos is illegal, if there is any way you can find their name with /seen etc, you could trace the ip (thats legal) and report them to their local authorities

Yes it does mean that. Because some people act immaturely about this matter, you all have it taken away. We can't just let some talk about it while others can. It's not how it works.

TeamSpeak is something where you can talk to people on. It's where some Avicus members talk while they play there games. You will find me in there quite a lot too if you want to talk to me about something. You have to download it from the interent first though.<br><br>DDOS is where someone sends you a bunch of information which can temporarily disable your internet or even perm disable it if it is that bad. But I can assure you that it wont happen.
