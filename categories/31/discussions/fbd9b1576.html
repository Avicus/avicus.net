In a recent senior staff meeting we decided to bring back Staff Spotlights. For those of you who are unaware how these work; we interview individuals in the staff team and ask them a bunch of questions. Then, on either a biweekly or monthly schedule (we haven't figured out how often we're going to be posting these yet, but you'll know by the next one!), we post these Staff Spotlights onto the forums.<br><br>So to start things off, today's Staff Spotlight is on <img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/0af038412894434ca4be965b317244e8?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/shadowolfyt.html" style="color: #5D5D5D">shadowolfyt</a>, who's been a part of the team for the last 5 months.<br><p class="MsoNormal"><b><br>Introduce yourself (4 or more sentences)&nbsp;</b></p><p class="MsoNormal">Hello, my name is shadowolf. I am 19 years old [still
playing a block game, I know]. I am a Moderator, Streamer and a student
studying in college. I live in Sydney, Australia.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><b>What are your hobbies?</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I enjoy recording gameplay and uploading it for
‘entertainment’ purposes, editing and creating videos and streaming on Twitch
playing games on either Avicus or other servers. I like the occasional coding,
I am currently learning HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL [database]. Outside of the
internet and this area of online life would be socializing and talking to
friends and occasionally meeting up with each other. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>What are you most excited/obsessed over at the moment?</b> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I’m not really excited or obsessed over anything really,
nothing really springs to mind. What interests you the most in life? My
interests mainly contain computing. I’ve built my own computer and I’m
currently learning new [coding] languages and all of that stuff. I am hoping
that in the future I will get a job in the IT industry. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>What music/art/media do you like?</b> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I am more into Electronic music [not like really hardcore,
just plain and simple] and the occasional quiet music while studying or
something that really relaxes me. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Where are you from?</b>&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">As I have mentioned earlier, I am from
Sydney, Australia [Not actually going to give you my actual location]. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>What’s your favourite thing about moderating?</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;I think my favourite
thing about Moderating is interacting with the community, taking reports [some
people might think, boi that crap is boring and repetitive, not really, at
least for me] and having some good memes with the staff team. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>What’s your most memorable experience as a moderator?</b> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"></p><p class="MsoNormal">Most memorable experience would have to be the time that I
have false banned and false kicked myself over the past 3 months as being a
Moderator. There are so many people that have the name shadow or shadowolf in
their names so I have to stop using tab when issuing punishments xd.&nbsp;</p>

I have a feeling that this won't last long... every time the seniors decide collectively to do something in terms of events they fall behind. I'm still thinking about the megascrims (that still get announced in-game) and the community events that were promised on TeamSpeak/Discord. In that case, the community is always running events for the community.<br><br>Anyways, hopefully this actually stays on track this time. Has been reintroduced around 12 times now since Howsie was director.

I'd like to do something that includes all staff, since this is a "staff" spotlight after all, not just a "mod" one.
