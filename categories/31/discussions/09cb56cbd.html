U decide in the comments. For DTC you need to break an obsidian in order to leak lava, which can make rounds last longer. I personally would like to have DTC in DTM rots. If you make a whole other server for DTC, that makes no sense.

DTC doesn't belong into the Destroy / Nebula rotation. If you add it to Destroy / Nebula it becomes Destroy. And not Destroy / Nebula, which means you kill Nebula, and if you do that you will not only annoy tons of "old newbish" players, you will annoy me too!

We are going to add it to Destroy once the gamemode has been played on Mix a lot and have good maps to integrate the gamemode with it. Also when the community learns how to play it.

This makes no sense, Nebula is just a brand name and Avicus' version of Project Ares.<br><br>DTC is merely an addition to Nebula. Since it is an addition, it is still part of Nebula.&nbsp;<br><br>Another thing, why is this minute detail so important? There are literally hundreds of other things to worry about, why stress over this one little thing?

By this logic, when CTW was added to Nebula... Nebula stopped being Nebula a LONG time ago.

No, DTC does not belong on the rotation of Nebula. If it's so popular, have it as it's own rotation, if not, let it die out like everything else.
