I'm sorry, but I'm probably going to sound like an idiot because I'm taking this a bit seriously. I have to say that the biggest unsung hero of Avicus is My04.... I forgot his full name. But My was an old admin back in MC Zone (not active) and was an admin on Terrascape. He provided Funky with financial help during terrascape to keep the server up and running. Without his generous donation, Funky probably wouldn't &nbsp;have ever made another server. And we definitely wouldn't be here. I for sure wouldnt. Sorry if this is long or too serious. But I do want to keep him somewhat remembered. No one knows of him, which is a bit unfair.
