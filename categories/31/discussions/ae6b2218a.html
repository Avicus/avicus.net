Hey guys! During the past days as I have been moderating I've seen a decent amount of people accusing of hacks in game instead of using the /report command and then arguing with the staff. On this post I shall be telling you all why we have a /report command hoping you guys will learn and evade any infractions for accusing of hacks.<br><br>To start off, the /report command is <b><u>NOT</u></b><u></u> a command to speak to moderators or to use as a joke to report your friends, anybody caught doing this will result in a probable infraction.<br><br>First of all, the /report command is meant to report hackers silently, so they do not find out you have figured out that they hack at the same time notifying all moderators online so we can reach them and deal with them appropriately.<br><br>To continue on with the last point, /report isn't only for hackers but for any rule breaker (spammer, scammer, team griefer, advertiser, e.t.c.), so if you find any rule breakers please use /report immediately so us mods can stop them.<br><br>Finally to finish off, when accusing of hacks in game, let it be on the rules or not, it <b>IS&nbsp;</b>againt the rules, when accusing of hacks in game it allows the hacker to acknowledge that you are onto him and that a moderator might be coming soon so he can toggle his hacked client. When doing this it acts like a form of helping the hacker get away woth hacking and then continuing with ruining everyones game by hacking some more.<br><br>In the end, what my point is, please do not accuse of hacks in game and simply type in /report {player name} reason. It will help us moderators a lot and keep the Avicus Network a better place to bond with new people!<br><br>Best regards ~vladthegreat100

I hate it when people say: "I reported you!1!1!11"<br><br>It kind of defeats the purpose of the report and could end up helping the hacker, as vald said.

@source &amp;juano, you must remember that moderators get hundreds of reports a day, and that most of those reports end up being false, or the report simply needed a warn, reporting people does help us a bunch as we cannot be in every game at once but many reports can end up being false because it looked like they were hacking for a few seconds.<br>Just want to say thank you for contributing at least to help the staff team as well as the network! :)

I don't there are too many reports <b>for now&nbsp;</b>due to the amount of Jr Moderators we have at the moment.<br>I already know most of the reports are false because someone looked like a hacked for once but I'm 100% sure people that hackusate are between 8-10 year old so they don't realize what they're doing.<br>I'm going to end this discussion so that's all the feedback I'm giving tho.

This is a very good topic.<br>If you report someone for hacking, and say "(player) I reported you!" in the chat right after, that player will probably know that a moderator is coming, and turn off their hacks, or stop breaking whichever rule they are breaking.<br>Saying in the chat that you reported them is a bad idea, so just keep that to yourself. :)

Of course! It's swearing in the chat and that's not allowed. Racism is also not allowed...<br>You can report them at the "Player Reports"-section in the Administration category. Just follow the steps in the sticky topic.

That goal shouldn't be getting players to come on the forums so they can be educated.<br><br>Staff members should promote good behavior and teach players on the rules in-game.
