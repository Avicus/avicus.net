</h1>
The next tournament is confirmed to be CTW, however the gamemode has two major bugs which need to be fixed. Those two problems are safety's and touches coming up in global chat.<br><br><ul><li>First of all, the fact that safeties are useless is stupid. Safeties should be a big part of the meta because it is literally impossible to have one person get back with the wool when he can not drop/ place a wool to his teammates. If he dies, it's all over and all they have is a touch.</li></ul><ul><li>Secondly, why can I see when the opposing team get in my teams wool room? Say I sneak into to the wool room, there's literally no chance of me getting back sneakily because they know I'm there or they're blind. It should display that a wool has been touched to the team offending that wool room and the observers. It should also come up in chat every time someone touches a wool and not just the first time that wool is touched.</li></ul>These changes would help the gamemode be more enjoyable and more possible to win. At this current time and in this current meta, it is really difficult to return a wool - in the all star game yesterday I had to hide in a 1x2 hole with at least 5 people hunting me to wait for my team to distract the hunters and PVP them while Danikas made an underbridge for me to return on. However, that team was randomised. It was not a team that knew eachother very well or that were experienced together. In experienced teams, something like that would not be possible. These two things should not be difficult to implement and it would help the meta.<br><br>PLEASE implement these.

I have to admit, the "Purple Wool has been touched" is annoying, but the safeties shouldn't work, as it is better without safeties IMO.

What about only being able to place a maximum amount of safeties? I don't like that you can't place safeties, but I also don't like safeties being spammed everywhere.<br><br>Agreed with point 2

For the first one, I'm afraid that safeties would become too OP because defense isn't really emphasized on public. Maybe tourney.

I think the first step for CTW is to fix the regions so you can't glitch into your own wool room and make it so trollers can't block where the wool needs to be placed. As for the messages, maybe broadcast it to the opposing team 10 seconds after it's been touched so the capturer can have a good chance of getting away.

I don't see the point in having it broadcasted at all. You should not know whether you've won or not so easily.

But once someone is the wool room, they do have those op wool room gear to harass the defender and help more people get in. Not only that, if 5 people were preventing you from getting out as you said, that opens up the rest of the map significantly, making it easier for your team to get into the other wool room, advance skybridge, make more pushes, etc.<br><br>And if the team is communicating, the defender should be able to tell their team whether someone is in the room or not anyways. Having it show up just makes it a lot more obvious. Shouldn't really matter, but I guess you could remove the part where it shows touches to the opposing team just to promote team communication.

Have the delay in public, but yeah, get rid of it for scrims, because people <i>should</i> defend.

I hope you realise you can easily get in the wool room without people knowing. Also, you don't understand the situation I was talking about.

I don't really care about the messages but don't add safeties. I like the current meta of having to escort the wool back to your side.
