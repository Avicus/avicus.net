You can apply when applications open up or possibly get reffered by another Moderator.

They will probably open in August since last applications were open in April and they open every 3 months now.

&nbsp;Edit:<br>Actually, I'm pretty sure we need Moderators who can speak both English and Spanish. I also think we need a few from Australia.

Ok, I've been wondering when they would be open again. But just warning you, there are many requirements including time spent on the server and you have only been on for 42 minutes.... So, you MAY want to wait. It's up to you.

Thanks for your advice. I'll do my very best to become a moderator and will be filling in everything.<br><br>Unfortunately I'll be going on a 2.5 week vacation on Friday.

Yeah as Junr stated above there are two methods to get a Junior Mod trial. The first is...<br><ul><li><b>The application process</b>, this is the standard process of&nbsp;<b>Application </b>-&gt; <b>Interview </b>-&gt; <b>Trial</b>. Ryan (Rinn) introduced the system where staff apps are to open three months after the trial period is concluded, so theoretically applications should open August or even September. However the senior staff team can decide to keep them <b>closed for an extended period</b> of they feel it's necessary.</li></ul>The other system is...<br><ul><li><b>The staff&nbsp;referrals</b>, which is essentially 'hand-picking'. The conclusion is based on majority vote on the thread after a period of time. I believe some examples of this are&nbsp;<b>LFT</b>,<b>&nbsp;</b><b>WQMBAT&nbsp;</b>and&nbsp;<b>Mqderator</b>.</li></ul><br>Hmm, seems like I've covered the basics of it. :)<br><br><br>N.B: Some of this information may not be 100% accurate due to the fact it is based of my knowledge of polices from when I was staff last.
