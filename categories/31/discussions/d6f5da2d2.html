Just a tip.<br><br>Mind your own business, why do you care how Sunrise lives his life? You don't know what he's dealing with and what he goes through. So how about you think before posting, so maybe in the future you can maybe sound a little less ignorant.

If you aren't looking for a fight then try not to bash people for no reason.&nbsp;<br><br>Also, If you don't care about his life then stop commenting things like "Take a break" and "He will never do anything with his life" on all of the congratulatory threads.

Red alert, red alert! Someone's telling Sunrise how to live his life again! Wait, no one cares this time? Okay... but in all seriousness I'm just kidding.<br><br>Yeah, congratulations and everything. I know leveling up becomes exponentially harder as you go further along, but I wasn't expecting it to take that much experience points... though, you're still spending an unhealthy amount of time playing. Not trying to start (ANOTHER) flame war, but I recommend (keyword) that you think more about managing your time, in case you already aren't and are actually a multitasking god...

It's my life and I can do whatever I want with it.<br>I never said I cared about Sunrise's life and I don't need to know about what he is going through because I think his life is pretty good as he has tone of spare time.<br><br>That's it and I wasn't looking for a fight, won't answer anymore replies.

Asserting something you can't prove (because it's untrue anyway)? How naive.
