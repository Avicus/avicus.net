1. The icon used to indicate whether a player is staff on the forums is the same logo that is the symbol for the teams tab on he website, just shrunk down.<br><br>2. The most expensive badge is the Greek letter for Omega, which is referencing the fact that badges were added in the Omega Update.<br><br>3. Avicus now has every gamemode that was in MC Zone except Ghost Squadron and Sky Wars. (And I believe that Ghost Squadron might be an Arcade game.)<br><br>4. KyloCode (formerly known as IvyCode, formerly known as funkystudios.), izjust4fun, and Telitubbies (formerly known as tel6331) are the only remaining staff from MC Zone.<br><br>5. Avicus has seen over 1,000,000 unique users in it's entire history.<br><br>6. One similarity between Avicus and OCN is that Show your face to the world! is the #1 topic on both forums.<br><br>7. If you jump off the map on the map Venomous. (TDM or DTM) you can see the phrase Turtle Love in glowstone under the bedrock.<br><br>8. KyloCode has a friend named Terrascape, which is the name of the very first version of this server.<br><br>9. &nbsp;Although HG was said to be renamed to Hunger Games, if you look in the Games tab, it is actually called Hardcore Games.<br><br>10. The only Nebula tournament this server has had so far was not won by a team from MC Zone/Avicus, it was won by a team from OCN named Nodus.

It was a team from OCN and they split up after the tourney. So technicaly, I'm still right.
