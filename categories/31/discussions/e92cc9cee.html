A week and a half ago, I bought the Gold subscription, and today, I decided to buy the one time Emerald rank. Well what happened was my Gold disappeared.. and the Emerald never came. So now I have no rank and the rank I bought never came through! I tried talking to some staff but they were busy, I also E-Mailed the support email. Mods I hope you can get this fixed!

Try contacting AviGill, Howise, or any Senior staff member on Skype.<br><br>They may take a while to answer, depending on how busy they are, so you may have to try re-sending another email to support@avicus.net if you do not receive a reply within a week.<br><br>Make sure that you have the proof of your purchase.

You could also do a Skype call and share screens with a sr mod, that what I did with Nolan to get my diamond as it was glitched.
