<div><b>Event #10:</b> This is the tenth official event on the Avicus Network, known as "<b>Pluto</b>". In this build competition, you will be building maps for <b>[CTF] Capture the Flag and/or [FFA] Free for All gamemodes.</b> These are 2 gamemodes we have been trying to introduce to the server and hopefully this contest will showcase your maps in these upcoming gamemodes.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Who are the judges?</b></div><div>The individuals that will be judging this competition are ParaSpider and PokerFace. Judges for this contest will not change, so please do not ask to become one. You may however request to become a judge for future Avicus building competitions.</div><div><br></div><div><b>What are the rules?</b></div><div>You have to follow these rules or your map will be rejected.</div><div>- You may not have more than 3 authors per map.</div><div>- You may not create more than 3 maps for Pluto.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>What are the guidelines?</b></div><div>Maps are judged in the following aspects;</div><div>- <b>Gameplay</b> (How do you think the map will play on the servers?)</div><div>- <b>Aesthetics</b> (How pleasing to the eye does it look?)</div><div>- <b>Creativity</b> (Is it unique and really stands out?)</div><div><br></div><div>YAML will be done by a map developer if you wish, and it will not count against you. We're all here to help!</div><div><br></div><div><b>What gamemodes can I do?</b></div><div>You may build maps only for the [CTF] and [FFA] gamemodes.</div><div><br></div><div><b>How do I submit my map?</b></div><div>Put a [CONTEST] tag in the title. By doing so, you are entered into the contest and put into a spreadsheet. It contains the map name, authors, thread link, jurisdiction of approval/denial, and it's gamemode. You have the permission to post your thread link in the post below so we can see it easier.</div><div><br></div><div>1. Do not give in-constructive feedback by knocking others down to build yourself up.</div><div>2. Do not steal maps; all maps are your property. Violations of this are a permanant ban.</div><div>3. Do not ghost produce; don't have other users make a map for you and you take credit.</div><div>4. Do not spam judges; patience is a large key. Wait for a response on your map.</div><div>5. Do not ghost view; don't tally a ton of thread views in your thread for attention.</div><div>6. Do not make joke maps; all maps must be true submissions to the server.</div><div>7. Do not submit maps made prior to this; all maps must be "newly produced".</div><div>8. Always give credit. No matter what the case, credit everyone who authored.</div><div><br></div><div><b>How can I create a YAML?</b></div><div>Feel free to ask out for tutorials on how to make a YAML, either from a map developer or other players on Avicus that are experienced with it. Our YAML documentation is currently up!</div><div><br></div><div><b>What is the prize?</b></div><div>The prize will be credits based on the number of map submissions. 500 credits will be added to the pot per map submission and the 1st place winner will win the credits. (Ex. If there are 5 map submissions, the prize will be 2,500 credits) The more maps entered, the bigger the prize! If there is more than one author, each author will receive the same amount of credits.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Is the spreadsheet public?</b></div><div>Not yet, it will be updated within a few hours.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><a href="https://avicus.net/forums/8d173c73c" rel="nofollow">PREVIOUS EVENT</a></div><div>NEXT EVENT</div><div><br></div><div><b>Starts;</b> July 16, 2015</div><div><b>Ends;</b> August 7, 2015 (11:59pm EST)</div><div><br></div><div>Any questions you may have, please ask below.</div>

I believe the gamemode will be in 1.8 and anytime you log into minecraft, search up banners when you're in gamemode 1. Para correct me if I'm wrong.

It's not like OCN's CTF, it's like CTW, but different. You run up to the fence post and it gives you the "flag", or wool.
