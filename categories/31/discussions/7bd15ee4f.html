Why is  Avicus not  Growing?

</h1>
Folks,<br><br>I would like to know your opinion on why Avicus is not growing and what we can do to help, and maybe the staff can chime in and let us know some things that are going on behind the scene, if they wish. <br><br>The reason for my asking is that I know with the EULA changes ( we are 25 days past the &nbsp;deadline ) some servers are not going to make it&nbsp;<i><b>( some will step up and take it to the next level and do great! Some have already made the changes and are are doing great)</b></i>, and I would hate to see Avicus go down. I also see that Avicus has never regained its stride that it once had when the name was McZone and at this rate it never will, IMO. I see other servers growing, I see other servers having so many people playing that sometimes its hard to get a game if you are not a Donator and so many players you have to turn player viability off. I see other servers already make the EULA &nbsp;changes and even add more to the content to encourage more players in the last 30 days.<br><br>I used to never play on other servers but now I do. I have a long list of reasons, but this is not a Rant page its and Idea board. I also do not feel this is out of place as, not only am I Donator, but I am also a Map contributor and a long time player , with many hours played.<br><br>I also see that many of the Avicus staff are doing all that they can, but it seems like some process, or some method in place is holding the mods back as well. For example, the map devs have been super busy posting maps, working on YMLs, and even getting the new rotations ready - as far as they can. They have gotten the community excited, but then many days pass and nothing, so we get discouraged. We even get a 2nd thread from them with a date on it as to when the Rotations should go into effect, but nothing happens, and we are well past that mark by days. I see lots of Polls about maps and game-modes, lots of Mod recognition threads, and lots of very good and quick answers to problems on the forums, but yet &nbsp;not much is getting done and not much server growth at all - it feels like we have less people... @ 10:30pm est , we had 99 people on the server the other night. Only two games mods had people Nebula and Walls, and Walls had only 1 game going. With that said, I know some servers never break 100 people online ever, but Avicus used to be near the 1000 - 1400 player mark most of the time and Avicus is the server that is not growing, and I fear will not be here as long as we would like, if we keep going like this.<br><br>Every server has a basic set of problems and each successful server over comes these obstacles, and none of them should be a crutch for reasons a Server is failing or falling when it in all respects should be growing. <br><br><b>All have :&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><br>*Every Server has to Deal with School / College back in or School / College is out.<br>*Most have a development staff of 1 or 2 - until you get in the 5000 + mark in avg. playing<br>*Every&nbsp;Server / Network&nbsp;&nbsp;has Real Life problems / Vacations / Day to Day responsibilities outside of Mine-craft<br>*Every&nbsp;Server / Network&nbsp;&nbsp;has to make Game mode choices<br>*Every&nbsp;Server / Network&nbsp;&nbsp;has to Manage a Staff of mods<br>*Every&nbsp;Server / Network&nbsp;&nbsp;has to develop a way to promote their server cost effectively<br>*Every Server / Network has to find a way to pay the bills<br>*Every Server / Network must follow the EULA<br>*The big servers have not lost much if any population - so the player-base getting tired is also not viable. Mine-craft is not a 10 year old game people are tired of playing.<br><br>So with that said, what do you think are the core problems, and what can we do to help keep our favorite server , playing strong.... Where is the Break Down....<br><br>Thanks for reading.

Interesting views.&nbsp;<br>Personally I disagree. I think the server is always growing. The other day I saw close to 600 on the server. It just all depends on timezones and what season It is.<br><br>I don't think there is any reason to worry at the moment. The fact that the server gets 200/300 different players daily is quite a feat.

I think its the lack of gamemodes since McZone always had 1000+ players all the time.

I think its cause this server Is very similar to The overcast network, and people go there because it has more gamemodes like capture the flag, destroy the core, rage (one hit kill) etc. But I think if everyone tells a friend to join we could double the amount of people playing :D

@arachadonic : We can all agree to disagree and it is fine. We do peak for a few moments here and there, but the valley is much lower than it used to be and the peaks are not nearly as high. I compare Avicus to the other servers and to past performance , not as if it is an island to itself where waves come and go naturally.<br><br>I do also agree that this is just a personal view ( my post ) of a member that would like to see game matches get back to where they once were, and have content added and enhanced to a greater level so that my favorite server will be around for a few more years.

I hate it when people don't like the new eula, the old eula said that you weren't allowed to make any money off of minecraft. You're now allowed to, so why are people mad?&nbsp;<br><br>We only have one dev (funky) and we need to improve our current gamemodes.

Most of Avicus is made up of North Americans, and Europeans (And yes Australians)<br><br>At 10:30pm EST, most people would be asleep because not all parents allow their kids to stay up that late.<br><br>In Europe at that same time, its probably about 2:00am. Again, not everyone is awake at that time.<br><br>At that time in McZone, the player count would probably be around 600, tops.<br>If you wanna play with a lot of people, I suggest that you get on around noon on a weekend. And besides, there are some people who have started school already (example people in Florida; they are already 1 week into the school year)

I've noticed this. It even seems that less players are playing now - only the regulars seem to be on this now. I rarely see the players hit 400, which is such a shame, because it deserves to have more. Maybe it's because of the lag the server gets, but this cannot really be helped. It is a lovely community and there are enough gametypes for everyone's suit. I don't see why you can't love Avicus - it's so good. Maybe we need YouTubers to showcase this server on their channel! I definitely agree with the post, and Avicus deserves more.

Also lobbies can be the thing that makes me stay on a server, i got stuck on minexplex cause of the fun lobby &gt;_&lt; so maybe have a bit more open explorable fun lobby with parkours , stuff to find then ppl would stay,also give ppl tihngs for joining , playing their first games! make it more fun! That buys more players :3

another thing that avicus could do is get cheaper ranks.. eg.<br><br><b><i>Iron</i><br>Cost: $15<br>Upgrades: Earn XP 1.0x faster<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ability to join full teams/choose<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;More kits unlocked<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;etc.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></b>just an example<b><br><br></b>

Avicus isn't growing because HG isn't here ._. I'm guessing thats also why Avicus lost a ton of players over the MC Zone &gt; Avicus Switch. HG used to be packed, so I don't know why it hasn't been brought back...

man that was an extremely nice speech. Ive been pondering about the growth of Avicus myself too, i mean, I've been here 7 months, and to some thats not much and to others its a looong time, and i always thought, that with such extraordinary effort from the staff and a nice layout, Avicus would shoot up within maybe 4 months tops but its always levelled off at a maximum of around 600 people nowadays. So you have my sic ere agreement and respect for that post man, and i hope to be able to grow my YouTube channel into something that will influence others into coming to Avicus and no I'm not trying to advertise.<br>Nice work man, if you want help with anything on the server I'm happy to lend a hand.<br>Have a good one :)

as other people said, more interactive lobbies would be good. i'm always staying in lobbies for a while when they have lots of stuff to explore. parkour that gives rewards, more lobby perks (examples from other servers are paintball guns, lobby horses, wearable things when you win tournaments or matches, holiday themed things, etc.) really helps, especially if you dont have to donate to get this stuff, and just have to earn xp to save up and get it. after im in the lobby for a while, i go to a game.
