Factions would be cool, but it would have to be on a separate server, because factions can be a very laggy gamemode with all the commands and such.

One of the best things about Avicus is that the minigames are unique. If you want factions, there are hundreds of other servers that support it.

Well maybe you could make it kind of different to all other faction server and make it like rust factions sort of thing. For those who dont know what rust is its a gun game where you build a team craft guns build a shelter and stuff. This idea could be expanded on<br><br>PS: I was originally going to make a server around dis idea but I cant leave ma laptop running 24/7 so it would be cool for this server to do it

+MetalicPenguin<br><br>I think that maybe you can hire builders and host wars like clash of clans?

In nolan's survival server there are factions there which is you get more powerful when you recruit more members sooo... I rather like to have the factions there rather than here on avicus cause it will only cause some wars and fights or worse chaos

Definately -1 as factions is a completely different type of server all together. AVICUS IS A MINIGAME SERVER!!! Also far too many servers currently have factions it's gotten ridiculous.
