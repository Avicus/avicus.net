Almost everytime i log onto avicus it crashes, its not the type of crash that everyone else was experiencing, its a different type. What happens is that i sometimes am able to do something for 2 seconds (legit) and then minecraft just stops and crashes in a sec. this is only for avicus and nothing else on my computer randomely does this. t Please help because i cant play much on avicus, and when it does work, after a while (a few hours) it starts crashing agian D: please help<br>the problem details are:<br><br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://pastebin.com/puc7V5uU">http://pastebin.com/puc7V5uU</a><br>[REDACTED]<br><b>Mod's comments:&nbsp;</b>The OP was too long with useless code. Please use pastebin instead. I'm nice, therefore I've already done it for you.

Did you remove the mods and try loading in without them? Just my first idea before I dig the code.

mods shouldn't effect it, since you can connect to other servers, unless its a hacking client of some sort... which I don't believe you would use...<br>make sure ur using minecraft 1.7.9(optifine if u want), if it still doesnt work, try deleting the version and re-running the minecraft launcher to have it re-install the specific version, and add optifine after(if u want)<br>P.S if that doesn't work, could u also paste the logs into pastebin? I'm not so good at reading crash reports D:
