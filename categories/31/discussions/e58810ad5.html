<div><b>Introduce yourself in 4 or more sentences.</b></div><div>When I started getting ranks here, barely anybody knew who I was, and I considered that an advantage. At this point, though, I guess most people know me well enough. I'm not going to repeat what I do, since you could just look at my profile.</div><div><br></div><div><b>What are your hobbies?</b></div><div>I like collecting different types of twisty puzzles (an example of which would be the rubik's cube), and learning to solve them. I don't really speedsolve anything, though.</div><div>I also have a few other hobbies but you don't really need to know about them.</div><div><br></div><div><b>What are you most excited/obsessed over at the moment?</b></div><div>I'm working on a custom twisty puzzle mod that I'm going to try to perfect and eventually sell.</div><div><br></div><div><b>What interests you the most in life?</b></div><div>There are various things, including what I stated above in the hobbies section.</div><div>In general, though, I really enjoy doing things with friends, as there's only so much loneliness that one can take.</div><div><br></div><div><b>What music/art/media do you like?</b></div><div>EDM and chiptune are ok, but I listen to many different things. I have very specific interests in terms of music, and there's a lot of popular songs that I dislike.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Where are you from?</b></div><div>New York City</div><div><br></div><div><b>What’s your favourite thing about moderating?</b></div><div>In terms of the physical act of moderating, nothing. I don't get some kind of rush from banning people, and if you are a moderator and you do actually get euphoric from punishing people, you need to rethink your priorities.&nbsp;</div><div>If the question meant, "what is my favorite thing about <i>being on the moderating team</i>", I guess it's that I have an actual say in terms of getting things done and getting changes made. There are also a few moderators who are really nice people, and whom I enjoy talking to.</div><div><br></div><div><b>What’s your most memorable experience as a moderator?</b></div><div>I got 2nd place in some kind of avicus trivia event despite everyone else being here longer than I had. (This was in 2016, when I was jr mod.)</div>
