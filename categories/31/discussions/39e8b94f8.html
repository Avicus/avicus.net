Why the heck do mods even ban for KB reducing. It's way too hard to tell if somebody is using a KB reducer on Avicus.<br>In case you haven't noticed, Avicus has the most fucked up knockback I have ever seen on any server.<br>Unless a player is screenshared and a KB reducer is found it shouldn't be bannable. <br><br>DISCUSS

Well if there is a constant amount of times that said player has reduced KB and you have evidence of it then sure, ban him for it, but if it happens once or twice then don't.<br><br>Avicus KB is fucked up but it won't give you the same kb ratio every time.

well lol it is soooooooooooooooo obvious you know dude, there is a thing called vertical knockback that you tend to take when you are using a kb modifier

This is a discussion. Keep it on topic please.<br><br>I do agree that Avicus knockback is messed up and it is hard to tell if someone is using a kb reducer. However, if the moderator has enough evidence from various occasions and not just 1 or 2 then the player should be banned and can later appeal.

Please don't go off topic. He wants to discuss this matter, so please don't post stuff like "Lego you're a hacker!"<br><br>And as far as I know if someone is suspected to use a knockback reducer he gets screen-shared or it's very obvious. As stated above you notice someone using one if they take an un-normal amount vertical knockback.

In this situation, I believe the moderator had enough evidence to ban, and decided not to screenshare.&nbsp;<br>But in my opinion, when it comes to reduced knockback, I believe the player should be screenshared, no matter what, especially when the knockback here on Avicus is pretty messed up.<br>But it all really depends on how the moderator judges the situation.

If you know what you're doing it's not hard, just look at vertical kb tbh. If they are bunny hopping they are likely hacking, not too complicated.

To an extent, I agree that screen sharing would be the best way to punish a player for KB reducer. However, if the evidence is considered to have enough proof to punish then there is no reason not too. But, a ss with the evidence would be the best thing to do.

Reduces knockback is hard to find because of other situations that might occur at that moment.&nbsp;<br><br>Ping or lag, anticheat, and more affect the KB. Aswell as the KB is indeed messed up.

It is still detectable without a screenshare and you could just record it and use that for evidence. Of course it depends on how sufficient it is but it can be detected still.

Yes, it's possible to detect, however, results may not be 100% accurate all the times. Plus, I doubt any of the players in here (Judging by how bad they are compared to people in other servers and by how dumb they're at the same time) knew how to get a functional KB modifier. Vertical kb is still a thing with or without a client here due to this server's fucked up KB, let's be realistic.

Avicus anticheat was retarded and we all know that.<br>Having no anticheat is better than before except mods don't ban on the spot anymore no matter how blatant so it's pretty stupid.<br>Get a good anticheat and spend sometime on it and people won't complain.<br><br>If we can be real with ourselves this server is poorly run and poorly developed and it's been like that since MCzone.
