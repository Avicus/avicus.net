There is a way to eat food in vanilla minecraft without actually eating. If you left click on a fence with any food then it will eat by it self. Will this get you banned or not???

Can you provide video for this? It would allow us to help determine whether it should be allowed or not.

Just because it's "in vanilla Minecraft" — bear in mind that Avicus gameplay is largely vanilla as well — doesn't mean it's not a glitch, because it still very much is. I believe you're talking about what's commonly denoted as the "fence glitch"... yeah, it isn't allowed. If at all punished, you'd most likely be warned or kicked for "abusing glitches"; banned, probably not (at first).

It's abusing a vanilla glitch, and if you do this I believe you'll be kicked after a warning.

I'm pretty sure they won't ban you for this unless you keep doing it after multiple warnings and kicks.

After looking it up on YouTube I'm going to agree because it is a glitch within the game, and that is not allowed on Avicus.

Yes, but what if they will ban you after the first time?<br>I'm 95% sure they will check for infractions/kick/warn you first<br>But sometimes a mod temp-bans you instantly<br><br><br>(Once I sweared very much in just ONE sentence and got banned for 7 days. Without warnings)

In 1.6, there was a Critical Hit glitch that was abused a lot in pvp, which was really unfair. Fence glitching is basically using NoSlowDown in a way, so don't abuse glitches because you will be punished as stated above.

Because not all players in Minecraft know about this glitch, which can be used as an unfair advantage.

On a note of glitches: Would the "shoot through corners" thing count as a glitch?<br><br>Basically, it's when someone's made a wall quickly (like in JKawesome's videos when he covers himself around a monument), but if the person moves towards one corner, then part of their body will stick out and be able to get shot (I've killed a rusher who surrounded himself on Quintus before this way.)

Pretty sure that was me if I remember correctly :/The corner glitch is just your hitbox going through the wall, so even swords can hit you, happens to me with skybridges with no floor under the wall, cause bottom corners work too.

Well it's mainly abusing a glitch if you are caught May result in the appropriate sanctions &nbsp;. Also if you mean&nbsp;<i>fast soup&nbsp;</i>which is a sort of hack you can be banned for that !

Every single server has this as an exploit (except a few), so it's technically not allowed.
