Hello everyone, this is the letter I sent to Jake when he became my successor as Community Admin. I am sending this out because if you follow the advice that I post in this letter, it will not only benefit you, but also the community. Also, I see many potential Admins, Mods, Sr Mods, etc who haven't been recognized, or shown their true potential. I want this to change. Understanding and applying what I say in this letter are not only the keys to becoming an Mod, Sr Mod, or even Admin, following these key points can help you be more successful at life in general. I am not editing this, because I don't really see the point in doing so. If you are smart enough to even have an opportunity to become an Admin, then you will figure out what I am saying. I am sorry that it is so personalized, but I want you to understand what goes through someone's head when they choose a person to become powerful.<br>Good luck.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hello to my replacement. I have not decided who you are yet, but I am in the process of choosing you. You have been chosen to replace me as Community Director for a multitude of reasons. I have been watching the Sr Mods closely ever since the opening of Avicus, and I have been doing my best to note down their qualities and problems. You have been chosen due to your outstanding performance with dealing to the community. You may not have to much experience running a server, but I hope I can help you fix this problem before you begin your journey as a Administrator. If you have questions or want feedback, feel free to message me on Skype.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My role may have been vague and unknown in the past, but I should be able to clear it up decently with you. To be honest, there aren't words or a definite definition to describe your role in the server, its whatever you make of it. I took the words “Community Manager” and described it as being the link between the people and the Admins of the server, to keep the server calm, to help the people in need, and to ALWAYS look at everything through everyones perspective (I will go into how to do all of this later in this letter). The first thing I want you to do now is decide how you want to define this role.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now, you may be confused as to why you were chosen as my successor, but trust me, it was for a good and fair reason. When I became an Admin on MC Zone I had 0 experience. I had a little bit as a Moderator, but the only other experience was being a Moderator on a 15 player faction server (less than you). I believe that within two months, you will be better than me. This server needs a more devoted player and new person to help the player count, and that is you.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You may be excited for this new promotion, and please do be, but do NOT let it get in your head. I will have you demoted if you fail to impress and do better than I did. There are a few things that I want you to know, and that will make your life 1000 times easier if you actually apply them. Some of these may seem like common sense, but are necessary in order to be successful, not only on this server, but in life.
<br>
<span>	<br>•		Be the smartest one in the room, but don’t act like it. Never be overly smart, and never think that you are the best or smartest one. Always be open to interpretation, and never ignore people.</span>
<br><span>	<br>•		“The best fighter is never angry. (Lao Tzu)” This quote will get you far in life. Anger is nothing more than an output of raw emotions that can never do good. Being angry at someone will ALWAYS cause more harm to yourself rather than your enemy. If you can maintain calm even when someone is annoying you, you will win any argument. Always stay calm, and never act on raw emotion. If this is hard for you, then always wait a day before acting on your emotions.<br></span>
<span>	<br>•		Do your job the best out of everyone. Saying that other people are slacking off with you is the worst excuse you can use. Always do your job and outperform your peers. That is the only way to be successful.<br></span>
<span>	<br>•		Don’t do other people’s jobs for them. You can help people do what they need to, but never do another’s work for them. It will almost never benefit you.<br></span>
<span>	<br>•		Never ignore another person. Its disrespectful, wrong, and you could be losing out on important information. Never block others on Skype either, you may nerve know if it will come back to haunt you. Never ignore questions, no matter how stupid they are. If they are trolling you, then call them out immediately to get them to stop.</span>
<br><span>	<br>•		Never be abused or taken advantage of. You are the highest rank on the server. Demand respect from your peers and the community. Never be afraid to take action.<br></span>
<span>	<br>•		Don't be afraid to take action when necessary. If you don't see Mods online and repots aren't getting taken care of, find out who is online. If they are just ignoring reports, then threaten to demote them. Make sure that the entire server runs smoothly and efficiently.</span>&nbsp;
<br><span>	<br>•		Perspectives are everything about this job. When you make any decision, you must look at everyone involved, effected, etc. Whatever happens to them, you must take into consideration. This is my most prized asset, and I want you to learn to develop it too.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;<br><br><span>	•<span>&nbsp;Hypocritical&nbsp;actions will only lead to revolt. If you make a rule, enforce it. And&nbsp;obviously&nbsp;don't break it.&nbsp;Don't&nbsp;treat anyone differently. Treat everyone as a player (including staff), this destroys bias when dealing with reports. No one is more special than another person, so&nbsp;don't be stupid and cause a&nbsp;revolt.<br></span></span>
<br>
Good luck,<br>
Max Gillette

I have a Moderator question.&nbsp; While I was Jr Mod, I tired to be more of a friend then a Mod.&nbsp; I tried to connect with the players using a kind of humor that the Sr Staff Team thought as immature.&nbsp; How can I help connect with players that are breaking the rules while still getting my point across?&nbsp; If I ever get another chance as Mod on this server, I won't sound too "Textbook."

It can sometimes be challenging to find a mix between "too lenient" and "too strict".<br>Try to be as friendly as you can to everyone, but also be serious when it comes to any situation where there is a rule breaker.<br>You aren't the only one who has had that problem. It may be a bit difficult, but practice makes perfect.<br>Good luck if you are reapplying!

This was very interesting, I'd have to keep this in mind if I think I'm ready when these staff applications open in a few weeks, been hoping to apply. Thanks for making this.<br>I feel it'll help a good bit of people.
