</h1>
I'm curious to see if the community has any ideas on server promotion and advertisement.<br><br>Clearly, "approaching Youtubers" isn't a good plan in the short term because nothing's happened so far, so I'm wondering if anyone has any other ideas that we could use to promote the server.<br><br>I know there's a few subreddits out there designed purely for server promotion but hardly anyone goes on there.<br><br>I need help with ideas..<br><br><b>edit</b>: A lot of people are coming up with flaws, and that's great, but providing possible solutions would be even greater!

Voting does not work and there are no substantial rewards to offer in Avicus except credits.

A thread won't kickstart it, because we've had so many threads in the past. That won't change the fact that we have ideas, but nobody is using them. This literally changes nothing in the game, nor has any of these threads changed the course of Avicus.<br><br>Sorry if I'm being harsh, but it's not enlightening the servers nor helping pave the road for anything. We have to have someone in charge who is willing to implement these ideas, not just listen to them and not give a "Hmm" response like we've been getting.

Adding gamemodes like SG, Skywars, etc will do nothing for the network like it currently is. Changing the SG type to kohi'S SG will still do nothing. The reason we still have a player base is because of gamemodes like CTW and DTM. If people are tired of it they can go play 5cp and CTF.

Something I think would work would be adding CTH, KOTH if they ever decide to add it, and maybe CTF maps to the Deathmatch rotation because that's what majority of the gameplay is for these games and Deathmatch alone is alright but some variety of similar gamemodes would be nice

Before you think of advertising you should come up with a gamemode that is good and unique. If people wanted to play these gms ocn wouldn't have died.

It's just really difficult to create a gamemode that's unique and will attract and keep players.<br>New gamemodes that aren't the normal DTM and CTW were introduced here for a while, they pretty much all didn't work<br>It will be quite the challenge

Honestly, I think we need to market ourselves as a fun and competitive obejective-based PvP network. This is really what we do, and it's unique. Also, I think players just need to spread the word to their friends. If they like what we have than they'll naturally tell other people to play. So basically what I'm saying is that we need to keep ourselves unique, but also focus on stuff that will make us appealing for new people to come to. We don't need some big ad, we need people to want to come and have their friends play too, which is a harder issue to tackle.

Like I said bfore ytb it's the biggest and easier way to adv something but u need the right YouTuber with the right public to do it, I'm pretty sure that u guys don't know him but TheRockManGamer it's a ytber from Peru he is rlly famous and he used to play and upload videos on avc bfore so if u guys talk with him I'm pretty sure that he might comeback to the srv and record there again

This thread will do nothing.<br><br>I've tried to give advice on advertising the server, but it hasn't worked. The advertising here is disorganized and no matter what we say in this thread, nothing will ultimately change that. Contrary to what you believe, advertising is not a thing that effort is being poured into and it's annoying that it seems this difficult to advertise, considering it was much, much easier to put forward an effort for advertising when I was admin (someone decided to hand off my progress to a senior that went inactive, then hand it off to more inactive people) but in terms of YouTubers not only was that set, but the people who run the advertising are inexperienced with dealing with actual advertising and marketing tactics.<br><br>I see how you're trying to help, and I want to assume that a certain someone will reply to this thread countering my points and saying "please give me suggestions", but no matter how many suggestions we give it won't change who or what is running it.<br><br>I gave up on advertising and quite a bit of the community did too, we cared and nothing was done. I've expressed this in meetings, to individuals, to documents, and over the past few years even trying to help with advertising when Gillette was admin.
