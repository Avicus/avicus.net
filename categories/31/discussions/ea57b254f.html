&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will be done with Avicus and minecraft in general. I am getting bored of it. I might get on once in a GREAT while but mainly, i'm finished. I will still be on the forums and skype though. I know some people might say "give suggestions" but honestly, I can't even think of any. I have made some great friends here. But since Bad Company has disbanded, I can't get into Avicus again. But like I said before, I'll get on sometimes. But I have gone back to the good 'ol playstation days playing with my IRL friends. To me, this is way more fun.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Another reason why i'm leaving is because (many people say this) I am spending to much time on it. I have a football tryout for the Olympics coming up. I need to get my butt in tip top shape instead of sitting in front of the computer.&nbsp;It seemed like I was in a good mood when playing it, but once I got off, I just wasn't.&nbsp;But thanks guys, for a great time.&nbsp;<br><br>Bye,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-Cedd

So, we've got about 30 minutes to get back to your place.I think that pick-up lines are for people with to much time on their hands. Let's just f**k.You have a beautiful voice. I bet it would sound even better muffled by my penis.If you can dance, you have my hand, but if you can sing, you have my heart. I hope to God you can't sing because I just wanna f**k you.That's a nice shirt. Can I talk you out of it?Hi, I'm gay. Do you think you can convert me?I'm the finger down your spine when all the lights go out.If I'm a pain in your ass... We can just add more lubricants.Life is short. Let's f**k and see if there is anything after that.Let me eat you for an hour. If you don't want to have sex after that, we won't.All those curves, and me with no brakes.[Give the person a bottle of wine or tequila] Drink this, and then call me when you're ready.Hi, will you help me find my lost puppy? I think he went into this cheap motel room across the street.I'm trying to determine after years of therapy and lots of testing, whether or not I'm allergic to sex.[Walk into her chest] "If they weren't sooo large, it wouldn't have happened!"How much will $20 get me?Roses are red, violets are blue, I suck at pick up lines... nice tits.Want to spend the night at my house tonight? The couch may not pull out, but I do.So, come back to my place, and if you don't like it I swear I'll give you a full refund.What are you doing tonight? Besides me, of course?Will you be my girlfrien? I left out the 'd' cause you'll get that later!My name is Skittles... wanna taste my rainbow?Are those pants on sale? Cause they're 100% off at my place!I'm with the TSA and I need to perform a full body cavity search, for security reasons.Can I be the wiener in your hotdog?I only have 12 hours to live... please don't let me die a virgin.I'm bigger and better than the Titantic - only 200 women went down on that vessel!What is a nice girl like you doing in a dirty mind like mine?What has 132 teeth and holds back the Incredible Hulk? My zipper.With my IQ and your body, we could make a race of superchildren and conquer the earth!You remind me of a crop, because I wanna plow you.I have the entire dictionary written on my dick. Want me to put some words in your mouth??The FBI wants to steal my penis. Can I hide it inside you?<span>You wanna go out this weekend?<br>[Sorry, I have a boyfriend]<br>I have a math test tomorrow<br>[What?]<br>Oh, I thought we were talking about things we could both cheat on!</span>Are those space pants? Cuz your ass is out of this world!

sorry bmb, I've got to get ready for some miserable thing about to start soon...school, last year i was barely pulling off b's. Almost every quarter I had a F through almost the whole thing. It's because of playing this. I need to give full attention to school if I want to get into college (mainly trying to get into college to get scouted into professional football) and video call with... my girlfriend

:) Thanks Jozz, same goes for you, you have been a great friend and it's been great knowing you. The reason I am trying out for the Olympic development team is so maybe I can get scouted for the next World Cup. I will be 17 then. The likeliness isn't very high since I will be young still, but you never know. And I will stop by every once in a while :)
