Hello,<br><br>Recently, an immense amount of community members have been attempting to bypass our death threat rule by saying "kill yourselfie." This is honestly disappointing behavior that will not be tolerated. Staff members will continue to punish as usual with no exceptions to this rule. A one-week grace period will be in place where staff members should issue a warn before any punishment regarding these matters, but after it passes, immediate punishments will be given. Thanks.<br><br>Regards,<br>Senior Staff

A few users have been caught saying such things, I do not want to breach their confidentiality. However, they said the exact same thing as quoted in this post. They have received a punishment, and henceforth, we are addressing this issue.

Well, I thought it was going to be smooth sailing for a while, but NOPE. And to those people who have said something like this, I have a quote from a previous Avicus thread pertaining to the same issue addressed here:<br>"Did you maybe ever think for a slight second that this person might actually do it? How would you live with yourself afterwards?"<br>-FrozenSolstice, I believe. <br>And yes I know the quote is kinda cliche, but I know at least I would feel no emotion but guilt if I ever knew that I was the cause of a suicide.<br><br>If it's because you're having a bad day ingame or just a bad day in general, and are just purely annoyed at the game/life/whatever, let your frustration out in ways other than telling people to kill themselves.<br><br>Also, please don't start a flame war on this thread...it hasn't happened yet, but I have a bad feeling that one's going to erupt soon due to the nature of it...

We're not accusing every single player of using it in that manner, but it will be used by some to bypass the rule indefinitely. Even a server like Kohi, with the most toxic chat out of any MC I've seen does not tolerate suicide encouragement and does not put up with bypasses, loopholes and technicalities. The whole point of this is to make it public the loophole is shutting and we're putting our foot down as a staff team, which is a step in the right direction if you ask me, since the whole loophole game has gone on far too long.

As someone who once knew a victim of cyber bullying, all I ask is that you respect these boundaries. I know you may think playfully bypassing the rules is harmless and isn't going to affect anyone, but trust me, it takes a huge fucking impact on some people. You don't know what they're going through. A simple trigger is all it takes.
<br><br>
In memory &amp; honour of my friend and all those out there who have been victims of it, please, just don't do it. It's not hard. If being a troll over such a matter is something you can't resist then I think you need a bit of help.

Doesn't matter, consequences should be the same. If I told you to kill yourself, or in this case, "kill your selfie" would you care to notice if I said this due to rage or if I wanted to say it because I felt like it? Does it change the outcome either way?

Yeah I agree with you on that.<br><br>The handbook is a real life example I was using to the avicus rules. You should be able to find it, since it's broadcasted and told to players. If you still can't find it, staff can direct you.

I don't see it broadcasted, or it's just me. All I see is the message to join the forums, the Walls tournament, and the discount for ranks. And exactly what I mean, "told to players" &nbsp;in the form of a warn. Right now, excluding the grace period, it's a straight out ban.

That takes initiative.

Read my edit<br>And it's the majority. I'm sure it would it be fun to get banned off a server you liked for something you didn't know was so severe.<br>Tbh, when I join a new server, I usually don't ask for the rules. I don't think it's just me.

Hacking is regarded universally on most servers as illegal, it's logically not allowed. This on the other hand, some servers aren't so particular, some servers allow it and some don't, because this is the internet and the online world.

This is the internet, you should expect verbal abuse and all that kind of stuff. So you would expect it to be somewhat allowed. Of course, you say it on this server, whether you meant it or not, you get punished.

LMAO<br><br>It is ridiculous. But look at it this way. What about all these poor kids (I'm talking just hitting teen years or younger than me anyway - 17) who solely depend on insta, facey and other garbage as their main port of communication. They're reliant on this, which is stupid in and of itself which is why the term was coined.
