For a starter, try Sword Art Online. I prefer the english dub but the Japanese &nbsp;version with subtitles is rad too. Its on netflix, but if you don't have netflix, ye better be looking for other LEGAL sources, yarrrrrr.

If you like thriller/horror over action I'd go with Steins;Gate, Another, or Ergo Proxy. If you're more into action I personally enjoyed Durarara!! and Accel World (only watched first episode so idek).

Did you just ask for a 2 on 1? cuz SAO is lyfe, not gonna lie i basically watch it everyday more than any other anime on my phone cuz my friend at school gave me all the copies of all episodes from season 1 and 2 and its something which many like me could look forward to that might happen in the future, w/ the way technology is fast-developing today, u never know, by 2022, Sword Art Online could actually happen and become a thing, many might even give up on playing PC, console games, etc. just for Full Dive Virtual Worlds

anyways, i recommend<br><br>- Sword Art Online I and II (action, abit of romance, harem, for them gaming feelers)<br>- Date a Live I and II (alot of fanservice YESSS!)<br>- Akame Ga Kill (dark fantasy, action, abit of romance, somewhat harem)<br>- Nisekoi I and II (alot of fanservice YESSS!) (season 2 is ongoing in sub)<br>- Attack on Titan (action, dark fantasy i guess)<br>- Black Bullet (for those "I &lt;3 Loli's")<br>- Tokyo Ghoul (horror but still great, if you can't stand alot of blood and cannibalism, watch the censored version)<br>- im not gonna put anymore cuz most of what was recommended by my friends at school were Hentai-Material, ecchi, yaoi, yuri, etc.

yeah, they kinda went overboard and just had it like Kirito-Asuna 24/7 from episode 8-14<br>and it made the 1st arc (sequence/ 1st half of a season) go way to fast, after the death of the Moonlit<br>Black Cats from June 2023, it skipped all the way to December 2023 which wasted alot of potential in<br>that time period, then came ALO which was actually pretty great, besides the fact that the antagonist<br>was full blown pervert-bastard and when Asuna got M*l***ed in ep 24, i just sat there and went like<br>"wtf did i just watch" and "was that really neccasary?"

it wasnt as bad overall, tbh the main idea of having the anime itself take place in a Virtual World for gamers like us and them sets the mood really good and its something different and also something which could happen in the future, i myself wouldnt care if i got trapped in a game for 2 years, besides the part i would die IRL if i died ingame but other than that i really wouldnt care xP

Is it just me or is one of the main themes of anime giving women huge breasts. It is really common in many of the shows.

Surprised no one has mentioned Angel Beats (if you have then my bad) but it's a really great show containing, some slices of comedy, romance, and trains. Feel trains. The most dangerous type of trains. I'd mention more, but I've either forgotten them, or are just a bit too perverted.

Here are some recommended animes for you to take a look at.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Sword Art Online-&nbsp;</b>As stated before, yes this is a very overrated anime and imo its pretty bad (as in story plot wise) but other than that, it is a pretty enjoyable anime (depending on how you look on it)<br><b>Attack on Titan</b>- Bit bloody and gorey but if oyur k with that, this anime is right for you. It is not overrated to an extent but its still pretty cool and enjoyable to watch. You might hate the main character and some characters are flat in the series but its great though. Another problem is there is a lot of plot holes (but reading the manga does fill up some plot holes but even the manga itself makes up more plot holes -_-)<br><b>FMA Brotherhood (Fullmetal Alchemist) -&nbsp;</b>One of the classics and argueably the best animes. PRetty dope story plot and I guarantee you will enjoy this if your in to action<br><b>Nisekoi-&nbsp;</b>Nisekoi is a romance/harem anime that it is a pretty enjoyable anime to watch. Very funny anime to watch but its plot kinda is bad because there is A LOT of fillers and the plot seems to get nowhere. Just a heads up<br><b>AngelBeats-&nbsp;</b>Sort of overrated anime but Imo, its better than SAO. Pretty sad in the end and it is a shame it lasted 12 episodes but the plot is really good. ITs funny, theres action, feels, its a good starter anime imo. The only con i would give is the producers did not give as much episodes to futher develop their characters but pretty sick Anime<br><b>FairyTail-&nbsp;</b>Kinda long anime series (and still airing) but Fairy Tail is a great anime. IT is very funny, the plot is REALLY good. (Yes a bit repeptitve but hey its like 200 ep long so what do you expect :/) and you may get feels even just by listening to the soundtrack. Also, there is barely any fillers in this anime so good to watch. If you want to watch a long term anime series, go watch Fairy Tail (and i Highly suggest you read the manga)<br><br>Animes to stay away from till you already watched enough- Now I know, some of these animes I would list would be arguable but i put these because some viewers may not understand or get lost.<br><br><b>Clannad-&nbsp;</b>Clannad, IMO, is a very good anime, good romance and much feels (if your patient). I do not recommend this anime only if you do not want to watch long dialogues and you like face-paced shows<br><b>Daily Life of High School Boys-&nbsp;</b>IT is a pretty hilarious anime as it shows a daily life of a high school boy. This anime is an iffy because if you were to watch this and this would be the first time watching anime , you &nbsp;most likely get lost and not get the jokes<br><b>My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU-&nbsp;</b>Good anime series but you might not get it. Idk its optional<br><b>Lucky Star-&nbsp;</b>^same reason stated above<br><b>Naruto-&nbsp;</b>ITs your choice but it is REALLLY Long so watch it if your patient. Still good though.<br><b>One Piece-&nbsp;</b>^again<br><b>School Days-&nbsp;</b>you will see why<br><b>Boko no Pico-&nbsp;</b>STAY AWAY (but som r8's 11/10 4 dank memes) (also its a hentai)<br><br><br>That is my suggestions of some animes. Here is some additional websites to help you watch your anime series i guess :/<br><br><br>MyAnimeList: Keep track of animes and have some additional info on animes you watch:&nbsp;<a href="http://myanimelist.net/" title="Link: http://myanimelist.net/">http://myanimelist.net/</a><br><br>Kissanime.com: Watch anime there-&nbsp;<a href="http://kissanime.com/" title="Link: http://kissanime.com/">http://kissanime.com/</a><br><br>Hope I help
