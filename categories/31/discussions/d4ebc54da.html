It all seems so quick. I came on to avicus just over a year ago, and man has it been quite the experience! I have decided to take a break from avicus. I will be no longer playing any more minecraft. Video games have really got in the way in my life. I can't spend all my time playing video games, and wasting valuable time to improve on being the person who I am. Being part of the community, I'm really gonna miss you guys! I will never forget all the wonderful people I met and all the great friends that I have made! Thank you to Strafes_/Jkawesome/RefuseToSync for being such a great friend and inspiration. Thank you to FluenZa_ for being such a wonderful person, and for always being kind and generous. There are so many people I have to thank, that I just want to thank everyone that knows me, for being such awesome people. It's because of you guys, that I stayed on this wonderful server for so long.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; I'll truly miss a lot of the wonderful things iv'e learned while playing on avicus. Coming into avicus, I was horrible at pvp, and couldn't get any kills. Coming out of avicus, I have earned three prestiges, and really have a better knowledge of pvp and strafing. Thank you: Emmaye, Sunrise, RefuseToSink, and Peacheh, for being such wonderful inspiration for me! I have learned so much from your styles of pvp and I have truly been grateful for getting to know all of you. Thank you to Strafes_, Sfkwww, and Yaky, for being such awesome inspiration for helping me become a better rusher! I'm so grateful that I have gotten to know you guys!<br><br>Lastly, I will truly miss all the wonderful memories of gameplay. I will never forget the memories of prestige, kills, and monument breaks. I will miss all the creatively designed maps and the creators of those maps, whom gave me inspiration to become a better builder! i would like to thank iMercury, and Tanpopo for being such awesome inspiration. It's because of people like you, that I have become a better builder, and have really appreciated the process of building.&nbsp;<br><br>So yeah! That is pretty much it guys! I love you all! I'll stay active on forums, and I am open to say hi to anyone! My skype is: shamrocky_&nbsp;<br><br>I will truly miss everyone, and I wish everyone the best of luck in your lives!<br><br>Peace<br><br><br>Sombrero
