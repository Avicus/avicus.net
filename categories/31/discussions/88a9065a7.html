As many of you know, today a lot of people aren't legit. Some use a certain client others use macros.<br>While playing scrims from time to time, there is usually one or two callouts on a player, basically they think someone hack on the opponents team.<br>I belive it would be good if people could request a staff member which is very experienced&nbsp;with clients and minecraft modifications to screenshare people after games in the tournament. Basically, once the game is over a referee will ask, "would you like us to screenshare anyone?" If we respond no, nothing will be done, if we respond yes, and tell the referee the IGN of this person, that person may not leave the server without getting his team DQed. Once the staff have screenshared him and been thorugh his minecraft folders, and give him permission to leave, he may do so.&nbsp;<br>If staff finds anything, his team will get DQed.<br><br>Just a small idea that could be good.

Program used purely to screenshare, but it doesn't show IPs. It is much more safer than using Skype where if a player gets disqualified, &nbsp;atleast the tournament staff member is safer.

This should be done on join.me. The only thing is, no one on the current staff team would be able to find a ghost client, I guarantee that. They need to get someone to teach the staff how to screenshare. However, not a lot of people would be knowledgeable in this subject. I can think of only a couple of people who could find a ghost client, and I can think of ihze, DGB and myself off of the top of my head.&nbsp;<br><br>I would be happy if this was implemented only if the whole team weren't DQed if someone was caught, he was only permanently banned and the match was replayed. It is not fair for the whole team to be punished for one person who they didn't know was hacking. The whole team should only be DQed if the player refuses or if the player logs off.

It's a good idea, but you do know people can disable the hacks while in game, they don't necessarily have to switch over to the new client.

I screenshare players all the time on kohi, so I know how to utilize the ss session to locate clients and/or illegal modifications. Training the tournament staff in that area would also be on the to-do list.

For those of you who don't really understand screen sharing involves, &nbsp;single player commands checking, checking any external macros, via USB or SSD, checking any mouse driver for macros and steer mouse for mac users, looking inside any "recognised mod's" e.g: togglesneak&nbsp;to check there is no client hidden in there, checking recycle bin etc. It isn't just looking at their minecraft&nbsp;ingame and looking for a client's GUI.&nbsp;<br><br>IMO this would be brilliant and i would love for it to happen, however i think this should be done before a tourney and only have the player DQ'ed as it's not the teams fault if one player is cheating without the rest of the members knowledge.

That's why you make sure teammates don't hack. "You wins as a team, you lose as a team." One teammate hacks the rest goes down as well, makes the people that have some common sense read the rules and not hack.

Then get a player who don't need to leave after. If you accept to play in the tournament, and this suggestion gets confirmed you should be ready to put down extra time.

Same here.&nbsp;<br><br>Anyway... my computer is a shared computer, my parents use it, so theres some pretty private files there. I also clear my recycle bin regularly because it will lag and fill my storage if there is a lot of files. Seems like an invasion of privacy to me.<br>There's just too many flaws

I feel like this would be abused a lot and teams would be DQ'd rather regularly for players disconnecting. Also it makes ddosing op, instead of ddosing a whole team to get a no show just ddos a single player and accuse him of hacks. Tournament staff should be competent enough to detect hacks without this.<br><br>I instead reccomend all refs, officials and advisors record their perspectives of the match, if a team believes a player hacks they can inform the tourney staff and have the footage reviewed.

This shouldn't be a mandatory thing, it should be done when a player is accused of hacking or a staff members suspects them, not to every random person.

Lie more, you said you got "falsely" banned for "hacking" and now you're telling me you had an issue with Ritsu.

what would happen if you accused the entire team of hacking just because you lost? would officials have to try and check all them?
