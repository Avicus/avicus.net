You're on an amazing killstreak. &nbsp;You destroy everyone in your path, and you've taken down two out ouf four monuments--single handedly. &nbsp;Then, that one person to whom you weren't paying enough attention to notice that they were coming up behind you hits you once, and you fly off the map.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>F*CK<br><br></b>you scream in the chat.<br><b><br></b><b></b>Why did you do it?<br>I don't want this thread to be a discussion about whether swearing is acceptable or unacceptable; we've already all shared our opinions about that in various other threads. &nbsp;I want to know the answer to one simple question: &nbsp;why? &nbsp;Explain your reasoning below.

i honestly dont know why. i do occasionally swear, if it's the situation you're talking about its cause i knew i was super close and if i dont swear i just get disappointed irl for a couple minutes, but when i swear it kinda relieves that. i think its worth it. i try not to swear at people, but if you look at my infractions list you can see i have. but 99% of those infractions are because someone was being homophobic, sexist, racist etc or just being rly rude in the first place.

It's sort of a reflex to get anger out.&nbsp;<br><br>On a side note, someone did a study in which two groups of people were too keep their hands in a bowl of freezing water for as long as they could. One group was told to remain silent and the other was told they could swear as much as they wanted. On average the swearing group was able to last twice as long with hands in the water as the silent group. This isn't related, I just wanted to share it.

It's been proven that swearing is a much more passionate form of language to us. Swearing even comes from a completely different part of your brain than normal speech, and so we don't really think of them as words that mean something, only an explanation. We've been taught throughout our lives that these words are bad, and so we often attribute them to bad experiences or feelings. Getting hit out of the world while on a kill streak triggers that in people, and causes them to swear.

Honestly, screaming vulgarities in chat isn't going to help you get back and turn back the clock where you can avoid being killed. Just hold it in yourself, don't scream in chat, that way things will be better ;)

all in all though, i really need to stress that the rule shouldnt be so black and white- in many cases, swearing is acceptable, and in some it is harmful and annoying. there are so many variables that come into account. the players doing the swearing, the context, and (very importantly) the biases of the staff dealing out the punishments (yes, you have biases when dealing out punishments whether you like it or not, concious or subconciously) it really should be on a case by case basis, a black and white no swearing rule doesnt help. (sorry, i know this wasnt the intention of the thread but i had to add my final opinion)

I mostly play walls now, and when I die, I usually just kinda stare at the screen and wonder about how I managed to get so outplayed, because it's usually my fault. &nbsp;As to why, I dunno. &nbsp;It's easier to type f*ck than "Man that was nonsense and I am angry that you have dispatched me in this virtual game."

its rather odd to swear in real life where there's no context as opposed to swearing in the place it makes sense. also its such a beautiful thing to have someone swear when you kill them, why not do the same for ppl who are able to kill you :)

I generally never swear in real life. In the game when I fall out of the world I say "dang", or "lel or lol", or "..." or something like that. When I get angry like when I'm about to try to destroy a monument I say "jdfaklejoiujkflasdjfsoadfpia" or "fudge" or something like that which still isn't that harmful.

I'm completely aware of all of the studies. &nbsp;But the studies have shown that you actually have to&nbsp;<i>speak</i> it, not type it. &nbsp;So I'm trying to understand the psychology behind this.

I usually just type "FFS", "FML", or "..." when I'm pissed off. I don't know why I do it, I guess it's just to let others know I'm upset. If I get really mad though, I smash my desk and it really does help me relieve myself. If I try to keep my anger inside, I'll end up rage quitting. I've never broken anything BTW.

I really don't swear in IRL or in chat because it's not good to (kinda with my religion) and my mom would kill me anyway :P, but if I get mad I usually just sit in spawn and go on the Internet for a couple of minutes until I calm down.

So it seems like I'm seeing that, for the most part, the people that are posting on this topic&nbsp;<i>aren't&nbsp;</i>the ones that swear in chat. &nbsp;I want to hear more from those that do!

Yo when I cuss it aint really aimed at nobody it's just blended in with the way I type/talk, that's wut I was getting at.&nbsp;<br>Like if I was playing (been a while :3) and I let Juano kill me I might say something, and that might happen to have cussing at it, but it's for no particular reason besides it just being how my speech is.<br>I would give examples but nah, that's not exactly suitable atm XD

I swear becuz I can. Minecraft's just a damn game, don't know why you would get angry with it. Someone kills you and ends your streak, just brush it off and keep playing.<br><br><br>Whats the reason to blaze the chat with your nonsensical behavior?

When I played on Avicus (before where I was on almost every day o-o) I never swore. I had gotten so used to the atmosphere of everyone else not swearing that I just stopped doing it myself expect for the occasional "sh*t" or "dammit" but I would never type it in chat. ^-^ But ever since I've stopped playing AV I kinda, started cussing again._. but I don't type it in chat (still) and I'm trying to stop cussing. Like I did, when I was playing before &gt;_&gt;

I rarely swear in real life, but I swear in Minecraft because it doesn't matter to me and I can pretty say whatever I want on the internet.

TOTALLY agree with the whole beauty of the Internet thing. I just wonder if this is the right place for all these...different forms of expression. I mean, take it to Facebook, Tumblr (if anyone here saw my Tumblr...), Twitter, Reddit, or pretty much anywhere else. Because it's implicit in those sites that there will be adult content and/or mild language. But here there's no such warning.
