How do you guys think Disney will do on the new movies? As long as Mickey isn't Luke Skywalker, I think they'll be ok....

Think about a G rated Star Wars :|&nbsp;I don'thave be high hopes, but I'm still gonna watch it. Along with "Rebels" the new Star Wars cartoon that's gonna be on Disney XD. It will NOT be as good as The Clone Wars series but I'll give it a try

I actually don't think that it will be that bad. Remember Pirates of the Carribean was a disney movie and I dont remember it having anything about mickey mouse.

Disney is mainly centered towards children. Star Wars, especially Episodes 1-3 , were pretty dark. I don't believe that Disney will be able to properly make a Star Wars movie that will satisfy fans WHILE keeping true to the original Star Wars themes and emotions

I'm a bit skeptical, but Disney has made a few dark movies in the past and I believe they are making a (seemingly) dark movie right now.<br><br>But then again... it's Disney :T

The Complete Saga was weird....I didn't like how they gave Jar Jar a fricking gun...i would buy the 2 games separately. Also, the second games casino is soooo bland! I like Dexter's Casino that id in the first game.
