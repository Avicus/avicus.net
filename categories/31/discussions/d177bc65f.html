Hello everyone,&nbsp;<br><br>Earlier today I pushed out a much needed update to the current badge shop in the hub. Before, if you may recall, it was a cluttered mess and some old badges were missing,<br><br>This update brings the total number of possible badges to <b>45</b> and also brings back some old favorites.&nbsp;<br><br>The shop has also been organized so that each badge is selected and then a list of possible colors is displayed.&nbsp;<br><br>Also, prices have been lowered some.<br><br>Here's some pictures:<br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/U7jE3me.png"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/TmDW31R.png" title="Image: http://i.imgur.com/TmDW31R.png"><br><br>A full list of all of our badges can be found <a href="https://gist.github.com/AustinLMayes/26be74ae74862a86ab3998ee43b815ef" rel="nofollow" title="Link: https://gist.github.com/AustinLMayes/26be74ae74862a86ab3998ee43b815ef">here</a>.<br><br>I've also added back rewards for the unlucky players who do not win the match.<br>This logic uses the same basic stats as the rewards for being on the winning team, just with a lower range of rewards.<br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/tblVtG5.png" title="Image: http://i.imgur.com/tblVtG5.png"><br><br>Thanks,<br>ALM

does this include the ability for single letters? I'd like that feature if it isnt too out of place.

I've also added back rewards for the unlucky players who do not win the match.<br>This logic uses the same basic stats as the rewards for being on the winning team, just with a lower range of rewards.<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/tblVtG5.png">

The reason this isn't a thing is because players could use this to bypass name rules.<br><br>Let's say my name was ucku and I bought an F badge.

When you win a 500,000 credit giveaway then they add more badges after you've spent them all.<br><br>-Imagine something really triggering here, whatever you want-

Gadgets shouldn't be top priority you need to be fixing scrim servers if you want players on the server and&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/avicus/issues/issues" title="Link: https://github.com/avicus/issues/issues">https://github.com/avicus/issues/issues</a>

Thanks for taking the time to add more badges!!<br><br>Edit: Can I make a request? It'd be super neat if there was a way to see a demo/example of your IGN next to each symbol to see how it will look before buying :P
