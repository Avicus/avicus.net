Hi, so I played the server a couple years back and it had a ton of players. I quit for a couple years for other things and I come back now avicus doesn't have much players anymore or something. A lot of games I see don't even have players in them and the most popular seems to be my favorite Nebula. What happened to all the players? ._.

A lot of things changed. It's been a bumpy road and a lot of the veterans left.

We aren't &nbsp;keeping new players, I joined right before it went way downhill, (before avicore update). &nbsp;But new players join and get no choices of game modes, because only nebula plays, walls occasionally happens and cth happens every now and then. &nbsp;No nexus, no arcade (which isn't even up currently), no sg. &nbsp;And as less players came back, the more these game modes died out. &nbsp;<br><br>People get older and leave, that happens, we can't withhold the same people forever. &nbsp;But we are not getting new people in their place due to bad first impression. &nbsp;So that's why the numbers dropped
