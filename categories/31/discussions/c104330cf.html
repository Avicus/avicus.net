The down side of ios is the fact that developers, like me, have to purchase licenses in order to post our creations. Also another bad thing about ios is that in order to get the software you need to purchase an apple mobile device which in turn is another gimmick to give apple more money.

Mac's are good for certain things, OSX is more stable then windows and OSX has better applications for professional use. That being said in order to purchase OSX you need to buy an apple device and when it comes to gaming OSX isnt good.

Android all the way. Tonnes more freedom. Plenty more apps, and especially more free ones :P<br>And no, &nbsp;Apple are not way ahead with mobile devices, if anything, they are way behind. The iPhone 5s is just as good as a Nexus 4 released in 2012. iPhones only just got their first 1080p phone this year, while Android has had them for a while now :P.

iOS. It offers simplicity, extensive functionality, and the best quality apps in the App Store. Literally anyone could learn the UI in seconds. It took my sister about five seconds to figure it out when she was two years old, compared to a Samsung Galaxy, which even I still have trouble finding my way around on. I've used an iPhone since it came out in 2007, and never once have I longed for more features, because the functionality bundled with the iPhone is more than enough, at least on an iPod and iPhone. I do wish that iPads could support more though, perhaps even running OS X on it.

Android, they have wayyy better tweaks &amp; cool stuff &amp; settings &amp; other stuff then apple does, I had an iPhone 4S for a year, now I have the LG G3 phone which runs Android, and in my opinion Android is better than Apple.<br><b>EDIT:</b> They also have less bugs :P

I find that the android will have problems depending on who made it while ios also can't download stuff from the Internet but that also protects it from viruses as I am pretty sure I have ad ware on my Android

Personally I would choose Android.<br><br>Overall iOS looks much nicer and cleaner in my opinion, and operates more smoothly than many android devices, although they might not run 'better' or more efficiently. Also, the 'cracking' between the two is HUGE. When jailbreaking an iOS device it's so much easier, and installing tweaks seems much easier than when on Android. But the largest difference is what the cracks can do.&nbsp;<br><br>Over the weekend a friend of mine was speaking to me about switching over from an iPhone to Android, and was asking me about some of the benefits of doing so. One of the pros I mentioned to him in regards to having an Android device is having the ability to root the phone. After asking me a few questions about it, his response was "ok yeah, but I can also jailbreak my iPhone, so no big difference there“. Lots of users, both Android and IOS alike, actually don't know that there is a very big difference between the IOS jailbreak and Android root access. You can't actually "jailbreak" Android&nbsp;or "root" IOS.&nbsp;<br><span><br>Here is the&nbsp;simplest&nbsp;way to explain this as I can currently think of. Think of it like the Matrix:&nbsp;Jailbreaking is comparable to what Morpheus could do. He could bend the rules of the system to overcome certain restrictions, but was still bound to its rules. Rooting is what Neo could do. Not only could he bend the rules, he could completely break them (my God that was a slick analogy).<br><br>So in the end I am going to go for Android, as rooting my device is a huge part of my phone.<br><br><br></span>
