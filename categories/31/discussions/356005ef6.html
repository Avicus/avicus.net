Hello, everyone. I'd like to discuss a few topics that have been brought up on many, many separate occasions.<br><br>The activity on the forums recently has been wretched. I'm not sure if you all have noticed it, but the amount of spam threads, repeated threads, bumping, etc. It&nbsp;<b>has to stop</b>. Just because there may not be as many staff members on the forums as there are in game, this does&nbsp;<b>not</b> mean you have the ability to break the rules. Swearing, spamming, being rude to others, will&nbsp;<b>not be tolerated.</b><br><br>Consider the entire Avicus Forum Community warned. We've been far too lenient on the forums, and that's going to come to an end very soon. Yeah, having fun is important. The forum is a place where you can chat, and have fun with the members of the community. However, the amount of "show your face" "favorite song" or "who's the best at PvP?" sort of threads, is annoyingly large.&nbsp;<br><br>It's basically based off of common sense. If you post a topic under "Avicus Lounge" that is completely irrelevant to Avicus, that's considered a spam topic. If a topic has let's say... A title such as "This is very important" and the actual thread message is "hey" that is considered spam. By repeated threads, I mean if you decide to make a thread that's almost exactly the same as one that has already been made at least four times before... Don't make the thread. It gets really annoying scrolling through the forums seeing the recent discussion section filled up with the same thread, created by multiple different players.&nbsp;And the rest of the rules are basically self explanatory... Don't be rude, don't harass one another, etc. Basic Avicus in game rules.<br><br>I know I've always been a very lenient staff member, and I'm sure you all know that I'm the kind of guy who loves to have fun. None of that is going to change, either. But the staff on multiple occasions have noticed spam threads, repeated threads, etc. A&nbsp;<b>lot&nbsp;</b>lately. To sum it up, consider this your&nbsp;<i>final warning.&nbsp;</i>If any more rule breaking is to continue, (<i>Avicus regulars, you know who you are; and so do we)&nbsp;</i>forum bans are a possibility.<br><br>Regards, -Jake

I don't mean to sound condescending here, and I don't have any authority to say this, but it's just my personal opinion to add onto what Jake said:<br><br>Posting "this is a spam thread" and so on, however well meaning your intentions are, is just plain annoying, and in fact just make the thread even more spammer when 3 different people say it. If the staff deem a topic unnecessary or spam, I'm sure they will deal with it.<br><br>Also regarding bumping threads; if a player bumps a thread for a legitimate reason so as not to have to create a whole new topic, please don't just reply "dat bump" or such, unless of course the bump is irrelevant or unnecessary. I'd rather player's revived old threads that were relevant than creating new ones every few weeks.<br><br>Don't be discouraged from posting, but just think about whether it's necessary or not. Regards, Blue.

Is it possible to introduce a Title-Tag-System? Like for Maps [Nexus], [Nebula DTM], [Avicade Red Alert] and so on. Or for questions [Question], forums games [Games], and so on.

If you're topics were locked, it's very likely they were locked for a legitimate reason.<br>A spam topic serves no real purpose, or is just unnecessary.

honestly, the forums is pretty much made of stupid games, AMAs, maps, and quick questions from non regs. people attack each other for making a thread that asks for peoples opinions. and its not just players, the staff always meddle. i can see that dopey topics are easy to moderate and arguments dont break out as often. but for a public forum that attempts to censor peoples opinions is kinda nutty.<br><br>just my 2 cents
