On multiple accounts he has been banned for hacks. Plus ban evading is against the rules.

to be honest avicus should start ip banning... when someone gets banned do an ip ban so anyone on his ip won't be able to get on... it is way more helpful and will stop all of this nonsense

Proxies.....<br><br>And a system like that wouldn't work, for example if my sister has an account and she uses my computer to play on Avicus, she also gets banned even though she didn't do anything.

it was unjust.. since he wasn't hacking. Although it was still wrong for him to ban evade... it was for a good reason. The staff probably felt sympathy and unbanned his main... since he's so dedicated to avicus :P
