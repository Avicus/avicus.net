As roman said no harm is trying But if you do get it appealed, I would maybe try actually following the rules or next time the ban could be forever.

Guys.<br><br>I realize that some of you haven't had the best experiences with Yoshi, but he's been around for a while and he at least deserves a proper good-bye. He has made friends with many people on the server, and I am one of them. There is no reason for you to bother him and others about his mistakes. If you have anything bad to say about him, simply don't say it.<br>(I'm not trying to be biased or anything, but Yoshi doesn't deserve the hate he's getting.)<br><br>Anyways, it's sad to see you go, Yoshi.

Guys.<br><br>I realize that some of you haven't had the best experiences with Yoshi, but he's been around for a while and he at least deserves a proper good-bye. He has made friends with many people on the server, and I am one of them. There is no reason for you to bother him and others about his mistakes. If you have anything bad to say about him, simply don't say it.<br>(I'm not trying to be biased or anything, but Yoshi doesn't deserve the hate he's getting.)<br><br>Anyways, it's sad to see you go, Yoshi. I wish you the best in your future &lt;3
</blockquote>
</div>
+1&nbsp;<br><br>At least have the balls to not be salty and give him a proper goodbye as a long-time community member. He doesn't deserve this sort of hate on his leaving post. It straight out disgusts me that anyone has the nerve to be so impolite to someone who was such a big part of the community on their final post, final hour.&nbsp;<br><br>Anyways, GL man and when I go on OCN sometimes I hope to see you. Even though I don't go on OCN that much. Thanks for the great times. got that Scorpio sweg doe (such pwnage that game). Best of luck with your future! Farewell my friend!

Thank you for stating the facts in a proper manner. I'm not gonna appeal due to the fact that I obviously don't learn and that it would be harmful to the server environment according to some people.
