"Rip Barca and the win streak"<br><br>What are you talking about lol? They lost to Real Madrid and Sociedad during the last few weeks. No win streak to be seen buddy boy.&nbsp;<br><br>Oh yeah, not to mention I saw this coming. They've had poor form over the week after losing those matches. Not only was it an away game for them, but it was after consecutive loses (in La Liga not UCL) in games that they should've won. Griezmann's been a God, not to mention Oblak and pretty much the rest of Atletico, but definitely deserved man of the match. Even though I'm a Real Madrid fan, I'd rather see Barca go down than Atletico.
