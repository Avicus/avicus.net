Hello<br><br>I believe that the All Star game went quite smoothly, however I would like everyone else's opinion. We are aware that the media aspect was very unorganised, having the streamer we wanted not being able to make it, and then having our backup streamer banned in the middle of the game. There will be most of the game coming out from a spectators point of view (Spookeh's I believe) so you guys can see. The problems we encountered were:<br><ul><li>Jive who was recording had to go</li><li>My recording corrupted</li><li>Lego ran out of hard drive space</li><li>Our main streamer couldn't make it</li><li>Our backup streamer got banned.</li></ul>In the comments below, please post what you thought went well, and what could've been improved. We will be hosting another event next weekend - vote for what kind of event you would like to see <a href="http://www.strawpoll.me/5587555" rel="nofollow">HERE</a> - and we wish to improve.<br><br>Thank you<br><br>The Unofficial Event Coordinators

The annoying thing was, I cleared lots of space before the game. Ended up corrupting my video. RIP.

Improvement for the future: Buy a backup router or try and prevent the router being disconnected.<br>That's mine xD.

As Blaze said, it'd be nice to have some events that catered for Asian and Aussie timezones.

I apologise for it was my first time streaming but I got the hang of it however my CPU was dying because I was doing a bunch of things and the stream kept on freezing and looping for a lot of people. I'll try to fix that in the later future :)<br><br>Sorry for also getting banned it was my fault xD
