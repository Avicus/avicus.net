Hey there kids, Vladio here at your service.<br><br>Earlier today I was hearing a bunch in a skype group and in game that the policy about swearing&nbsp;<b>is allowed</b> but is not allowed if used excessively or towards someone has changed once again to a zero tolerance and was also told in game from three or four (maybe more, not 100% the exact number as I don't count this stuff) different staff members that it's a zero tolerance policy and others said that it is only for excessive and towards someone that you get punished for it.<br><br>The reason why I'm posting a thread about it and not contacting a Sr Mod/Admin about it is that there are more people than just me who are still confused on this subject and was wondering if it could be clarified so that there is no more confusion.<br><br>Thanks again people from the Avicush Community!<br>Love you all so vury much :)<br>~VLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD

For the first scenario, I'd assume so under our new rule.<br>As for the second scenario, that would be illegal.<br><br>I've now forwarded it and announced it to the other moderators. Thanks!

We can't exactly compile a list of all the bad words, but I suppose if you wouldn't say it to a 4th grader, don't post it in chat. Try to avoid anything that could be too questionable to say.<br><br>If possible, I can bring this discussion up with the other seniors.

Please discuss this with the other seniors. This rule really needs to be made clear since I still see players saying "fuck you" in chat and not even getting verbal warned.

We will reconsider the addition of the rule. I have created a thread in Staff Discussion.<br><br>Users, you may use this thread to post opinions and feedback. It will influence how we decide, and we will ultimately compile all of the comments together to further improve the swearing rule.

"fuck you" has always been something worth a verbal warning for, not sure where the behavior on that was picked up to not verbally warn; I'll release a statement to our junior moderators since the training might have been mixed up. That'll be taken care of.<br><br>As for discussing it with the seniors, I'm open to having opinions from all sides, including community and moderators if they wish.

I think a lot of words are pretty inappropriate and if someone is saying it constantly then I understand but if it was a mild word then okay but don't be rude to teammates and start throwing everything in the book.

The swearing rule <i>"Swearing is allowed as long as it's not excessive or directed towrds anyone"</i> was completely fine.&nbsp;<br>It was understandable for the players and easy to enforce for the staff (most of the time)<br><br>I don't understand why it needed to be changed, it was completely fine before...

To my knowledge, if swearing is directed at someone or if it keeps occurring by the same person it should be followed up with a punishment. If someone was about to get the monument and then was killed and they just said f**k it's totally fine and doesn't even need a verbal warning.

Look at the first page<br>The forums turned into a dictatorship and "fun" has been put aside too much. Players are seeing this and becoming angry with the staff and are "revolting." Something that would help is becoming less trigger happy with commands and see how things turn out. Another one is saying why you are removing the comments.

I can see your point of your view, however I hope you can understand that if a staff member saw a post which contained inappropriate language, they are going to kind of archive the post.

You know, I archived the posts. I don't understand the need for more unnecessary, sarcastic, and rude remarks. All I was looking for was feedback, and I'd prefer that we keep the thread<i> fresh</i> for that purpose, and not argue over petty archives.<br><br>We basically have every other thread for throwing stuff around without feedback to complain about the staff, and we've tried opening up. I'd prefer just one topic to properly have feedback.<br><br>Every decision we make, simple or not, is challenged now... either complain there isn't enough change, or complain when we do change. What's our options supposed to be? It deters away from us wanting to even ask opinions.

You know, I archived the posts. I don't understand the need for more unnecessary, sarcastic, and rude remarks. All I was looking for was feedback, and I'd prefer that we keep the thread<i> fresh</i> for that purpose, and not argue over petty archives.<br><br>We basically have every other thread for throwing stuff around without feedback to complain about the staff, and we've tried opening up. I'd prefer just one topic to properly have feedback.<br><br>Every decision we make, simple or not, is challenged now... either complain there isn't enough change, or complain when we do change. What's our options supposed to be? It deters away from us wanting to even ask opinions.

I knew you archived them and some were heavily unnecessary to not hide.&nbsp;<br>Everything a staff member has the post is about Community v Staff. That is something made up by one side to blame the problems of this. When staff members do something wrong, community reacts. When staff do something right, community reacts. When the staff do something wrong you don't know how to deal with the problem. Just from that post alone I feel infuriated instead of calm. You haven't proven yourself that you can moderate a server to me and these few posts haven't. Not all staff have this problem though. Flu and Grape have proven themselves and when they do something wrong they handle a situation amazingly. (Flu most of the time). When you learn to react to negative reaction properly, you will notice that this staff v community thing, is just a lie
