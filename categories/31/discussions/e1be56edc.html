Ping (LOL??)

</h1>
As a lifelong resident of NYC, my connection to North American servers is quite good. I have about 20-30ms on Avicus and 30-40ms on other US servers. However, since Avicus added the /ping command, I've been constantly bullied by MY OWN team and various salty randies for having such godly ping :(<br><br>In order to test out just how much my ping affected my pvp, I started playing EU and AU servers regularly (where I get 150ms and 200ms respectively). While I noticed a very slight delay in my hit registration, I found no difference in my skill level. In other words, I still found myself beating players I could normally beat using the same amount of effort. This led me to question the actual effect of ping on pvp and how much one can truly blame on connection.&nbsp;<br><br>What are your thoughts on this matter?

I agree with you for the most part and I personally prefer having delay (140ms ish on Avicus) as it gets me some cheeky double hits but to be fair bowing is a lot easier with lower ping. Obviously potting is a lot harder when you're chilling with 200ms instead of 20ms but in terms of Avicus I rate higher ping over lower ping for sure.

If you want to raise your ping for testing what ping is best, this tool works great:&nbsp;<a href="https://jagt.github.io/clumsy/index.html" title="Link: https://jagt.github.io/clumsy/download.html">https://jagt.github.io/clumsy/index.html</a><br>Set filtering to "ip.DstAddr ==158.69.120.209 or ip.SrcAddr == 158.69.120.209" (without the quotes), select "lag", by how much you want to delay, and hit start.<br>The above filter will raise your ping to the avicus server but not to anything else (google, etc)

I get like 400 ping but unlike posighdun who probably has nbn or cable, I am a peasant with adsl and my fastest ever download speed was 3mb/second and I get like 100 ping to my closest server because internet issues so I can tell ping definitely affects ur pvp like when I have 400 a good player can easily ping abuse me and out range me but like as long as if u have 200&gt; Ping then it shouldn't matter

People with 250ms (or similar) are always complaining about how laggy they are and how everyone else is a 'pinger' whereas I would actually argue this is probably one of the best ping values to have, due to the amount of hit delay not being just right so you can appear to be hitting for 5 blocks

IMO anything sub 30ms is the best ping to have, then followed by 240-260ms. Although for low ms to be most beneficial you'll have to have very good aim

ping doesn't have an affect on pvp directly, it's mainly latency which isn't exactly the same as ping&nbsp;<br><br>in melee there's not much difference between EU and NA ping unless u have like 300ms/ur a laggy AU fucker

Tbh I don't think it's a big difference between having 30-50 ping on EU servers (us servers for you) and 100-130 on us servers. I mean it's just like some milliseconds. Also, maybe if you're used to 30-40 ping it could look/feel like the hits are delayed a bit cus ur not used to 100+ ping.<br><br>I wouldn't say it matters to me but on AU servers I get like 300-350 ping.<br><br>EU: 30-50 ping<br>US: 100-150 ping<br>AU: 150-350 ping

There is a slight difference between 30 and 100 ping, it is even more noticeable with 30 and 150+.<br><br>Ping doesn't matter too much on Minecraft compared to say a FPS (first-person shooter) game.<br><br>Low ping is always best, but as&nbsp;<img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/58d037b7dccc4f2eadd4011c6f484555?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/Lokigh.html" style="color: #FF5C5C">Lokigh</a> said having a 100ish ping isn't great as you don't get neither the better hit registration of low ping nor the delayed kb/hits of 150+ ping.

I think ping doesn't really matter, it's the level on skill the player has. For example I used to get bad ping (now it's decent but not great), and I my skill level was the same. Honestly I don't think ping matters.

Ping is definitely not the most important factor in a person's ability to PvP, though in situations between those of equal skill, it can give an advantage to one side; However in most cases players like Rinn would likely still best you or be bested by you irrelevant of ping, but it can give the opportunity for lucky wins or good combo hits.

Having a low amount of ping fighting someone with 200 ping you'll lose almost everytime. Delayed hits are nearly impossible to cope against. Ive never played a server where ive had above 60 ping, pvping is extremely hard because i lag too much on eu/au.

no its deff not the best ping value, i've tried playing au,na and eu pot and against someone and found it easier on au then na then eu. why is hit delay worth it when you either take 0 kb or get launched to china.
