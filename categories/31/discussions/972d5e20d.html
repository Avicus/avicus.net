<div>Hello<br><br>CS:GO recently had a LAN and the format was really interesting. It was IEM Masters and it happened on last week. This idea can support up to any number of teams however it could go on for a while.</div><ul><li></li><li class=" _wysihtml5-temp-1439416909433">Each team will begin the tournament with four lives.</li><li class=" _wysihtml5-temp-1439416909433">Each game lost will cost them one life.</li><li class=" _wysihtml5-temp-1439416909433">Winning a match will allow the team to choose the next matchup in the tournament.</li><li class=" _wysihtml5-temp-1439416909433">The games will continue until only one team with lives remains.</li><li class=" _wysihtml5-temp-1439416909433">The map for each game can be selected by the community or randomised.&nbsp;</li><li class=" _wysihtml5-temp-1439416909433">Noone can play twice in a row (unless unavoidable)</li><li class=" _wysihtml5-temp-1439416909433">One of the teams picked needs to be from the teams with the least amount of matches played.(until impossible)</li></ul>This could be very interesting. Now moving on to possible layouts. At the LAN, there was only 6 teams, this made it much more simple. Therefore, we could potentially either have one big group which probably wouldn't work very well or we could get several groups of a certain number. Say we got 32 teams registered; we would do the same layout until each group is finished. A possible way to do this would be to get 8 groups of 4 or we do 4 groups of 8. In my opinion, if we get 32 teams we should take the top two teams from each group and group a vs group b, 1stA VS 2ndB and 2ndA VS 1stB in a Bo1 format.<br><br>A possible way to do it would have the losers go into a lower bracket and the winners advance into the upper bracket. You do a normal Bo1 formatted tournament until you get to the Upper and Lower bracket final. In these two finals, it will be a Bo3. The winner of each will advance into the lower bracket final and the losers will do a 3rd/4th place match. However, the two teams in these final two games which were from the upper bracket, would have a 1 map advantage in a Bo5.<br><br>However, that may not work. You could have the team who came second in the easiest group get knocked out in the first round by a good team and then that team could go on to win the tournament. This should not be how it works. To counter this, you could just play it out in a normal tournament. The first round would be Ro16 where the loser goes out. The Ro16 would be Bo1, and following from that all matches would be Bo3.&nbsp;<br><br>The final way to do it would be to put the teams that came 1st into a a group with all 8 1st place teams and then do the same layout that we used in the original groupstage.<br><br>tl;dr: read the first bit and skip the layout part.<br><br>I am open to constructive criticism.&nbsp;<br><br>-Tazz

Great Idea, just remember... Avicus maps are not that good to be played on a tournoment, DTM with obsidian is the "OG" Avicus... You guys should add DTC.... And this would be a great Tourney.
