Hello<br><br>I was wondering what people's thoughts were on ways to revive the competitive community on Avicus. I know school has started up, but I wish there were more teams scrimming on the weekends. I myself am gonna make an initiative to be more active, but I need your help. Please suggest ideas to revive the competitive community.<br><br>Some ideas I have are... &nbsp;hosting&nbsp;weekly mega scrims and&nbsp;<br>bi-monthly unofficial tournaments

No, the Officials should get their stuff together and organize frequent tournaments. It's really up to them and you can all blame them if they fail. More tournaments. @Officials.

Too late, everyone has moved onto to either badlion or Stratus. The officials had a shot and they missed it.

The point is to bring more teams to Avicus, or have people make new teams.

People get tired of playing old maps. Secondly, when there is no tournament going on, people have zero motivation to scrim because they don't want to practice ctw when a conquest tournament could potentially be coming up.

I think you are pointing to something very important. So I would like to go further into this point and I would like anyone who has an idea to respond to my question below.<br><br>The issue is between tournaments. What do you think can be done to make teams more likely to scrim during the offseason of tournaments?

Have more competitive maps being made. Focus map devs to make comp maps as the same maps get boring and thats why teams are going to badlion etc. Because they have new maps. Also more tournaments.

^^^^&nbsp;<br><br>I think the main issue might be the maps, and possibly the gamemodes. This is something we could possibly focus on as a map dev team (it would take some discussion as a group).

Nah, teams are attracted to tournaments. Everyone thought stratus was superior to hosting them then fucked up their "mini" tournament. If its advertised well and sounds juicy [with a good reward for top teams] Teams will play.

Totally agree. Ultimately, the teams, scrims, and the competitive scene altogether revolve around tournaments. There are so many teams from Stratus and BL that will expand and or migrate to Avicus because they have the motivation from tourneys.

I think that tournaments can solve anything. If Avicus Event staff prepares a good tournament, with a good map pool and a prize for the top teams, teams will get attracted to play. Lots of teams have a main server to play, but then they play the tournament that the competitive scenario brings to them. So porbably, we can't brin more players to play actively the server, but we can bring teams to play the tournaments.

A lot of old players like myself have lost interest in avicus and simply dont snjoy the game itself anymore, let alone avicus. People move on as they get older to either focus on other things or play other games if thats what theyre into. <br><br>Personally i no longer see why i should put my time into this game when the only reason i have stayed for the past year or two is because of the people im surrounded by.<br><br>&nbsp;Avicus and minecraft dont have much to offer that a) isnt already done by numerous other servers or b) doesnt offer things such as a proper esports base or well-priced tournaments because minecraft creators and devs deliberately steer away from that. Minecraft has its limits and is becoming more limited with shitty updates that the pvp community despises and now we have to stay in a state of the game thats years outdated. Minecraft’s target audience is getting thinner and thinner by the day and i dont see small servers like avicus reviving itself to how it was in the mczone golden years because the main playerbase is losing interest and lack of advertising in the past, when the server WAS revivable and avicus could have actually grown, means that this server is in a state where advertising and frequent tournaments might not even be enough to bring the server back to its good ol days.&nbsp;<br><br>At this point i think avicus will do the same as it has done for the past 2 years and stalemate in player base, as a few newcomers appear and some old veterans leave because of lack of interest.
