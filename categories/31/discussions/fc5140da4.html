BSM & Toggle Sneak

</h1>
Hello,&nbsp;<br><br>As you're all aware we recently allowed players to use BSM. In some BSM versions there is a Toggle Sneak future. After an incident during the BC vs Berzerk match, we have tightened the rules a little bit. You may still use BSM, however if you're caught using &nbsp;Toggle Sneak, you will get banned.<br><br>That's all for now, thanks!

It wasn't toggle sprint, it was toggle sneak being used by one of your players which isn't allowed on Avicus &nbsp;Also did it effect the game? Of course it did making it harder for us to locate the player giving him a better chance of not being seen. Hopefully everything gets sorted out.

all im saying is you are being so ironic, when you got a page of infractions - you can't pull the old "doesn't know &lt;whatever&gt; isn't allowed."<br>This is despite the fact that the person in question of hacking doesn't have access to the website so can't read the rules.<br>I ain't gonna argue with you. If you wanna think in your head that you would of won, go for it. Maybe it might come true one day..

I don't deny that Bad Company would've won regardless, seeing as their PvP skills and tactics are above and beyond anything we — or, at least, I — could compete with, but the rule in question has been on the "Rules" page, and not punishing someone who broke said rule, just because (I admit) it didn't give them any significant advantage, is, essentially, bias.<br><br>Also, the "Terms of Use" state that, by playing on the server and using the website, you comply with "all applicable laws and regulations", which includes the restrictions on client modifications, and the rules make it awfully clear — anything that allows "crouching while using a Minecraft interface" is "strictly" prohibited.

This rule was changed like a week ago, he can't get on the forums and can't watch the rules. We told him BSM is allowed and in most BSM there is toggle sneak. He thought toggle sneak was allowed as well since toggle run (BSM) is.<div><br></div><div>I still vote for a rematch</div>

Tbh the mod should be illegal. Like stated above, if you accidently have your kill aura on for at least 10 seconds and a mod catches you, a ban will be given, toggle sneak is illegal and if you use it for as little as 10 seconds something should be done for it. You can't trust anyone with the BSM mod even if they don't do anything illegal, you never know if they try it one day. Either way, if you can't hotkey your sprint key and hold it on your keyboard and play decently don't call yourself good at pvp as you need a mod (which is an assistance) to be good at it.<br><br>VANILLA FTW

I understand Tazz used something that he wasn't supposed to use, however, Tazz's internet provider does not allow him to get onto the forums. &nbsp;He uses sky internet for anyone who wants to know. If you want a screen share with him to prove I am sure he will be more than happy to do that. So my point is, how could Tazz have known that this was a rule without someone telling him?

I understand Tazz used something that he wasn't supposed to use, however, Tazz's internet provider does not allow him to get onto the forums. &nbsp;He uses sky internet for anyone who wants to know. If you want a screen share with him to prove I am sure he will be more than happy to do that. So my point is, how could Tazz have known that this was a rule without someone telling him?

Did you seriously read through the entire rules section with your team? That's unreasonable, the mod didn't give us an advantage, he couldn't know about it, the rule has been edited so much over the past month or so how were we to know, especially when Tazz can't access the website from his internet provider. We should either rematch or dq Tazz, the team didn't know he was using it, he didn't know it was illegal and the whole incident was unclear.

Here's my take: BC would have won the game regardless. That being said, BC should have also made sure that all mods they were using were indeed legal. I also believe the tournament rules, mod restrictions and other such details should have been better handled by the officials and presented in a more organized and team friendly way. In my opinion keeping up with the tournament, it's updates and such was all a major bust. However there is no point whining about what has already happened. I think there should be an elected official who is in charge of presentation of the tournament on the forums. I also think that once a team registers for the tournament there should be a way of receiving messages about updates (through the player's alert page) notifying them of these things so that there is no excuse to miss it. Also if there is going to be the huge amount of different forum threads that tournament announcements are made across there needs to at least be one hub thread where users can navigate to the others. Also announcements should never be made on individual posts on threads.
