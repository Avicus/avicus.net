Not joking. Avicus has the best. A few weeks ago, i was in MCSG and I said "guyz im using hax. Im using aimbot cuz im a haxor" a couple minutes later, i was tempbanned &nbsp;for a week. On Avicus, this isnt breaking a rule cuz our staff is pretty dang smart.... thanks avicus staff, for helping the communtiy for free and making the server a better place :c

Won't even lie, everyone here is great. The bad apples that I used to see have now either improved, or are gone, which leaves a team of fantastic, and experienced members.<br><br>The sad part is, that's pretty rare.

I believe that is my infraction. There was a random guy who said, "jg, turn off your kill aura" then I said, "ok, off" as a joke. I have seen other people make jokes like this and they dont get punished :P, still sad that I got my first infraction like that :(.<br><br>@Ducky The staff here are amazing! I love them!

I do have to admit from the change from my server the staff are a lot nicer and are much easier to have a conversation with.

I used to play on a server where I was staff. A few months ago I was demodded for a reason that I will only explain if people ask why. Anyway, while I was staff on that server I was very dedicated. I see a lot of dedications with the Avicus staff and I love that, they are all so friendly and do what they can to keep the server the best. The server I used to play on, now has staff that abuse. I never see abusing or staff power tripping on Avicus. This server truely has the best staff in my opinion of playing ;)

This is really nice to hear. A lot of work is done to maintain the staff team and in the coming months this is going to improve drastically. Also...love how you mentioned MCSG there... &lt;3
