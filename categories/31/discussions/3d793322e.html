Ivy, I think that the Dark Wood is an Awesome Walls Map. If for some reason the Map devs have trouble ( because its a complex &nbsp;2 team walls map ) Will you give it a look? I really think the people playing walls will love it. We can learn through the others, but this one could be tough...

I still say -1 no offence, a 2 team walls map isn't too fun :/ but I like the map tho, there would be too many players on a team tbh

I agree with Vlad, I would prefer a 4 Team Walls Game.

x-heat you play a lot of walls?<br><br>Why judge a map before you give it a try. I have played sooooo much walls that I know what the players want. I built it for players that love the adventure of " get your own stuff" without living in a mine with the hope that you find something good. This map has so much to offer. &nbsp;Download it and give it a try then tell me if you think it will be fun. Really, look at the vendors, look at the weapons and items,really give it a run down.

I have to agree with the others. Walls IMO is and always was meant to be 4 teams. It just works and makes the game that bit more challenging since you have 3 enemy teams as opposed to just one and you are surrounded by them.

Arachadonic - First, Most games end up with a team of 2-3 a team of 1 and another team of 1-2. &nbsp;Normally only 3 team are left at start or one team has someone AFK at the spawn. The teams in most games are not even close to fair. The Dark Wood map was meant to make it where even if only 3-5 players are in a match it stays as fair as can be. Currently Walls suffers from having many servers stay idle and only 3-4 servers going. Dark Wood would be a fun change for one map. All other game modes have different amounts of teams, walls can also fall into this pattern, and make for interesting game play. Again, Walls-players think this is a good thing. I have been asked every day for weeks when the map is going to be open.....
