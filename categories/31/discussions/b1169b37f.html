October - Monthly Update

</h1>
<span><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:3pt;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial;    background-color: transparent;">This October has been hectic, for a multitude of reasons. However it’s a great opportunity to shed some light with the community on what the administrators and senior moderators have been doing behind the scenes! Despite the recent negativity on the forums, we’re hoping to soon improve greatly. That being said, we would love for any hateful comments to remain off this thread. Thanks!</span><br></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700;   background-color: transparent;">Teamspeak and 18+ channels:</span></p><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;">When deleting the 18+ channels, it did state there was a possibility it was a temporary change; however it was obviously dismissed. The senior staff team all copped heavy hate, which we expected. While we haven’t particularly done anything to Teamspeak since, we’re hosting a moderator+ meeting on the 25th, where we will make our final decision whether or not it will be added back.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;">Other than that, we’re currently working on creating policies that affect the Teamspeak server globally, and not just the channel descriptions. This will avoid confusion for staff and users, which should hopefully decrease the “invalid” infractions.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700;   background-color: transparent;">Advertisement:</span></p><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;">Administrafer is currently in the process of scouting for Youtubers, and has already contacted many! We may end up having multiple Youtubers with a solid fanbase, so it’s cheap for us but we still feel the flow of new players. We’re currently attempting to contact more popular users… but I can’t promise anything! While it can be expensive depending on the Youtuber, it’s certainly effective. </span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700;   background-color: transparent;">Staff training:</span></p><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;">Internally, we have been working hard to ensure that each staff member is educated before dealing a punishment, and to have them perform better overall, in hopes to prevent or lessen the amount of false punishments distributed. We also aim to provide more of a confident environment so the moderator in question knows what and what not to do in a situation. We have held these on Teamspeak, and the training ranges from detecting hacks to experiencing them on a first-hand basis.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700;   background-color: transparent;">Weekly discussions</span></p><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;">We’re reviving this! Don’t know what it is?! Essentially, Howsie22 used to do this, and it would revolve around a topic set by the administrators and seniors that address issues amongst the community. This thread would then be dedicated to that specific topic! At the end of the week, one of the admins will make an official statement that will update </span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);    background-color: transparent;">everyone </span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;">what we’ve done about that topic. </span></p><br><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700;   background-color: transparent;">Administrator roles:</span></p><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;">Within the last week, Administrafer and I have discussed bringing back designated admin roles. This system has proven to be quite effective in the past (with a few setbacks here and there) however with the current state of the staff team, we have decided it’s best to reassign them. The newly designated roles are listed below:</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);    background-color: transparent;">Head of Staff and Administration</span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;"> - Mango_</span></p><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);    background-color: transparent;">Head of Community Relations and Support</span><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;"> - Administrafer</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;">The titles and specific roles relating to each role are subject to change, although for now we will be focusing on our own sectors and working on a smooth transition into our new roles. We will still be working together on a large portion of the administration tasks, and these titles do not restrict us to the respective sectors. It is simply for us to designate work in a more efficient manner and inform the community on what we will be individually managing.</span></p><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;"><br></span></p><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;"><b>Newsletters</b><br></span></p><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;">We've been doing this for staff, and it's been a huge success - everyone loves it! Currently it's a possibility to alter the way this monthly update is presented, into a newsletter format. It would then allow community writers to add their own columns addressing particular issues (or anything for that matter). Essentially, we're aiming for interaction!<b><br></b></span></p><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;"><br></span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>That's all folks! More headings to be edited into the OP (maybe)!</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Regards,</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Avicus Administrators.</span></p><div><span style=" font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;"><br></span></div></span>

By small group of people do you mean the TS community? By the way if you were to ask someone who is actually active on TS they would say it's stupid to remove 18+. Most of the staff aren't super active on TS so you really tell us that a majority only want it.

"What do you mean we can't deal drugs?! Everyone loves doing that, the whole 'community'!!! Why can't the cops just leave us alone, you're never even in area!!!" That's essentially your argument. If a rule is being broken, the people in charge have the responsibility to fix it. If you don't like the fix, I don't know what to tell you; grow up maybe?

I would like to point out how annoyed I am with this. Not the idea or if it would be shot down but how it was handled. I was not notified if it was a good or bad idea. I saw a lot of staff who were higher ups look at this thread and if they handled this thread right they would of looked at every post. Do you know why a huge reason why the community gets mad at the mods? Because it looks like they have no leadership who are supposed to be Sr Mods. Flu has done well but the Sr Mods have done beyond poorly with this aspect. Do not let community members in the dust. We are people two.

"What do you mean we can't deal drugs?! Everyone loves doing that, the whole 'community'!!! Why can't the cops just leave us alone, you're never even in area!!!" That's essentially your argument. If a rule is being broken, the people in charge have the responsibility to fix it. If you don't like the fix, I don't know what to tell you; grow up maybe?

I can live with the change, but he is saying only a small group wants the channel when it is really the whole TS community and that he doesn't know that it's the whole TS community that wants the channel back.

Then I have a concern over what you think you need the 18+ channels for. You can still curse to your heart's desire, but if being racist, homophobic, or otherwise offensive to other people is a must for you and the rest of the TS community, then it's no wonder Avicus is having trouble attracting new players that want to stay and actually join the community. No one wants to be a part of something that gets a bad reputation, hell, even Germany apologized for the Holocaust because they were ashamed to be associated with it. I get that that analogy is extreme, but it does apply. It doesn't make sense as to why you'd rather be offensive and deter people away and then turn around and complain about the drop in players that don't want to be around that, than to be slightly better people and see an increase in people who WANT to stay.

uh<br><br>there are 5 other channels for them to go in. if anything, it attracts a more diverse community where people can talk about things that don't make a 10 year old mod scream at you every 2 seconds. if somebody happens to be offended by what is going on in there, they can happily leave into one of the other channels without a problem.&nbsp;<br><br>thank you for your concern

Great update, Joel! And I'm replying to your comment so you get the notification; is your Skype still the same? I tried adding you recently, not sure if it worked or not. The web version of Skype is still in Beta, so it may have a few bugs. But yeah, just figured I'd get in touch with you again. It's been quite some time! :)
