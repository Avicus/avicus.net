You should receive an e-mail from a Senior Mod regarding the status about your ban appeal. You can also check your infractions page and see if the "ban" infraction is green instead of white.

I send an email asking desban because they accused me of an alleged "kill aura" .... I sent my .minecraft tests and even sent my youtube channel to believe me. It's been four days since I sent the request for desban and nothing happened.
