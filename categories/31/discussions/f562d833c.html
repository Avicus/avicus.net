Ask yourselves this question all you NFL die hards, If you had the power to, would you make the super bowl a national holiday (in the U.S)? I thought this would be a fun question 4 y'all to answer. Enjoy :PP

The Super Bowl is on a Sunday xP.&nbsp; But considering that people wait all year and these business must pay millions of dollars to get a commercial spot, it sounds like a holiday already.

In america we treat every sunday like a holiday. Everyone stops working (mostly) and sits down and watches football. It's just our pastime. Well that's what I do :PPPP

The Super Bowl is pretty important but I don't know why there would be a holiday because of it.

Well, if the Super Bowl became a holiday, the World Series would have to also! Baseball is our National Pastime, and there's no denying thay.

@SnowSX3, American football can have crazy turn outs, this past weekend showed the lucky team (Seattle) And the dominant team (New England). Personally I want the Patriots to win. Tom Brady is a native to my area and I would like to see him win. The neon and blue is getting a bit too overwhelming.&nbsp;<br><br>@RCMP: Dude the packers had this one. They made some pretty stupid decisions when it came to instances where 4th and inches occurred. From my point of view, the Seahawks were just lucky, the better team just made one error. New England has this. The Broncos had no chance, but this time around the score will not be as huge!

it's honestly not that bad of a decision when you realize you're going against a good defense... gotta get points when you can... the seahawks are a good defense, it'd have been a huge momentum shift if they stuffed the packers on those fourth downs..

Yeah... But they were lucky that they won. It was pure luck. Their defense was not as good as green bay's. Honestly the pats offensive line may be a bit tough for the birds to fly around.

They are a better team, even in there worst game they found a way to win, Seattles defense held green bay to field goals instead of touchdowns
