more specific? I could help, send me a pic on skype or here? I could help more, are you clicking upload from the middle of the screen and nothing is popping up? if so, drag and drop the vid or use a different browser for uploading, it has happend to me before, took around a week than it fixed itself, if you need to try restarting your computer too<br><br>Hope it helped

This happened to me.<br><br>try adding "http://" before the YouTube URL. I did this and it fixed it. If this is not your problem then I have no idea.

This could be a case of your internet not wanting to do what you want it to, a quick fix could be restart the internet modem or if that doesn't work try waiting it out. The second is youtube could be playing up and all you could do in that case is just to wait.
