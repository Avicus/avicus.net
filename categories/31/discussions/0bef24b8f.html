<div>Well it has been something like 3 years in the Staff Team and almost 5 years being on Avicus as a whole. I've decided that now is the best time to leave and move on with my life. I've decided to do this for a number of reasons. Before I start explaining i just want to make it clear that my retirement has nothing to do with a certain owner or a decision they made. Sure I haven't agreed with every single decision that has been made but at the end of the day, they are the owners, they know what is best and I will support them. Also, my reasons are not the same as PieZ. Us retiring right near each other is merely a coincidence as I hadn't planned on retiring until yesterday.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>There's a number of reasons why I decided to finally call it a day but in short I've just lost confidence and motivation in the server as a whole. I've been here for over 3 years trying my best to make a positive impact, and in some cases I have, but no matter what any of my partner administrators or I have done nothing has changed. Somehow things get worse (From a player count POV). Even over the last couple of months I started to realize that only the Owners could really fix Avicus. I'm by no means giving up on Avicus and I'm sure it will continue to be a thing as Avicus has two wonderful owners who love the server and continue to keep it up, I just think the Admin team needs a few new clean faces to get us back to where we should be. Because of my lack of motivation I had been planning to retire at some point in the future, then something that happened a few days ago triggered my retirement. I did something that I probably should not have done but it was the way the situation was handled that really annoyed me and because of that I decided to call it a day, I'm not going to go into too much detail because I don't want this to turn into a salt thread.<br><br></div><div>I just wanted to say my time on Avicus has been a blast and I wouldn't change one single thing. The only regret I have is not joining Avicus sooner. I've met so many people and had to deal with so many situations that have honestly prepared me for life more than I would have ever thought. This server has taught me skills I'm sure i'll still be using later on in life. Avicus is amazing, it's unlike any other and the community is just outstanding. So thank you to Keenan for creating such a wonderful server. &nbsp;Most importantly, thank you to each and every one of you for making Avicus what it is.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Now I'm not going to make messages and thank specific people for things because quite frankly I'll be here for too long. I'll simply make a list of people that have, in some way and in some point in time, made my experience at Avicus better whether it was when I was a staff member or just a community member back when I first joined.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In no particular order; <br>Keenan, ALM, Harvey, Jozz, Mango, Dylan, Greg, Jess, Lokigh, Solux, Myworld, Kyoal, Jack, Henry (SirCyanide), Jive, Eric, Tynvale, Snow, Kashike, Passively, Ciaan, Mintace, Robert/LFT, Mucky, Fouled, Zicuri, R3dss, Ghost, Falz, DaFrozenBlaze, Borrah, Xtra , Zelk, Youlml, Miel, Iron, Crazy_, Avy, Stormz, Zeus, Cronus, Horizon and finally every single friend I've made (You know who you are). If i missed anyone else I do apologies, if you know me well then you know I have a terrible memory.&nbsp;<br><br>If anyone wants to keep in contact with me then just HMU on discord as I'll be deleting my mc discord eventually. Good luck to Crazy and Cammy, I have faith in both of you!<br><br></div>

Sess mate!<br>You provided a much needed sense of stability when we had Admins joining and leaving within months of each other. <br>You were an anchor the staff team desperately needed for the longest time.<br><br>I'm still amazed at how you managed to do this for so long while balancing everything else in life.<br><br>But hey, now we can talk shit about Avicus just like the good ol' days lol

I was having a lovely chat with myworld when pussydon came along and rudely interrupted. I simply said 'hush pussydon' and i got warned. Apparently this is inappropriate and i believe that this admin was simply salty because im cooler than him. If this appeal is not considered i will take further action and kill myself.
