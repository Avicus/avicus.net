HAI GUYS!!!<br><br>I stopped playing MC at like the beginning of the summer. Idk why, it just kinda happened, unannounced and i left everyone to wonder where I was.<br><br>First off, I want to apologize to a few people that I made commitments to before leaving, mainly Lyyris. I must have looked like an ass, saying I would make a team with him and disappearing without a word. I even uninstalled skype cuz i nver used it anymore.<br><br>Now that school is starting, and I am kinda bored with all the games in my Steam Library, I need a new way to procrastinate. Playing MC on Avicus or Overcast is one pastime that never gets old. So, I'm back!!!&nbsp;<br><br>And I'm bored so Ask Me Anything!!!<br><br>Thanks!<br>~higger

An AMA is now a personal update? And can you please leave this to the staff. It seems a little obnoxious after a while.

When I was making my minecraft account, my friend was over at my house, and we both had watched a lot of youtube minecraft videos and stuff so we knew what it was, and we knew that a premium MC account was a big deal cuz it makes you cool. and stuff. I was freaking out cuz i couldn't think of a name, so I walked away from my computer for five minutes and he had typed in the name and password and pressed enter. I rly like it too, and i use it for other things like Steam, skype, reddit, youtube, and battle.net.<br><br>TL:DR<br><br>my friend is an asshole, but a creative asshole :)
