Yes, I am aware that I need to send ban appeals such as these on the support email. As a matter of fact I have.&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://prntscr.com/4kvf8g">http://prntscr.com/4kvf8g</a>&nbsp;The only reason I am writing a post is because as seen from the reply, I have been told that I may get an email back, this email was sent on Saturday 6th September 2014. The only reason I am writing the forum post here is because I had no reply since that date, I am sorry for sounding impatient but I do not want to be serve a ban that I do not deserve. I have taken to the forums because more staff members seem to read posts like these and I would like to get confirmation on what the banner (Howsie22 I believe) has said why she/he banned me.<br>Thank you for reading.<br>(PS. I blocked off certain parts of the print screen so my email is hidden, I will give the name of my Skype if any staff members reading this would like to talk about this further, if not, I will not take offense.)

Why make this post completely pointless other than Attention Seeking and Lowering your chances of being unbanned

And to Dynamo, you shouldn't make fake accusations unless you were in the game and have supplied sufficient evidence, at no point have I 'speed hacked' the anti hack would pick that up and I would of most likely got kicked, the only hack people seem to use on this server are Killaura, anti knockback and a few others which I have not used. I use Optifine 1.7.4 to log onto Minecraft.

Update: I have been unbanned, I thank tel6331 for doing this, I'm very grateful. I know it's hard to get evidence from bans like these. Somebody please lock this.

First of all, you're lucky you got a ban for only a week....most people get 62 days! :/<br><br>Anyways, stay clean and you won't be punished. Congrats on the unban.

Adam hacked clients are not allowed on avicus, I don't care if you did or did not use them please don't not spam our forums. Playing on avicus is a privellege don't abuse by making spammy topics about bans and unbans.<br><br>appealing takes a reasonable appeal statement and proof.<br><br>it took me 1 year to get appealed from OCN.<br><br>have some patient. After all patient is virtue. ( Jozzmcozz taught me that)
