I've been to Cozumel before. Me and my family took a cruise along the caribbean where one of the stops was Cozumel, but sadly, we didn't stay at the beach since my dad wanted to try out something different, so, we went to visit Chicenitza instead, where we had a guided tour and a lot of cool places to check out.
