A few weeks ago, I filled out a form for the staff to give recognition to community members or other staff that they look up to or appreciate. I have now made this public in spirit of Christmas holidays, and if your name wasn't mentioned, we still admire you for staying with us. We value everyone in different ways, and this was opened as an extended opportunity to those people. Without further ado, here are the results;<br><br><b>ViceWatercolour -&gt; Acceqted</b>:&nbsp;<span style="font-family:Arial;">Acceqted, you've been a pretty chill dude. I've liked scrimming with you, and I like talking to you on TeamSpeak/Skype whenever I get the chance. You've been promising thus far as a friend, and I very much do enjoy the casual chats we have here and there. You're one I can talk to for things and trust, and I'm more than happy to recognize you. Thank you for being a great friend, and I hope we can do more in the future together, getting to know each other more well. You'd probably be really neat to meet in real life too, if given the chance.<br><br><b>ViceWatercolour -&gt; ThatIsReallyHot</b>:&nbsp;<b></b></span><span style="font-family:Arial;">I very much like your initiative and persistence. Out of all the community members I've noticed, I can say with a lot of confidence that your personality developed way more than previously. After constructing a map with you and having a few conversations in TeamSpeak recently, I've decided that I admire you and your contributions. Overall very chill and helpful, showing respect and gradually building maturity, you really stand out!<br><br><b>ViceWatercolour -&gt; Newcleus</b>:&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family:Arial;">He's a blast. Very entertaining conversations in TeamSpeak... however I've noted him to be a leader and very hardworking. He has essentially all the qualities that make a good staff member, and overall, he has a sense of humor. It's fun when you can actually interact with someone and they aren't always a robot.<br><br><b>ViceWatercolour -&gt; Elthandorr</b>:&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family:Arial;">Ever since he was unbanned, he's practically been the most inviting and kind user on the server. Every time I join, I'll get greeted from him. It really helps to have someone say hello and thank you every now and then, especially for such a difficult staff position. The simplest things sometimes mean the most.<br><br><b>ViceWatercolour -&gt; Iron</b>:&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family:Arial;">This dude is one of the all-stars of the staff team. I can say with utmost certainty that he is an outside-the-box thinker, and knows how to work with things he's given. He takes initiative, has been very much more responsible, and over all of the mentoring and moderating tasks he does, he's the absolute most dedicated person. His TeamSpeak activity, fucked up schedule on account of Avicus, and strength for constant mentoring has made it apparent.<br><br><b>ViceWatercolour -&gt; timaeusTestified</b>: I probably wouldn't have made it this far without his wisdom. I want to recognize him for his consistent and loving friendship, where he's always willing to help even when someone else may not be there. From day one as the first map developer to now, he has been one of my best friends. I really love this guy.<br><br><b>ViceWatercolour -&gt; awesome_apricot</b>: Probably not many people remember him anymore, but he was a source of inspiration for me. I liked talking to him whenever I got the chance, and I'll never forget "Scorpion's Nest" and his contributions as staff. Whenever I get a chance, I like to chill with him.<br><br><b>GrapeSmoothie -&gt; DaFrozenBlaze:</b>&nbsp;<span>He posts on the forums a lot o-o</span><br><br><b>resepignev -&gt; ViceWatercolour</b>:&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family:Arial;">Para is a really funny person, he and Evo got me into building maps for avicus. He never fails to let me smile. I loved the picture war in the #random chat. I bookmarked all his pictures xD<br>When I hear the KekoCode song on my way to school I always have to laugh because of the video he made :D<br>Additional he is pretty experienced in music stuff. His mixtape on soundcloud is amazing and he always gives me links to leaks of songs from some famous artists.&nbsp;Oh and I forgot "The World is burning"-song xD<br><br><b>resepignev -&gt; x_Redstone_:</b>&nbsp;<span>He is a redstone god.<br>Well, you could say he is fluent in command block commands xD<br>He recently made a adventure map that was amazing.<br>His maps are also pretty good and now he is in the staff team.<br>It's always great to talk/chat with him. He has really good ideas. And he loves ocean monuments xD<br>From what I saw he's a good staff member and I hope he passes his trial.&nbsp;<br></span><br><b>resepignev -&gt; Spartemex:</b>&nbsp;<span>My Media-Team buddy &lt;3<br>We really should post something again, but idk what xD<br>Spart is a fantastic person. He has a Build server and he's a amazing staff member. There is no particular trait of him that should be recognized. He should be recognized as a great person that he is. He has too many character traits that I could mention. I really like him ;D</span><br><br><b>resepignev -&gt; Fouled</b>:&nbsp;<span>The flattest of the flats.&nbsp;Sli is a wonderful person. A wonderful mapdev and a wonderful moderator.&nbsp;I love talking to him. I still know when we wanted to make the mapdev website but never came to it. Well, it's a shame but I still want to do it.&nbsp;He is funny as hell xD He likes to play the jimmy neutron theme in meeting and on random occasions. Overall he likes to make other laugh.<br></span><br><b>resepignev -&gt; timaeusTestified</b>:&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family:Arial;">He and Para got me into building. If I ever had a yml question he could answer it. I love his maps, they are awesome!&nbsp;Also he helped me to release my first Nexus Map (first map that got accepted) Travincal (he thought of the name).&nbsp;He is really funny and smart.&nbsp;Sadly in the last time we didn't chat that much...<br><br><b>resepignev -&gt; fishyfacediamond</b>:&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family:Arial;">Fishy is nize!&nbsp;Really nize!&nbsp;I loved to defend with her in public matches and of course the karaoke party xD&nbsp;Even if I totally sucked in singing it always was fun to do it.&nbsp;I still know when we were defending and constantly decorating the monument. Also killing ourselves with falling anvils xD&nbsp;Sadly she moved away from avicus, but if she is on the TS I always talk to her.&nbsp;<br><br><b>ProfessorUtonium -&gt;&nbsp;</b><span><b>Elthandorr</b>:&nbsp;</span><span>Elthandorr is always their to help players in-game when no Mods are on. He helps the community on the forums and certainly in-game as a responsible and mature player. I recognize him for his work as a non-staff member that assists players whenever he can.<br></span><br><b>ProfessorUtonium -&gt; Petlas</b>:&nbsp;<span>Even though she doesn't want to come back as mod, She should still be recognized for what she does and how she acts as a non-staff member on all Avicus Platforms.</span><br><br><b>Iron -&gt; Buster_U</b>:&nbsp;<span>Being really nice and awesome in-game. She has an incredibly outgoing demeanor and it shows when I see her constantly trying to help people out!<br></span><br><b>AutoHit -&gt; dilpickel</b>:&nbsp;<span>Is active on the forums and such and is a friendly user on community related sources<br><br><b>Smiley -&gt; X0X0X</b>:&nbsp;<span>They have more activity than I do on Avicus (24 days), they're always a bright and shining example of kindness and they just want to be friends with everyone. Nemo is friends with a lot of people, and I believe a lot would like to see him win this :) He deserves this recognition.</span><br></span><br><b>Acceqted -&gt; ViceWatercolour</b>:&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family:Arial;">This user has been a huge role model for a lot of people including me. He helped me throughout many times either in-game or on team speak. He's such an amazing person and the admin position totally suits him. If you need anyone to go to about ANY Topic or problem, Vice would be the exact choice for you. Thank you so much Vice for being a leader and role model throughout the community.<br><br><b>Acceqted -&gt; Midnightstorm</b>:&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family:Arial;">I would like to recognize this player and congratulate them on their promotion on junior mod. I have only known her for a very little amount of time. But she seems super cool and you should get to know her &lt;3. I can't wait to get to know you more.&nbsp;<br><br><b>x_Redstone_ -&gt; _TinyBear</b>:&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family:Arial;">He is fun to be around and is polite to people around him.<br><br><b>Newcleus -&gt; Iron</b>: Despite the controversy that always manages to circle him, he's still one of the most intelligent people I've met on Avicus. He knows rules inside out and always manages to get the right answer, even though people like to argue it. <br><br><b>Newcleus -&gt;</b>&nbsp;<b>TheTNTPotato</b>: A true example of leadership and knowledge.<br><br><b>Spartemex -&gt; Resepignev:</b> An amazing guy. Helped me through my false demotion, the start of my build server, and a lot of my amazing experiences on this team. He always has a good joke, and a positive atmosphere :)<br><br><b>Spartemex -&gt; </b></span><span style="font-family:Arial;"><span style="font-family:Arial;"><b>timaeusTestified:</b> A dedicated servant to Avicus, and a jack-of-all-trades.&nbsp;I would like to thank him not just for something he has done for me, but what he has done for the server. He is an amazing map developer and moderator, and works hard on the events team as well.</span> <br><br>You may use this thread to say <b>your </b>thank-yous to others. Happy holidays.</span>

<b>Para -</b> We don't ever really see eye to eye on a lot of things, but I have to admit you're a fantastic admin. I'm certainly not someone you like too much, but I&nbsp;<i><b>love</b></i> seeing your disgustingly amusing memes and gifs in #random. I enjoy seeing all your jokes and the amount of fun you have with everyone in the team. Your leadership skills never fail to amaze me and I hope to see you keep the gold tag for some time yet.<br><br><b>Michael -&nbsp;</b>I realize we aren't the best of friends (at all) and it may seem like I hate you and you being a senior, but I will admit you have surprised me since you got your rank. As you've said before, you know your past better than anyone.<br><br><b>Spart and Seth -</b> Hardly talk to you beasts anymore, but y'all are still some of my best friends. I'll try my best to have a chat or with you guys. &lt;3<br><br><b>Sevo -&nbsp;</b>One of my best friends. Don't see you as much as I use to, but you're still a coolio.<br><br><b>Sli -</b> We talk here and there, and I'm not sure if you do, but I consider you a really good friend. I remember the first day I met you in Elimination. Teaming with Peachy, having you kill me and with Peachy just watching. I started yelling at him to kill you, but he never did, haha. You help me with all sorts of things from map making to moderating.<br><br><b>Evo and Skyadia -</b> Wisdomatic hilarious beasts. And Evo made me a great skin I'm looking to keep forever, while Sky was a fantastic friend for a very long time.<br><br><b>AzureKitty and Goldenwalrus -</b> Y'all are cool, wish I'd see you some more. :{ Enjoy talking to you both so much!<br><br><b>Old Build Server Group -</b> Seth, Alex, Slvr, Poker, etc. y'all are fucking beasts. Wish we'd all be on like the old days.<br><br><b>Kylo </b><b>-&nbsp;</b>Creating a server that I didn't give up on after 2 weeks. &lt;3<br><br><b></b><br><i></i>

Thanks to:<br><br><b>The community</b> - You've given me a fun server to play on for over 2 years and I'm so grateful.

There are others but I haven't got the time or energy to write them all xD. The point is, you've been great.

Not to mention how the server is more stable when you're staff.<br><br><b>Smit -&nbsp;</b>One of the best people i've met lets be honest. Through all this time we've been friends while we lost a lot, stay strong my friend :)<br><br><b>Dynamo -&nbsp;</b>We've been in and out, but nonetheless we're friends at the end.

You're a really cool gal and your dad looks like Tom hanks.<br><br><b>Phyre:</b> I'm not going to lie to you, I thought you were so annoying when I first met you, but after we talked a few times on teamspeak I realized you were just a really nice and outgoing guy. You don't really care what other people think about you and I respect that. You're definitely one of the nicest people I've meat on the Internet and one of my closest friends.<br><br><b>Dynamo:</b> You hated me when you first met me :( haha but I always thought you were a funny guy and really nice to your friends. Even though you got mad at me and max for a while, I always knew you'd come out of it ;)<br><br><b>Heat:</b> We haven't talked in a while and we only talked for probably 2-3 months before I quit, but you're a super chill and nice dude.
