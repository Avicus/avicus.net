As any regular Avicus player knows &nbsp;or even someone who glances through the forums, the server is currently in a state of disarray. The main reason for this is a lack of active devs due to our one and only developer, IvyCode, being busy in school which is fair enough and understandable. This is where you the community comes in.<br><br>In order for us to sort out all the major issues facing Avicus at the moment, e.g the current major downtime, lag, lack of updates/features etc, it goes without saying that we need a dev or devs and fast. There are some issues though when choosing a developer:<br><br><ol><li><b>Lack of funds:</b> This is probably the biggest issue when hiring a developer as any developers will not work for free so finding one that will is vital as our server funds are dwindling from what I know.</li><li><b>Lack of Trust: </b>Can we trust this person to have control over console and other powerful commands that could potentially ruin the server? Trust is something that can really just be gained over time but if we hold interviews it shouldn't be too big a factor.</li><li><b>Experience:</b> If the possible candidate has enough experience and skill with working with plugins and the maintaing of plugins aswell as working in a team. This will be even harder to find with little to no budget.</li></ol><span>So, these factors make finding a developer very very hard. Which is why I think we as the community need to stand up and instead of moaning an groaning all over the forums, do something to genuinely help the server.&nbsp;<br><br><b>So I am asking every single person who reads this to use all of their contacts and resources to try find some good potential devs</b> that would be willing to work for nothing but a rank and the gratitude of an entire community (with possible payment once more people donate when they see the problems are fixed). If you do find someone that might be interested in the job than you can skype me their contact details and/or their portfolio of past work and I will pass it onto staff members. The reason why I would use my skype is simply because none of this is official and I would rather I get bombarded with links and names than the busy high staff. You can find my skype on my profile here. Together guys we can do this.<br><br><i>*Note this is not official and I decided to make this thread as staff have not even though I suggested it multiple times. I hope this won't be locked or hinder my chances at the interview for moderator as I only have Avicus' best interests at heart and was sick of procrastinating*</i></span><i><br></i>

You could have for example, anyone who helps avicus in a crisis have the rank "Avicross". And the when they chat in game or something they could have a little red cross with AVICROSS in red next to their name.

My "challenge" was to get people off their grumpy moany butts and do something productive that would benefit the server like looking for devs, hence the title of the thread "DevHunt".&nbsp;<br><br>If you don't know any devs that is okay equally as there are other ways to help like voting/donating etc. I fail to see why in order for you do donate, I have to donate? It has nothing to do with the topic and as I said I have not enough money to donate at the money which is why instea of donating I am looking for developers.

Ok so say someone's like this:<br>"SCREW THIS SERVER"<br>Then your reaction should be:<br>"Avicus is a one of a kind server with stats, building, stratagy, and pvp. I see no reason for you to hate on this"<br>Then they might say&nbsp;<br>a.) "I WAS GRIEFED"&nbsp;<br>b.) "THEY WERE SPAWNKILLING"<br>c.) "I WAS SPLEEFED BY THIS ******"<br><br>Your response:<br>a.) We have many different hubs and games going on at the same time. Just join another. Also, when you play more, you might find yourself griefing<br>b.) That's stratagy bro. They managed to sneak past your defense. Soon, you might find yourself spawnkilling<br>c.) That was probably an accident. Just use /report to report the person who spleefed you. &nbsp;<br><br>And that might solve it.

Developer != Coder.<br>There's a difference in them in some ways, but too much to explain. You may think Ivy is lacking, and that is 100% true. He is busy, but the problem is also what you stated, we need more devs. Now, here's the problem. Nobody on Avicus is a developer, and if we were, Ivy would probably have to test us or something or we would have to be REALLY trustworthy. An old player (ObsidianFire99) actually was a developer, and he played Avicus, he was very good, but I always wondered why funky (This was before Avicore) hasn't bothered to ask Obsidian, or Obsidian to ask him.

Dev's code the plugins for the server, Nebula, Nexus, Walls ect ect are all coded with hundreds of lines of code. HTML is useless when it comes to Minecraft because HTML is used for webpages and Minecraft is not a webpage. Minecraft uses Javascript which is quite a bit harder than HTML from my experience and can take a few years of practice to be coding Javascript fluently.

lol<br><br>Minecraft does not use Javascript, as that is an object-oriented computer programming language used to create interactive effects within web browsers. If you're confusing it with Java (not JavaScript) then yes. HTML also is irrelevant and is also used for webpages, so I don't know how that was brought up and how it relates to Java.&nbsp;Java&nbsp;is a programming language and computing platform, so...

Also, I'm almost positive Ivy is on the lookout for devs, however not everyone in the community is an angel and he won't lower his standards to cater out to get more developers. They need to be fluent in the languages we use and be able to manage all of the utilities Avicus has. While some issues were addressed in the OP, I can honestly say we aren't probably going to get another developer for a while.<br><br>If you guys believe you are qualified to be a developer and know all the basics (and advanced) material that Avicus uses, then sure, shoot Ivy a skype request or email support. Any push forward helps.

I'm sure he might be but sure that doesn't mean we can't help. I just thought this might be a better idea as opposed to making threads complaining about x,y,z and not really offering anything practical to do that might actually help. I would hope the standards aren't lowered but regardless we do need a new developer. I honestly don't expect anyone from the community to become Dev which is why I asked people to use all their contacts or whatnot to maybe try find some potential candidates.

Knockback is already broken. CakePvP will take it 10 steps further and break everything if he gets developer.

support@avicus.net is the support email, but I'd use info@avicus.net because that's for business inquires (though it will take longer to get a response from info@avicus.net than support@avicus.net, I think)

I can confirm that DCRaven has made contact with the staff team. No news on how that went but only time will tell! Hopefully we get a dev soon. 2 promising devs so far have made contact.
