Minecraft EULA regarding Avicus

</h1>
Hello guys! I was considering donating for the gold package but I was concerned about purchasing it with the EULA changes.&nbsp;<br><br>Owen states that : "<span>Ranks are allowed so long as any perks gained are cosmetic. Coloured names, prefixes, special hats etc. are fine."<br><br>And according to the donation packages the only "Non-Cosmetic" items on the packages are the kits. I was curious if the staff at Avicus were going to change these to something else? Or maybe make it so they are unlockable ingame or something similar to that. Because Owen also states that : <br><br>"I</span><span>f the “kits” contain gameplay-affecting features they are not allowed. Gameplay balance is not relevant to the EULA. If the items included in the kit are purely cosmetic, you can charge real money/hard currency."<br><br>I was just curious, that way I know what changes are going to be made, that way I know what I am donating for! Thanks so much guys!</span>

I'm hoping we get to keep our exp gain and whatnot. I emailed the team putting my idea forward about how to let donors keep their stuff while being in line with the EULA. Hopefully they read it ^-^

Yes, the Exp gain passes the EULA, because it is purely cosmetic! Nothing to worry about on that topic.

We've adapted to EULA. I'm sure we'll find more esthetics to account for the loss of kits in our donations.<br><br>Dont be shy if you have any recommendations!

Technically exp isn't purely cosmetic because you can unlock different things in the neb shop by leveling up. May e if everything is available in the beginning for nebula, but you can't give everyone all the kits in nexus :/

Donator only kits, xp&nbsp;multiplyers&nbsp;will be removed along with /surface and other donator commands. However, more perks that do not alter gameplay will be added.

That's perfect, considering I bought emerald solely for surface.<br><br>Mojang should have enforced their rules from the beginning, as it's unfair to those who have spent money for these perks.<br><br>And before people start going on about it being a donation, it's not really true. It says Shop, not Donations. I love avicus, but I probably wouldn't have spent $50 on here if I knew Mojang was gonna do this. Maybe a smaller amount, but not $50.<br><br>I'm not mad at avicus, as I know there's nothing anyone here can do about it, but it is kind of ridiculous on Mojangs part. How do they expect servers to keep running? Honestly, the majority of people wouldn't just donate for fun. At least not nearly as much as they spend for ranks etc. Minecraft is going to lose a lot of its frequent users as servers aren't going to be able to keep running without these payments.<br><br>But there's nothing anyone can do about it I guess. Oh wells!

From what I understand, this is what another server is doing. I think anyways. <br><br>If this is the case, that would be awesome. If not, then as I said, there's not a whole lot you guys can do about it anyways.<br><br>It's just frustrating all around, I'm sure.

You should be able to keep the perks you've already bought. That is what they said in the official Mojang post. However&nbsp;<i>after</i> August first you can no longer sell non-cosmetic commands! This means that after aug 1st these will no longer be sold in the ranks.

I thought of an idea to keep the XP boost.&nbsp;<br><br>"So maybe yous could do the same here, say give the top 100 players on the leaderboard the 1.5 exp multipler, 50 players the 2 xp multipler and then top 10 players the 2.5 xp.

I feel like that wouldn't fit Mojangs demands, as not all donators are top 100, so its not being equal. <br><br>I wouldn't mind a soft currency on here. Would give people more drive, imo.

So say if you get a kill in nexus you would be rewarded 5 AviCoins. Then you could save up those AviCoins and buy Pyro for 1000 AviCoins, or something along those lines. That would be really cool :P

Exactly. They say donors can keep their perks if other people have access to them too, so why not do it like that? I think it would keep people happy and bring a bit more life into the game.<br><br>You could be able to unlock all the different perks like kits, xp boosts, /surface etc.

Just make a separate server for donators only in all the gamemodes. The donators will get to use heir kits in that one. And since it is pay2play on that one server, Mojang is happy.

Maybe not - maybe they will just add servers for people with the ranks... I dont think you are allowed to mix rank and not rank when the rank gives perks. I also dont think you can allow people to "earn" kit perks in game if the rank that is purchased gives the same reward.&nbsp;<br><br>So - Any guess on how long Avicus will be down when this all starts tomorrow? I've started player on some other servers, so its not a big deal, just wondering.
