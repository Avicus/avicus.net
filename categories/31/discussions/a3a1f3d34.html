I was just gone on vacation for a week. I didn't make any notice, or hint, or anything. I was trying to see how viable leaving threads are.<br><br>So, if you guys were wondering were I was, then leaving threads DO have a reason.<br><br>But if you just shrugged it off, or didn't care, then leaving threads are just clutter.<br><br>So, which kind of person were you?

I was actually wondering why you were inactive on the forums for a bit...

Plus Juan for leaving threats, and if people don't like them they don't have to look at them.

I noticed you were gone. I figured you were away on vacation or something similar.

Well it worked, because I didn't see you ingame at all. So yeah, I thought you were on a trip.&nbsp;<b>IMO</b>;&nbsp;I feel "Leaving threads" are a great notification to intend who's leaving. :P
