Hello there!<br>This might seem like a super random post for most new Avicus players. I was a super obsessed Avicus player back in the good old/MCZone days&nbsp;(feels like years ago now) and for some reason today I felt like checking back on the community I once loved. Here's my leaving 'announcement' for those of you who might remember-&nbsp;<a href="https://avicus.net/forums/discussions/69127aff0" title="Link: https://avicus.net/forums/discussions/69127aff0">https://avicus.net/forums/discussions/69127aff0</a>&nbsp;. I think I must have been about 16 when I signed off for the last time (yep I did come back once or twice for nostalgia's sake).. now I'm 18 *runs away from adult responsibilities*. Long story short I just wanted to check back and see if any of the old buddies I used to hang around with on Nebula &amp; teamspeak are still here c: Might be a shot in the dark but it would be lovely to hear from anyone that remembers those days. I think I've lost my mojo when it comes to minecraft these days so if you see me messing around on Avicus in a moment.. that'll be why!&nbsp;Love to you all :)

Hi Lisa! When I was new to Avicus, you were the first person I met and which got me into Minecraft! It's nice to see you again, how's life? How's adulthood feeling? I have 7 months till I'm 18. Also, you have wicked drawings (Facebook feed), keep up the good work and strive towards what you enjoy :D
