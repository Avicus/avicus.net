</h1>
I just wanted to make a post to show my love to all the staff &lt;3<br><br>I'm just gonna say the mods that have inspired me the most on Avicus -:<br>- <b><u>jozzmcozz</u></b> - He has done a lot for the server and also he is probably one of my favorite staff members.<br>- <b><u>NolanDalton</u></b> - He is an amazing Sr.Mod. He does pretty much anything to make anyone happy (So do all staff, he just stands out)<br>- <u><b>tel6331</b></u>&nbsp;(Jesus) - Brilliant manager! He is so good at catching the hackers!<br>- <b><u>Princezz_Dubstep</u></b> - Brilliant at responding to reports, also good at finding hackers.<br>- <b><u></u></b><b><u>Zeus499</u></b><b><u></u></b> - Probably the most inspirational mod - If my app is accepted, I want him as my mentor xD<br><br>&nbsp;And last, but certainly not least, <b><u>batteship811</u></b>! He is probably my favorite moderator because he does an outstanding job for Avicus and really helps out!<br><br>And obviously, all the other staff do an amazing job. Keep it up!&nbsp;:)<br><br><b>Post your top <b>6</b> below! :3</b>

Princezz_Dubstep: The only moderator who didn't turn into a boring person because she got a special rank. :3 I look up to Dubstep because she is the only mod who acts like herself.

Thanks! But to be fair though, the hackers in question had the hacks as follows (both, might've been in a skype call;)<br><br>- Fly<br>- Speed<br>- NoKnockback<br>- High Jump<br>- NoSlowDown<br>- Regeneration<br>- Kill Aura<br>- Aimbot<br>- Timer<br>- Click Nuker<br>- Torch Nuker

like everyone else has stated, everyone in avicus's staff is amazing! however, I will state the most<b></b> inspirational.(in my opinion)<br><br><br><b><i>jozz:&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;</b>this guy is just amazing! jozzmcozz is one of the funniest directors I have ever talked to! especially when it comes to noodles o.o (chicken) hehe&nbsp;<br>jozz has been very helpful when it comes to both the server and outside of the server; and I thank him for that.<br><br><b><i>dubbeh: &nbsp;</i></b><i></i>like many others have stated before me, princezz is one of the most optimistic, outgoing staff members right now. she is almost always happy in the server and is very helpful. &nbsp;especially on forums :p. she always responds to any question you have for her; and if she can't answer it, then she finds a way to make you feel pleased at the end. OH and she has some of the best advice EVER!!!!! I use her advice all of the time(: thank you, princezz_dubstep<br><br><br>i love all of the staff but these two have been very inspirational in my opinion. thank you all of staff for making Avicus one of the best!
