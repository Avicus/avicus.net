Permission granted from senior staff to post this. I don't like stuff behind the curtains, so let me tell you what is happening.<b><br><br>Gamemode Assignments</b>&nbsp;The map developers have decided that we will start taking charge of the gamemodes in a more uniform way; we’re going to assign mapdevs into gamemodes so we can make sure nothing will die out anymore. By doing this, things will be more efficient. Map Developers will have to keep up with their gamemode and make sure that it is going smooth, however they can still change things in other gamemodes as long as their area is getting enough attention. Should a map developer go on a leave, a head map developer or other willing mapdev will take charge.<i><br></i><br><b>Map Reassessment</b>&nbsp;We’re going to be wiping the entire repository. We’re going to keep a few maps that we think are good and fit, maybe throw a few into a throwback server, but for now everything we currently have is just too different in a (poor) way. We want diversity, but in a way that connects for everyone. With this, we’re going to be changing the direction of the server with more competition. We are going to introduce a tournament play scene to every Nebula map, with every aspect of PvP. From TNT to sword combat, possible supplies or anything fun, we want a match that’s like no other general map. Map makers who are affected by this will have a chance to revamp their map into something that fits the criteria, which may be posted later on.<i><br></i><br><b>Head Map Developers</b>&nbsp;We are introducing another head map developer, to look after the 2 sectors; making sure things are getting done, and one to organize staff. Though it was thought for a community mapdev, that is more than anything Peachy’s role and we want to keep it simple. With both, voting is currently in place and the new head mapdev will be announced at the end of this week. There will not be a third one. As well as this, there will be a change with the current head mapdev, that will also alongside that be announced next week.<i><br></i><br><b>Map Development Commit Info</b>&nbsp;Want to see who has been doing what? Sure. After thought from Tanpopo, we are going to release the repository statistics of the map repo and let people see for themselves how much has been done or whoever they want to praise for pushing things. As well as this in the update, there will be an automated system on a page. You’ll be able to see which things have been recently changed in the repo with a description on such.<i><br></i><br><b>Senior staff / map devs connection</b><span>&nbsp;We hope to have seniors and mapdevs work more closely together. With them being able to input on polls and join meetings now, we want them to be able to participate as much as they can to improve the network. As many heads as we can get is always good, and hopefully this improves communication and connects the missing link together with the staff.<br><br><b>Tournament Maps</b> No worries here, still covering the event as a mapdev. Nothing drastic has changed, but more submissions as well are welcome! Coords are moving fast. These will also not be reassessed btw!<br><br><b>YAML Classes</b> Because of the potential I see in a lot of community members as a map dev, I really want some of you to be one; but there is one key thing missing. A lot of the candidates I see don't know YAML. So as a proposal from my own time, I'd like to start having YAML classes in TS so you guys can learn how to YML. I will also do this one-on-one, so I'll take one at a time. Because you guys may think it's advanced, I'll help you out. Times to be announced, but I prefer you poking me in TS whenever I'm on to learn rather than me having to do certain times.<br><br><b>Omega Update</b> There was a few problems with the testing map-wise. If you have any, please send them to us or a mod to forward it to us. Thank you!<br><br><br></span>

I guess you are right, but we can't just not pay attention to those gamemodes, like if there are any bugs the map devs should fix those. I think one mapdev for Avicade, Elimination, and Control the Hill would be sufficient. Also, I'm pretty sure we will get a lot of maps for HG coming in soon.
