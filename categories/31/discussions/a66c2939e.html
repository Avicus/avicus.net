<i></i><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><i>and led by people who hold too many responsibilities</i><br>This is so true. Don't promote Senior Mods or Admins to Map Devs, it's just stupid. If a Sr. Mod or an Admin wants to do something with maps, they should just do it. I mean they're Seniors/Admins, they should be allowed to manage the maps without being a Map Dev.</span>

this is exactly the problem right now will all the recent events. Great guys, great map devs and builders. I've said it before, stop stacking ranks, spread them out, give more people opportunity's.

Some of these people are delusional of what eric and ryan were saying. stop stacking staff with so many responsibility AND GET UR SHIT TOGETHER. admins won't do anything about this or listen to the community which is why avicus gets like 40 people on a day.

Sorry to hear this Eric but I am glad you'll still be around, but I completely agree with you. This server is unorganised and although I have not had personal experiences you among others have said being a staff member in general is not rewarding.<br><br>Thanks for everything though mate,<br><br>Myv

Sorry to see you guys retire, hoped to be able to work with you :(<br><br>About the maps not being used, totally agreed. I know the old maps play well, but what's the point of us making maps if they're never gonna be used? Some of my maps got accepted with a big yay, more than a year ago, but didn't get used after that.<br><br>Hope they get their stuff together so I can do what I like :)
