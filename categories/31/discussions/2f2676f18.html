I use adobe Photoshop for my channel art. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/mlgporky">https://www.youtube.com/user/mlgporky</a><br>I will be making more channel art soon so let me know how you like it. You can't make channel art on a website. It just looks bad that way. You need to learn an editing software such as photoshop cc to make good youtube channel art, icon, or thumbnails.

Thanks for the feedback, and yeah I've been strongly considering just reverting to photoshop; after all its probably the most professional and stylised way of making the channel art :) Also your channel and channel art is amazing! you should make more DEFINITELY! Keep it up :)
