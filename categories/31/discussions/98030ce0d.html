Does your brother share the same wifi network as you? check your connection. just because your brother can't connect doesn't mean anything. (Unless he's at college or something)

It's been happening a lot over the past couple of days, but using direct IPs helps.

I've had this happen to me a lot over the past few days. Try connecting with direct ip's such as <b>mczone01.avic.us</b><i>&nbsp;</i>or <b>luna.avic.us</b>. I haven't had a connection problem while using these ip's, so hopefully you won't either. &lt;3
