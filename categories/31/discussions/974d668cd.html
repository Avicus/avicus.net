The hit registration is off and players are invisible. Yeah.<br><br>I was playing on Candoria and I could see players being hit and killed by no one. It wasn't assassin either because no donators were in game.<br><br>Also, sometimes you take damage way to fast. You will receive 3 hits during the time you would normally receive one. This isn't hacking either. I got caught on fire once and I took damage 3 times in half a second from it. My ping is 300-150 so I dont think it is a ping problem.

The invis glitch is due to multiple spawns in Candoria.<br><br>The fast hit thing is a glitch that'll eventually get fixed :/

The fast hit. So much fun if you get it but freaking stressful and annoying if someone else gets it
