Yes, guys, we are growing. Slowly, but growing.<br>The main reason may be X-mas hollydays or something else.&nbsp;<br>But im so happy to see it happening, and maybe Avicus will beat some records of last months (Atlas months)<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/YTzHmUp.png" title="Image: http://i.imgur.com/YTzHmUp.png">

Unfortunately I think Avicus may have stagnated. I'm hopeful that there is a bigger general interest in the sever, but I'm afraid that we'll see a dip after the holidays.

It's a good start and I have noticed some people say that they are new on the server (which aren't just there to fly or get banned ), despite this growth could be due to there being little to no exams and there being a Christmas holidays

Not to be a party pooper, I do wish that Avicus would grow bigger, but look more closely in the statistics and you see more recently it drops<br><br><img src="https://i.gyazo.com/f2727728f7857a62a384a0d6eec1a08b.png">

This is pointless, Avicus is losing players by the day, and only getting them back due to unusual occurrences such as Christmas holidays and/or summer break (for the Southern Hemisphere). We don't need an increase in players, we just need to keep the players that we currently have by developing the one game mode keeping them on the server in the first place - Destroy The Monument/Nebula.

New gamemodes for new tournament are what they have done and made the server more interesting but still keeping it traditional to its playstyle

Competitive is what keeps &nbsp;Avicus alive if you didn't notice is that Avicus had 100+ players on during the tournament with around 3 rotations &nbsp;being played at once.
