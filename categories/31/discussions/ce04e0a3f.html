I got kicked for spawnkilling when I was in the hub, the date was march 11th and today its April 3rd.. I don't recall spawnkilling and if I did so, by accident. Also, is this in the right area? I have no idea.

Yeah we know about this. It is a bug that is currently being fixed at the moment. Don't worry the infraction will be appealed and won't show up on your infractions page.

Hey Tigger,<br><br>Yes this is one of the several small bugs from the recent update, where your past infractions repeat themselves on you, I am experiencing this as well. Don't worry, the punishments won't fill up your infraction page. :)

Kylo said it happens when the hub generates its stats. It's happens when the hub is close to restart. Currently there isn't a solution yet, but kylo is acknowledged about this and he tries his best to fix it. But there are also other bugs around and it could take a while it's fully fixed. Just wait :)
