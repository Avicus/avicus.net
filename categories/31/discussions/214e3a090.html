Ahahah jokes kids. Whatever you heard about disbanding we were duking you XDXD.<br><br><br>So after recent events have gone down, Bad Company have not, &nbsp;in fact we are still gonna kick ass. Read the whole thing for an actually, somewhat interesting story about Bad Company, we honestly are more than just a minecraft team. My experiences with everyone here have been utterly fantastic and this team will never die. Many of our players are leaving but we have all agreed on one thing. We are all coming back for the next tourney &gt;:) I wish you all luck.<br><br>BmB's small notes.<br>Thank you me for starting this whole thing 2 years back.<br>Thank you Tazz for losing us the tournament.&nbsp;<br>Thank you Notal for joining very early on and kickstarting the new BC.<br>Thank you Robin for being the kindest person on the team and stopping us all from being banned, (So far)<br>Thank you Caiden for being one of the first players on the team and never losing faith in us amen beaner brow.<br>Thank you Gaabe for turning up as the player none of us knew yet being able to play every position and being a none stereotypical beaner. #<br>Thank you Notal for teaching the team how to play almost a year and a half ago and kick starting the new BC, also for so many suprise objectives<br>Thank you Jive for being one of the original squad and never getting bored of defending, also for being one of the kindest Yives i know.&nbsp;<br>Thank you Juanoh for being the best beaner we could ever hope for.&nbsp;<br>Thank you Pantai for convincing me you had down syndrome ( i guessed for your voice)<br>Thank you Ronloyd for being the original BC member, for always being here and for just being you, freaking Godloyd&nbsp;never trained<br>Thank you DaGoldJeff for holding the record for the most infractions (something difficult to achieve in BC) and playing with us low lifes.<br>Thank you N3xT_M3cH for never actually showing up :^), but carrying in scrims and for having your name on the roster.<br>Thank you Remy for being an original BC member (goddamn fancy soldiers) and never dropping your&nbsp;balls gg remdawg.&nbsp;<br>Thank you Creep for showing us how to actually use a bow and for making Archer towers that made my mum cry.<br>Thank you Kiwi for never taking anything seriously and making me wet myself laughing a good few times. See you at school tomorrow.<br>Thank you Advisor, Boom, Skai,Trail,Buster,Zero,Zeus,Pizza,GamerzFinest,Dynamo,JGkid,D00Z,LampY,Calined,Tresh,Rot/Pebble,Dualzz,Tekcrezec,Craft_sem,Sparkz,3picrises,Gamer_Henry,Cels,1Theodore1,PeachyYas,PieZ, Ingigo&nbsp;and PF76 for all being in the team in some shape or form. &nbsp;Sorry if i forgot you.<br><br><br><br><br>My personal paragraph:&nbsp;<br>Dear all of BC who ever joined, you have all affected my life so much, ever single one of you have had an impact on my life and you have all meant so much to me. This team was my first large leadership job and damn did it go well. So many players have come and go but you loyal ones who have stuck with it over 2 years, and from Robin's bro chats to Tazz's Chicken burgers i love you all.<br>This has been so fantastic and i am so glad we will be going for another year! Long live us. It's been so fun and i have had some of the best shits and giggles of my life with you guys. Never give up y'all i'll always lead you. GG no re eZ.&nbsp;<br><br>Juanohs paragraph:<br><div>History has been written with this team even thought we didn’t win the &nbsp;tourney. We went from a team diagnosed with bird syndrome&nbsp;to a legion of pvp warriors. To be honest, I didn’t think we would get that far considering we were facing Impact in the quarter-finals, but, they didn’t show-up and we just moved-on. The match against Berserk was really hard but thanks to my advanced pvp skills, I carried the match and made us win. Unfortunately, thanks to our senpai Tazz, we got dq’d (Love you, &lt;33333) cause Kohi’s KB and BSM, but, I don’t care, me and the team got the love of everyone in the server and I’d like to thank each of them personally:</div><div>BmB, for being our one and only leader (xd Robin and Tazz) and for arguing with Tazz everytime we were losing a match. Robin for being one of the most chill scottish people I’ve met in my life and for telling us we were about to get black-listed (lol). Tazz, for dq’ing us from the tourney and for raging every scrim. &nbsp;Gaabe, for being the other beaner in the team. Cedd, for being the easiest kid on the team. Brick, for getting Tino demoted and risking our match against Berserk. N3XT, for nothing. Creep, for nothing. Tino, for being the easiest gringo to beat on Kohi from the team and for moving alongside me from Allah to BC. Pantai/Noah, for being our pvp carry and for having that weird dutch accent. &nbsp;Notal, for letting me get into the team. Remy for not showing to any of our scrims. Ron for nothing cause I don’t really talk to him, xd (Inactivity op). And.. Jive, for being my pet (rekt).</div><div>I won’t be playing Avicus that much because I get bored pretty easily and I need to take care of the people going through the border at a times. This tourney was fun but a bit unfair, gg boyz.<br><br></div>Caiden's/StrictlyCedd paragraph:&nbsp;<br>Been around the world twice. Talked to everyone once. Seen two whales make tender love, been to three world fairs. And I met an old man in Thailand with a wooden willy. Pushed more poo more sweeter and more completer than any other poo pusher around. I'm a hard bodied, hairy chested, rootin' tootin' shootin', parachutin' demolition double cap crimpin' frogman. There ain't nothin' I can't do. No sky too high, no sea too rough, no tender love making session too tough. Been a lot of lessons in my life. Never shoot a large caliber man with a small caliber bullet. Drove all kinds of trucks. 2by's, 4by's , 6by's and those big mother fathers that go 'Shhh Shhh' and bend in the middle. Anything in life worth doing is worth overdoing. Moderation is for cowards. I'm a lover, I'm a fighter, I’m a Bad Company member. I'll wine, dine, intertwine, and sneak out the back door when the refueling is done. So if you're feeling froggy, then you better jump, because this i've been there, done that and i'm &nbsp;going back for more. Cheers boys.<br><br>Notal's paragraph:&nbsp;<br>Its always been a good time since I've been on Bad Community. The first time I met Barney (BmB) we pretended that he was depressed and mentaly unstable to stop a moderator having a go at him and since then, 2 years ago, its always been a laugh. When me and BmB reformed BC after all of us have got better at PvP, we knew it was gonna be good. We have been scrimming on sometimes 4 times in one day and only getting better. Todays disqualification is only a little hurdle (#cutfortazz) but we will come back better than ever and use Kill Aura next time because we're not pussys.&nbsp;<br><br>Tazz's Paragraph:&nbsp;<br>thanks for accepting my apology everyone. I did wrong on accident. Cheers notal for getting me in - screw you barney for talking behind my back. LMFAO how I found out. Notal, you got smacked by that chair brooooo. HUH. Gabe and ron you are Gods... mfw when kiwi turns up at the last second to make us 10 and then we win. Then someone gets us DQed - not sure who though!&nbsp;<br><br>Jive's Paragraph:&nbsp;<br><div>helo mi nam is adam aka jive. After this tourney (the omiga champooonshype), I am going to leve minekraft overall. i may turn up when there's a tournament again. bibi</div><div>-Regards</div><div>Jive</div><div>&nbsp;add this too</div><div>about me. im a bad boy which loves to kill bob. im 10 yers old and i like rongod. i hav 3 childrens and 6 sons</div><div>&nbsp;when u red this, i am problably killed. now i hav only 2 sons left. i criii ;ccc</div><div>thank yo guis i lov u</div><div>&nbsp;thank u bob for being fat</div><div>&nbsp;thank u tazzeh for being fatter</div><div>&nbsp;thank u ronneh for being fatterer</div><div>hank u notal for being fattererer</div><div>&nbsp;thank u robin for being tjock</div><div>Regards</div><div>Edited 20:03:55] Jive: - Jive (the real bc member)</div><br>&nbsp;Tino's Paragraph:&nbsp;<br>Me and this team has been through a lot. All of those long nights in the bedroom, sweating and moaning (We were scrimming). As for now I'm leaving, having children I don't know about, and playing osu! for the rest of my life. I'd like to thank a few people. I'd like to thank BmB for being Barney Michael Bannister, Tazz for getting us disqualified, Jive for being Jive, Tazz for making us lose everything, Robin for defending, Gaabe for not being a stereotypical beaner, Juano for being a stereotypical beaner, Pantai for nothing, Brick for getting me demoted, Cedd for loving me, Notal for nothing, Kiwi for rushing and Ronloyd for carrying us. Thanks guys (heart).&nbsp;<br><br>Robin's paragraph:&nbsp;<br>It's a big disapoitment for all of us on BC, but we're not going to give up on what we started. even with the fact that I'm a staff member, I dont belive this is fair. But I respect the officials opinion. Every player on our team Always did their best, and even if we're not perfect, we would accept what happend. Me Tazz and Barney will from now give 100% to be able to make the best team on avicus, and one day, we might even be able to take on the best ocn teams. But whatever, BC brought the best &amp; intense games, it was Always a wonderful feeling when we won against a team, that match we won with 16 seconds left, that was Amazing. Dont worry lads, you'lll all soon be knocked out by a very, bad, company.<br><br>Juano's Paragraph: This is my essays guys, please add it into the post!!<div>[20:59:29] Juano: The moment has arrived?.&nbsp;</div><div>its time for a little character assassination?..&nbsp;</div><div>and as Kyle best man?..&nbsp;</div><div>its my opportunity to slate him.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Although,&nbsp;</div><div>as Henry the Eighth said to each of his wives?..&nbsp;</div><div>I wont keep you long&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Having never done this before, I really didn?t know how long my speech should last&nbsp;</div><div>General opinion suggests it should last about as long as it takes the groom to make love, so?..&nbsp;</div><div>(hand gesture)&nbsp;</div><div>Thank you and good night.<br><br></div>Tazz i loved all your speeches before the tournament that helped us win so much,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO4tIrjBDkk" title="Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO4tIrjBDkk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO4tIrjBDkk</a><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NWec9atK4c" title="Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NWec9atK4c">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NWec9atK4c</a>&nbsp;<br>GG<br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/7TktR2h.png" title="Image: http://i.imgur.com/7TktR2h.png"><br><br><br><br><br><br><h1 style="margin: 0px 0px 24px; font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  color: rgb(65, 65, 65);  "><b>Also don't ever forget our motto:&nbsp;<br></b><b>Tickle my pickle, make love to a nipple, touch my testis, here in Bad Company we're all besties. &nbsp;</b></h1><b>Rot and Cedd i love you to like bro's for this kind of shit lmao.&nbsp;<br><br><br></b><img src="http://i.imgur.com/xYIUEKD.png" title="Image: http://i.imgur.com/xYIUEKD.png"><b><br></b><br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/jqP7Srb.png" title="Image: http://i.imgur.com/jqP7Srb.png"><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/dhuXXuI.png" title="Image: http://i.imgur.com/dhuXXuI.png"><br><br>Just casually filtering some BC classic photo's and quotes.&nbsp;<br>Tazz, where do you get your clients from?&nbsp;<br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Zvr9yQP.jpg" title="Image: http://i.imgur.com/Zvr9yQP.jpg"><br>'BmB, kick gold he's a sexual predator, trail too'&nbsp;<br>Robin likes birds, but not the female ones.<br><a href="https://youtu.be/VPZuXKhk0No?t=7m38s" title="Link: https://youtu.be/VPZuXKhk0No?t=7m38s">https://youtu.be/VPZuXKhk0No?t=7m38s</a>&nbsp;Tazz screamer.&nbsp;<br><b><u>CAIDEN</u></b><b><u>&nbsp;TAKE THE TRASH OUT!</u></b><br>"Guys learn to pvp properly, shove your router up your ass, and slap your mouse with your head.

Message me on skype so i can add you. (scrim subbing doesn't count)<br>Also Robo you are love, long live team allah.&nbsp;<br>and the sophisticated robotts. &nbsp;<br>and blurred dreams<br>BmB : Fucking legend, op as fuck omg please have my babies.<br><br>Robin: Never complains, always good, you are not getting past his defende (unless he doesn't see you :^)) But among that a great friend, to think i never wanted you in the team originally :D<br><br>Tazz: You squeak and scream and piss everyone off but at the end of the day you're still slaying pussy and getting a good portion of our objectives, love you client boy.<br><br>Notal: You came to BC a year and a half ago and taught everyone everything that turned us into a good team and i thank you for that, you still remain a great friend to this day. &lt;3 Snotal<br><br>Jive: Where do i even start, one of the nicest guys on the team without a doubt, one hell of a loyal guy, you always stuck by us even when we were dicks to you. You're a great defender and offender, silent and deadly and just a pleasure to play with. &lt;3&nbsp;<br><br>Kiwi: I know where i start with you 14 years back in the same hospital ward, and we still going at it today. You only turn up when we need you most and then you make a killfarm in their spawn or someshit. BC or irl we still carry. :)<br><br>Ronloyd: The first ever BC member, 2 years ago me and you played nexus all day, and we fucking owned MCzone nexus. You are an amazing guy, you are never said, always make scrims upbeat and nobody in the world can dislike you, even though you are one of the best Iron kit/ diamond kit pvpers i have ever met. Keep being insane.&nbsp;<br><br>Gabe: A true newbie at the time, me and notal picked you up in a public OCN game because you were freaking good, every time we scrim you bring out something new, weather you can defend or cannon or keep our asses safe in big pushes you're a steady guy not to be underestimated.&nbsp;<br><br>DagoldJeff : Welll the days since i was scared of you as a pvper have thankfully ended but jesus can you still kickass when we need you. Despite being one of the most well known pvpers on MC you still come and scrim with us regularly and i appreciate that, thanks for sticking around.<br><br>Pantai/Noah1 : I swear you're high every time i meet you but i guess you are dutch. You are certainly someone that i would want holding a position with your insane bow and sword skill, you're really just a valubale player.<br><br>N3xt/Noah2 : Haven't known you that long but you seem pretty chill and you give everyone (excluding tazz ;) ) respect in the team and have the tendency to win 4v1's when you feel like it.<br><br>Remy : longggg time friend that i will never forget, can't wait till you get home so you can join up again and play with us all, we miss you and we know you will still be on of the greatest frontliners a guy can have. You've been with us a long time now and you've made a huge impact on the team and me, keep going buddy. :)<br><br>Creep : You're again such a nice guy and i've never ever seen you lose your cool, you don't complain and you just wreck, probably one of the best archers on minecraft and still good with a sword, you are such an asset to the team and you're always willing to help out, thank you.<br><br>Juanoh : Resident bean, despite you being fairly new to the team i feel like you've been in forever, one of the strongest players i've known who will help out regardless, great guy, great player, great friend.<br><br>Tino : I was so happy when you joined the team, i've considered us friends for quite a bit of time now and you joining the team really made it that much more fun, You always have a fun atmosphere about you but still know when to get the job done and damn you can get that job done.<br><br>Caiden : One of my all time best friends on BC and in general MC, i really hope to meet you sometime this year before 'murica. You're such a great person and you are never unkind to anyone. You just stay being you and i'll be happy forever. You defend, you offend, you midline you god mate. G0D. BC oldtime best old timer.<br><br>Upsoar : Another newbie :^) from when i've met you and played with you, you're a damn strong defender who always speaks theiir minds and gives some great calls, not only that you're one hell of a pvper and that really surpried me, PVP legend in the making!&nbsp;<br><br>Danikas : When i trialled for Instant damage that time you were by far the nicest guy that introduced me into everyone and in general was so nice. Recently you became absolutely insane with a bow and sword, always willing to play, always chilled out and it's great to have you in BC.&nbsp;<br><br>Budah : You are such a nice guy, and in the small amount of time i got to know you in i can already tell you're gonna be a great friend, you are comfortable in the team and liked in the team and you can kick some good ass. Thanks for not complaining and just being a nice chilled guy, you really work with the team a lot more than you know and thank you!&nbsp;<br><br>Dualzz: If you play then make a proper defender ffs! It never matters though because you just hop off a wall and literally kill their entire team without breaking a sweat and it's a pleasure to play with you. Thanks for being a fucking god and once again one of the best pvpers on MC.&nbsp;<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ww5GXbk58R0" title="Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ww5GXbk58R0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ww5GXbk58R0</a>
