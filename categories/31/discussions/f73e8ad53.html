Hello to the community, its Max<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am making this post as my last one as an Administrator on the server. I have been with this server for something like 4 years: through Terrascape, MC Zone, and finally, Avicus. Let me tell you, this server has been a major part of my life in total, and its going to be hard to let it go. Its been a pleasure, and I can't wait to watch (from a distance), and see this server grow larger and larger (it'll happen).&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am retiring for a good reason (in my opinion), I have not been online enough to be an Administrator on the server, and I have not been being active in the community, or on the server in general. At one point, I could play for 2 hours a day, every day. Now though, school and life are taking a toll on my available time, and I will soon not be even to play. I am not leaving because this server is "boring" or "less good," I am purely leaving for personal reasons, and I most likely will be playing a bit in the near future, and helping out the staff team whenever I can. I would like to point to FTW's reason for retiring. He had a noble reason for quitting, and I completely support it. Life isn't made for living inside on a computer, its about going out, being social, and making friends whenever possible. I respect you if you like the computer, but this is just my view on the subject.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For my replacement, I have chosen Jake/Aversively. He has been a staff member for as long as I can remember, and he is the one I believe will most suitably fill my role. He will be a better community Administrator than me, and I have complete faith in him.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I don't want to thank people by their names, because I know Id forget a few people, and I don't want to do that. I want to thank the staff, for always helping the community. I would like to thank all of you, the players, for making this server great, and for making this job worthwhile, and I would like to thank Ivy overall; without him, the server wouldn't exist, I wouldn't have made so many friends, and I wouldn't have met any of you.<br>Thank you for all of the great times, this won't be the last time you see me (hopefully),<br>Max Gillette

You're a great friend, you were a great administrator, and it will be so tough to see you leave. You are such a genuinely nice person and I don't see that in many people. Good luck in life bro. &lt;3

Although we barely see each other because of timezones I have to say that it has been a pleasure working with you and when we were on at the same time we had some very good laughs!! Farewell chap!
