Hello Avicans,<br><br>As you can see, this message is called New Map. That's because I want to build a new map but I want to approach the consumers of the product and ask for what you would like to see in this new map I want to make. You can suggest crazy, unique, out of this world ideas. Anything you want me to implement into the map, I will take any idea/thing in consideration. Your probably thinking, you sound like those politicians who promise everything and then they never comply with the public. Like I said, I will take everything in consideration and comply with most of your suggestions. I can and I will make your dream map possible. Thank you for your time and feedback that i'll be pleased to receive. <br><br>Your fellow Avican,<br>Jossiux

Make a map where both teams spawn in giant pigs and the monuments are on the ears and the tail. Make sure to include a manure pit under the pigs .

I know, but what's stopping us from making one that is more fair and balanced?<br><br>After all, people do not have a copyright or fair-use claim for personal ideas for maps.

If you need Ideas of maps just go to -&gt; map releases and then look at some of the images, that's what I personally think is the best way to get ideas.
