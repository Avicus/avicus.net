<p class="MsoNormal">Well.... How do I start?...... For those of you who don't
know me very well, I will give you a little insight of my time on Avicus.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">It was a warm summer and a few of my friends and I decided
that we should make a Minecraft map since we had just gotten into PvP. We
wanted it to be different from others and a gamemode that would stand out from
any others like TDM or Capture The Flag. After many confused and bored faces,
we had come up with our idea and we began building. We decided that the map
would be high in the sky and hosted on islands..... And so Skywars was born.
Many of you who were on McZone (Now known as Avicus) may remember a gamemode
called Skywars. Yes, this was the gamemode. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Once we had built the gamemode we played the map countless
times within a small group of IRL friends but my friend JJtCool wanted to go
bigger. He decided that he would put the gamemode onto a server called McZone
with the permission of a certain person called FunkyStudios (Now known as
Kylocode). This was soon implemented and proved to be a big hit on the server.
Since the map was then put on the server, this encouraged to me start playing
on the server. I became a regular and I became familiar with the mods at the
time (No McZone veterans remain after I leave unfortunately). This map got more
and more popular that FunkyStudios decided to host a tournament after we built
Skywars 2.0. As there were 3 islands, there were 3 teams (The Creators, McZone
Staff and YouTubers). This was one of my favourite minecraft memories. The teams
consisted of Myself, JJtCool, PINEAPPLE_SLAYER, W1NKILLER2 and hughsie1. The
McZone staff consisted of FunkyStudios, killerbye22, Shirokamii and
Blackhawk6alpha. And finally the YouTubers consisted of Exploding_TNT,
GameplayerHD, and some other people whose names escape me for the time
being.... Anyways...... We won this tournament and life went on. I carried on
play McZone more until one of my friends and a certain Blackhawk6alpha
suggested that I apply for a staff position on the server. I did so accordingly
and woop woop I got Moderator. (No staff interviews back then so was eZ :P)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">As time passed on, McZone was becoming bigger with the new
gamemode nebula. FunkyStudios wanted to make the server even bigger, and so,
the plans to transform McZone into Avicus began.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Just before Avicus was going to be released, I was asked if
I would like to take up the spot as Sr Moderator on the Network and I responded
with "Heeeeeeell Yeah!" But, I did have to go through an interview
this time and yeah.... aced it :P Anyways, so yeah Avicus was born and
everything was fine etc.... Now for more recent updates.....</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Avicore was a major update to the Avicus network. It was a
big step up in what we had achieved. Prior to the update of Avicore, I was
asked a question....Whether I wanted to take on the role as Manager. Because it
was me, I replied with "Ye bitch" and boom, I was Manager. And the
Gamemode 1 abuse was real XD I built many things in nebula such as hot tubs,
swimming areas, temples, statues and castles :P Don't forget the massive
Crosses that I stood on when I had a Jesus skin :P </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">But then came another update where Manager was then morphed
into Sr Moderator again and well yeah, story of my lyfe really..... Nah</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Then recently, I was given the opportunity to become Staff
Administrator in the server. I was enthusiastic about the task and I was
willing to take it on with much excitement. It all started off well and I was
happy and I thought that I could do many great things in the future....
but......</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The last few weeks have been very hard on me, I have had
more than 4 personal and heartbreaking issues pop up within 5 days. This was
extremely hard to deal with. I felt more alone than ever and all that
motivation I had was stripped away from me. I lost motivation for everything.
But my boys and girls here on Avicus always knew how to cheer me up and they
helped me along the way however my motivation has yet to return. That is why I
am announcing my retirement, after almost 2 year on this server.... I
think..... </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">It has been quite and journey and one that I have both loved
and treasured. I have had many laughs on the server, Skype calls, the server's
TeamSpeak and even when I am on my own. I am sure that everyone I have talked
to, I have somewhere along the line squeezed a laugh out of you :P And I am
sure that I will again.<br>
<br>
I will not fully leave the server, I will still be on TeamSpeak, Skype if you
need me and every now and then I will pop on the server to say hi.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I will not go through a list of players that I want to thank
since I want to thanks every player on this server. Even the banned players....
I want to thank them for giving me the pleasure of banning them :D and the
players who are currently on the server thank you for just keeping this server
alive. I don't plan on coming back as a staff member so you will only see me
with my Diamond tag ;) </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">So I guess it has been quite a journey! I will miss everyone
here!<br>
<br>
Finally my last announcement will be about my Successor. He is fairly new to
the staff team but has been impressive all round. He has exceeded all
expectations and I have no doubt that he will perform excellently as an Admin.
The choice was not made just by me, but by the whole Admin team so there was no
bias involved.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Adios amigos, I will see you around I guess</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Ya boi teli &lt;3</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">P.S Sorry for the Essay :P&nbsp;</p>
