Hey guys,<br><br>So if anyone knows the answer to this, feel free to help me out :P. But this is more directed toward the staff team, when do applications re-open? I'm considering applying again; football is coming to a close, and Winter is approaching. Won't have anything to do, and I really enjoyed it when I was a Staff member. So, might as well.<br><br>-Jake

I think next year maybe January or February or later depends on when they need staff.

There is no exact date for when they will open. I can say that it is likely to open in a while.

Considering you retired, if you talk to Jozz/Mango, you could come back to the team without having to send in an app.

I'm pretty sure that ex-admins get a trial/training as Mod if they pass they get promoted to Sr Mod, or something like that. Anyway welcome back Jake! c;

We usually have them every 3 months or so unless we need staff urgently before that. January-February would be my guess but it's just a guess nothing is confirmed.<br><br><b>Edit</b>: If you are thinking about coming out of retirement you need to get in touch with Mango_

<b>*Sigh*</b> Glad to see your coming back Jake, sad to see Avicus Staff Members still can't handle the retirement guidelines of ya got 3 months to come back or go through the process again unless needed...<br>If it were to be an old mod I'm sure he/she wouldn't be allowed back after 3 months.

In coming out of retirement, I'd return as a Moderator. Correct? Not sure if anything's changed with that since I last heard, so I just want to clarify.

Technically you can, we had 4 Admins before.<br>(Kylo, Pop, Peachy, Mango)<br><br>But if Jake decided to return, I doubt he'd get Admin because he's been away for too long.&nbsp;<br>Having said that, he'll definitely get Mod if he returned.
