<b>RESULTS<br></b><i><img alt="" src="http://i.gyazo.com/041faf0f9218b2ff65eaa573530217a8.png">&nbsp;</i><b>Quagmire v1.0 by Zintenka +&nbsp;TheHoopsman +&nbsp;Slvrflash</b><br><i><img alt="" src="http://i.gyazo.com/5605d4635ec6a084ae9a4ffa34668f78.png"><b>&nbsp;</b></i><b>Ascarin v1.0 by Slicorn</b><i><br><br>Credit to Trans4rm2me for the idea!</i><br><br>Event #2: Mu Cephei&nbsp;<span>This is the second official event on the Avicus Network, known as "Mu Cephei" (which is the name of a star, to fit alongside the theme.) You are given 2 weeks to construct a map in Nebula, and it can be either TDM or DTM, or even your own unique concept. However, this one has a twist unlike the other; <i>you have to use a cut of terrain</i>. This is for your own creativity and to see what you can do to make it really good compared to any other mapmakers on the network. There are a few rules however, but it should be fun for everyone!<br><br><u><b>Who are the judges?</b></u><br>Just me again. I may scout for judges in future events, however the event is not sponsored by the network but rather independently by me and with what I can do within my power.<br><br><u><b>What are the rules?</b></u><br>You have to follow these rules or your map will be rejected.<br>- You may not change the map's terrain too drastically.<br>- You may not create large craters into the map.<br>- You cannot build outside of the cut other than making obs spawn.<br>- You may not implement lava into the map.<br>- You may not hide overpowered items.<br>- You may not have more than 3 authors.<br>- You CAN build anything you want above the terrain.<br>- You CAN make rivers, mines, and underground accesses editing terrain.<br>- You CAN change the material of the grass and dirt, or remove the tall grass.<br><br><b><u>What are the guidelines?</u></b><br></span>Maps are judged in the following aspects;<br>-&nbsp;<i>Gameplay</i>&nbsp;(How do you think the map will play on the servers?)<br>-&nbsp;<i>Aesthetics</i>&nbsp;(How pleasing to the eye does it look?)<br>-&nbsp;<i>Creativity&nbsp;</i>(Is it unique and really stands out?)<br><br>YAML will be done by a map developer if you wish, and it will not count against you. I made the mistake of taking off points for this before; we're all here to help!<br><br><u><b>What gamemodes can I do?</b></u><br>You can do anything possible within YAML in Nebula, however it is reccomended to do DTM (Destroy the Monument) or TDM (Team deathmatch). OiTN is also possible, but that is a submode.<br><br><u><b>How do I submit my map?</b></u><br>Put a [CONTEST] tag in the title. By doing so, you are entered into the contest and put into a spreadsheet. It contains the map name, authors, thread link, jurisdiction of approval/denial, and it's gamemode. Only Nebula maps are eligible to be in this contest. You have the permission to post your thread link in the post below so I can see it easier.<br><br>1.&nbsp;<b>Do not give inconstructive feedback</b>&nbsp;by knocking others down to build yourself up.<br>2.&nbsp;<b>Do not steal maps; all maps are your property.</b>&nbsp;Violations of this are a perma ban.<br>3.&nbsp;<b>Do not ghost produce;</b>&nbsp;don't have other users make a map for you and you take credit.<br>4.&nbsp;<b>Do not spam judges;</b>&nbsp;patience is a large key. Wait for a response on your map.<br>5.&nbsp;<b>Do not ghost view;</b>&nbsp;don't tally a ton of thread views in your thread for attention.<br>6.&nbsp;<b>Do not make joke maps;</b>&nbsp;all maps must be true submissions to the server.<br>7.&nbsp;<b>Do not submit maps made prior to this;</b>&nbsp;all maps must be "newly produced".<br>8.&nbsp;<b>Always give credit.</b><span>&nbsp;No matter what the case, credit everyone who authored.<br></span><br><u><b>How can I create YAML?</b></u><br><span>Use our documentation resource at docs.avicus.net.<br></span><br><b><u>What is the prize?</u></b><br><span>To be announced. Most likely an emerald rank, and if said user has a rank already they may receive pets.&nbsp;<br></span><br><b><u>What about Canes Venatici?</u></b><br>Details regarding Canes; one, it's a constellation, not a star in which I messed up while writing. Second of all, testings for Canes are hopefully coming however it is not a promise; if it happens, it happens. If it doesn't, it doesn't.<br><br><b><u>Is the spreadsheet public?</u></b><br>Yes! <a rel="nofollow" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a9CYPRvSxJWrkJiugM7Hl3dlCmi6M5iwYG-xU5dhK0w/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a9CYPRvSxJWrkJiugM7Hl3dlCmi6M5iwYG-xU5dhK0w/edit?usp=sharing</a><br>&nbsp;<br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://avicus.net/forums/88cf15919">PREVIOUS EVENT</a><br>NEXT EVENT<br><br><b>Map Download:</b>&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/x84g5al6ig7g901/Contest.zip?dl=0">https://www.dropbox.com/s/x84g5al6ig7g901/Contest.zip?dl=0</a><br><b>Map Images:</b>&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://imgur.com/a/Ca0OR">http://imgur.com/a/Ca0OR</a>&nbsp;(You may change the time of day.)<br><br><br><b>You may rotate the map in any way you like.</b> You may have a custom void gap and custom islands or something between the gap.<br><br><b>Starts;</b> <i>October 31st, 2014</i><br><b>Ends;</b> <i>November 14, 2014</i><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span><br><br></span>

I don't think the Cartographers are doing it this time either, we just don't like the cut idea.

Event 3 is peeking around the corner. With the contest coming to a close, we unfortunately did not have a strong round of submissions like the last one -- we had 2 with honors going to Slicorn, Zintenka, TheHoopsman, and Slvrflash. The spreadsheet has been updated in accordance to this, and I am currently working on setting up the third. Some things I'd like to address;<br><br><b>Canes Venatici is not dead.</b> I will do my best to test the maps when I can and hopefully get the maps in rotations. All 4 maps have been acknowledged and the 3 that have not yet been added will be, and tested. I appreciate everyone's hard work to participate in them, and for those uninformed: Yes, emerald ranks were given to Evocal and Slicorn for achieving first place.<br><br><b>TheHoopsman is going to help.</b> For at least event/contest 3, TheHoopsman has been taken as a judge and will help review maps so I have different opinions to base off of instead of my own to prevent bias. Upon doing this, he is aware he cannot participate in the contests he judges and has to follow the rules.<br><br><b>Ascarin and Quagmire have been added. </b>When I can, I'll test the maps along with the Venatici contest. These two have been reviewed by me, and I will decide the winner once we are able to properly test them. Positions have not yet been entirely decided.<br><br>Any clarification you need can be posted below. Thanks for reading!

It has been decided that Quagmire wins the contest. As everyone is aware, we didn't get many submissions however after a bit of testing on the side and review itself, Quagmire took the win. Thanks to Zintenka, TheHoopsman, Slicorn, and Slvrflash for participating in Mu Cephei.<br><br>The builders of Quagmire will receive gold. Thanks for being a good sport everyone (&lt;3 Sli)<br><br>That concludes event #2. Event #3 coming soon!
