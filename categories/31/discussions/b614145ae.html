Why not have one encouraging players to work with the new Atlas features that will be coming out soon...? So there's a bigger pool of maps to test with.

The reason why me and Arigenn stopped this was because we had a lack of map submissions to those contests. We only had 1-2 maps submitted in the last couple of contests.

It's been a while, but I want to host another. Hopefully it can be official, since I'm open to XMLing them for people and making adjustments.

I've talked to Arigenn about this like in February and he said that me and him may start it up again when avicus's player count has grown. And by the looks of things it has.

The reason why so few people entered was because there was a map making contest consistently on. So people got sick of it. As there hasn't been one in some time plus it's with completely new gamemodes, therefore I'm sure it will be popular...

This might not work, but awhile ago when you guys had a Steam game as a prize, chances are that might get the attention of a lot of people. Let's be honest, nobody really cares about credits anymore.

We should make a general post for all events on what should be in the prize pool. Could be an amazon gift card or just a steam game, but it could also be a console code or credits/a rank. There's a lot to see after.

Perhaps a prize could be determined by the amount of maps/people entering. More maps entered would mean a better prize such as, say, a rank. This would hopefully encourage more people to submit maps.
