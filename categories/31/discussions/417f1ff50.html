Earlier today, there was a huge argument between a lot of Avicus members and some staff members, and I was one the members involved.<br>I know that it was wrong to continue my argument about the ban, and I did not want to imply that some staff members are not doing their job properly, because I know that they are.<br>I really hope that you will not hold any grudges against me, but I understand if you will remain mad, because I know that what I did was wrong.<br><br>I am especially sorry to :<br><br>-NolanDalton<br>-EmeraldSword85<br>-Mooch24<br>-Princezz_Dubstep<br>-The_Detonator_<br>-cole1crc<br><br>And any other members who were involved in this issue.<br>I hope that you understand that I meant no offence to any of you, and I hope that you do not lose any respect towards me.<br>Thank you,<br>-Porky.

I know, but now that I look back at the conversation I admit that I seemed kind of pushy and rude :/
