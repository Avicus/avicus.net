(They were removed)<br><br>Claustrophobia is my map and I hope you respect that, and it was a favorite map of many because of it's unique style and people saying we needed more maps like that. Well, unfortunately, I have had to remove that due to several inconsistencies in the gameplay and aesthetics. The clay patterns were uneven, the entire map was off to the side by 1 block, there was a bunch of stone junk everywhere, the tunnels were too narrow to PvP in, and the map was either you love it or you hate it. I am making a v2, so expect to see that within the next week.<br><br>Castle Adventure 2, while I observed, was imho the worst playing map. There was a lot of kit mixing due to the chests, getting out of spawn was too much of a challenge, the map was too laggy because of the constant leaf decay and lighting updates, and half of the map was never used making it seem small + the gameplay was not up to par with Avicus Network quality. Just thought I'd inform you about it. Please don't complain about either map.<br><br><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/UFr1Dci.png"><br><br><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/2Q9e14T.png"><br><br><br>

Claustrophobia was such a good map :c<br>Do you plan on editing it at all so it's up to standards? Or do you plan on just letting it die?<br>

I loved Claustrophobia along with a lot of people. And no one noticed that inconsistency xD. I understand Castle Adventure 2 though.

Sad to see claustrophobia go, although Im glad there will be a v2. I do agree that sometimes the tunnels were a bit thin, and such and such, but as long is that is fixed in the next version it will be perfect.<br>
