Im sorry I couldn't think of a better title, but im going to talk about my demotion.<br><br>How it really happened, even though it happened a pretty long time ago, there is some stuff that I did that I dont want anyone to get demoted for never again. <b>Ever.</b><br><br><br><i>I suggest the possible future mods to read the whole thing carefully.</i><br><br><br>First , before we start, I want to say that I really cared about getting Mod for helping the server, a longtime ago.&nbsp;<br><br><br><b>&nbsp;Until the spirit had faded and I kinda lost hope of getting Full Mod. &nbsp; </b><br><br><br>Secondly, that we all have a life, outside of the server, and that some days are good, some other days are awful. <br><br><br><b>This one was pretty bad.</b><br><br><br>Put the two things together and you get a really shitty day where you do a bunch of decisions you will regret later.<br><br><br>Fast and stupid decisions. Awful decisions.<br><br><br>You pretty much know how I got demoted, you have a nice idea for the least.. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><br>Well, I wrote that text a long time ago on the old forums, showing all the mods how I got demoted by posting it on the "Players Reports section" &nbsp;I told everything inside out. They told me how they felt about it too.<br><br><br>And this is a copy of that text, this is everything, inside out, on how i got demoted,&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://pastebin.com/LpDAkywD">http://pastebin.com/LpDAkywD</a><br><br><br>That said, I hope noones ever makes the same awful mistake, at least something similar. &nbsp;Because trust me, it tastes so f*cking bad.<br><br>Also, im not going for mod anymore, I give up<br>for those of you interested, this was my last application.&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://pastebin.com/8ymbvYzX">http://pastebin.com/8ymbvYzX</a>

That sucks, though I understand why, I don't understand howsie's response (nothing against him, however). You had almost all of the staff members say "I want you back!!!!", and he just kinda.. *poofed*

Honestly disgusted. It was pretty obvious by the messages you were having a bad day, and then Howsie decides to make it worse by demoting you.

Adrian I am sorry for the stuff ive done, I was kinda desesperate for getting the promotion, who knows if that would have helped, you know increasing the process? &nbsp; &nbsp;It didnt :c<br><br><br><br><br><br>And yes Shadowbladz, you understood 100% of it, I was indeed having a pretty bad day and I wish i never sent that message to Gill, in fact, the next day after I sent him the message, I was playing on the server and enjoying it ! I still remember how it happened...

But Howsie is not the one to blame and he certainly didnt try to make it worse by demoting me, he probably didnt know what I was going through and taught I really was going to be quitting the server<br><br><br>He probably didn't understand the message that I sent Gill was written in 2 mins on a quick and stupid decision. A head "bump"?

Wow. I thought you simply got demoted for inactivity.<br>Warrior, this shouldn't have happened. You have always been a good friend and you never got mad when i made a mistake. You would have made a great moderator on this server. You shouldnt have been demoted its as simple as that, Venum :(.

I simply do not understand why people say "You should not have been demoted"<br>You guys dont know whats going on in the staff, not now, not before and not until you DO get in the staff.<br>Until that point all you have is one point of view, and i suggest you do not make any rash comments.......

Well Yoav, I think I explained my situation very well and im not asking for players to take my side. &nbsp;Neither asking them to hate on the higher staff members..<br><br><br>This topic is not about me raging at them, its about preventing others from doing the same mistake, I do not want to get Mod anymore and I dont think they are even going to give it to me.

Maybe if they'd known you better they'd have tried to help you out? Maybe you just didn't get to know them well enough so it all came muddled up?

I'm not going to sugarcoat this...I honestly never saw you as mod, and, although I was happy for you, I didn't expect you to go very far. And....I just didn't think you performed well.<br>(Although be comforted by the fact that I feel the same way or a similar way for many other mods.)

Damn. I read all 800+ lines (and spaces).&nbsp;<br><br>I guess its it's too bad you won't be going for Jr. Mod. &nbsp;Not taking a side on wether you should have been demoted or not, but it's a shame that you won't be staff again.

He didn't say ever again, because my last application was put under review since It was considered good, but looks like he decided to deny it in the end so he has a nice group of 25 doods..

Sorry man. No offense to Howsie, or to anyone, but this makes me think that you shouldn't of been demoted. I wish someone could've at least explained to you why you were demoted. Im sorry this happened and I wish someone could've helped you more. It sucks that you were in a bad mood and that's why you were demoted. I think there was a better way to handle this situation.

No!<br><br>As I said on the first paragraph, this topic is meant to prevent others from doing the same mistake,<br><br>The staff just didnt allow me to do it, well, they didnt want me to show all of it back then, but its been a long time and i felt like the people needed to know what really happened.<br><br><br>Things have cool down and I taught it was the right time since there is a new batch of mods upcoming.
