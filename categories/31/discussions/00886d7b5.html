Walls.<br><br>Instead of 4 squadrons, 2.<br>1 team vs another, enough supplies for each player.<br>No kits.<br><br>Could work, could not. Ideas please.

Vetoing would be interesting, but I don't think Walls should be its own tourney. Maybe have it as a mixed or even a mini tourney.

That's a matter of opinion, I like mining the diamonds, finding the secret chests and all that, plus in walls, if you die, your out, where in TDM, you respawn.<br><br>So ultimately, it's a matter of opinion, because I like walls a lot more than TDM but others may have the opposite opinion

There's more strategy if you have to get your own resources and choose how to use them/split them up among your team. If kits are allowed, we could see some interesting kit strategies.&nbsp;<br><br>Of all the games on Avicus, walls is the most dynamic. There is a large variety of aspects that can be taken advantage of (potions, enchantments, lava, skybases, traps, tnt). The games may not be as long as nebula but they will definitely be just as intense.

Walls DOES have strats and tactics<br><br>1. lava/fire for pvp<br><br>2. You can place blocks (skybases/traps)<br><br>3.

Ok first all, regarding your first point, I don't see anything coming out from that. How's using lava or fire stratting or making any tactics. And to be honest, I'll agree with the other 2 points merely because they're fair enough.<br><br>Yet, you can't say TDM doesn't have anything. You still need to organize the team-pushes and what not, plus, working as a group during the match is an important factor as well.<br><br>I didn't disagree with a walls tournament just because I don't like it but that gamemode doesn't seem so important to me and I'd rather make just a mini-tourney with it.

I personally don't like DTM vey much, there's lots of tourney's for that. It's a matter of opinion, you DTM people get your tourney time, let us have ours. You can join, have fun if you want to, but there's no reason to completely hate the idea just because it's not as popular.

Right now, we sense that we need to focus on other gamemodes. I have never seen walls as a competitive gamemode, and that's what a tournament is all about. In addition, there are only a few that play it on a regular basis.

The thing is with walls, and i know pelp already said it but their isn't a large enough player base for the community to support it and ,aking walls competitive would be very difficult. Also walls scrim servers? Walls bracket, even walls teams, it's just not a gamemode that is cut out for a tournament.

Walls is the 2nd most played gamemode (usually 15-30 players online which is funny compared to DTM -_-) so why can't we revive this gamemode by showing what it really is for more players to actually play other gamemodes instead of the same gamemode every day.

Because there is more in other gamemodes. If we hadn't planned ahead, walls might have been an option, but we took the decision to start preparing something else already, however, nothing is confirmed. If the community does show more interest in a walls tournament, we might have to do some more thinking.

IMO, we really don't need another Nebula tourney. Nebula is the only game mode that always has at least 1 match open. We should try advertising other game modes like Walls and Nexus. If we make a tourney for lets say Walls, we could boost our player count not only for the server, but for the actually game mode, too.

Maybe because you've knocked their confidence by being a little asshole. Maybe you want a walls tournament and maybe lots of people on this thread do. But even more don't want a walls tournament and actually the DTM tourney did attract new players. Only about half of the teams entered were all Avicus member teams anyway, look and you will see that many new players arrived for the tournament.

Don't you think some Walls players were "annoyed" when we had our DTM server, and then found out that we'd be having another? The Walls community has almost no members on the forums,which kind of sucks since they aren't sharing what they believe. I can assure you, there are a lot of people who want a Walls tourney. Even people who don't regularly play it, like me.

Walls is the 2nd most played gamemode (usually 15-30 players online which is funny compared to DTM -_-) so why can't we revive this gamemode by showing what it really is for more players to actually play other gamemodes instead of the same gamemode every day. Some players are getting sick of the usual "DTM" on avicus. Might as well rename avicus "The DTM Server"

Na, cause you got it wrong. I don't mind walls at all, in fact I quite like it.<br><br>but let's be real here, pel already explained a tournament should be competitive and somewhat skill based. Randomly finding spots of iron and right clicking on chests isn't exactly competitive as a team based tournament/event. Not to mention, for some reason you think having a walls tournament will do anything positive for the gamemode, when really, it won't. For the nebula tourney, there was a struggle for teams to even get a spot after 16 teams (which by itself isn't even that much), and I'll be extremely surprised if more than 16 teams will even give a fuck about a walls tourney (avicus is known for nebula). A TDM would also be a good idea because again, it's actually skill based. Walls is literally just who can tower the highest or who can get the most lucky with finding iron etc.<br><br>It's a joke.

Well that depends on what maps are played, if we use regular walls rot maps, the "random boxes" and iron are complete obsolete problems, because a skill needed in walls is knowing the map and it's secrets.<br><br>Now if they are new maps, that's a different story, but you can still practice the new ones on practice servers

<b>Here is my take on this particular idea<br></b>Walls may be fun, sure. I enjoy playing it whenever I don't feel like playing PvP based gamemodes. Actually, that pretty much backups the argument that "Walls isn't skill based". Instead, it's knowledge based - in the sense that the player with the most knowledge about the item locations will most likely end up winning; no matter their actual ability to sword fight or archer. Which is exactly why new players enjoy walls. They don't feel the need to play competitively.&nbsp;<br><br>Additionally, TDM is actually more than just PvP engagements. Think about the team work that could be involved and how teams lock down choke points. Let me tell you this... a team can end up victorious even against the most strongest opponents if they play the gamemode/map well. In walls, it's not like that. You spend X amount of time gathering items - some of which are OP - and abuse that to rush teams (essentially cheap wins). &nbsp;<br><br><u>@BowSpamNoob:<br></u><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; "><i>"...a skill needed in walls is knowing the map and it's secrets."</i><br></span><br>I'm sure I'm not the only one... but I don't want teams winning purely off their map experience.<br><b><br></b><b><br></b>

Lol, people who play walls who aren't on forums said they would join the forums just to be apart of the tournament. &nbsp;And plus, why not advertise a tournament is happening on the server. &nbsp;Idk if you do, I assume you do.<br><br><br>There is TONS of strategies. &nbsp;Remember, in walls your more open to what you can do in that game. &nbsp;You could make traps, Rush teams that are still mining, I know that Murph has this one srat where she crouches and her team mate doesn't. &nbsp;So when someone runs in thinking its there fighting just one they are surprised to find more in there. &nbsp;In Tetris, the bow in the middle in the sky so people have the strat to make a small base the build over there.<br><br><br>I wouldn't say Walls isn't competitive but isn't so dependent on some pvp skills. &nbsp;I think you guys underestimate how much fun a Walls match can really be. &nbsp;And it could always just be a mini tourney where you don't need 16 teams. &nbsp;I'm just saying, there is a whole group of people on Avicus who feel ignored since &nbsp;the majority play Nebula, but there are other game modes that aren't even played on the server, so why not try something new for once?

Because i am sure you have located every player who enjoys walls on the server and contacted them about a possible tournament, not only that i'm sure that they would all join a team.<br>Lets face it walls attracts barely any players, at most 50 people on the server would enjoy a walls tournament. Oh wait that makes up 4 teams.&nbsp;<br><br>All these strats aren't exactly complicated or advanced in fact they are simple, i'm not denying walls can't be fun, it actually is quite a lot of fun but it's just not a game mode that is cut out to be played competitively.&nbsp;<br><br>If you have followed what i have been saying a Conquer style tournament would be great. It includes TDM from nebula and obviously nexus is also TDM and if there a maps with capture points it also incorporates CTH. 3 gamemode in 1 tournament, try and argue that walls would still be a better idea i dare you/<br><br>16 teams isn't a large tournament anyway, infact it is quite a small tournament and as mentioned before walls could only really pull 4 competitive teams.&nbsp;<br>Your arguments are flawed and there is no way of denying that walls isn't a good game mode for a tournament.

Maybe because you've knocked their confidence by being a little asshole. Maybe you want a walls tournament and maybe lots of people on this thread do. But even more don't want a walls tournament and actually the DTM tourney did attract new players. Only about half of the teams entered were all Avicus member teams anyway, look and you will see that many new players arrived for the tournament. The officials had already started organising what I believe is a TDM and CTH style tourney which once again will attract more players, TDM is also an overlooked gamemode on Avicus, it also is easily compatible with a tournament bracket and scrim servers and everything else that comes with it.&nbsp;<br><br>Stop whining about not getting your walls tournament and either play in the next tournament or don't, who knows there might be a walls tourney sometime but you have to know when to give up kid.

<p>If you don't like the idea, then just stay out of the tournament. You have TDM tourney's all the time, why can't we have some fun?

You really think strategies work in walls? If you're up against a player who actually knows what the fuck they're doing, you stand no chance. Ever played MCPVP HG?

How would the other team know that the guy/girl is a veteran?

So please, if you don't like the idea, just just stay out of the conversation. </p><p>"walls is in the minority" How would you know that if you only play TDM. You can't. Walls is fun to some people, if you don't like the game, then you don't have to play. You're not being forced to... Just stop...</p>

Maybe you haven't but there's no denying over half the teams entered weren't from<br>AV and not only that if a Nebula tourney, AV's most popular game mode didn't cause a player rise then a Walls tourney ain't either.

Again. How has a 1v1 at the end got anything to do with walls separately as it's own gamemode lol. I never said you automatically lose if you have someone who knows how to beat the walls type strategies you're thinking of, simply, that it takes those strategies like towering or w/e out of the game and basically makes it a luck based TDM (due to mining and shit).

<p class="MsoNormal">Okay, so my opinion on this whole topic. I personally think
that the next tournament should not be TDM, due to the fact it doesn’t involve
much strategies. You can say “holding choke points” is a strategy but it isn’t
really because depending on the type of TDM it wouldn’t work, since most of the maps would be
1 hit or have protection not allowing players to place blocks. If officials already have
something in the works for the next tournament please for the love of god make
it DTM or CTW, something that actually has a ton of teamwork and planning needed.
I talked to one official that is completely against the idea of a TDM tournament
because it would be extremely unfair to some teams, when you have to play
against PvP based teams like BC and Impact. Even look at this topic, two of the
players that really want a TDM tournament are probably two of the best PvPers
in Minecraft. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Also I’m 100% for the idea of a Walls tournament or mini
event, heck I would even host it myself. Although I don’t think it could work
on the same size of a scale as the Omega Championship simply because most Walls
players don’t have forum accounts or access to TS3. I’ve talked to couple
officials some that are completely for this idea because of how unique it is. I'm not saying this event needs to happen very soon, I just think it should sometime in the near future. <br></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Wouldn’t that be the point of this event to get more players

<p class="MsoNormal">Walls is nothing like TDM or CTH, you don’t need to actually

I understand that it is entirely tactical, but there is not a lot of interesting features to it other than PvP. At lest with CTW and DTM you need to have defenders, offense and mid, making it far more tactical. Fairness wise if my team were to play yours the score would be completely one sided as we don't have players that are as highly skilled with PvP.

If you don't have defense, mid and offense in aTDM you're screwed, depending on the map albeit. You still have positions in TDM just not something as simple as Defense, Offense and mid.

It won't be 1 hit kill, and you can place blocks. The maps we have so far tested very well, so it should be fine. If you can't seem to find strategies in a tdm, it's a gamemode that doesn't suit you, which is perfectly fine. Also, this 'Official' hasn't voiced their concern to us, so we can't do anything if they don't communicate with us. Also the Officials who want a walls a tournament, again haven't communicated with us, so that's there loss. I am not going to force Officials to share there ideas, but to be honest, it's rather dissapointing that they don't share these ideas.

1. No it's not.&nbsp;<br>2. Not really.<br>3. Okay i agree.

1. It may not be the main point of hosting a tournament but it turns out to be a major factor. Even if its temporary, we can't really see how Nebula was increased by the past event because it was already the gamemode with the most players.<br><br>2. It has some, I will agree that all the gamemodes have some tactics.Walls has traps, skybases, full on rushes, attacking mid and making potions. Those are just a few I can think of, but there is several more.

If you don't have defense, mid and offense in aTDM you're screwed, depending on the map albeit. You still have positions in TDM just not something as simple as Defense, Offense and mid. I'm not denying CTW and DTM are more tactical but TDM is still tactical and far more so than walls.&nbsp;<br><br>As i said before Pvp is a skill, it's not our fault that you may not be as good in pvp, but because we might be better at pvp than you that is no argument to not hosting a tournament.

1. I realize that people still have positions during a TDM match but its still not as interesting as DTM or CTW when its completely based on PvP.<br><br>2. I know just stating the fact that some teams like Bad Company, Impact and even Apollo would dominate a TDM tournament.

1. That could be due to the fact that the tournament didn't exactly put Avicus in a shining light.<br><br><br>2. Maybe so it's just walls is a game mode that happens to be effected largely by map knowledge and luck.

I'll spill the beans. Walls will not be a game mode for the next tournament. But don't worry, it will happen sooner or later.

You don't seem to understand that TDM is entirely tactical. Yes pvp is a large part but that's a skill in itself. &nbsp;There is far more to TDM than holding down chokepoints. You have to know what players will be playing where, if their is an &nbsp;objective like a hill or a scorebox who does what, who will stand back and bow and when you will organise a team push.&nbsp;<br><br>No tournament will include 1 hit maps.&nbsp;<br><br>Also to prove a point about me being able to use his argument:&nbsp;<br><p style="margin: 0px 0px 12px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; ">If you don't like the idea, then just stay out of the tournament. You have &nbsp;lots of walls servers that are always available. &nbsp;Why can't we have some fun? Plus, I rarely plays TDM and CTH, and i'm still supporting it as much as any TDM and CTH player would. TDM and CTH is fun, it may not be 'your type of game' but that doesn't mean that we can't have one. And at this point, I'd be a little frustrated if there was a walls tourney. So please, if you don't like the idea, just just stay out of the conversation.</p><p style="margin: 0px 0px 12px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; ">Oh look, it worked. &nbsp;Michah's entire argument just with some words changed. What a suprise.</p>

Regarding your first paragraph, don't you use at least half of those in walls?

Hello!<br><br>This is literally my first post on the forums!<br>I have very little to say, I joined avicus when it was still called McZone, I had quit avicus for maybe 6-7 months, and only now a few days ago did I finally get back into avicus and minecraft in general and I started playing on walls!&nbsp;<br><br>The idea of a walls tournament in the future is a great idea! I understand the next tournament will not be a walls tourney, but the next one should be! It is hard for new players to go into a large gamemode like nebula and do good. Walls is different, pretty much anyone can join the server and play. Even though I just came back to avicus, I already made many friends, and could make a walls team. So to the people who say 'there won't be enough teams' How do you know? Lets try, lets see if teams will join. I respect everyones opinion, so please respect mine!&nbsp;<br><br>-Pat :D
