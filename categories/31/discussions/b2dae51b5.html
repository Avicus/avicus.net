:.( dil I promise you that you were one of the most trusted players on this server. And when we promoted you, we knew that you were the best choice out of all of the others. You were the one that started off the handpicking system, I'm so sorry it had to end this way, and I'm sorry that some people looked the other way. You're the first player I mentored and you were my last. And I'm happy to say that you helped me a lot and sticked with me till the end. Please stay in touch bud.&nbsp;<br><br><br><br>Its been been a pleasure having you with us. And its personally my pleasure to have worked with you :.(((

Why would you demote one of your better moderators just because he was inactive on a not-so-popular platform? <br>TeamSpeak isn't exactly thriving...this demotion achieved nothing, it did not benefit the staff team any futher, only damaged it by losing a reliable moderator..such a waste of a dedicated and talented person.<br><br>Thanks for for the work that you put in dil, thinking back to when you were a Jr, you've grown and learnt a lot. <br>Thanks for everything mate.<br><br>:)

We have emphasized to the Moderators (specifically Dil) multiple times about TeamSpeak activity, especially when he hasn't been active at all since he was promoted.<br><br>We went very easy on him with TeamSpeak, as we need Mods to be active to make it thrive, and still he contributed nothing to his duties after months of us asking.<br><br>So it did involve TeamSpeak, yes. But it also involved a lack of doing his duties, ignoring numerous warnings, and ignorance of an entire Avicus service.<br><br>:)

Dill it's really sad for you to get demoted. You were an awesome Moderator who responded to me when there is trouble. I would like to thank you for the great service you did to the community. Even though you don't know me, I still remember you going from Default -&gt; Diamond -&gt; Ref -&gt; Jr Mod -&gt; Mod. Honestly, I did not expect you to get demoted and I expected you to get Sr Mod, because of how good of a mod you are. Well, I hope good things will appear in your future, Good Luck!
