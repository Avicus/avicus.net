Leaving?

<b>I'm sorry..</b><br><br>For my discussions<br>For my suggestions<br>For having fun<br>For joking around<br>For helping the community&nbsp;<br>For reporting<br>Most of all, I'm sorry for my presence on this server<br><br>It is April 28th, 2016, 10:20 PM EST where I have decided to quit Avicus, in fact quit Minecraft in general since this is the only flame that was keeping me going. I was an Avicus member for 3+ years and counting, it was a wonderful experience in meeting new friends on this server and keeping in touch socially.&nbsp;<br><br>I'm leaving due to many conflicts. It is a very long story, but all I'm going to say is to the senior staff team is have some trust on the fan base. They have been here the most obviously and if you want to keep this server going, listen to them, comply with them, and keep in touch with them. They know the drawbacks of this server.<br><br>I would like to give a huge thanks to <i>Arigenn (Ethan)</i> for giving me the chance to talk to him as it gave me the final motivation I needed to finally quit. My life is progressing with many difficulties and I needed this. It was fun keeping close relations with some staff here as well as many new friends. You know who you're. Once again, I'm sorry.

Aw, bye Centralking, I am sorry for everything I have said to you. I hope your life brings you joy and wonderful experiences. Courage will be your friend as you grow older. As Atticus said from the book To Kill A Mocking Bird,&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Verdana;  ">“I wanted you to see what real courage is, instead of getting the idea that courage is a man with a gun in his hand.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Verdana;  ">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Verdana;  ">It’s when you know you’re licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see through it no matter what.” I hope we can keep that in mind for the rest of our lives :P.</span>
