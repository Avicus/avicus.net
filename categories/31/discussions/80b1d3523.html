Hello, everyone. Recently I thought about myself and realized my Moderating isn't sufficient enough. And I've been having some other issues in real life situations. So I figured instead of doing my typical Moderating, I'd find a different way to impact you all. I care about each and every one of you. So, I'm making this thread so you can feel comfortable letting it out and talking it through with someone. Minecraft help isn't enough. I want to actually impact your&nbsp;<i>life.</i>&nbsp;<br><br>So if you ever need anything at all, feel free to Skype message me @jake41901, and ill always be here to lend a hand. If you are 110% sure you're comfortable sharing some problems you've been dealing with, don't hesitate to let it out. Just make sure you reply to this topic saying "I" &nbsp;before adding me, just so I know who I'm expecting to talk to. Have a nice day guys.&nbsp;<br><br>-Jake

(Not trying to bump this) but I posted this very late last night, so I'm assuming not many people were able to see it. Just making sure everyone knows what's going on.
