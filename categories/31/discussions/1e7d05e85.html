Aero handled his <b><u>RETIREMENT</u></b>&nbsp;(not demotion) fine. Also you just defended 99 for how he reacted to his demotion. Lastly you handled your demotion by joining the resistance, an anti staff group. Even after that you sold them out to Michael to try and save your Jr Mod trial. I don't think your Solstice is Frozen after that roasting kiddo.

Well, here we go Zac.<br><br>To your first point, Aerosmith's "thanks" to Refuse was rude, uncalled for and utterly idiotic.

Aero's message to Refuse had nothing to do with his retirement nor is it any of your concern (I believe it was addressed to refuse who is in fact capable of holding her own without you) . Aero gets to be mad when someone who pretends to be his friend is actually going behind his back trying to get him demoted. If it happened to you or anyone else I am sure you/they would have something to say about it. 99 himself even admitted to bad behavior after his demotion so you must be blinded by your bias. You joined the resistance before your last demotion but after the first. You did actually rat on the Resistance to Michael as confirmed by Michael himself, why exactly would they want you to rat them out? :3
