Staff Reassessment Day

</h1>
Hello everyone...again!<br><br>Yesterday, the staff team gathered for a meeting, and we discussed the results of the Sr. Staff meeting, as well as some other mini things that aren't too important. However, there was one thing that many of you would have guessed is coming. Well, it's here! On Saturday, April 4th, at 6 PM EST, the Senior Staff will be hosting our second Staff Reassessment Day. This means we will demote each and every Moderator, and discuss their strengths and weaknesses. After we discuss one Moderator, we will take a majority vote, which will decide whether they will receive their rank back or not. The Senior Staff will be moderating during this interval, but hopefully it will not take very long. If you were wondering why we decided to open staff apps so soon, this is why, and you probably already guessed that.<br><br>Have a great day/night!

Good to see Admins and Seniors are moving fast and making the server progress again not like when we just had 6 Senior Mods c:<br><br>I've been waiting for this day to come due to the complains a lot of regular members (Including me) were making, hope this turns out good and the staff team becomes much more efficient than before!

Aside from the routine of cleaning up the moderators, senior mods should also be looked at as well. There may be some bad seed thriving within it too. I'm not sure if there are any, but it would be nice to have a reassessment for them as well.
