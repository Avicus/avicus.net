Hello community, it's Fluenza here!<br>Over the past few weeks, Jake and I have been discussing a LOT of topics in which could potentially move Avicus forward&nbsp;into a more enjoyable, safe and friendly community!<br>One of our topics were monthly updates, informing you guys what is planned, currently in the process of being enforced and confirming information!<br><br><b>AuraFusion</b><br>====================================<br><i>These last few weeks have been great. I stayed up almost all night of every night discussing with Jozz about how we could improve, things we should implement, community ideas, etc. And everything seems to really be coming together. I'm feeling a lot more comfortable with the role as an Administrator now, it almost feels natural for me to do what I do.</i><i><br></i><i>List of things I've accomplished personally as an Administrator over these last few weeks:</i><i><br></i><i>1. I am now used to being an Administrator.</i><i><br></i><i>2. Able to attend most interview sessions/individual interviews, meetings, etc.</i><i><br></i><i>3. Activity on TeamSpeak has skyrocketed since my promotion took place</i><i><br></i><i>4. Community Party was a success (Lot of positive feedback)</i><i><br></i><i>5. Definitely planning on hosting more Community Events in the future (Tournaments, UHC's, etc.)</i><i><br></i><span><i>6. I've come up with a lot of ideas aside from all of this, that I will bring up in the next</i><i>&nbsp;</i></span><i>Admin</i><span><i>&nbsp;</i><i>meeting.</i></span><i><br></i><i>7. The amount of hard word Joel and I have put in to our multiple-hour-at-a-time discussions has really paid off, we've come up with more ideas I ever would have thought imaginable.</i><i><br></i><i><br></i><br><i>In the future, (whether that be in the near future, or a ways from now) I'm planning on hosting some sort of tourney, or PvP related competition so our Community can duke it out in a real deal situation. The winners will be awarded (not sure what yet) But that's just scratching the surface.. I still have a lot on my mind.</i><br><br><br><b>Fluenza_</b><br>====================================<br><b>Staff recruitment system<i> </i></b><i>As you know, applications are closed and we're finalising interviews and Jr Mods. I'm not here to talk about that though,as I am going to announce that hand picked staff system will take effect in mid-march. We're only trialing it, so don't worry. If this system doesn't work we'll revert back to applications.What essentially is going to happen, is we'll open applications every 4 months and whilst they're closed, hand picked staff will be enforced. This ensures constant flow of staff however I will make a seperate thread detailing this topic, as it'll need to be focused around community assistance. (answering questions and what-not) <br></i><br><b>Changes to the senior staff team</b>&nbsp;<i>So right now, we're lacking active sr mods. We're currently struggling on making every interview work and we do apologise for that. To cater for this, it is planned that there will NO longer be a Staff Administrator role, but instead the Senior Moderators would take on that role. Us Administrators would be focused on community and community only.It puts a LOT of stress on me since I have to deal with complaints 24/7 and everyone relies on one person. This way, it relies on the whole sr staff team.This is yet to be confirmed, and is awaiting discussion in the upcoming senior staff meeting.&nbsp;</i><br><i>That being said, we're already scouting for possible candidates for sr mod. We plan to do things differently, but that has merely been discussed. Expect some Mod &gt; Sr mod promotions within the next month or so.<br><br></i><b>Community suggestions&nbsp;</b><i>It has come to my attention that there have been a LOT of community suggestions on the Forums which have been ignored by the development team &amp; administration team. This is why I have decided to list all of the suggestion threads onto a spreadsheet so Ivy can read through it all. Whether this will be public viewing is still up for debate. This is not formal, so don't expect a comment on the thread stated the suggestions status. A thread might only have 4 views, but it could potentially be on the spreadsheet.</i><i><br></i><br><b>Comment from the Staff Admin&nbsp;</b><i>No one is perfect, and I have to admit that I haven't been performing the best over the past few weeks. Over the course of Christmas in 2014, I enforced stricter rules &nbsp;for staff because quite frankly I have had enough of people pushing my buttons.&nbsp;I have been telling the staff (since I became Admin) calmly as possible and they didn't seem to listen to me... That was the last time I will warn them calmly. I don't hesitate to demote, as long as there is proof. Therefore I sign off my message with a reminder; please&nbsp;gather proof whenever you see a staff member doing something wrong!<br><br></i><br><br>This will be a monthly thread... updating you guys on what's been happening behind the scenes and what has been done with particular issues.

I think we need something really creative&nbsp;<b>now</b>. (Don't count the Winter Update). I'm thinking about something big like pushing or enforcing the UHC or the PvP competition, there have been a lot of complaints about the lack of events so I guess pushing this 2 would be a good idea. Also you need to make sure the server that is going to be used for this events (If we do them) needs to be a server out of lag, like 0% laggy so the event doesn't go into a massive list of complaints, also make sure it's a server Avicus related because non Avicus related servers or non organized servers tend to crash or fail, hope you take this in count. ~ Juan

Hand picked staff might not be liked at start by some players that really wanted mod but don't think they are capable of getting it but I think that with time that issuw will resolve and the system would be better.<br><br>Something that I feel could make the community more alive and attract more players is a big update to the servers. Im not talking maps. I am talking gamemodes. Add what people that aren't already playing would come here for and play.&nbsp;<br>I will take Factions for example.<br>People would play factions but you would need to make them unique. I have an idea what could possibly work and would mix factions and prison into the same gamemode/server. If you want to talk about that you can add me on skype. Ask Evocal for it.<br>UHC would be fun but so many networks have been doing it that I feel like it wouldn't make a big difference.

There is a huge update coming soon (The Winter Update), not as big as the Avicore update but still big enought to make great impact in our community!<br>This update will bring new gamemodes to the server but sadly, it'll might remove some too :(<br>The date for this update hasn't been confirmed yet but you can keep an eye out for the forums and Avicus's facebook where sneakpeaks are given every certain amount of likes. (I can't put links for now because I'm on my iPad).<br><b>P.S:</b><b></b> I think factions isn't going to be putted in this update nor the server because it doesn't match with the server's play style.

From what I've heard, the Winter Update might actually be bigger than the Avicore update.

Thats great that a huge update is coming but chances are that nothing will change with the amount of players and the community without some massive advertising.<br><br>As for factions it would not be your normal factions. Thats why I said that we can talk about it on skype if needed. It would be kind of factions mixed with prison mixed with uhc mixed with custom maps that the community would make but that would need a lot of work on the plugin part so I don't have big hopes for that.<br>Factions on its own don't fit but we can make them fit with some original changes which could attract more players.<br><br>I really hope that in the update you guys won't just recycle gamemode ideas from other servers. Don't get me wrong I like games like Survival Games etc. but it won't attact new players as there are already a ton of servers out there with it. You need to put a unique twist on it that people will like and will want to play. And it would be a twist that other servers don't have which means it would attract more players.<br><br>The server has a lot of possibilities. It could go far. Even if its on its downfall (by player count) it could still get back where it used to be it just needs to be revived but sadly with the amount of developers that you currently have, that won't happen / won't happen soon.<br><br>I have a lot of ideas that I will be posting when I refine them but for now I can just give feedback on stuff that already exists.

This is a great way of informing the community. I agree on every level. Tel does a lot of work as well, he's been trying to sort a time for my interview, he's amazing! Great job to every staff member, whether you be a Jr Mod to the Admins. I was expecting something regarding our new developer though.

I'm not able to give you a proper answer because I'm on my iPad right now x)<br>Add me in Skype (JuanoMCPlayer) so we can keep discussing this when I get back on my PC. If something good comes from that conversation, then I'll bring it up to the staff.<br><b>P.S:</b> Recycling ideas from other servers is good sometimes, you need to take in count people that were banned from servers like MCSG or The Hive look for others servers to play the gamemode they liked so I guess Avicus is free to receiving more users in this community ^~^&nbsp;<b>Resume:</b> The server will actually grow with this update, just like it did with the other ones.

I've seen you commenting on a lot of threads bashing the Jr Mods.<br>Yes, some maybe a bit inexperience but what do you expect from 2 day old Jr Mods? You've been a moderator, why don't you tell them how to be not so naive.

Not bashing.<br><br>I'm just slightly infuriated that some of them have the audacity to be rude to players in-game and on TS and get away with it.<br><br>The last thing on my priorities is to teach players how to moderate. There are staff members for a reason.

I took lots of reports for the whole morning and I actually remember yours, no one was hacking so before saying something here, make sure there was actually a Jr - Mod or not.

When you guys do the Hand Picking and somebody actually gets a rank from it but you guys decide hand picking isnt a good idea, will the person be demoted?

It depends. If the hand picked player is doing a great job as a staff member, they won't be demoted. If they don't do so well, they'll get demoted. If we go back to the application method, the player(s) who was / were promoted by hand picking won't be demoted just because of the switch.
