Personally, for me, my friends don't know that I play Minecraft. No offense to anyone, but I guess you could call my friends the "cool" kids (Even though I think that is stupid, because everyone can be "cool"). I'm afraid that my friends will make fun of me if they find out that I play Minecraft and I'm this involved in it. Do your friends know that you play Minecraft? What do they think about it?

My <i>friends</i> do, yes. Nobody outside of my little 'circle' of friends have any idea that I play any games. Everybody assumes that I no-life Clash of Clans, since I play it all the time at school.<br><br>My friends also play games, so they're perfectly fine with it. I used to tell people that I played it, and I even wore Minecraft shirts to school. I started getting teased about it (mainly due to my old name), so I stopped telling people. I also had to stop telling people about my love for anime.. They thought it was bizarre. =/

All of my friends know, and they make fun of me for it :/ When they tease me about it, I usually just make fun of myself with them, as in I just agree with them and call <i>myself</i>&nbsp;names. Or I pretend I don't hear it. They used to pick on me a lot but they don't as much, which is nice.<br><br>Only two of my IRL friends play minecraft; CrocRock123, but he doesn't play anymore, and moosea1, who sometimes helps me with avicus maps but doesn't actually play avicus. One of my friends who moved to Texas about 2 years ago also played, but I'm guessing he doesn't anymore. Then again, I have not been able to contact him in a while.

It's legitimately frowned upon at my school to even play Minecraft. I've heard people around me talk about Minecraft, only to be insulted for it for no logical reason. It's a game, it doesn't matter, people make irritating statements about certain games, leave us alone.&nbsp;<br><br>Some friends know I play, but only for the reason they play it themselves, and actually accept people for the game they play.<br><br>In addition: I don't understand why this game is frowned upon socially with some people. In my opinion, it's completely inconsiderate and disrespectful to judge someone because they have a game they enjoy, much like most people enjoy Call of Duty.<br><br>I can assume with great knowledge that most peoples opinions on this game are bias, because they probably hang around people that dislike the game, and that it's, "cool" to be a follower of someone supposedly of, "higher importance" than them. My town/school community is mostly filled with these hateful people.<br><br>But then again, I can also guess that most have played the game before.

<p>My close friends do, they used to play a lot and sometimes still do but kinda moved on to GTA and other PS4 games (I still find time to play with them and play on here), some of my not so close friends know and tease me about it (in a jokey way) but not often.</p><p>If some other people in my school found out, they would probably make fun of me because Minecraft isn't a 'good&nbsp;game' and has terrible graphics&nbsp;but you know, I don't really mind, If I enjoy it then why not? </p>
