First and foremost, <b>I am NOT doing this nor do I plan to</b> since that would be a waste of money and time. But if I or some user got banned from Avicus and returned with an alt, would that be against the rules and considered ban-evading? I'm just curious.<br><br>Warm regards,<br>TheBron_cool

Yes, it's not allowed, which is typically Ban Evading.

Not saying I haven't done it before, but yes that would be considered ban evading. You must appeal at support@avicus.net to be unbanned.

Usually you can find out by tracking each players ip. If two players ip match it usually means that they are being used in the same location which is how you can find out. If a player is using a VPN (virtual private network) this method doesn't really work.

That would be pretty unfair for family members. Also, it wouldn't prevent players from using a proxy/VPN.

What is an alt?<br><br>Where a person creates (and pays for) a second Minecraft account and uses it, or is there a way to change your name within Minecraft?

The function to change your username is coming out on the February the 4th.<br>And 'alt' stands for an alternative account. So like a second or back up account.

When banned and you use an alt, you are violating rules. You are basically ban evading.

If a friend or sibling wants to play, they should probably use a different computer, because they won't be able to use the same one (Has the same IP).

If you're using a different computer connected to the same router, it's still the same external IP address.
