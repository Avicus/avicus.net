Listen up, Notal. If I were aagrant, I would've told you all that I am his alt. Aagrant would never make a post about himself for attention. If you think I'm the alt of aagrant, you are very wrong.

Also, I wouldn't see why aagrant99 would use an alt. He already has a good standing in the community, so there would not be a purpose of him using an alternative account.

I saw him in-game around the time Avicore was released.. He said that he quit the forums because there were people telling him to (most likely bullies of some sort). I really miss him... I hope he comes back some day-- he was an amazing part of the community ):

Just as the Avicore Update rolled over, Aagrant told me on Skype that he didn't want to come back because he felt that everyone was going against him. I tried to convince him to come back and he said that "he'd give it a chance."<br><br>I saw him in-game a few times but I doubt he's coming back to the forums.

It may be hard for him to adapt to the new forums, so he may just play in-game, if he ever returns.

Just sayin', I've not been in contact with splaying ninja or aagrant, but I have spoken to Kizzy and Nesa. Kizzy left, but didn't want the drama of making a leaving post. And nesa is just, taking a break I suppose. Vacations and just doing stuff has taken over. I'm sure she'll be back &gt;;D<br>i spoke to her two days ago, Infact ;D
