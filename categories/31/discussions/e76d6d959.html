Hello all,<br><br>This has been a thread I have wanted to make for a while now. Basically, what I am asking from you guys is to provide ideas of what you would want in the upcoming tournaments. This could range from gamemodes to maps.&nbsp;<br><br>In addition, I have made a <a href="http://strawpoll.me/5713396" rel="nofollow">poll</a>&nbsp;asking if you would like frequent, small tournaments, such as 1-2 weekend tournaments with different game modes or large, but less tournaments such as the Omega Championship.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Any my comments that are offensive, unrelated to the discussion or spam will be deleted. Failure to follow these rules could warrant a harsher punishment. We want this to be a constructive thread. Thank you.<br></b><br><b></b>Regards,<br>The Event Coordinators

Can we have smaller tournaments first off. To test maps, make sure the plugin works for new maps, and other things. And have bigger tournaments that last longer, have the best maps Avicus can supply, and to make sure the tournament plays well

I'm pretty sure that's the purpose of Tazz and BmB's unofficial ones.

The purpose was really for the community to have events really. But they are unofficial and don't mean much. Take a lot of esports or golf. They have a system where they have lower tournaments that no one really cares for, and bigger tournaments that should be hyped up for.

Yeah, but with the unofficial tourney Tazz and BmB are hosting they are giving feedback to mapdevs, so they can make the changes and decide what maps to put in the official one.

But those mean nothing in the long run. I want small tournaments that mean something and big ones that mean something. Take OCN for example also(Oh noes OCN AHHHHHHH). OCN has had small tournaments in the past &nbsp;such as Beta, AotA, RotLW, GoG. Then it had big tournaments such as RotH and BC. Then back and forth.

That would be nice, but you can't expect that from Avicus. Not going to lie but planing and organization takes way too long, with 6 official we should technically have events every month.

Organization and planning take little time if it is in the right hands. I don't want to take a shot at the ECs here but...it isn't the best. Same with OCN if you are thinking I am referring to them

I agree with Pie, we need small, official tourneys/events to make sure everything works and then the big, important tournaments like the Omega Championship. As much as people think the unofficial ECs are doing a better job, it's hard to take unofficial events seriously, we need the actual ECs to be in charge of the smaller events as well. We could have small tournaments every 1-3 weeks and then the big tournaments like 4-6 weeks after a small one. It would also help the server grow, I've seen the player count go up to 150~ on weekends when the unofficial events are going on, now imagine if they were OFFICIAL events? The competitive community is what keeps the server alive...

Have small tournaments, use them to maybe train refs or test out certain things. Then you go for the big one.

We really should have an event every month. This will attract more players and bring excitement to the server. I would say a small event, followed by a large event or even 2 small events followed by a larger one.<br><br>These smaller events could be used to try out tournaments for different game modes like Walls, CTH and even SG!
