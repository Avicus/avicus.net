<div>Hello Avicus,</div><div><br></div><div>The Map developers have decided to start removing most of the leather armour on certain maps. All you now got is an leather helmet to show what team you're playing in.</div><div>&nbsp; We decided to change the armour to provide better gameplay with having people making armour. We believe that if people start making armour gameplay will be better, kill farmers won't have it as easy as they did and rushers would actually get a challenge.<br>&nbsp; These changes will soon be on the server :)</div><div><br></div><div>If you disagree with this, please explain why bellow. We're always listening to you, but please address the issue with somewhat kind words. Don't get too offensive.</div><div><br></div><div>Regards.</div>

I have a feeling it won't workout, but I'm not going to assume since there are always pros. :p Good luck with this idea, guys!

Your talking about how it will make kill farming harder but if a teamstack of good pvpers (which is usually how kill farming starts) eliminates most full iron people (if they even try to build armour) since so many people are lazy kill farming will be made much easier for those kill farmers since now your dead, your enclosed by kill farmers and you have less armour than usual to protect yourself in pvp.<br>There are pros and cons but it seems here if the changes were made for harder kill farming its very flawed.<br>For rushing people if the player is good enough they take their armour off anyway so its not too much of an effect.

I honestly like this, since this will be a challenge. Pub matches are pretty easy these days, and I like a good challenge ;D. I'm sure that people will hate this change as well, but you have to appeal to the majority =l

I'm going to take a fair guess that you havn't even played the map and that you're saying this just based on your thoughts. I was just on a few hours ago and I had no problem killfarming at all. All I had to do was eat an gapple once or twice more than usual.

I really disagree with having only a leather helmet... Robin you said that people will make full iron and have better gameplay but what I'm seeing ATM is people making iron armour and then just camping in their own half as usual. You have a chace to kill these full iron when you have full leather because you have a little bit of protection but with just a leather helmet, you barley have any protection at all and die easily

It isn't hard to kill someone in iron, it's easy to do it without armor, too. Not too much of a problem, plus, you have a diamond sword which helps quite a bit, too.

Only Quintus has Diamond Swords in the loadout, the rest of maps have the usual Stone/Iron.

I did play the map... And I wasn't talking about kill farming. I was saying that leather players can't have a decent fight when they both have diamond swords. But it is a bit better with iron so thanks for adjusting it
