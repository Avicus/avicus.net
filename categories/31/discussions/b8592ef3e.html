Hello everyone,<br><br><br>It is very sad to see our fun, caring and amazing Community Administrator, GraphixError, retire from his position. He meant so much to me personally, as well as the entire staff team and community.&nbsp;<br><br>Graphix, better known as Jake, has chosen me as his successor. I can completely understand if you are surprised to see&nbsp;<i>me&nbsp;</i>taking on the role of the&nbsp;<i>community&nbsp;</i>administrator. Don't worry. I have a proposal/plan to work everything out, and have come up with numerous ideas regarding both the staff team and community. If you ever have any concerns, contact me on Skype @ PeachyYas. I'm always open to new ideas, and especially feedback.&nbsp;<br><br>Best regards,<br><br>-Peachy. :)
