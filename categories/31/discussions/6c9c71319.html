Hey guys, Kammy here. I just wanted to say that i have made many friends on avicus and they are great! But i can improve. To some i may be a jerk and i am very sorry for that. I really want to be someone who is liked instead of 50 50. I would love to know things i could do to be nicer and a better person. Also again, if i have been mean to you, or have offended you, i deeply apologize. Please leave things that i could do. Thank you for reading :D<br><br>EDIT: I would like you guys to suggest ways for me to be a better and nicer person, if i have done something that you have not liked that i have done, say that.

I'm still a new member on Avicus. Therefore I don't know who you are and what you might have done. <br>My challenge for you is to build up your reputation in a positive way and prove to the newer Avicus players (like me) that you're a cool guy.<br><br>:)

You were never mean to me. You always said hi to me and you were friendly C:<br>We joked around and it was always fun playing with you. It takes great courage to admit mistakes, especially in front of everyone here.<br><br>&lt;3

It takes guts to admit that, Well Done!<br>Even I, admit that my popularity and reputation is going down and I wonder why?<br>Probably because I got demoted but still, is that a suitable answer.
