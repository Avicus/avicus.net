Hey everyone, as some of you have already noticed and asked me about, I have decided to permanently retire from the staff team.<br>There are multiple reasons for this, and I won't explain them all, but for the most part it's because school is starting, and because of some issues in the staff team which I won't mention.<br>It's been an amazing 7 months being able to serve as a staff member and work alongside some really great people. This community is one of the best I've been a part of, and I'm glad to have met you all :)<br><br>Anyways, I'm not leaving Avicus at all. I'll still be active on TS, the forums, and ingame, but I just won't be a staff member.<br>Before I end this post I want to list a few people who I want to thank.<br><br><b>Zaccc</b> - Zac you are probably one of the most hilarious people on TS that I usually talk to. Yeah, your sense of humour may "offend" some people sometimes, but I thought it was rather funny and for that I like you ;D. Also, you're a really annoying guy when it comes to playing my youtube videos on tinychat, but it was really funny when you did to be honest xD<br><br><b>GalaxyBrit</b> - You were probably the most helpful staff members (to me) in my opinion. We both got Mod together, and Senior Mod together. I felt that I could really trust you with anything, and I really enjoyed talking to you ingame. I'm thanking you since you were a really good friend to me, and because you would always listen to me if I wanted to talk about something :3<br><br><b>GrapeSmootie</b><b> / Greg</b> - Greg, you're a really great guy in general. I had a great time talking to you on TS pretty much every day, and tinychat as well. All the screenshots you took of my butt whenever I stood up were.... interesting, especially the one where you edited a pigtail on it.. Anyways, thanks for being a great pal greg &lt;3<br><br><b>_Cyanide</b> - I could honestly write paragraphs about you Cyanide, but I'll keep it short. Cyanide, you honestly feel like a brother to me. I feel like I can talk to you about absolutely anything without being judged, and without me thinking that you're going to tell other people. You're trustworthy, hilarious, and a really amazing guy. You should keep up the great work as a Moderator, because you're doing a great job so far. You started out pretty rusty as a Mod, but I can definitely see the improvement. Stay cool Cyanide x)<br><br><b>RefuseToSink</b> - You're always patient with me, and always seem to want to help with whatever problems I was having. I want to thank you for being a really great friend to me, and a fun person to talk to. I always enjoyed talking to you on TS and on Skype since you can be pretty hilarious :D. Tinychat was always fun, as was Cards Against Humanity, although you always somehow managed to beat me.. Anyways, thanks for being a great staff member, and an ever better friend :')<br><br><b>vladthegreat100</b> - There's not much to say except thanks for being a great friend, and I&nbsp;<b>love</b> the .gif you showed me on TS<b>!</b><br><br><b>Vobaseball</b> - Hey man, although we didn't really get to talk on TS too much, I wanted to thank you for being a really supportive guy. You always seemed to be a great confidence builder, and I really want to thank you for that. Keep up the great work as a mod :)<br><b>ColdCraft&nbsp;</b>- Cold, I really like the fact that you are super supportive of my YouTube channel, and that really lifts my spirits. If I didn't have people like you watch and comment on my videos, I probably wouldn't even make them anymore. There are so many people that I could say the same thing about, but I know that you've been supportive for a really long time. Thanks for that &lt;3<br><br><b></b><b>Pelp</b> - Pel, I can't say that we've always been "really good friends", but there is something that I really respect about you. That is your dedication to the server. I know you always try your hardest to make Avicus better, and I like that about you. Keep it up pelp :3<br><br><b>Jozz</b> - Jozzy, when you were Admin, it was probably my "favourite" time on Avicus. I know that some people say you were a bad Admin, but I don't see it. Let the haters hate you, and ignore them. I agree with Vlad when he says that you should somehow be involved with the staff team, since you have the experience. In addition to being just staff, I want to thank you for being a great friend to me back when you were Mod, Senior Mod, and Admin. You were probably my favourite staff member back then, and I always looked up to you whenever I needed something. Thanks for being a great role model &lt;3<br><br><b>SnowSX3</b> - Snowy man, you're a terrific Mod. You have a ton of potential and I know that you can become a Senior Mod one day. You are always confident with your decisions, and you are dedicated to Avicus. I have a lot of respect for you dude, and I hope you can continue to impress me as a staff member ;D<br><br><b>Tynvale</b> - Man, you're a great guy. You were a terrific confidence booster for me to continue my YouTube channel, and it meant a lot. Whenever you had problem, I loved taking the time to message you through Skype and talk about it. Also, you shouldn't give up on YouTube. You have a ton of potential, and I can see you getting really far. Don't worry about getting dislikes on your videos, since there will&nbsp;<b>always</b> be haters. Stay cool man &lt;3<br><br><b>The staff team</b> - It's been amazing getting to know you guys and working with you guys. We've all been through good times and bad times together, and I want to thank you all for making my experience in the staff team awesome. &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3<br><br>This isn't even half of the people I want to thank, but I could go on and on with thank you's. Thanks to everyone for making me feel welcome here, and I hope that I did a good job as a staff member.<br><br>Thanks for all,<br>Porky.

I just wish you hadn't informed us so suddenly about this. It was like an immediate heart-stopper once I heard you were retiring. Anyways, good luck on the YouTube channel! Hopefully, I could make a contribution or two to it.

I always loved you man. Always kind, outgoing, and enthusiastic. Shame to see you step down. But, it was with good reasoning. Keep your grades up in school, as they reflect on the rest of your life. &lt;3
