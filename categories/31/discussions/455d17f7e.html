I actually don't know, could be a server or plugin issue, but no one is 100% sure.

Yes, I think you are all correct. I think we should all just check out for a while and let our super super busy developer work all this out. I think we should check back next Saturday and be super thankful and patient that we get to play sometimes. We expect way way to much..

The servers stopping at 1 map could be cause of a YML error. Think that the server that eventually crashes is Nebula05 and always on Camp Erbosi.<br>The Hubs can crash either because of a DDoS or (i think) the few holograms. Anyways, both cases seems hard to happend.

I didn't mean that, but sometimes I fear that I'll get banned for posting things like criticisms and advice. Mod might say things like "That's spam stop posting it"
