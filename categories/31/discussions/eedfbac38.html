Well, today or really soon marks 2 years on this server.<br>OH<br>MA<br>GAWD.<br><br>Like, seriously, I can't even... This server has been better and laster longer than most of my IRL friends...<br><br>Thank you all. I just, can't believe that a simple game, on a simple server could be this amazing... What an experience. I've loved every second. I've also made incredible friends...<br><br>PeachyYas- I still can't believe you look like that... xD I asked you to join Charmy that one day, and well, I've been your friend since then. Still got the skin. ^-^ Thanks for being a great friend.<br><br>Armoredpotato- I can still rek you any day dude. Even if you are second on walls... Best walls friend ever right here.<br><br>Izjust4fun- Ok, we are like, good friends or anything, but thank you. You've helped me countless times, and you're an amazing person.&nbsp;<br><br>Everyone else I neglected to add to this list but I talk to regulary- Thank you guys, from the bottom of my beating heart. You guys have made this server so amazing... Nothing could change that.<br><br>Well, two years here... 1 year, 11 months, crappy desktop: 997 kills.<br>1 Month, new laptop: 1500+ I believe.<br><br>So who's the nub now?&nbsp;<br><br>Thank you so much though guys...&nbsp;<br>#avicus4ever #jj2year
