Honestly this server is dead. If you're able to run this, then you must pay at most $4 for the entire network. Nobody seems to play anymore, and the forums are the most inactive since my grandmother turned 40. I'm just wondering how many pennies you find on your school cafeteria's ground to afford this; any thoughts?

Just because we add one game doesn't mean people will just magically appear. We need to advertise, and keep updating. Skywars is a good thing, we just don't have the player base we used to when Skywars was popular. Adding Walls, Skywars, Nexus, and making rotations better is going to help with getting people to stay. It doesn't necessarily help get people onto Avicus. I mean yes, if we keep adding games then people will hear about us more and come on, but it takes time. Getting a bigger player base doesn't just happen because we add one game. The people that left that wanted Skywars still have to check to see if Avicus has Skywars, if they never even look, how are they going to know?

Thing is, the people that left because Skywars was removed left almost 3 years ago. What does that mean?<br>It means that if they haven't checked in yet, they probably won't check in again, and the people that left recently left because all the current fuck ups.<br><br>You're saying that it takes time for a server to grow, yes, it is very true, but it usually isn't normal for a server that used to average 1K players go down to average 20-50 players. Unless the developers are actually going to start listening to some features&nbsp;<b>*cough*</b> prestiges&nbsp;<b>*cough*</b> that will actually bring usefulness in playing the game other than trying to break a monument, create a functioning anti-cheat that does not lag the server to death (Lets be real, no server can get bigger if there is a hacker in every game with the majority of the time no moderators on), and advertise the server in ways that is not going to be seen by whoever visits the website: ex: Make a server trailer of Avicus and use the youtube advertisement thing where you pay to have a certain video that you choose run as an advertisement, and if someone clicks it, depending on how much money you put in will vary on how many clicks it can take before stopping. Pro's with this is that it will 100% be seen by people and regardless if they click the ad or not, if they remember the name of the server and google search it, more traffic.

Yeah I agree. The devs do need to listen, and I think they are realizing that. Recently they have been asking for suggestions more often, and adding things that the community asks for.

Adding new games isn't bad, adding a game like skywars that is on hundreds of servers that have about 200x more players isn't a good idea

I agree, games like SG or Skywars are on bigger servers, but at some point we will need to those games. If we add them now we have a good community that can help find and fix bugs. Before SG was a huge fail, if they readded it it wouldn't be as bad. Good things come from fails, you learn what you did wrong and you can not do that next time.
