<p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Hello community,</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>As the title states, we are proud to announce monthly update threads! We intend to generate transparency by ensuring that YOU know what we're up to. We’re open to suggestions regarding the format of these posts, so if you have any ideas or relevant feedback feel free to let us know.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span><b>Without further adieu, let's start;</b></span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Mango and I have been developing a structured calendar, having day to day goals that must be fulfilled. &nbsp;For example, we would have admin meetings between the two of us every Monday, addressing the main concerns and topics for the current month. This way, the we’re able to keep track of what needs to be done as well as openly communicate each issue.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Within the last few weeks, the standards within the staff team have be raised in order to work through some long-awaited changes. We have promoted GrapeSmoothie and Kavinsky (ParaSpider) to senior moderator to help us with this, and we look forward to seeing what they can contribute to the team! We are now assigning tasks to individual staff members to assist this process and the work efficiency has increased significantly as a result.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>&nbsp;To add on, all of our improvements have been directed to fix the issues internally (this month), so negate the source of the dislocation between staff and community. It's a slow process, something that may not be noticeable yet, but we promise you that policies have been set in stone to realign the staff. A proper warning system has been deployed, and is in full swing. Not to fear, we are planning some external changes too! (See below).</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Next month, it will revolve around community event planning, which we hope to improve the relations between community and staff. For example, Mango and I are thinking about planning parties; that includes giveaways, games (maybe cards against humanity?) and more!&nbsp;</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Additionally, we are looking forward to working alongside the media team (both social and entertainment committees) for plans such as interactive youtube videos, Facebook promotions and exclusive things! Actually, the monthly update thread could take form of video as well, with the voice of community members! We plan to release more information about this at a later date, once we have decided on a format.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>Staff applications?! Yes, more about them! So far, we can confirm that they will close at the end of the month. You may have noticed no one has received a notification regarding interviews. This is because we are releasing all the answers at once, after the applications have been closed.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>To finish off; community suggestions will see a dramatic improvement. In monthly update threads, suggestions that are raised will be mentioned in the OP. This way, you can check to see if you have been heard by the senior staff! The thread will be updated with this month's suggestions soon.</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span>We originally planned to publish the update at the end of September, but this was needed to give everyone hope, and to keep sticking with us.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span><br></span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span><b>UPDATE: 20/09/15</b><br></span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span><b><br></b></span></p><p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span></span><b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; ">Updated Rules on Ban Evasion-</b></p><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; "><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; ">The policy on Ban Evasion has been updated.&nbsp;</span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; "><ul style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 12px 25px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; "><li>Any player that has been found guilty of ban evasion will immediately be banned permanently with&nbsp;<b>no</b>&nbsp;(we repeat,&nbsp;<i></i><b>no</b>) chance of appealing.&nbsp;</li><li>Any player that has been found guilty of ban evasion prior to a punishment expiring will have all accounts guilty banned.

These are all wonderful ideas. Good to see that Avicus is making a comeback. All of that starts with good leadership. On that note, congratulations Joel, Mango, and Keenan. Changes are being made, and they all sound like they're going to positively impact the server. Bravo!

Before fixing the staff I recommend something to fix the stale and boring gameplay/maps and get youtubers to advertise.&nbsp;<br><br>Also I want a refund with my donor rank as it literally does not do anything in game anymore since every team has reached it's maximum capacity.<br><br>EDIT: Oh and making the server 1.8 will just make this server have nothing over OCN at all.

Didn't you&nbsp;<b></b>always say that the staff team was terrible and needed improvement? Wouldn't you want it to get "fixed" asap?<br><br>And yeah I agree with the team capacity thing. A perk of having donor is being able to join full teams, and if that's taken away, there's literally not much the rank is good for anymore, except getting a credit boost.

Evidence will be provided that clearly backs up the reasoning for demotion. This will hopefully prevent any false demotions.

We've always received several complaints that the evidence isn't satisfactory or true. The evidence that will be provided alongside a demotion will (hopefully) be true and undeniable. It's hard to completely stop false demotions, but there will be greater care than before when issuing a demotion.

100% accuracy is too much of a stretch. My hope, with this new implemented system, is to prevent false demotions from occuring to the best of me and the Senior Staff's ability.
