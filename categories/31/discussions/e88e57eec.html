If by "the rule before the very last one", you mean Rule E3 — it means that if you reserve a scrimmage server and can't access it because it's broken or glitched, or if certain features don't work properly or as you'd expected, neither the staff nor the server as a whole are required to make up for your loss (for instance, they won't grant you another reservation, because they're not obligated to).

More directed to rule clarifications. The previous ruleset was rather vague - nothing specific.

No, it's simply to inform users that we made changes to <i>fix</i> the vague language that was present before. We have since re-written certain rules in order to fix that issue. From now on we're hoping to be more flexible with rule changes, as in the past we have taken too long to update the page.<br><br>EDIT: Wow I just got double ninja'd, do I get a prize?!

sorry for suggesting such a stupid idea but you might want to fix some stuff to prevent problems. I mean, this server has many problems that u can fix easily (no I'm not talking about the block lag don't hurt me) that are so easy to fix, but people keep ignoring and we are dropping players, y'all need to face the truth and fix the problems. I understand "we are working hard" and "u don't know what's going on behind the scenes", but y'all have been telling that like 7 months already and it takes so long and so many posts about a topic to fix a problem<br><br><br>about the scrim servers, if it's hard to fix alone, find more people that can help you. I know many people that play here with huge knowledge in coding and stuff they can help u.

That note is there not because the scrim servers have frequent issues, but because in the event that something does go wrong and it isn't able to perform up to spec, users don't expect compensation (it's a free service and accidents happen). Please report any issues if you see them to avicus.net/issues as normal - I'm not presently aware of anything <i>major </i>regarding the scrim servers, so please enlighten me on what is needing attention there.<br><br>Yes, there are many small things that need to be addressed. "Small things" from your perspective may equate to enormous changes from a dev's perspective. Most issues that are small from our perspective are in fact fixed quickly. We understand any frustration coming from dedicated users who are seeking something new from Avicus. The lack of progress bothers us too! We want Avicus to thrive and much of what is preventing it is just that. Hold tight I guess.<br><br>Edit: You can always drop me an email, keenan@avicus.net, that's the best way to get my attention.

That's the attitude I want all staff members to have. Some of the staff members on your server have super annoying attitude and just defend themselves even if they are wrong. I like how you say the truth and exactly what I need and want to know, I would personally like every staff member having the attitude you have. I will drop you an email with suggestions, thank you
