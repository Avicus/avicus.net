<b>1. What is your username in minecraft and what is your favorite game on Avicus?</b><br>Hey, guys! My name is StormzInvader, but you can call me Stormz! I actually came up with my name because I had to find something "cooler" than my IRL name for my username online. It was around 6-7 years ago when I thought of this name. At that time, I was obsessed with The World Ends With You, and I was watching gameplay videos from a guy who had the letter "z" in his name. I found it pretty cool, so I tried to mix and match words that could work with that. Finally, I came up with storm. It had a nice ring to it, but I had to differentiate myself from other people as well, so I tried to mix and match more words. Invader eventually came up in my mind and then it just stuck with me ever since.My favorite gamemode on Avicus would be Nebula. I used to be a Nexus player back in MCZone, but I stopped and started to play on Nebula more after I found out that it was the most popular mode here. I don't regret anything.&nbsp;:P<br><br><b>2. What are you most excited/obsessed over at the moment?</b><br>Monter Hunter 4 Ultimate, Majora's Mask, and summer!&nbsp;:smile:&nbsp;(Shout-out to any Monster Hunters out there!) With school almost ending for me, my work load has been increasing. It hasn't been easy for me because of how crammed all my assessments are.Outside of school, I like playing Airsoft and just playing video games.<br><br><b>3. Where are you from?</b><br>The Philippines! :)<span>&nbsp;(Shout-out to any Filipinos out there!)<br><br></span><b>4. Are you in school, or do you have a job? &nbsp;</b><br>I'm in my final year in high school right now. I've already passed several colleges, and I have already picked a course that I want to take up. I plan to take on masters in America eventually.<br><br><b>5. Who or what inspires you the most in your life?</b><br>Liam Neeson because, well, he's cool. I've been a fan of many of his movies, and I continue to enjoy his really awesome voice. HAHA. &nbsp;<br><br><b>6. How do you contribute to the Avicus as a staff member?<br></b><br>I just like giving back to people what good memories I had as a player in MCZone. Using my virtues and values that I have picked up along the way in various activities sanctioned and not sanctioned by the school, I try to&nbsp;help&nbsp;other people fully develop as well. It isn't a matter of getting the most infractions for me. I just want to&nbsp;help<span>&nbsp;create a safe and more family-friendly environment for everyone!<br><br></span><b>7. What are the most common questions you get asked while moderating or managing?</b><br>"How did you get that KD?", "Can my friend be unbanned?"Those are the things that come at the very top of my head. :P<br><br><b>8. Anything else you want to mention?</b><br>I like ponies, graphic design, and psychology as well.&nbsp;:P

I tend to sit back, relax, and enjoy the light show. :P (I use my bow more often. I have a defensive-midfield playstyle)

Stormz &lt;3<br><br>I never knew you were a fellow Filipino! :o<br>Also, I've been thinking of getting Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate and Majora's Mask. Is Monster Hunter worth it? I've heard mixed reviews on it, and I'm not sure if it's to my tastes or not. I was also thinking about getting Majora's Mask 3D, but I played the original to death. Is the new experience enough to buy the remake?
