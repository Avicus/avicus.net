This guide will cover most of the basic questions. This is only a basic guide and the links provided in the guide will give you a more through explanation on a topic. Lets get start shall we? "(This is a long guide but this is good because it might answer all your question's here)<br><u><br></u><b>What we will be covering in this guide:</b><br><br><b>General in-game and website</b><br><ul><li>General Rules</li><li>Punishment's</li><li>Appealing</li><li>Reporting</li><li>Avicus Support</li><li>Cool Avicus Terms and Phrases.</li><li>How to apply for staff</li></ul><br><b>Website:</b><br><ul><li>Customizing your Profile</li><li>Donating</li><li>The Forums</li><li>Forum Rules</li><li>How to use the forums</li><li>Forum titles and terms.</li><li>How to make a map</li></ul><br><b>In-Game</b><br><ul><li>How to play-Basics</li><li>Gamemodes</li><li>Nebula</li><li>Prestiege&nbsp;</li><li>In-Game Commands</li><li>Useful links</li></ul><b>Useful Links</b><br><b>FAQ</b><br><h1>General Rules</h1>Before we get to the other topics in this guide, you must know the very basic rules. So please, read this first!<br><br>Use common-sense- using this will prevent you from getting an infraction.<br>Please maintain a calm and casual atmosphere in-game and website- Basically be mature and act mature<br>Do not team grief, team spleef, or anything that prevents your team from winning- even though a teammate griefs you, do not do it back or both of you will end up with a infraction<br>Do not spam the chat with annoying caps and/or phrases and dont post spammy threads<br>If you're an observer, do not give out any tactical information in chat!- This means that if your spectating or in a team, do not give out precious info that could help the other team<br>Do not spawn kill and/or spawn camp<br>Do not abuse glitches<br>Do not hack in the server<br>Do not combat log/ void log- defined as before you die, you log out in order to escape death.<br><br>For a more thorough rules explanation, please read:&nbsp;<a href="http://avicus.net/rules" rel="nofollow">http://avicus.net/rules</a><br><br><h1>Punishments</h1>If you or a person so happens to break the rules, you will be given an infraction. It will go on your profile and will stay there no matter what. The usual punishment system is:<br><br>Verbal Warn &gt;&gt; Kick &gt;&gt; Temp Ban &gt;&gt; Perm Ban<br><br>This is the basic form of the punishment system. However, this system does not apply in some cases. If you hack even once, you can end up with a temp or a perm ban. If the infraction you did was to severe, you would probably get Temp or Perm banned. Excessive Infractions may also result to a kick or ban. So please, follow the rules :D<br><br><h1>Appealing</h1><br>If you think that the staff may have made a mistake on your punishment or your really sorry, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE FORUMS TO APPEAL!!! You can email them by going to the support tab on the website. Please make it detailed and make sure there is valid evidence that you didn't do this infraction. (its at the very bottom) SO if you dont have an email, i suggest you make one if you want to appeal your punishment. Also, contacting staff through forums, skype, or alts is annoying and if you do happen to use alts, your punishment will get worse.&nbsp;<a href="http://avicus.net/support" rel="nofollow">http://avicus.net/support</a><br><br><h1>Reporting</h1>The Avicus Network has 2 ways of reporting people. You can either use the command, /report in game or send a report through the forums in the "Player Reports" section.<br><br><b>In-Game Reporting:</b> When you see a rulebreaker, use /report &nbsp;&lt;name&gt; &lt;reason&gt;. Only use /report if necassary. When making a report, make it very detailed. Dont just say "/report Y0urm0m2 hacker" The staff wont listen to that. Instead, use this "/report Y0urm0m2 hitting enenmies all around him, shooting multiple arrows super fast, unusal flying movement." A staff would defitnetly take a look into that so if you want reports answered, be very detailed.<br><br><b>Website Reporting: </b>IF you do so happen find and record and/or have screenshots of a rulebreaker, post it ONLY in the Player Reports section. When making it, make it somewhat detailed. Say the person who did and what he/she did. Then just put the evidence. Please note that the evidence must be vaild and do not use old evidence. Video evidence is most preferred if your reporting griefers and hackers. Screenshot evidence is preferred if its chat related.<br><br>Links: <a href="http://avicus.net/forums/ae6b2218a" rel="nofollow">Why there is a /report command.</a>&nbsp;by vladthegreat<br><br><h1>Avicus Support</h1>Avicus support is a neat feature. If your account is hacked, a problem with your account, a staff breaking the rules, etc.. please do not post it in the forums. Send these types of problems to&nbsp;<a href="http://avicus.net/support" rel="nofollow">http://avicus.net/support</a>&nbsp;so it wouldn't create unncecassary spam threads.<br><br><h1>Cool Terms and Phrases</h1>There is some gaming termonolgy that it is used frequently so if you cased you don't know, here they are:<br><br><b>GG-&nbsp;</b>Good Game<br><b>Gl&nbsp;</b>- Good Luck<br><b>gl hf -</b> Good luck have fun<br><b>Gj-</b> good job<br><b>gf-&nbsp;</b>Good fight<br><b>gg wp-&nbsp;</b>good game, well played<b><br></b><b>gg no re-&nbsp;</b>good game, no regrets<br><b>eZ-&nbsp;</b>means someone is "easy". Please do not use this against other people as it may be offensive and rude"<br><b>u wot m8?-&nbsp;</b>its a response saying that "you wanna go down dude?"<br><b>3spooky5me-&nbsp;</b>"its scary or spooky (mlg term. Mostly a joke)<br><b>1v1 me m8-&nbsp;</b>1 vs 1 me dude<br><b>scrub-&nbsp;</b>a noob (again offensive and rude)<br><b>inb4-&nbsp;</b>in before something happens.<br><b>bump-&nbsp;</b>A response to a thread and it bumps the thread to the Recent Discussions section<br><b>ninja'd-&nbsp;</b>when some one says the same thing and/or idea as you the post before, you would use this term<br><b>thread-&nbsp;</b>a forum topic<br><b>OP-&nbsp;</b>Overpowered, Orignal Post (in a thread topic)<br><b>o/-&nbsp;</b>waving hello<br><b>HYPE-&nbsp;</b>Excited about something<br><br><h1>Customizing your profile</h1>It is really easy to customize it. Just adjust the settings and bam. If you want t maek a flashy profile like mine, you have to use HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) The coding may seem complicated but just copy and paste codes off the internet and your profile will look cool. If you want to insert an image, save an image, uploaded to imgur.com , and get the html code and copy and paste it to your account. I have this one link about HTML profiles from OCN. (if its advertiseing, remove it pls)<br><br>*If you want a purplish backround, use this code "&lt;pre class="btn btn-primary btn-block active"&gt;"<br><br><a href="https://oc.tc/forums/topics/50ca1655f3442235aa0001ff" rel="nofollow">How to make an EPic PRofile!</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><h1>Donating</h1>If you want to help the server, you can always make a donation to avicus.net/shop ! It has 3 ranks: Gold, Emerald, and Diamond. This ranks give you soem perks in-game such as joining full teams or choosing which team you want to be on. For more info, go to avicus.net/shop<br><br><h1>How to apply for staff</h1>If you feel like you are worthy to be staff and you are willing to take up a position to be staff, you can apply by submitting an application in the Staff Applications section. The Staff Application will be opened on certain occasions. Usually, an admin will announce on the forums when staff apps are open. If it is open, you must have all of these reqirements in order to apply for staff<br><br><ul><li>You must be mature</li><li>You must be completely honest in your application (they will backround check you)</li><li>You must have some way you can contact the staff (most preferrably Skype)</li><li>Must have an email (well everyone needs one duh)</li></ul><br>If your application does get accepted, you will be interviewed by the other staff members through Skype most likely. If you have been accepted to become a staff member, you will have a trial period as a Jr. Mod. You will undergo training from other members of the staff team so do your best!<br><h1>The Forums</h1><br>The forums is a place where people can discuss about almost anything. Topics can vary and you can make one yourself but same rules apply. Here are some general rules when using the forums.<br><br><b>General Rules:<br></b><br>1. Use common sense<br>2.Do not make spammy topics (this means topics that a short and have no purpose or meaning)<br>3. Do not spam forums with constant threads.<br>4. Do not post any inapprpiate images or things on the forums<br>5. Do not start or encoruage flame wars (fights in the forums)<br>6. Post topics in the right section of the forums<br>7. If you want to give critisism, give constructive critisism. (Critisism that helps basically)<br>8. Do not make social updates. Its not Instagram<br>9. If you have been hacked, errors in your profile, staff did something wrong, etc... send it to avicus.net/support.<br>10. When posting in a thread, do not bump it just so you can bring it to the top. Be sure when you bump a thread, its related to the topic.<br><b>How to use the Forums<br></b><br>When using the forums, you will see different subtopics to choose from to the left. Before making a thread, be sure to post it on the right section. If you post something on a thread and made a mistake, instead of making another post, just use the Edit function. If you want to delete a post, press edit, checkmark archive and press ok.<br><br><i>Note:&nbsp;</i>You may only bump threads (posting on a topic which brings the topic to the Recent Discussions Section) if it is related to the topic. As much as possible, do not triple post. You may use @&lt;name&gt; to quote multiple people.<br><br>Subtopics(only covering important ones):<br><br><b>Recent Discussions&nbsp;</b>The new discussions<br><b>Offical News&nbsp;</b>News about whats going on in Avicus<br><b>Player Reports&nbsp;</b>File video reports here in this subforum<br><b>Staff Applications&nbsp;</b>If you want to become staff, apply here but it is open in some occasions.<br><b>Server Feedback&nbsp;</b>Feedback on the server, how it could be improved and stuff<br><b>Game Discussion&nbsp;</b>Talk about map gameplays, gamemodes, etc..<br><b>Avicus Help&nbsp;</b>Ask questions here<br><b>Media&nbsp;</b>If you make videos, post here<br><b>Gaming&nbsp;</b>Talk about any other games, computer parts, anything about gaming here<br><b>Off Topic&nbsp;</b>this is where forum games go, other topics etc.. Feel free to discuss almost anything in off-topic just as long as its not spammy, somewhat orignal, and appropiate.<br><b>Map Making/ Releases:&nbsp;</b>If you have a new map, questions, etc.. post here anything map related.<br><u><br></u><b>Forum Titles<br></b><u><br></u>There are a couple of ways people title their threads to make it look fancy and to give an idea what its going to be about. Here are a few:<br><u><br>[Game]- A forum game<br>[Help]- if you need help<br>[AMA]- Ask me Anything<br>[Sug]- suggestion<br>[DTM]- Destroy the Moument<br>[CTW]- Capture the Wool<br><br></u><b>How to submit a map<br></b><u><br></u>Players can feel free to submit their maps to Avicus! They may do it some other server or your on single player world. Make sure your map looks like you put a lot of effort into it so the chances of it can be most likely accepted. When submitting a map, you will make a thread in the Map Releases section. The title should be formatted like this<br><u><br><i>[Name of Gamemode] Version; Name</i><br><br>Ex. [DTM]- V1.0 Wooly Caverns<br><br></u>In your map thread topic, the following is needed in order for the map devs&nbsp;to take a look at it.<br><br><ul><li><b>Screenshots of the map-</b> Be sure to take a lot of screenshots around the map including the spawn, spawnkits, etc... Make an imgur album most preferabbly by uploading screenshots to imgur.com</li><li><b>A world download of the map-</b> To do so, you must find your Minecraft world that has the map in your Save File in your minecraft folder. If you do not know how to find it, type in%appdata%.&nbsp;Once oyu have found it, up load it to mediafire and share the link here.</li><li><b>YAML-</b> This is the coding language used to make sure the map works. If you know how to code YAML, make sure there is a link to it. Use pastbin.com for example to put the YAML. If you do knot know how to do YAML, dont worry because theres a lot of people that can help you out. Just make sure you have someway to contact them (Skype preferably)</li></ul><b>What now?</b><br><br>Well, you have to wait for the staff response. PLEASE do not bump continously so your map can get attention. It's annoying and chances are it might not get accepted. The only way you can bump it is if you made another version of the map and you edited the OP with different pictures, you changed the map, etc.. If it is accepted, your title would show "Accepted" for testing. If not, you always have another chance to make another map. It is hard to submit a map on someones first try but do not give up!<br><br><u><br></u><h1>How To Play- Basics</h1>I am not going to go a lot in-depth because its really self explanatory but ill explain it brefiely. This section will mostly cover the more in-game subjects<br><br><b>Some basics</b><u><br></u>When you go to a server, a GUI will appear and show if you want to Auto-Join, Join red, or Join blue. Only donator ranks can choose teams so if you are not a donator, you must click auto join. If the GUI does not appear, you can always use /join to join the game!<br><u><br></u>Most maps have objectives (mostly DTM). The objectives will appear usually on the right hand side of the screen. If it is marked with an "x", the objective hasn't been complete" If it is marked with a check mark, it has been comeplete<br><br><b>Rules in-game</b><u><b><br></b><br></u><ol><li>Do not give any tactical info to the enemy team</li><li>Use common-sense</li><li>Do not team grief, team spleef, or anything that hinders your team from winning</li><li>Do not team grief and/or team spleef as an act of retaliation</li><li>Do not spam the chat please</li><li>Please act mature and keep a calm and casual atmosphere</li><li>Please do not call out hackers. By doing so, your helping them out. Just silently use /report ^.^</li><li>Hacks are not allowed and will result in a long ban</li><li>Ban-evading is not allowed (if your banned and you are using alts, your ban will be even longer)</li></ol><b>The lobby<br></b><br>When you enter the lobby, there are a couple places you can go. Here are the places:<br><br>Nebula- the main attraction to Avicus. Has gamemodes from Destroy the Monument [DTM] to [TDM]- Team Death match<br><br>Avicade- Avicade is the Arcade of Avicus. It offers some fun mini games such as Minatour Run, (need welp)<br><br>Control the Hill- Join here if you want to enjoy matches in relation to capturing points. This a teamwork based server mostly<br><br>Elimination- It is (i think) like TDM except that you have limited lives in each game<br><br>Walls- If you want to play the "Walls" gamemode, join here. There are usually 4 teams and each must prepare before the walls fall down.<br><br><b>In-game Basics<br></b><br>When your out there pvping, there are a few basic tactics you should know<br><br><ul><li>Skybridging- When a person is bridging from a tall height to the enemy side. IT is dangerous but skybridges can be really effective. Be sure not to build to high or to low and be wise on where you are starting your skybridge. Always have a water bucket</li><li>Block running- When a person is running and jumping at the same time while placing blocks underneath them. It makes them somewhat faster and sorta slows down the enemy chasing you</li><li>Push- a planned charge toward one focused side of the map</li><li>Tunneling- Digging underground in order to sneak past the enemy.</li><li>Bridging- When a person&nbsp;is holding shift while placing blocks towards one side in order to get to one place, to another</li><li>Ninja- Bridging- When a person is constantly shifting while bridging. A faster way of bridging basically</li><li>Breezily Bridging- A difficult tactic in which it is like regular bridging but you do not shift at all or for the most part. It is a hard tactic and very few know how to ultilize it but it is the fastest way of bridging.</li><li>Water drop- The act off falling from a high place but before you fall, &nbsp;you place a water bucket in order to take no damage. This is useful when you are up in a skybridge</li></ul><br><h1>Gamemodes</h1>Avicus offers a lot of gamemodes to choose from. Here is a little bit of information on all of them<br><i><br></i>[DTM] Destroy the Monument- These maps usually have an obsidian monument. The number of obsidian blocks can vary from 1-3 usually. The monuments are usually placed on the sides or back of the spawns so you have to be really sneaky.<br><i><br></i>[CTW]- Capture the Wool- It isn't an official gamemode yet but it is similar to capture the flag except you have to run to the enemy side to get the wool and back in order to wn<br><i><br><u></u></i>[TDM] Team death match- Teams must kill the enemy players in order to rack up points to win.<br><i>'<br></i>[OitC] (One in the Chamber). Info<br><br><br><i><br><br></i><u><br><br></u>Useful Links:<u><br><br></u>Small other notes: Ill continue when i get back from school. Its like 12 am and i have a lot to cover. If you want me to add, fix, or take out anything, please respond here in order to make this guide effective. This guide purpose is to answer most questions so the forums would be less spammy.<br><u><br>Updates:<br><br></u>1/27- Added Map making, Gamemodes, in game things(i will fix errors soon)<u><br><br></u><u><br></u>

Nice to have this thread get a sticky. Also just one recommendation if you could write up a short description of each gamemode? and maybe include this topic about <a href="http://avicus.net/forums/292161723" rel="nofollow">prestige's?&nbsp;</a>

Pretty awesome! But who told you we don't listen to reports that come in as /report {player} hacks? XD, overall I really like this post! Keep it up!
</blockquote>
</div>
Maybe don't listen&nbsp; at all but people should make detailed reports. I mean if some one does<i> /report &lt;player&gt; hacks,</i> as a litteral statement, it does not really tell much and chances are staff would take less attention to that report that then a more detailed report like "/report Y0urm0m2, unusal flying movement, 3-5 enemies hit at the same time around him. or /report Y0urm0m3 Team griefing- destroying team bridges and spleefed 1-3 people. I mean a person would most likely take a look into these type of reports than a person that reported "hacks"&nbsp; Idk how it goes but it should be that way where players can make detailed reports.<br><br>If my statement is false, please tell and ill edit it
