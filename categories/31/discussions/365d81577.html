I would say, if I never played on or heard about Avicus, life would be the same as before I started to play on this server. Yes, I am thankful I got to know some amazing people and some people I just want to punch in the face. If we think Avicus never existed for me, I would live my life normal, I got my job, my girlfriend, yes my life is perfectly fine right now. :)

If I had never found Avicus...&nbsp;<br>Well, I wouldn't have so many amazing friends who are so supportive and helpful, they've been there for me whenever I've needed them. I would most likely be stuck on my old server or other servers being a complete nub with nothing to do. I wouldn't be able to expierence such good and bad memories, yes we do thimgs in life that we regret... But most of my memories on Avicus are amazing and wonderful. I've never seen such an amazing community filled with helpful, dedicated, hard working people!
