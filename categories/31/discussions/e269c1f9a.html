Just curious on what avicus plans to do and whether or not you guys have received an email concerning it. Mojang has decided to file DMCA requests on servers that aren't in compliance with they're said "EULA"<br><br><a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/eula-dmca-requests-being-sent-out.125792/" title="Link: https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/eula-dmca-requests-being-sent-out.125792/">https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/eula-dmca-requests-being-sent-out.125792/</a><br><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/47bt3r/mojang_are_starting_to_crack_down_on_servers/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/47bt3r/mojang_are_starting_to_crack_down_on_servers/</a>

Good thing we aren't violating the EULA!<br><br>I doubt we will get an email since we are doing way better than other servers in respect to the EULA. (Finally it has paid off.)

Are you sure? I mean, they don't want any player to have any advantage over another player. Does this also mean the amount of credits one receives? If I'm correct, doesn't an upgraded account receive more credits per kill/win?<br><br>(Hopefully no issues arise on Avicus)

It goes after servers that sell god items that you can only get by donating. You can still get credits if you do not donate. Avicus is a very non-pay2win server

The credits only help with cosmetics which is allowed. What mojang don't want is for players to be able to buy items (that only those donators can buy) that completely change the gameplay.

They can "actually" take the server down by complaining to the server host. No it is not ludicrous.

It's a DMCA, any server host would because it is has legal implications for the host. Especially coming from a company like Microsoft. It's much easier for the host to shutdown the server than to defend a client.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>A DMCA was enough to effectively shutdown Bukkit which is the foundation of every server out there and happens to be owned by Mojang itself.

He's actually right, a DMCA is still a DMCA, if it took down an entire/well-known and used by thousands (probably more), it most certainly can take down a minecraft sever with not much effort. Networks such as Arkham have already been taking measures to fix there networks<br><br>If people love your server, they'd probably donate: even if it's for nothing in return

Exactly, the people at Spigot unofficially have continued Bukkit development, and Spigot is the layer on top of it. Sponge is looking pretty awesome, but so many features are still missing.

Sponge is technically bukkit reborn, considering all (if not most) of the bukkit team basically transformed themselves to Sponge.<br><br>I wouldn't use it if I were you (sticking to paperspigot/spigot would be better IMO)
