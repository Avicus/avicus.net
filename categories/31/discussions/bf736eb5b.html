And plus no mods ever want to do their job on the teamspeak when players are breaking the rules. That's why most of us use skype now since it's more in privacy as well. The old TS community was great, now it's almost dead.

All the people who used to be on TS are gone, also Emmaye If you feel privacy is an issue don't worry about it. I try being on TS 24/7 too moderate it, and tbh I do try my best. If you have a problem just poke me...
