Hello.&nbsp;<br><br>Please consider this as a heads up, nothing like an announcement or anything like that. Just a bit of community communication and transparency that is always healthy. Anything said here isn't bound to happen, as it's in no way a thing yet. Bear that in mind while reading the post.&nbsp;<br><br>Recently, it's come to the staff notice that there are several people which we observe that could potentially autoclick, however we are afraid to ban as it's a quite tricky and difficult thing to detect. Even before I was a dev I was already making my to do list, which included an autoclick detector; obviously making reliable and trustworthy code for an autoclick detector is quite hard, detecting patterns, cps, index variation, taking lag in account, etc. That time I was not aware autoclicking was such a problem, now I do and I'm already starting to write the main infrastructure and brainstorming ideas for it.&nbsp;<br><br>Also I think it would be unfair to not say this: we are probably not going to tell you when it will go live, as we want people to continue their normal habits, and catch them if they do something bad. So, if you reader are used to autoclick on Avicus, consider this thread as probably the last one we will publish until it's live, so if I were you, I'd stop it. That is the one and only warning.&nbsp;<br><br>Of course its coding will take its time, but I promise it will be good and won't give from very few to none false positives or positive falses. We won't unfairly ban for autoclicking anymore, as we will have very solid proof for it.&nbsp;<br><br>Also worth mentioning I wrote all this from my mobile phone while on holidays, but I think it was high-priority.&nbsp;<br><br>Have fun, don't autoclick.&nbsp;Peace o/

Great! Im pretty sure quite a few mods autoclick but another moderator clearly isn't going to do anything even if they think they're autoclicking too... This should help

I honestly aim, at least the autoclick part to be as good as theirs, however we will need several days of coding and testing before it can be better than nothing, if you get what I mean.
