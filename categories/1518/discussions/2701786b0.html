<div>Hey all,</div><div><br></div><div>Today we are releasing a new punishing tool, /mute! Muting players enables our Moderation team to remove talking privileges from users, instead of removing them from the server.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Mutes are not used for all chat related punishments. Offences such as, but not limited to, excessive caps, rudeness and spamming, will result in a mute. Serious offences will still issue bans.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>We hope that this new system will be quite effective and at the same time useful for our moderators. We believe that kicking and banning for minor offences isn't helpful anymore to know their fault, so with the new system, if they are muted, they can't talk on chat, but they can still play.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks,</div><div>The Senior Staff Team.</div>

This is a team-based objective server and since day 1 it has been intended for all users to be able to have established branches of communication so teams can cooperate in a match. Taking this away with mute due to caps violation or other offenses is a step backwards, because it will cause players to take their anger out in other ways, such as teamgriefing or hacking: thus causing more rulebreaking. There will be those muted who will want more attention, and more bans will come out of it.<br><br>Is a player trying to talk to a user in-game? The problem is, now they can't interact with them, let alone anyone. If I was addressed, I would like to know exactly why, but I wouldn't be able to even explain that I'm muted.<br><br>We maintained since MCZone that /mute was a bad idea- there was even a thread I posted in staff discussion long ago about why it was a bad idea, and virtually everyone agreed. I hope you sincerely reconsider adding this, the circumstances don't call for it and that's why OCN or any other respectable server never took away the most important part of a server: communication.

In the short term it could help Moderation but in the long term this will be terrible.<br><br>You have no way of referencing these mutes.. no way of seeing how many times a player has been muted..so you can't escalate punishments appropriately.<br><br>This is terrible from a Structural point of view with Moderation.<br><br>It's literally taking the only bad thing about verbal warns (no reference points) and amplifys it..

Alright, I was the one who requested it a long time ago, when I was still a junior. The problem was that I was unable to ban hackers, so the only thing I could do is to freeze them.

Now I've realized that there are good and bad points of having it.<br><br>Good points:<br><ul><li>Mute is not that harsh punishment and it should be only used for breaking chat rules</li><li>Amount of kicks would reduce, meaning the player can still play the game without having to rejoin</li><li>Juniors would be finally able to mute hackers and ensure they can not spam the chat while waiting for a MOD</li></ul>Bad points:<br><ul><li>Players are unable to communicate with their teammates, resulting in gameplay quality decrement</li><li>If a player is muted, there's a possibility of him/her getting angry and breaking the rules in a different way (referring to Vice's reply)</li><li>If player needs help from a staff member and he/she is muted, then that would result in player satisfaction decrement.&nbsp;</li></ul><br>I am happy of us being able to mute players instead of kicking them off the server, but at the same time I hope the punishments won't be too harsh or we'll lose players.<br><br>Kind regards,<br>EncryptedShoesHD

It's annoying to see a frozen hacker spamming until they get banned, I am sure regular players don't like that either.

The thread said that mutes won't be used for all chat punishments. I'm pretty sure the racism rule will remain the same, starting with a tempban as a first offense. Meanwhile, let's keep this chat on topic, you can discuss your punishment with me in an appeal.

I disagree, I think that most chat related offenses are not serious for being removed from the server, when there is a built in punishment method to deal with this. Lets be real, team chat really isn't used that much and it's not going to make a difference if they can't see anything, I don't remember the last time I gave information to my team in chat. He can still see the messages, and chances are if they're '''toxic''' enough to be muted then they wouldn't have given<br>&nbsp;information to their team anyway.
