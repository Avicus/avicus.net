<a href="https://pastebin.com/raw/Gcy2ui0R" rel="nofollow" title="Link: https://pastebin.com/raw/Gcy2ui0R">Versión en Español</a> |&nbsp;<br><br>Hello everyone!<br><br>Today I am proud to announce a big update to allow you all to play our network in a new way. This update adds achievements. The update adds a new tab to profiles where a list of all of your earned achievements is displayed. When you earn a new achievement, it is also displayed to you (and others if they have the setting enabled) when you earn an achievement.<br><br>There are a lot of achievements, which I will not disclose in the interest of letting you all find them out for yourselves. Just a note that some achievements which involve legacy data require you to log in after the update for those to be updated. Some other achievements that cannot be back-loaded started being tracked a month ago.<br><br>Thanks, and hope you enjoy the update,<br>ALM

I like this, but maybe if you let us see at least some of the achievements, that would be good. Once we finish all the achievements that we see, then you can show us a few more and repeat the process. Basically just hidden achievements which become unlocked upon completion of prior achievements.

</div>
For a start, leveraging your current user base to get more people in. For example, bring back voting on Minecraft server websites so more people casually looking for new servers would see Avicus (and reward people for voting, as people have little incentive to vote otherwise), or maybe reward a player for tweeting about Avicus (this would require being able to link a twitter account with an Avicus account, to verify that the player actually has the account).<br><br>Basically, figure out creative ways to <b>get the word&nbsp;out</b>; word of mouth is crucial for small groups trying to get noticed. And no, the Avicus Network's Instagram or Twitter won't cut it, because the only people who will see those messages are the ones actively looking up those accounts, meaning they already know of Avicus.
