Hey all!<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Today we are releasing something that has been requested and hyped for well over a year. We are finally rolling out a beta for the arcade! Since this is a beta, only Emerald+ will be able to join to test out the new games. We want to get everything right before we fully release it to the public in a few weeks. If you are not Emerald or higher, don't fear! We will be holding public testing events periodically (there's one today during a stream) to get a wider audience and range of feedback.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also releasing a new game mode with this update simply titled "Carts". The goal of this game is to get into a minecart before other players. The last player not in a cart will be eliminated. Think of it as musical chairs but with minecarts. More maps will be made for this mode in the coming weeks which will add some more variety. Keep in mind that this game type is in beta! Any issues should be reported on our issue tracker.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The other maps in the arcade rotation are&nbsp;Chopped (kill the most pigs to win),&nbsp;OiTQCampus (one shot bow kills, limited lives),&nbsp;Audax (Ghost Squadron), and&nbsp;Aura (Red Alert). We will be working to add more maps and game types in the coming weeks, so stay tuned!<br><br>Thanks,<br>ALM
