Hey all,<br><br>I would like to to first off start by apologizing for the lateness of this update and the odd time of this post. I've been up for a while writing an essay and this is the last thing I need to do before going to sleep.<br><br>ANYWAYS, here's the update!<br><br>As you might have noticed, a few of the icons around the site might look a bit different. A big thanks to&nbsp;<img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/d5d736622792456aa7d5c556718cf6b4?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/trevin.html" style="color: none">trevin</a> for updating the website icon set to a more modern version. His work made this update possible.<br><br>The main part of the update, however, is the addition of custom forum badges for premium users. These appear next to your ranks on the forums and can be configured from your edit profile page. The higher tier ranks have access to more icons and colors. Gold only has the basic icon and color set, and Emerald/Diamond have more colors/icons respectively. There are even some sets not enabled for anyone right now, which will allow us to give these out as special prizes. Each user can only have one badge and only YOU can edit it.<br><br>Also, since this update was late, I have tacked on "good faith" feature. This was going to be released later but I wanted to make up for my lateness. The Nyan gadget is back in the gadget store under "Devices". Go grab it!<br><br>Also&nbsp;<img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/eb1216878b1a4944bd4de0a818d9dfe2?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/Kashike.html" style="color: Gray">Kashike</a> is a dev again! He's going to be working on mostly backend stuff to make your experience more streamlined and efficient. Some of the stuff he does you won't see, but the changes he is making are making Avicus more structurally sound and easy to extend.<br><br>Thanks,<br>The Avicus Development Team

Cool update. But with the update of the icons, the steam icon no longer seems to work and a few icons for formatting a forum post are also broken.<br><br>And found an issue with badges. Contact me if you want to know how (devs that is)

When a feature for donors makes non-donors jealous, that is when you know you have created a successful donator perk.

I am jealous.
