New credit reward sounds. You can select which sound should play when you earn credits. The default will be the orb pickup sound. Once servers restart and update this will take effect!<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/N9Oq8CT.png" title="Image: http://i.imgur.com/N9Oq8CT.png">

In the last week, as many of you have seen, I implemented&nbsp; /stafflist  (which works) and  /friends  (which I fixed but we're just waiting for changes to be pushed).<br><br>Now, I have added colored text based on the distance of a bow kill at the request of <a href="https://avicus.net/Awesomerp">Awesomerp</a>.  It works as follows:<br><ul><li>If the kill is from less than 20 blocks, the color is light green.</li><li>If the kill is from 20 to 40 blocks, it is green.</li><li>If the kill is from 40 to 60 blocks, the color is yellow.</li><li>If the kill is from 60 to 80 blocks, the color is orange.</li><li>If the kill is from 80 to 150 blocks, the color is dark red.</li><li>If the kill is from <b>more</b> than 150 blocks, the color is dark red.</li></ul>

Enhanced /msg as some of you already saw on the&nbsp;<a href="https://avicus.net/revisions" rel="nofollow" title="Link: https://avicus.net/revisions">Revisions</a> tab. In a nutshell:<br><ul><li>The msgs now displays the team color for the player, and their ranks. Meaning that if you are Emerald the prefix that appears normally on chat will also be sent to the player you msg.</li><li>If the sender and the receiver are on different servers, the name of the server the sender is connected at will also be displayed in the message.</li></ul>This should appear on servers when they restart, hopefully you like it :)

Hello again! I have added a new command that hopefully you will like: /namehistory. As the command is pretty long it also has two aliases: /nh and /nhist.&nbsp;<br><br>You can probably guess what this does, checks the namehistory for a player on-the-fly. Kylo also made it async so hopefully it won't take more than a second to load. It is server wide. Also all of you have permission to use it.&nbsp;<br><br>Hopefully you'll like it :) <br>Regards<br>javipepe

Hello! Some new changes that kylo and I have made and should already be live on the servers!<br><br><ul><li>First, a bugfix, teleport on /go was fixed</li><li>Then, a long awaited thing that has finally come into surface, punishment messages for kicks, tempbans and bans (there are too many warns and most, and doesn't really take any effect into the rest of the players). Kylo helped with the message huehue :)</li><li>Warns used to appear in the chat, but now we are adding title support and titles will be displayed on a title if it's a 1.8 user. The message will still be sent just in case it's offline, afk, whatever.</li></ul>Stay tuned, new things are coming!

Going to take advantage of this MC downtime to perform some maintenance on the server. It shouldn't take longer than 1-2 hours.<br><br><b>And...&nbsp;</b>We're back. Servers coming up soon. MC is still offline though.

Hello folks.&nbsp;<br><br>As you have probably noticed, there have not been a lot of updates to the server dev-wise, while we have been working on quite a lot of them. I'm now going to explain why these mentioned stuff is not live yet. We are preparing our stuff for 1.8, because we have to change the structure of loads of stuff, drop support for many others, and create new cool stuff.<br><br>To put you into situation, we have a commit where we changed quite a lot of the structure, but that's not finished. Hence that commit is not pushed into the server, meaning it's obviously not live on any server (except Expo, read a bit more and you'll know). On top of that commit we have every update we have made since then.&nbsp;<br><br>Expo is the server where kylo and I test stuff (only seniors, devs, and admins have perms to access it). There, every commit we make gets pushed sooner or later for testing proposes there and only there, to see bugs and debug them; because we don't care if basic (let's say kill tracking) things don't work, however, it's the other way around on public servers. So, in a nutshell, we need to debug the very basic to the very top so we can make sure nothing bad will happen if we push to public servers after their respective restart.<br><br>So basically you'll get the idea with this diagram that would represent the <a href="http://avicus.net/revisions" rel="nofollow">revisions page</a>&nbsp;:<br><br><br><div class="table-responsive">

</div><br>So, what I want to explain here is that commit "3b5fb3b" (the last one) isn't live, the above ones won't either. So we got to make sure every new commit from the bottom to the top is correct, that's the meaning of Expo. Why that "Expo" name and not something like "Dev"? No idea, blame kylo.&nbsp;<br><br>The following is the list of changes that you can expect to appear when we update to 1.8:<br><ol><li><i>(For staff - jrs+)</i>- &nbsp;/f &lt;player&gt; (-u) - Freezes a player so they can no longer commit bad things. Unfreezes with -u. Staff members, if you haven't already, read the <a href="https://avicus.net/forums/15349bff0" rel="nofollow" title="Link: https://avicus.net/forums/15349bff0">guidelines and usage here</a>&nbsp;.</li><li>Patch for crosskills/doublekills/however you want to call it - What is that? When you kill a player and the player kills you too. Nasty, ah? Well it's fixed.</li><li>Several block-lag and block-delay fix attempts</li><li><i>(For staff)</i>- &nbsp;For the sake of being able to write a longer reason, /ban /kick and /warn are now aliased into /b, /k, /w respectively (you can still use the old ones though). Also /history is aliased to /h for speed reasons when looking into a user's infractions when about to punish.</li></ol>A bit on the doing and the to-do:<br><ol><li>We are planning on using 1.8 titles on a lot of more things, like when you win, a report comes in, etcetera. Titles are a great way of displaying information for an user and is much better for important info. &nbsp;What is a title javi? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLlr8ch54to" rel="nofollow" title="Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLlr8ch54to">How do you dare!!!</a></li><li>New cool website updates, as the forum-online indicator. <a href="https://twitter.com/AvicusNetwork/status/627093908216897536" rel="nofollow" title="Link: https://twitter.com/AvicusNetwork/status/627093908216897536">Sneak </a><a href="https://twitter.com/AvicusNetwork/status/627093908216897536" rel="nofollow" title="Link: https://twitter.com/AvicusNetwork/status/627093908216897536" class="">peak</a><a href="https://twitter.com/AvicusNetwork/status/627093908216897536" rel="nofollow" title="Link: https://twitter.com/AvicusNetwork/status/627093908216897536"> here!</a></li><li>FFA gamemode, its development was started on kylo's stream.</li><li>Discounts are now possible on the website, along with many other things, the new webpage will come with a 30% discount!</li><li>To Do: New revamped appeal system, shifting away from the forum system that wasn't really the best way of handling appeals and acting on them.</li><li>To Do: Many fixes and addons to the ingame report system (as adding an ID for each) so /takereport on click is finally possible!</li><li>To Do: Enhancements to the combat log reporting system.</li><li><b><a href="http://goo.gl/forms/jj7XTE4xuk" rel="nofollow" title="Link: http://goo.gl/forms/jj7XTE4xuk">SUBMIT YOUR IDEAS!</a></b></li></ol>We hope you like this small (well maybe not that small) heads up, thanks for flying Avicus; harden your seatbelt for the next update, woo hoo!<br><br>Regards!<br><br><i><u>PD: We may have a double perspective&nbsp;</u></i><i class=""><u class="">kylopepe&nbsp;</u></i><i><u class="">livestream</u></i><i><u>&nbsp;soon!!!!</u></i>

Hello!<br><br>Many of you may have seen the new website changes kylo has been working on lately, and now (most of them) are live! In a nutshell these are the changes:<br><ul><li><b>Sales made possible</b>. We now have a 25% sale on all of the shop products until 20 days from now, <a href="http://avicus.net/shop" rel="nofollow" title="Link: http://avicus.net/shop">make sure to get one!</a></li><li>A bit of the <b>main page rework</b>, sexy green ribbon for the sale</li><li><b>Forum online indicator</b>, you will see a green ball next to an online player's post. This indicates that the player is online on the website, not ingame.</li><li><b>Stickied threads' titles are now bolded</b> with the goal of making them more important and making them more "different"</li></ul>Also, the <b>1.8 update</b> is really near and with it, loads of new features and tools. We are hoping to deliver it next weekend, though we'll see if it we can meet this deadline.<br><br>Raise your hypes, and thanks for playing!

As you may or may not have noticed, a few days ago I added some fancy titles to monument destroying and wool capturing with some cool icons. If you don't know what I'm talking about, have a few screenshots:<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/woAADcG.png" title="Image: https://i.imgur.com/woAADcG.png"><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZWMNsM8.png" title="Image: https://i.imgur.com/ZWMNsM8.png"><br><br>However, I found people that loved them and people that found them annoying; so the most intelligent - and requested - thing to was to add a small toggle to it (will be live on server restart):<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/pcKmhk6.png" title="Image: https://i.imgur.com/pcKmhk6.png"><br><br>Just a small heads up :)

ALM has added tournament-specific punishments and alerts recently. He has also added significant amounts of documentation to <a href="http://atlas.avicus.net" rel="nofollow" title="Link: http://atlas.avicus.net">atlas.avicus.net</a>. Do check it out if you are interested in Atlas and writing Atlas XML.<br><br>We've been very happy with how Atlas testing has been going. We've only seen a few bugs, the only things that need changing are little additions that Avicore has that Atlas is lacking. Progress!

Worked on some changes to the server menu. Right now it is not utilized, but for future gamemodes this may be relevant. Server groups, which group together servers of the same gamemode, are represented as a single icon in the server menu. Left click and right click performs different functions.<br><br>This makes it easy to find a match, but still possible to join a specific server, or spectate an ongoing match you desire.<br><br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/IwOzpLO.png" title="Image: http://i.imgur.com/IwOzpLO.png">

This update is large, but it does not contain any visible features as of yet so I am going to post it here.<br><br>First, let me start off by giving you a little history of Atlas. Atlas was first written with one goal in mind, to fit the needs of Avicus in the current state that it was in when development began. This state was purely a completive PVP-oriented environment and thus Atlas was written to only satisfy those needs. This has it's advantages and disadvantages. The advantages are that we are able to handle these sort of games extremely well and are able to write features to cater to these specifically. The disadvantages of this are that we are not really able to write features to better suit and support other game types, such as walls or SkyWars. These game types are currently stuck in Atlas but do not fit in with the rest of the games and are poorly handled in places that expect competitive conditions to be happening as opposed to more simple games such as these.<br><br>This has been a problem since the beginning, and adding new game types over time has become increasingly more difficult and hacky. To help remedy this issue, I have written an external loading system similar to the way Bukkit loads plugins that we now use to write components for Atlas. Right now Atlas is a load of different features that are written to facilitate specific game types and that aren't used outside of these types. With this system, I have extracted out different parts of Atlas (competitive, walls, skywars, generic arcade) and left the core Atlas with just things used across game types (regions, checks, base executors, zones, etc). The nice thing about this new system is that new game types can be coded into an external component and only loaded in on certain servers so that core Atlas does not need to change with each addition.&nbsp;<br><br>Here's a list of the game type sets:<br><ul><li>Competitive - Destroyables, Leakables, Wools, Hills, Flags</li><li>Walls - Any special walls kits, handling of scoreboard and wall removal</li><li>SkyWars - Handling of spawn distribution, special features</li><li>Generic Arcade - General stuff that can be included in all Arcade games like auto team selection and joining mid-game</li></ul><br><br>This system does have one caveat, and it effects some of the maps we currently have in the repository. You cannot combine game type sets in maps anymore. This means that maps such as Walluar or SkyWars maps with hills or flags are no longer possible but the advantages highly outweigh the few negatives.<br><br>New features and games should come of this soon,<br>Austin
