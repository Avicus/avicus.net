Staff Reassessment day - Notification

</h1>
Hello everyone.<br><br>Over the past few weeks, the senior staff have been discussing possible ways to improve the efficiency of the staff team.&nbsp;<br>We came up with an alteration of Howsie22's idea <i>(which was to originally to demote all staff (including Directors, and then re-promoting the worthy ones)).&nbsp;</i>However, only the <b>Moderator</b>&nbsp;team will be affected (Junior Moderators &amp; Map Developers are excluded).&nbsp;<br><br>Essentially, this is how it's going to work:<br>1) Demote all mods, to a regular rank.<br>2) Opinionated discussion<br>3) Senior Staff will mark each moderator, <b>privately.<br></b>4) Dig deep into evidence that may or may not effect the fate of the staff member being discussed.<br><b></b>5) Finalize the data in which the senior staff has completed.<br>6) Take action; promote the moderators who passed. Permanently demote the ones who didn't.<br><br>This process will take up to 2-3 hours, depending on the efficiency of the senior staff.&nbsp;<br><br><i>This will occur @ 6PM EST Saturday 29th (9AM AEST Sunday 30th).&nbsp;</i><br><br><b>Can you make a difference?<br></b>Potentially, yes. If you have any complaints on a staff member, please log onto Teamspeak and search for this: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://prntscr.com/5az38a">http://prntscr.com/5az38a</a><br><br>All senior staff who will be participating in this event will be available. Do not troll us with pokes, as you will be punished for it. We will consider all evidence provided, as long as it's suffice.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Thanks,<br><b>Senior Staff</b>

This is great, tho:<br>I don't&nbsp; think you should demote Mods to regular users at first; you should demote after the discussion, otherwise there would be 2-3 hour gap with possibly no staff at all. (Sr.staff busy deciding, mods demoted) Also, new or uninformed players would freak out if they saw the staff page in that time slot... and with so many mods demoted/promoted at the same time, the staff page might break again o.o<br>^-^

The reason the Sr.Staff aren't taking part in this and most likely aren't going to in the future, is because we basically already went through this to&nbsp;<i>achieve&nbsp;</i>Sr.Staff. We had to go through an interview stage testing if we had what it took to move up to Sr.Mod. So technically, the Sr.Mods who were recently promoted (myself included) have basically gone through this already. The only difference is that we weren't brought down to a regular rank before we did the interview.

Regarding favoritism, I created a written test that each Moderator will need to complete, and test scores do matter. It consists of 10 questions every Moderator should know. Their results play a huge role in whether they keep their rank or not, as well as a&nbsp;<i>group</i> decision between all of the Sr.Staff. I don't think bias will be playing a role here.

No matter how hard you try to get rid of it, bias will always be there in one way or another.

However with the amount of people taking part in the decision, it's based off of majority. So if a staff member has 4 votes yes and 3 votes no, it would lean toward the yes side of the decision. That could be seen as bias, in a way. But I agree, there's no way to completely be rid of bias decisions. One person could be saying yes because "Oh I know them personally and they're a really nice person" or "They're very efficient in the way they perform their duties as staff, for example.." We can't control how others think. So in a way I guess I have to agree.

But we're obviously going to try our best to make the decision as fair and mature as possible, attempting to keep bias out of the picture.

Like the idea.&nbsp; Didn't someone one in some country fire their government people and hold a new election.&nbsp; But that should only be in desperate times.&nbsp; I like the staff team, so this sounds unnecessary.&nbsp; Just demote the ones who aren't cut out for the job.

To be honest, I like all the staff team, excepting one or two exceptions, but I think the staff team shouldn't be modificated yet, excepting when the applications will open and one or two moderators demoted.

What I'm most curious about, is how many moderators are expected to be demoted. I can't imagine more than 2 or 3.<br><br>Excited, though. Good luck everyone! :)<br><br>EDIT: Woah, TIL theres 24 mods. Okay, <i>maybe</i> 4-6.

The way I've designed the markings; there will be no bias.&nbsp;<br>There is to be no communication between the sr staff during this process.&nbsp;<br><br>One senior staff member's opinion does <b>not </b>guarantee anything. I would rather not go into detail how it's going to work out.<br>Believe me, if there were to be bias, it would be so small it would barely take affect.

Guys, what Jozz means, is it'll be as unbiased as (as Iron said) human characteristics can let us get to. Although it's difficult to be 100% unbiased, it's still easy to be unbiased, to the point where if there is bias, it's doesn't completely change the outcome.&nbsp;<br><br>I don't have any doubts about this, and how it'll go. I think things will run smoothly, because of how many people are involved in the decision. Even if 1 staff member had bias, the other may not. Remember, majority rules.

This is great, tho:<br>I don't&nbsp; think you should demote Mods to regular users at first; you should demote after the discussion, otherwise there would be 2-3 hour gap with possibly no staff at all. (Sr.staff busy deciding, mods demoted) Also, new or uninformed players would freak out if they saw the staff page in that time slot... and with so many mods demoted/promoted at the same time, the staff page might break again o.o<br>^-^

</div>
I totally agree with you, you should demote 1 by 1, if not, there won't be any Moderators in the server for over 3 hours..
