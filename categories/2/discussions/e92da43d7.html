After reflecting over statistics regarding how long an average player on Avicus spends, the Administrators came to a conclusion that one of the current problems is retaining users, getting them is one thing but keeping them on the server is a completely different thing. We questioned if we were targeting the right audience or if perhaps the average player didn't even know what Avicus was and what it provided? We came to a conclusion that we had to do something regarding keeping new users, so Keenan and the Developers have been hard at work making a tutorial plugin and then working with the Map Developers to implement it.&nbsp;<br><br><b>What's it?<br></b>Basically the Tutorial is a slide show, ingame ,that shows the player a) What Avicus is about b) How to play it and c) How to play each map. This plugin won't exactly be of much use to all of us regulars you know what's going on, but it will more benefit new players.<br><b><br>How can I see it?<br></b>Go into the hub and click on the emerald. We'll also be introducing mini tutorials into maps, so that each time it cycles you can see how to play on <b>that&nbsp;</b>specific map.<br><br>All in all, hopefully this will help new players find out what Avicus is really about and hopefully we are able to hold on to players.&nbsp;<br><br><b>On a side note<br></b>Advertising has kicked off and we're currently experimenting to see what kind of effect it will have on the server and if we actually see a player increase in the current advertising schemes we are doing.<br><br>- <img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/8242e55ecc6a458ab272a2b34918045f?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/keenanjt.html" style="color: #E77400">keenanjt</a>,&nbsp;<img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/89f514e1f0f549778ddc77ef030a8b46?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/Posighdun.html" style="color: Gray">Posighdun</a>,&nbsp;<img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/0b8f95fa0f404f289fd0b8e243bb6800?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/Fouled.html" style="color: #FF5C5C">Fouled</a> &amp;&nbsp;<img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/701196d59e574bc9c19b7f63e1fbfaef?s=20&amp;default=mm" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/Arigenn.html" style="color: none">Arigenn</a>

Right now we've purchased some slots on minestatus, so we appear up the top of the list. We're looking into youtubers, we've contacted plenty but we're deciding whose best for us and in some cases the youtubers want to check us out.

I think there should be a title when you join saying click on the emerald to see tutorial<br><br><br>or something indicating how to get to the tutorial

minestatus was prob. the one of the worst options, you won't see many new players.<br><br>sorry but it's true.<br><br>hopefully you never spent that much money on it.<br><br>For future reference, use either .org or minecraft-server-list.com
