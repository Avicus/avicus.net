Hey!<br><br>Because of the fact that we are only two, and we both have in real life duties to fulfill, and we are sooooo and I repeat soooooo off timezone-wise, we have set up a new organization system because we realized that we never talked and discussed what needed to be done, our priorities, general questions to each other, and the setting of To-dos for next week.<br><br>I guess after this short introduction the idea would be to explain these to-dos to the community on a weekly basis, and as we work on a different branch which changes do not get reflected at <a href="https://avicus.net/revisions" title="Link: https://avicus.net/revisions">https://avicus.net/revisions</a>, their state too. It is like that because Kylo and I are now having weekly meetings to set this values for the forthcoming week, which will exponentially increase the number of things that get done, and consequently (but not in that of a blatant manner), the new things you guys will see on the server.<br><br>Our first meeting within this new system was supposed to be last week but as I was away, we postponed it to yesterday. Yesterday, as it was the first meeting, we had a plethora of topics to talk about and to argument into. The things that are primarly getting done (minor things are not listed, and maybe confidential ones too, ex: staff related...) are:<br><br><h3>Friday the 11th of December - 2015</h3><b><br></b><b>On my side:<br></b><ul><li>Add some new links to the website. (<u>DONE</u> - not pushed). Within this commit a link to <a href="https://avicus.net/vote" title="Link: https://avicus.net/vote">https://avicus.net/vote</a>&nbsp;will soon appear in the top navbar, and both this link and the one that will head onto <a href="http://avicus.net/lottery" title="Link: http://avicus.net/lottery">http://avicus.net/lottery</a>&nbsp;will also appear in the bottom navigation panel.</li><li>/rules with link to <a href="http://avicus.net/rules" title="Link: http://avicus.net/rules">http://avicus.net/rules</a>&nbsp;(<u>DONE</u> - not pushed). This is quite self explanatory :p</li><li>Death messages clearing (<u>Halfway there</u> - not pushed). Within this commit, death messages in which you are involved in will appear bolded to you for better easy-seeking of them, cool, eh?</li><li>Finish up the new and server-by organized /stafflist&nbsp;(<u>DONE</u> -&nbsp;<u>LIVE<i></i></u><i></i>). This was mostly already done, but we finished it and pushed it to the network yesterday, so... go try it!</li></ul><b>On kylo's side:</b><br><ul><li>Fix /reports command (<u>PROBABLY DONE</u> - not live). The /reports command shows the most recent reports of the server, and right now apparently it was taking the last ones. Probably fixed already.</li><li>Fancy main page lottery flair (<u>NOT DONE</u> - not live). The main page is getting a bit stale and thus kylo will be working on giving it some life. The first thing to probably come will be a big lottery link / info display.</li><li>Check 1.8 update branch (<u>Halfway there</u> - not live). We have many, and really, MANY things to check for the 1.8 update. As kylo knows the structure of the plugins he created better than I do, he's looking at possible bugs and memory leaks before making any live.</li><li>Lottery winners actually getting their prize (<u>Almost there</u> - not live). Pretty straightforward too.</li></ul><b>To come on future meetings:<u></u></b><br><ul><li>Server picker / board huge revamp - More information on this to come soon.</li><li>Avicore revamp</li><li>Cute tablist - Feel free to suggest how you'd like to see a 1.8 tablist .(<b>EDIT</b>: No it's not the scoreboard but the tablist, sorry messed up)</li><li>Loads of other ideas, and maybe even <a href="https://avicus.net/forums/87c1e76bb" rel="nofollow" title="Link: https://avicus.net/forums/87c1e76bb">your idea too</a>!</li></ul>We are very pleased to bring more activity onto the staff team, hopefully this will help a lot. Whenever a meeting occurs we'll update the OP with the info, and bump the thread so that you get alerted and notice it.&nbsp;<br><br>Happy avicusing!
