<h3>About<br><span style=" font-weight: 300;">In a bid to get teams and team members more active the Senior Staff will be coordinating weekly Mega Scrims at the listed times below. Megascrims will always be held on the weekends, at times that are best for everyone. The times will vary from week to week but the days won't. I'll get a proper megascrim channel going soon and I'm going to try to see if we can get a permanent server for the purpose of Megascrims, if not then we'll just use scrim servers.</span></h3><br>

<h3>What's a megascrim?<br><span style=" font-weight: 300;">A megascrim is a scrim where members from multiple teams play each other in assigned teams. 2 captains pick and assign players to the teams and then we scrim. It's kind of like a Football match you might have at recess. There are no assigned teams, you just turn up, pick teams and play. Well that's how a megascrim essentially works.</span></h3><br>

<h3>How do I participate?<br><span style=" font-weight: 300;"> Anyone can play as long as they have access to Teamspeak, you don't need a microphone but you need to be on Teamspeak in assigned channels. If you want to play you simply come onto Teamspeak at the assigned time and move into the assigned channel (more on that later). You must also be on Avicus and be able to play on the server. You don't have to post here, you just show up. I want to stress this, you don't have to be a regular to play. All you need is Teamspeak so virtually anyone can play as long as they have Teamspeak.</span></h3><br>

<h3>How will this differ from Unofficial Megascrims?<br><span style=" font-weight: 300;"> They'll differ in 2 ways. A) These will be more organised and B) Unlike unofficial Megascrims, these will be hosted weekly at a set time.</span></h3><br>

They have a job and responsibility, this is part of it. Senior Staff should be involved with other issues. Regardless, it should be easy to combine planning/hosting a tournament and a megascrim.

Anyone can host a megascrim. It isn't really something the Officials should worry about. Regulars host these kinds of things every once in a while so I don't see a problem with us having a go.

A MegaScrim could be organized by everyone, also, as Posighdun said, the officials&nbsp;work on the torunaments or at least an event bigger than a MegaScrim. Whereas the Senior Moderators should work in this things that are more related to the community.

I was going to do one today but there is an unofficial tourney so I can't. If you want to host it or get another senior mod to then by all means you can and I can make it an official time.<br><img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/fb57ed989f4140c78e61dee46d34d427?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/AtditC.html" style="color: none">AtditC</a>

Prefer unofficial ones, they actually make an&nbsp;<u><b>attempt&nbsp;</b></u><b></b>to letting Aussie's play. Oh well, hype for whoever is playing.
