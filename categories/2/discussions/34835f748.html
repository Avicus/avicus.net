Some things such as your player name not appearing correctly in the tab list is a result of poor 1.8-1.9 support and is unlikely to be fixed.

Well, just an idea... Maybe there can be two servers, for 1.8 players and for 1.9 players, because there are people who like 1.9 (30% we can say) and there are people who like 1.8 (70% we can say). I don't know why we are making in 1.9, when most of people hate it. Staying on 1.8 and waiting for Mojang to fix it would be better I guess.

There will be no 1.9 features. It's just the server as it is now, just that you can join with 1.9, which means new players can join since it is the latest version.
