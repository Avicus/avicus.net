I advise you sit down before reading this... I've&nbsp;added AAC (the AntiCheat system we use) back into Avicus.. It'll be okay.&nbsp;Before you freak out and exclaim that AAC is literally a product of the devil and it should be burned at the stake, please actually read this post and you might get an idea of why we are doing this!<br><br>It is added back&nbsp;with the intention of ironing out the root cause of some major issues that we faced when it was deployed on our servers earlier. An anti-cheat system is necessary in filling the role of moderators where they should not be needed. Checks for spam bots, blatant flying and other movements can easily be detected by AAC and handled accordingly. Other checks, such as with block breaking, block placing and intricate movements cannot be always be detected by AAC, or worse&nbsp;it may&nbsp;produce false positives. This is the biggest issue we are dealing with. We know that many of you have already seen some of the side-effects of this plugin&nbsp;<b>when poorly configured</b>. We have since changed some options in the plugin to decrease the number of checks and its responses to these checks. If the plugin was perfect, all of these checks could be enabled, but as we have discovered, it has some issues. As we receive reports of more false positives, we will consider disabling their respective checks.<br><br>Please comment with your experiences on the server as of 2 PM CST&nbsp;(when all servers should have restarted) here&nbsp;<a href="http://www.avicus.net/issues" title="Link: http://www.avicus.net/issues">www.avicus.net/issues</a>.<br><br><b>In other news, we are getting really close to some awesome plugin development and website updates (more backend enhancements, but still big updates nonetheless)! Expect some development updates soon.</b>

The anti-spam plugin is good and all but it is too frequent and annoying.<br><br>You should make it so that you don't type 3 messages in a row too fast. Not the way that it is currently. It's annoying.

Well personally I don't really believe in anticheat as a moderator but I guess if it warms us a bit of when a player is suspicious I'm fine with it. The thing is, it's not the anticheat who causes most of the lag, based on testing with people's reactions and personal tests it has to be another thing.

Well I think he actually played a bit on you (not sure) because when people said wow everything is ok now the anticheat was on, and when some said omgomg freking AAC laggggg it was actually off.<br><br>As I said my pov on this is in a few words is: I don't think aac is needed but I don't think its the very main lag source either.
