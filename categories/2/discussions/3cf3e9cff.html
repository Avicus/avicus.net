A new game manager plugin is coming to Avicus that we like to call, </span><span style=" font-family: 'Lato'; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700;   background-color: transparent;">Atlas</span><span style=" font-family: 'Lato'; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;">. As most of you know, since the Avicore update, we have used </span><span style=" font-family: 'Lato'; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700;   background-color: transparent;">Avicore </span><span style=" font-family: 'Lato'; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;">to manage games. Since then, nearly two years have gone by and Avicus has obviously changed dramatically - our community has shifted towards the competitive genre, and our minigames have become somewhat stale due to the limited features Avicore is able to support. This is what Atlas is aiming to address.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: 'Lato'; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;">We want Avicus to properly host games for the competitive Minecraft community in addition to reestablishing the casual gaming community within Avicus in the long run. This is why Atlas is coming, and what it makes it so great. It is what you have been waiting for, and what the developers have been working hard to complete</span><span style=" font-family: 'Lato'; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;">.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: 'Lato'; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;">Atlas differs from Avicore in many respects. I’ll do my best to list off these changes:</span></p><br><ul style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><li style="  font-family: 'Lato'; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700;  background-color: transparent;"><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="  background-color: transparent;">XML: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;   background-color: transparent;">Currently Atlas only supports XML. We may provide support for other markup (YML, JSON, HOCON) in the future, but is unlikely. Map developers are starting to learn Atlas XML and I will be helping with the process of converting Avicore maps to Atlas maps.</span></p></li><li style="  font-family: 'Lato'; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);  background-color: transparent;"><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-weight: 700;   background-color: transparent;">Translations:</span><span style="  background-color: transparent;"> Every message sent to a player can be translated. Map developers can even (and are </span><span style="text-decoration: line-through;   background-color: transparent;">strongly encouraged</span><span style="  background-color: transparent;"> required to) provide translatable messages for team names, objective names, and in game messages and warnings. The </span><a href="http://atlas.avicus.net" style="text-decoration:none;" title="Link: http://atlas.avicus.net">documentation website</a><span style="  background-color: transparent;"> for writing map configuration files supports translations as well. Help get your native language translated at </span><a href="http://translate.avicus.net" style="text-decoration:none;" title="Link: http://translate.avicus.net">translate.avicus.net</a><span style="  background-color: transparent;">.</span></p></li><li style="  font-family: 'Lato'; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700;  background-color: transparent;"><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="  background-color: transparent;">Objectives:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;   background-color: transparent;"> Under Avicore, objectives are defined by the gamemode of the map. For example, only DTM maps can define monuments and only CTW maps can define wool. Atlas maps, on the other hand, can define any number of objectives in one map (monuments, wool, hills, score caps and more all in one map!).</span></p></li><li style="  font-family: 'Lato'; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700;  background-color: transparent;"><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="  background-color: transparent;">New tab list: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;   background-color: transparent;">The tab list has been organized to show teams, spectators and game information more clearly.</span></p></li><li style="  font-family: 'Lato'; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700;  background-color: transparent;"><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="  background-color: transparent;">No death screen: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;   background-color: transparent;">We have disabled the death screen and replaced it with a popup message. Upon dying during a match, a player can now spectate the game until they desire to respawn (map developers can toggle this).</span></p></li><li style="  font-family: 'Lato'; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700;  background-color: transparent;"><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="  background-color: transparent;">More modules/elements: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;   background-color: transparent;">There are many more features available in Atlas of which map developers should take advantage.</span></p></li><ul style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><li style="  font-family: 'Lato'; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);  background-color: transparent;"><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-weight: 700;   background-color: transparent;">Zones:</span><span style="  background-color: transparent;"> A zone is a region that has special qualities. For example, you can give an item or a potion effect to a player when entering an area. Or, you might want to define </span><span style="font-weight: 700;   background-color: transparent;">team bases </span><span style="  background-color: transparent;">where only one team can enter and are exempt from player damage.</span></p></li><li style="  font-family: 'Lato'; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700;  background-color: transparent;"><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="  background-color: transparent;">More regions: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;   background-color: transparent;">Points, cuboids, cylinders, circles, spheres, joined, translated, inverted, intersected, subtracted, above, below void and more regions are available. See the Atlas documentation for a complete and descriptive list.</span></p></li><li style="  font-family: 'Lato'; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700;  background-color: transparent;"><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="  background-color: transparent;">Spawns: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;   background-color: transparent;">Spawns are used to define where a player should be teleported to and what items they should be given when they appear in the map or respawn after a death. Many types of regions can be specified here.</span></p></li><li style="  font-family: 'Lato'; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700;  background-color: transparent;"><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="  background-color: transparent;">Better objectives: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;   background-color: transparent;">More options for wool and monuments are provided. Some examples include: monuments as a region as opposed to a single block, monuments as any type of material instead of obsidian, optional fireworks upon completion, and disable crafting of wool. See the docs for more information!</span></p></li><li style="  font-family: 'Lato'; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700;  background-color: transparent;"><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="  background-color: transparent;">Hills: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;   background-color: transparent;">We have scrapped the “capture the hill” behavior of hills and now provide hill objectives. Teams compete for control of any number of hills by having members of their team possess one for a certain amount of time.</span></p></li><li style="  font-family: 'Lato'; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700;  background-color: transparent;"><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="  background-color: transparent;">Events, conditions and triggers: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;   background-color: transparent;">For the more savvy map developers, we leave you with the most important change last. These three map elements allow you to modify almost any event that occurs during a match. The documentation explains how to take advantage of events.</span></p></li></ul></ul><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: 'Lato'; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;">I know you’re eager to try it out. We are too! We want to see this in action on the live servers as soon as possible, but we must be careful not to rush it. We are extensively testing the new plugin with map developers and selected staff members. Public testing will be happening soon and it will surely be announced ahead of time.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: 'Lato'; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;"><img class="thumbnail" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Ee-JDL3Tt6RMItVnN37mVgQBQiQZG-o0X9aG7m-tAZFFvyxUfETBlGoiOUs4w4GjIDhIO5keCJme6t0F6s5AJrrjG3vpRspTl7O-XDWfWbyBsqtWm0dwFQnQE5t8tqve3qLaUXiH" style="border: none;  " title="Image: https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Ee-JDL3Tt6RMItVnN37mVgQBQiQZG-o0X9aG7m-tAZFFvyxUfETBlGoiOUs4w4GjIDhIO5keCJme6t0F6s5AJrrjG3vpRspTl7O-XDWfWbyBsqtWm0dwFQnQE5t8tqve3qLaUXiH"></span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: 'Lato'; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 700;   background-color: transparent;">A note on the next tournament:</span></p><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style=" font-family: 'Lato'; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);   background-color: transparent;">It’s very possible the next tournament will be running on Atlas if all goes smoothly and it is so desired by the players and the tournament organization team. We’ll do our best to keep Atlas working on 1.8, regardless of what happens with the main server, which means the tournament will likely be on 1.8. This is assuming there are no changes made to 1.9 gameplay and the perception of 1.9 gameplay that would persuade us to upgrade.</span></p><br><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><i>- Avicus Development Team</i></p><div><span style=" font-family: 'Lato'; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);    background-color: transparent;"><br></span></div></span>

Interesting how I didn't suggest upgrading to 1.9 anywhere in this post, in fact I said it's not even on our radar currently, yet it's discussed below. *sigh*<br><br>Let's talk about Atlas, not 1.9.

As much as I love to see this ans am do exited My mind wanders to avicore and how long it took and how eventually dissapointed people were.. It was a good update but the hype train had left like 3 months before it arrived.<br><br>All I'm saying is post regular updates, keel the players noticed, keep the hype train rolling and we won't have a repeat of avicore.<br><br>Hopefully not 17 years this time d:^)

Item keep is basically a component that allows mapmakers to select certain blocks and items that will stay in a player's inventory even though they have died.<br><br>This will be great and allow maps to be focused around a steady progression of upgrades using NPC villagers.<br><br>Also, add an armor-lock thingy that prevents players from taking off the selected armor or ITEMS that happens to be on a player's body.<br><br>The regen blocks would be a great way to fix a map that was griefed or shorten the amount of Iron so that the map can be more focused on aesthetics and gameplay.<br><br>Basically regenerating ore blocks.<br><br>Also, this could cause a lot of lag and problems... Too many blocks regenerating at a single time... Players getting stuck through blocks...<br><br>For this reason, make sure that you not only add a time set to regen SELECTED blocks but make sure that you add an option to prevent players from getting stuck in blocks.

I'm pretty sure they don't. This update is to improve the 'elasticity' of map making, so basically we can do more diverse things with them, creating more options ffor gamemodes and such.<br><br>OP: a few ideas for map making include:<br><br>-Locked monuments: there are more than one monuments on a map but they have to be broken in a certain order. Once &nbsp;monument #1 is broken, you can then break monument #2, then #3 and so on. I believe Sli thought of this.<br><br>-Points by the break and capture of a monument: this idea was thought of by Eric. Essentially, the map is set up aas if it were DTM, but for each monument break you receive some points (let's say 10). Then you have the ability to return your obsidian to your spawn, granting you more points (let's say 10 more). Your team then in total have 20 points. The obsidian respawns once the broken obsidian is lost by the 'breaker' and the first team to reach a target (let's say 200 points) wins.<br><br>CTW and DTM: this was mentioned in the original post but I thought I might mention it anyway. There's a wool room, there's a monument. First team to break the Monument and capture the wool wins. I know there is currently some maps being made for this so I hope this works :D

Would you be able to make blocks around a monument slowly collapse after the monument is broken, that'd be cool, for the world around the monument to slowly disappear after it's broken, and just keep doing that untill the games ends.It would be helpful to tell what monuments are broken w/o looking at the sidebar.&nbsp;<br><br>Also, is there a way to 'highlight' a monument? Like to show where it is, because some monuments are hard to find lol

Maybe its not good to add Event.Spectators to Tablistevent ?<br><br>Because Hackers can see who is spectating and can faster toggle off the hacked client / Inject Client,

Interesting how I didn't suggest upgrading to 1.9 anywhere in this post, in fact I said it's not even on our radar currently, yet it's discussed below. *sigh*<br><br>Let's talk about Atlas, not 1.9.
</blockquote>
</div>
1.9 is literally so bad most of us go out of our way to say these things to people responsible of servers. OCN upgraded to 1.9, and even though they made a lot of changes to make it better, most competitive OCN players either started playing another game mode, joined Avicus or left Minecraft all together. While this increases our player count by a little, the point I'm trying to make is that OCN lost players, a lot of players. I still remember the days where &nbsp;we were going from 1.7 to 1.8 and people were saying it "ruined PvP" (guilty of this). If we are to update to 1.9, which I remind you is made by developers that mostly have kids that aren't competitive at all to please, and that it is named the "Combat Update" which is basically a recipe for failure when it comes to competitive PvP, most of us, at least I wouldn't be very happy.<br><br>But, you're the boss. xP

they won't update for a long time. the staff here actually know how pvp works thankfully like people like piez, tazz, cyclops, stimulating etc. they know that 1.9 will be really bad. also I think kylo knows that 1.9 will lose a lot of his players ;)

mfw you say that yet they updated to 1.8 which is so much worse than 1.7 and even worse is the fact that the servers quality went down when they updated as opposed to making it better gg

1.8 still sucks major ass, there's no reason the server isn't mixed versions of 1.7/1.8 right now<br><br>the nerds who tried to use stats for the comparison are fools to see that this wouldn't happen - less players when the server is pure 1.8 as opposed to mixed
