These would be at this current state English, Spanish, and German. Any other languages may be added, however they are not required to be updated consistently with the others. If a ruleset is outdated past a translation and it cannot be updated properly, in a time frame of 2 weeks, that specific ruleset translation is considered deprecated and removed from the website. If there is an incorrect translation, the senior staff are to forward it immediately to a developer (if the user does not do it themselves). Incorrect translations, minor or major, should be attended to with any available user to translate it. Keep in mind, revising or translation will not be available to users who are not fluent in a language. If the community wants a new language to be added, and they veto for it under proper basis, they may make such a request for the language, and ALL staff groups are intended to discuss it. Under no circumstance for a translation language request should it be private. A translation team is not recognized officially as a staff group, but a translator group is recommended to tackle the rule project. The translation project is lead especially by an administrator.</span></p><br><p style=" margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="  font-weight: 700; "></span></p><p style=" margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="  font-weight: 700; ">(U)</span></p><p style=" margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 133, 117); font-family: Verdana;  ">POLICY 2.2 - Retirement Policy</span></p><p style=" margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;  ">Reassessment is a system used to reconsider if a staff member has been falsely demoted from the network, or wishes to return.

Might want to add in somewhere that because Javipepe is a Moderator, he can obviously punish without permission from the Senior staff. <br>Just to avoid confusion.

Devs, &nbsp;pretty much only ALM, &nbsp;I think should be allowed to ban blatant hackers such as Fly when there are no mods online and a ban is greatly needed.

While I agree it is sometimes not a big deal, such as with fly hackers, I think it's best to stick to the policy for this to avoid confusion. Devs are welcome to record hackers and place the evidence on slack for a moderator to ban.

Nice new policies, though I'm sure Vice had to do with half of them. Great job to Vice and the seniors/administrators who came up with these new/updated policies

It goes without saying. If you're a moderator and a developer you have training in both, which baisically says it all

Since on the topic, there needs to be a solution to hackers roaming free when there are no staff on, &nbsp;running game play experience.

They have more power, but they can't ban because they're not moderators?

Yeah, I think the permissions developers need are entwined with some moderator permissions that can't be removed.
