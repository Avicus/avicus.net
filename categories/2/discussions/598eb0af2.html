New Appeal System

<small>February 20, 2016 at  7:02 PM UTC</small>
</h1>
The Senior Staff team would like to introduce a new appeal system that will be in place starting today, as the previous system had a few flaws that resulted in the system being ineffective.<br><br>Essentially the new system will work like;<br><br>When someone appeals, their appeal will be sent in a thread form on the forums. If the moderator who banned this person is still staff, this moderator will proceed to negotiating with the player that wishes to be appealed. Once&nbsp;a&nbsp; final verdict has been reached, and the user is happy with the decision made, a senior moderator will review the appeal. If the senior moderator is happy with the response given, they will proceed to lock the thread, and that will complete the appeal.<br><br>If the punisher is no longer staff, a senior staff member will step in and negotiate with the user instead of a moderator, and will reach a final verdict.<br><img src="http://imgur.com/T3TIF5L.png" title="Image: http://imgur.com/T3TIF5L.png"><br><br>Thanks, <br>Senior Staff Team

tbh I don't think its a great idea to allow Moderators to speak with the ban dispute. All you are doing is prolonging the ban appeal system.<br>We all know staff members falsely ban players some times and can't notice it and actually need a Sr Mod to who actually knows to figure it out. Having the Moderator come out and talk to the player is just more work then needed.<br>And I'm sure that if someone is appealing they're gonna say&nbsp;<b>no</b> either way, thus bringing the Sr Staff in anyways.<br><br><u>Short form:</u><br>Y'ALL ARE JUST WASTING YOU AND EVERYONE ELSES TIME WITH THIS

The Moderator knows more about the situation than the Senior Moderator, as they are the punishment dealer. We normally have to wait longer for a moderator to explain the situation, not to mention the fact that there are many more moderators than senior moderators, making the rate at which appeals are dealt with higher.

That is why there is evidence. You don't need to have a moderator's opinion on a ban. If there is an opinion on a ban and no evidence/evidence is insufficient it's called the Moderator using bias. If the evidence is sufficient then no consultation with a moderator should be needed.<br>All Sr Staff should be doing is looking at whatever evidence and decide weather it is sufficient or not and if you aren't sure either you get the opinion with other Sr Staff. That's why there is more than one.<br>Evidence cannot lie, man can lie. And if its for a chat offence you guys have chat logs, go check it out, that's all I hear whenever there is a dispute to understand the situation that has been going on.

A moderator only has a valid claim if they can produce sufficient evidence, if not then the player appealing should be appealed.

Don't you guys have a place that you put all evidence? That's what I've heard.<br>All you need to do is put it there and that's it. Moderators should be putting evidence on right after they ban/start uploading and put it there as soon as they can.<br>If all evidence is there you don't need to speak to the moderator who banned it since evidence is there. Like I said, evidence cannot lie, man can.<br>If there is no evidence Sr Staff appeal right away, if there is evidence Sr Staff look at the evidence and decide if sufficient or not and then appeal. You don't need the moderators word on if its sufficient or not since they got the evidence, they decided it was sufficient and they banned the player.<br>When they hit enter with the /ban they are locking in their consent that it's sufficient. If they find its insufficient before it gets to the appeal stage it should go directly to Sr Staff to get it appealed as soon as possible regardless if the player who got banned wants to or not.<br>You don't need to have said moderators opinion because again, if there is no evidence its insufficient, if there is enough evidence the moderator already hit enter and banned him thus giving consent that said staff member that it's sufficient. If said moderator negotiates with a Sr Staff member about it in words, regardless if evidence or not there is bias because you are being influenced by a third factor.

Appeals don't work in that manner. A punishment could be valid, but 6-7 months old. There are so many circumstances for appeals that simply looking if there is evidence or not does not work at all. We're giving moderators the ability to decide whether or not the punishment that&nbsp;<i>they</i> dealt may be appealed or not. Besides, a Senior Moderator&nbsp;<b>must</b> review the response before ending the thread. If your point is that things were fine the way they were before and there is no reason to change the system, that's not true. Although I do appreciate your opinion, you often don't get to see the efficiency of our previous appeal system. There are not enough active senior staff members to keep up with the amount of appeals coming in, and several complaints have been made about the rate at which appeals are dealt. In order to increase this rate, and to make a more structured appeal system, we've decided to make appeals run in this manner. We will not revert to our previous system, it was unorganized and slow.<br><br>Also, before someone twists around what I stated and tries to use it against me, I'm not saying that our Senior Moderators cannot do their jobs. However, as many of them are not as active as our moderators, and there are not as many of them, giving Moderators a say about&nbsp;<i>their own punishment</i> has allowed appeals to be dealt with in a more smooth manner. Replies come in very quickly from Moderators, which gives a bit more time for a Senior Moderator to come in a little bit later to finish the appeal.

Why waste the Sr Staff's time to have to deal with an appeal when a staff member can deal with it and the Sr Staff can just review the evidence to make sure everything check out? As Qinn said, there isn't enough active Sr Staff to have the deal with the appeals. Watching evidence videos and actually dealing with an appeal are two different things, and take different amounts of time and effort.

Nice new appeal system. I personally like this idea since it gets the mod and the user to interact with each other and clear up the current and any future conflicts without repeating the same mistake (hopefully). It would give the Sr Mods time to have a decision based on the interaction without automatically deciding. Great work

First Point:<br>There are things called false bans ya know where the moderator thought the evidence they had was sufficient and banned while the evidence was blatantly false where Sr Staff saw it was false in an appeal and unbanned the player.

Well normally when you've waited 6-7 months, you have a much higher chance of being appealed because of the time you've waited. After quite a while, evidence is not needed because as mentioned earlier, you'll likely get appealed instead of denied when you've waited patiently for a long time.<br><br>Erm.. first you state that false bans happen all the time and then you say Staff don't usually false ban.

It all depends on the situation. Also, it was too long ago for the chat logs and the person who dealt the punishment to remember, if you had appealed it earlier it might have been appealed, but now there is pretty much no chance. Sorry :/

If a moderator can't own up to his/her mistakes, then they shouldn't be a moderator. Let's say you false ban someone, they appeal, you know it's wrong and you tell them it's not. Isn't that the same as banning someone for no reason? This system will give moderators a chance to correct themselves, and learn from their mistakes. As well as own up to them, you can't just always hide from everything you do wrong, it'd be nice if you could, but sadly you can't.&nbsp;<br><br>OP: neato :D
