</h1>
After a month of&nbsp;discussion and wanting to update the server based on user feedback, we are announcing The Renaissance&nbsp;Update. This update will act as a rebirth to Avicus to bring in a new player base and hopefully give more of a variety of gameplay options for our community. This update is not going live at the moment but we will give you more specific information about the update when the time comes. But, here is a list of what we can tell you about the update:<br><br>-Capture&nbsp;server which will have a full capture the wool rotation.<br>-Walls server which will bring back the beloved gamemode&nbsp;to the server.<br>-Deathmatch turning into Conquest with a whole revamped rotation and more king of the hill.<br>-More donation perks are being worked on which will bring more reason to donate to the server.<br>-Advertising Team will be advertising the server and this is not a joke this time.<br>-Content Creator is added to give back a little to our glorious community members that decide to record on Avicus.<br>-Race to Victory 2 ;)<br>-Temporarily remove CTF until more maps are submitted.&nbsp;<br>-Since people are going to ask if I don't put it in here, yes Destroy is staying and its rotation is changing with new maps and some old ones.&nbsp;<br><br>We are open to any criticism and ideas and when this update is implemented, we will be very close to our community and hearing your thoughts about it. We hope that you guys come on and try the new maps out and have fun :)

Since the act of developers searching to work on Avicus is not a high turnout, and with Javi//ALM/Keenan/formerly pavillion going out (with a high turnover of developers as well), is there rather any way you will be actively searching for developers who are willing rather than have them search you out and apply? This isn't a sustainable model.

I wrote the CTF part so just in case anyone else wonders about it. We are not completely removing CTF. The reason for its removal was it's complete lack of maps at the moment. We rather not put in maps that are completely stale just because they fit in a required spot. You guys are the first priority in good gameplay and maps the servers enjoys and until we can support that in the CTF area, it will be removed until further notice.<br><br>Edit: The map devs are still taking CTF map submissions

I think you misunderstood, or maybe I misunderstood you. These new gamemodes, servers, etc are going to create a better environment for new players. The goal is to give new and old players more gamemodes to experience and chose from. It will give everyone a choice on what they want to play. If someone joins, but they don't like DTM-type gamemodes, why would they stay? They don't have any reason to stay and play a game they don't like. If we add more gamemodes, and give them more options to play more games, players are a lot more likely to stay online to look at the other games. Hopefully at that point, they will find a game they like, make friends, join TS, forums, etc, and stay on Avicus.&nbsp;<br><br>The advertising team will bring players to Avicus, they can't make them stay. That's what the update is for. The advertising team will (I'm guessing on this part, I have no idea honestly.) probably put some sort of ads in places where players will go to look for servers to play on. The goal is to make it looks nice, and just overall get people to at least join and test the games.
