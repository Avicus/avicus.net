Hello everyone, ALM here!<br><br>I am pleased to announce a new and exciting feature that has just been rolled out in Atlas. This feature is MVP. MVP is not a new thing in games, and sports in general, so we thought it was about time to make it worth all that hard work you guys put into winning matches. <br><br>When we introduced match/life recaps and facts, we implemented a system that tracks every action you take in the match that has an effect on whether or not your team wins or not. These actions include completing/touching/repairing objectives, getting kills/killed/assisting a kill, and leaving/changing teams. With the new system implemented for this update each action has a "score" which is determined by a multitude of factors. Even each actions' score can vary based on factors surrounding the cause of the action.<br><br>Some of examples of this are: <br><ul><li>Knocking a player off of a ladder will have a higher score than plainly killing a player.</li><li>The efficiency of the tool used to break monuments/cores</li><li>The health you have when capturing a wool/flag</li><li>The amount of players on the hill with you during capture.</li></ul>Each player also has a "killability" score which is basically how easy it is for them to be killed. Factors such as armor, weapon, and potion effects have an impact on this score. When you kill someone, you also have a score which determines how "easy" it was to kill that person based on weapon and potion effects.<br><br>This feature is in <b>BETA</b> and therefore no rewards will be given out yet for top players, since all the bugs have not been worked out and the best way to test is with people doing all kinds of things in matches.<br><br>Once all the bugs have been squashed and the scores balanced, rewards will be given to the MVP of the match (if they are online when it ends).<br><br>Enjoy,<br>The Avicus Development Team

MVP isn't something one server came up with, it has been around for a long time in many different games. If it looks too similar to another server than we can easily change that.

That logic makes no sense at all. By that logic you might as well come to the conclusion that Hypixel, Minecade and Mineplex all copied our Walls gamemode....

I'll have you know at least 3 people accidently join walls on avicus per DAY! It is the second most popular gamemode on the whole of avicus... At the time of making this reply, there are the same amount of players playing walls as capture, Destoy, and conquest, with a total of zero players.

Minecade is one of them that comes to mind. It's Ironic how both Minecade and MCZone had so many players in 2012-2013 and then they just had a massive loss. They still get more than us but they currently have a fraction of what they had 4/5 years ago.
