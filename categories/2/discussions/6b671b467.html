<span><p style="margin: 0px; "><span>Hello,</span></p><p style="margin: 0px; "><span><br></span></p><p style="margin: 0px; "><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Recently, an enormous controversy occurred when former staff members shadowolfyt, Camemes, and SnowSX3 created a podcast, which ultimately resulted in two of them being demoted. The Senior Staff have decided to provide a detailed explanation to you, the community, to further explain what occurred in the eyes of the Senior Staff team and why action was taken. A Senior Staff Q&amp;A is being planned to further erase any confusion in the community, and we thank you for bearing with us. &nbsp;</span></p><p style="margin: 0px; "><span><br></span></p><p style="margin: 0px; "><span><b>PODCAST:</b></span></p><p style="margin: 0px; "><span style="color: rgb(69, 69, 69); font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; ">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(69, 69, 69); font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; ">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>The first thing to discuss is the podcast. It was advertised prior to it being posted on the forums for the whole community to see. While it did contain feedback we are taking into consideration, the way in which the information was presented and discussed is something we do not support. At Avicus, we do want to hear constructive feedback from our community - including staff members. We want our network to have leaders who are willing to communicate their minds maturely and respectfully, which sadly did not happen in this situation.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="margin: 0px; "><span style="color: rgb(69, 69, 69); font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; ">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(69, 69, 69); font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; ">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>When feedback is presented in a way that is positive and constructive it creates an environment where we can make change. However, the majority of this podcast did not present the feedback in a constructive way. Jabs were taken towards recently demoted staff, past promoted staff, current Admins and more. A leader should not be involved with content which involves disrespect and shame towards a network in which they represent. The podcast was reviewed by the Senior Staff team. The following timestamps mark areas that we found were inappropriate for staff members to make.</span></p><p style="margin: 0px; "><span><br></span></p><p style="margin: 0px; "><span><b>BREAKDOWN:</b></span></p><p style="margin: 0px; "><span>6:33 - Avicus player count dying joke - not too bad</span></p><p style="margin: 0px; "><span>Numerous gay jokes in the beginning</span></p><p style="margin: 0px; "><span>24:40 - Disrespectful remarks towards Fouled, mocking with clapping and sarcastic tone</span></p><p style="margin: 0px; "><span>24:50 - Similar remarks towards ALM</span></p><p style="margin: 0px; "><span>30:40 - Somewhat rude statements telling streamers to "fuck off fuck off fuck off fuck off"</span></p><p style="margin: 0px; "><span>31:10 - Once again, disrespectful sarcastic comments towards a certain person being their favorite official, said by Cammy</span></p><p style="margin: 0px; "><span>32:10 - Jab towards a referee, sarcastic comment towards his inactivity</span></p><p style="margin: 0px; "><span>32:22 - Uncalled for remark towards recently demoted staff member</span></p><p style="margin: 0px; "><span>36:05 - Rude comment at past senior's promotion</span></p><p style="margin: 0px; "><span>40:10 - Masturbation jokes</span></p><p style="margin: 0px; "><span>49:44 - Poking fun at admin team, claiming it's "Cammy's team" since he's supposedly the only good Administrator from his POV</span></p><p style="margin: 0px; "><span>51:10 - Plenty of comments regarding ALM going on a "warpath", and Cammy having to be a babysitter to him - said in a mocking tone</span></p><p style="margin: 0px; "><span>51:59 - Cammy talking about how he had to clean up ALM's mess, once again disrespecting him and his work</span></p><p style="margin: 0px; "><span>1:00:32 - Highly inappropriate comparison of ALM to Hitler's Nazi reign</span></p><p style="margin: 0px; "><span>1:09:11 - Bluntly stated that promoting ALM was a terrible idea</span></p><p style="margin: 0px; "><span>1:29:50 - Sarcastic comment towards at-the-time head of social media</span></p><p style="margin: 0px; "><span>1:31:19 - A rude comment directed towards an Administrator</span></p><p style="margin: 0px; "><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p style="margin: 0px; "><span><b>RESULTING PUNISHMENTS:</b></span></p><p style="margin: 0px; "><span style="color: rgb(69, 69, 69); font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; ">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(69, 69, 69); font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; ">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>We would like to make it clear why only ⅔ were demoted. After careful review of the podcast and taking into account nuances such as tone of voice and the manner in which the suggestions were made, we came to the conclusion that Snow was trying to provide feedback in a constructive, not destructive manner; however, a couple of inappropriate comments were still noticed. The other two individuals constantly made rude jokes, leaked some info, and were generally negative towards the network. Snow, on the other hand, seemed to be hesitant to trash the network and to join in on the ridiculing. Snow has been dealt with differently and accordingly.</span></p><p style="margin: 0px; "><span style="color: rgb(69, 69, 69); font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; ">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(69, 69, 69); font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; ">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>As this is a developing story, we will address events based on the order in which they happened. Since their demotion, Cammy and Shadow were first banned from different Avicus services. Cammy was banned from TeamSpeak for attempting to give himself and Shadow hidden permissions. Shadow was banned from Discord for posting a website directly targeting an Admin which contained personal pictures.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="margin: 0px; "><span>Within the past 24 hours, Cammy and Shadow have now leaked classified Avicus documents. It is unfortunate that this is the route that they chose to take. &nbsp; As many of us knew Cammy and Shadow for quite some time, we were all shocked by this behavior. As a result of these actions, both are network banned from all Avicus platforms. As a reminder going forward, any former or current staff members that partake in the leaking of information can be network banned. It is important to speak up if you see something.</span></p><p style="margin: 0px; "><span style="color: rgb(69, 69, 69); font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; ">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(69, 69, 69); font-family: 'Helvetica Neue'; ">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>In a few days time, we’ll be hosting a Q&amp;A where we will allow anyone, staff or community, to ask the Senior Staff any questions regarding the server's future and the events that took place recently. More information on the Q&amp;A is yet to come. We thank you for understanding and it's important that we work with each other as a team rather than against to ensure the best possible outcome for the network.</span></p><p style="margin: 0px; "><span><br></span></p><p style="margin: 0px; "><span>Cordially,</span></p><p style="margin: 0px; "><span>The Senior Staff Team</span></p><div><br></div></span>

It's fair that you banned the other two for leaking, but claiming that ridiculing the server was part of the reason why they were demoted is a pathetic justification. Mods, seniors and admins in the past have ridiculed and mocked the server and have not been punished for it at all, yet before they even leak classified information you demoted them. I'm sorry, but since when has it become a crime for community members and mods alike to criticise the server? If you want a unified staff team, start aiming to appeal to all of your (limited) members instead of just a few. Peope have always criticised Avicus, and responding to it by demoting them instead of warning them just goes to show that the main problem is with you.<br><br>I get that they insulted you and that probably ticked you off, but your initial response was not a fair one.<br><br>P.S: Considering Austin's track record I wouldn't consider him the best example of constructive criticism.<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/hi4eOR8_d.jpg?maxwidth=640&amp;shape=thumb&amp;fidelity=high">

After hearing the other side, I feel like I've completely changed sides on this issue. I suppose making judgement without knowing everything isn't for the best; perhaps we (myself included) should stop and think about everything that goes on at this server, at least for a second.<br><br>(Also, the previous edit posted by mistake. Sorry about that.)

Come on Cammy, I expected better from you... You're not here to act condescending. I think ALM did the right thing here, by taking it to the seniors to demote an admin who was acting like a 10 year old.

I have agreed with this decision since it first happened. Two members that play a huge role in the staff team shouldn't be allowed to throw shit at a server they represent. Criticism&nbsp;has a line. There are many mature ways you could feedback criticism, but the way Cammy and Shadow did it was completely wrong.&nbsp;<br><br>The amount of things that they said that were disrespectful is crazy. Especially coming from these two staff members. I believe the demotion was perfectly fine, and deserved. The way that they acted after the demotion was extremely stupid, and then they decided to leak a bunch of information? That is a well-deserved demotion and network ban, and the seniors shouldn't be getting shit thrown at them for it. They tried making the senior staff team look bad by saying they got demoted for "making a podcast!!".<br><br>Thanks for clearing this up with the community, as this post was definitely needed. The senior staff team handled this situation very well, and shouldn't be hated on for how they did it.

Of course they are going to joke about the stupidity they see. I can understand why after you had a temper tantrum and demoted them, their response was "Fuck you" What did they leak anyway? I'm curious. Was it the plan of how Avicus was going to dominate the PVP market and get to 30 players on at a time?</p>

Still think it was the wrong decision. I just think you enjoy kicking out good people, and you can argue it all you want, it won't change my opinion of you. You want to run things the way you want it and it's disgusting. No wonder the server's dead. Gonna get a lot of hate for saying that but to be honest, I don't care.
