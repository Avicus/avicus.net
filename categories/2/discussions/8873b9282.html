Hello Avicus Community,<br><br>The Administration team and the Management team has been creating a brand new copy of the staff policies for our staff team to follow. We have decided to announce this to the community, as it involves you guys quite a bit.&nbsp;<br><br>This thread is a basic overview of all BIG changes that we have made to the policies. The final and complete copy of the policies can be found<b><a href="https://avicus.net/forums/discussions/8319110c3" rel="nofollow"> here.&nbsp;</a></b><br><br><br><b>POLICY 3.3 - Assignment System</b><br>Essentially this is a feedback system that the staff have created to ensure that all staff members are giving and receiving peer feedback.<br><br><b>POLICY 3.6 - Leave of Absence Policy&nbsp;</b><br>Staff now can only take 2 months or less Leave of Absences, only if they will remain completely inactive over this period of time<br><br><b>POLICY 5.4 - Running out of Strike Points</b><br>Any staff that loses all of their points, will be demoted without question<br><br><b>POLICY 7.1 - Duties of a Senior Moderator&nbsp;</b><br>We have re purposed the Senior Moderator rank a bit;<br>Senior Moderators would &nbsp;focus on communicating, listening to, and improving the Moderator/Junior Moderator team. They will act as role-models for Mods and become more or less the "ideal" Moderators. The Senior Mods will be Moderators with the most abilities, experience, and maturity who would help Mods with any difficult situations, aiming to improve their quality, relations, etc. This would put a large amount of meaning to the name "Senior Moderator." Senior Mods will not have an official vote for promotions/demotions regarding other senior moderators, managers, or administrators, but they can give recommendations/vouches/feedback.<br><br><b>POLICY 7.4 - Behavior Agreement&nbsp;</b><br>Senior Moderators now have their own behavior agreement&nbsp;<br><br><b>POLICY 8.1 - Duties of a Manager</b><br>We have also re purposed the Manager rank a bit;<br>Managers will be in-charge of different parts of the server, and will act as overseers for their specific part of the server. One Manager and Administrator would head the community, one Manager and Administrator would head server development, and all Managers and Administrators would head staff development. They would work as an executive team, and would essentially execute things that the administrators had planned. They would be in-charge of the senior moderators.<br><br><b>POLICY 8.3 - Behavior Agreement</b><br>Managers now have their own behavior agreement.<br><br><b>POLICY 8.4 - Assignments</b><br>Since Managers head our server now, each one will be assigned to a particular department, and all of them have a staff duty to complete. Administrators are involved in these assignments as well.&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial;  ">&nbsp;If you have any problems regarding a certain part of the server, you may approach the respective managers or administrators.</span><br><br><p style=" margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial;   font-weight: 700; ">Server Development -</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial;  "><b>&nbsp;(Arigenn and Fouled)</b></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial;  "><br class="kix-line-break"></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial;  ">This will consist of managing advertising documents, working close with officials, map devs, and developers, listening to suggestions, and further progressing Avicus to ensure that it is growing constantly.</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial;  "><br class="kix-line-break"></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial;   font-weight: 700; "><br class="kix-line-break"></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial;   font-weight: 700; ">Community - (Rinn and Palaemon)</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial;  "><br class="kix-line-break"></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial;  ">This task will consist of running community events, ensuring community relations are well, running community updates, and tending to community problems.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial;  "><br class="kix-line-break"></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial;  "><br class="kix-line-break"></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial;   font-weight: 700; ">Staff - (All managers and administrators)</span></p><ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><li style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial;   "><p style=" margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style=" font-weight: 700; ">Managing Staff Calendars (Fouled) -</span><span> This task will consist of managing staff dates, meetings, finishing projects, certain events within the staff team and community, deadlines, and other miscellaneous dates. They will then sort these into a simple calendar, which can be easily made through finding the months calendar on the internet, and using paint to edit it into the picture. These are a full staff team resource, and should be made every month for all staff team members.</span><span><br class="kix-line-break"><br class="kix-line-break"></span></p></li><li style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial;   "><p style=" margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style=" font-weight: 700; ">Managing Training Documents (Rinn) -</span><span> This task will consist of managing all training documents within the team. You will have to ensure that they are all up to date, and are well thought out. These will include the senior moderator training document, administrative / management training document, and the moderator training document.</span></p></li><li style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial;   "><p style=" margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style=" font-weight: 700; ">Managing Staff Warning Documents (Arigenn) -</span><span> This task will consist of managing a simple document that will contain staff contact information, age, timezone, and their record. This will be a resource sheet for the management team to keep track and monitor staff behavior.</span></p></li><li style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial;   "><p style=" margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span style="  font-weight: 700; ">Staff Spotlight (Palaemon) -</span><span> Managing Staff spotlight will consist of choosing a particular staff member, who you believe deserves a recognition for their hard work to be in the ‘spotlight’. You will pick one person biweekly, and basically you will submit a variety of questions to the user, for them to fill out and re-submit back to you. You will then paste it into a thread, and edit in an introductory part.</span></p></li></ul><br><br><b>POLICY 9.1 - Duties of an Administrator</b><br>We have outlined what an Administrator does; <br>Administrators will be overseers of the entire server. They will work very close with the staff team as a whole, and will constantly put into play different items for the server. Administrators in their spare time, will assist a particular manager department.<br><br><b>POLICY 9.3 - Power and Authority</b><br>Probably the policy that affects the community the most, this policy will allow administrators to make executive decisions without evidence. If the administrators want to take action on a problem, they will hold a vote, and the action may only be taken if it is unanimous (including the owner).&nbsp;<br><br><b>9.5 - Transparency</b><br>Administrators must remain transparent with their work.&nbsp;<br><br><b>9.6 - Behavior Agreement</b><br>Administrators now have their own behavior agreement.<br><br><br><br>Thanks for sticking with us for this long, heres to our first step towards a better Avicus!<br><br>Cheers,&nbsp;<br>Administration and Management Team

More new policies, same old attitude. I'll wait until I see some change before I deem this "neato."

+1&nbsp;<br><br>On topic: These are pointless now. Put time into bringing more YouTubers (and advertising) to Avicus rather then remaking the same crap over and over again. Policy's are nice but trust me, even if I was staff I'm not going to waste time reading it.

Lets hope this Sr Staff "role-model moderator" works out. In the past months imo and a lot of people can agree too that Sr Staff have been the most corrupt rank of the staff team. But new promotions can probably change that, but until actions are shown that thought stays.<br><br>For the LOA, being "completely inactive" is a bit bs. There have been vacations and that still are that people have had access to internet but may not have access to certain platforms. Ex: not in game but ts and slack is possible. If that is the case will you guys end up demoting them/warning them for inactivity since I'd assume they can't write up a LOA as they don't meet the requirements.

I don't know.<br><br>Has anyone else noticed how many "new policy" threads they put out? Every time they "rework" it so it apparently benefits us. I don't see all of this happening. Is it just me or am I assuming too quickly?
