We will be deploying a change to the server soon that will attempt to limit team stacking on all matches. You will be unable to join a match if your addition to a team gives that team an unfair advantage, based on the number of players on that team in comparison to the other teams. We may modify the amount of imbalance that is allowed if we feel the need.<br><br>Premium users cannot bypass this as that would not be cool (in addition to being pay-to-win in a somewhat indirect way - o hi EULA).<br><br>In addition, some friendlier "players required" messages will be deployed in the next day or so (<i>yes</i>, you can click "1 Yellow" or "1 Red" to join those teams).<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/V3STURh.png" title="Image: http://i.imgur.com/V3STURh.png">

What is considered an 'unfair advantage'?<br>(how many people is too many)

Good to hear!<br><br>One question, for the "players required" messages, could you disable it saying a message for empty servers. I think it's kind of pointless for it to advertise an empty game.

Currently, an imbalance will occur if the team sizes differ by <code>20%</code>. This may change in the future.

Could we have messages that aren't white? It's kinda annoying to see them all the time :3 Other than that, amazing feature! (I suggest a colour that isn't so bright though :3)

An unfair advantage might not start the game unless it's switched. When it counts down from 30 to 0, then they should stay on their team. If they are not balanced, then I would report it to a moderator or admin (I think). It's a very epic feature though.<br><br>-Mad
