You guys are long overdue for an update post so here we go. I had an admin meeting with Fouled yesterday and discussed many things;<br><br>In regards with the moderating team:<br><ul><li>Staff Activity and Improving quality of moderators.</li><li>Getting a few more senior staff.</li><li>Updating the Staff Code of Conduct.</li><li>Updating rules and punishment guidelines.</li></ul><div><br>Events:</div><ul><li>After talking with Fouled I decided that we should try a different a new approach with events.</li><li>Basically I'm looking for people who would be willing to host events that we organise. So, seniors would organise the events and then a specific member of the community would run it, we would give them all the resources they need to host it.</li><li>We also talked about hosting more multiplatform events, that is not just events on the server itself.</li><li>Prizes were another point of discussion. With the new events that will come we'll be offering a range of prices.</li><li>If you would be interested in a hosting role then just get in contact with me on discord.&nbsp;</li></ul><div>Advertising was another area we discussed. I've already done most of the basic stuff when it comes to advertising, it's more about actually finding people who will advertise. So I'll be working with a few people to make that happen sometime soon.<br><br>Transparency. I'm trying to get back ontop of it all, all of the weekly update posts and all that. I'm also trying a new approach, that is, we're starting to involve all the areas of the server in our work.<br><br>Finally here are some things we actually physically decided/did:<br>- We decided there <b>will</b> be a content creator rank coming, more on that later this week.<br>- I <b>changed</b> the guideline for how to handle off topic posts.<br>- Finally, we made the advertising rule more <b>clear</b>. That is, videos posted on the Avicus forums must have somewhat avicus related content or we'll delete them.&nbsp;<br><br>If you have any questions then post them below.<br><br>- Peter<br><br><br></div>

Some stuff looks good, but I have some questions.<br><br>So if we are going to be outsourcing events (which I assume is what your goal is), will there continue to be Officials and Refs on the Avicus server itself?<br><br>What will be the difference between "Content Creator" and "Media"? In my opinion, ranks on this server have become&nbsp;superfluous. If you scroll through threads on the forums (this one for example), 90% of people have a rank.&nbsp;<br><br>@joelous I think they need every player to feel special.<br><br>Thank you for the update though

Yes. By events, I mean unofficial events.<br><br>Well the content creator rank will be given to those who produce avicus related content on their youtube channels on a regular basis. Media is just a rank where you stream tournament games.

Still no need for it. They can be put under one rank - Media. I see no purpose in splitting them up... the rename was fine, but then coming out and creating a rank that pretty much does the same thing as the old school media?<br><br>Sorry, but this does more worse than good by flattening the structure and decreasing responsibility. There's a reason why the staff tean is starting to be demotivated.

Both those roles are completely separate and always have been, even before media was renamed. Media/Streamer only stream tournament matches whilst content creators create content for avicus on a regular basis, they aren't related to one another at all.

The roles are different, but Jozz is saying that they both fall under Media.<br><br>Although I don't mind the idea of recognising content creators for Avicus, making two ranks, a streaming rank and a glorified YouTube rank, does create a lot of unnecessary work for something that can just be put under one 'Media' rank.

I get what jozz is saying but what I'm saying is they're too different roles and subsequently they can't really be combined. &nbsp;I mean they could physically be combined but that wouldn't be a very smart idea as both roles are managed by two different groups of people, Officials don't manage avicus related content and admins don't manage streamers. That's pretty much like combining the social media team role with the officials just because social media handle/are going to handle the youtube channel, which funnily enough people have suggested. The tasks of the two different roles would clash completely and just muddle things up.

There's no point making a content creator rank for a server so small; at least properly advertise and get some decent-sized youtubers first. &nbsp;<br><br>Also so why not just get the officials to host more frequent mini-events? Make the major tournaments 3 times a year and then have 1-2 between each tourney, seems more practical to me...
