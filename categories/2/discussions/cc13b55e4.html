<div>Hello,</div><div><br></div><div>On the 7th of December, Avicus is closing a chapter of its history. Our TeamSpeak license will be expiring then, and we are not planning to renew. Over the past four years, the Avicus TS server has been a great place of friendship, community, and enjoyment for everybody. In recent months, however, usage has drastically declined. The TS server’s usage level no longer justifies the price of a yearly license, and the funds would be better spent towards the other servers’ upkeep.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Now, while this is a close to one chapter, it is an opening to on that should be even more exciting. We will provide all the necessary channels in our Discord guild. We will also be holding events in the coming weeks which we encourage you all to join. We are also working to always have staff in the VCs so you can hop in and chat with the people who make Avicus great! Discord provides all of TeamSpeak’s necessary features, and it is completely free. The discord is also easier to join for new users and is easier to moderate.</div><div><br></div><div>We would like to thank all those who have helped make the TS a better place (including our many former TeamSpeak developers), and hope that the good memories made will not be forgotten.</div><div><br></div><div>Sincerely,</div><div>The Avicus Administration</div>

But can't you just use no license? This will limit the server to 32 users but at least we get to keep the TS?

because people like discord better, they've been in the voice channels regularly right? one person in ts is still more than zero on discord.<br><br>Discord provides all of TeamSpeak’s necessary features, and it is completely free. The discord is also easier to join for new users and is easier to moderate- yeah this is baloney. You are just making up excuses now.

I never liked teamspeak's interface to begin with, but I can understand people being attached to it due to nostalgia.<br>Besides , I think investing elsewhere is more productive too and that this closing chapter isn't anything drastic at all.<br>Plus , I find the community really active on discord its insane ^^
