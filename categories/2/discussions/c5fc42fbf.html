Recently there have been quite a few large "lag spikes" that have been causing numerous issues. Timing out, kicking from games, AntiCheat glitches and more. I'm aware of the issue and the cause of the issue, but in order to fix it we may have some downtime later tonight.<br><br>This doubles as a message to the players that we are aware of the issue and a warning for the possible downtime that could be anywhere from one to six hours.<br><br><b>Edit:&nbsp;</b>No server downtime was necessary. The issue was due to the enormous strain placed on the database when updating the stats/leaderboard. Existing stats are transferred to a secondary database and scanned as opposed to the previous system where experience and kills/deaths was scanned in the live database.

I'd personally /alert for downtime for now on such as "Server going down for maintenance in 10/5/1 minutes!" to let the players who don't use the site know, but thanks! :D

The server doesn't impact your FPS. Sounds like a computer issue.

They are referring to lag spikes, which the server nor maps can cause. If a map has an effect on FPS then it would be constant, or at least not in severe spikes to 1 FPS.

For some reason, it has lag spikes scattered around the map. That's what I'm referring to, sorry for getting off topic.
