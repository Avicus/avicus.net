<b>Update:&nbsp;</b>In response to everyone's desire for some more options for products and colors, I have opened up a more standard store at <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.avicus.net/swag">www.avicus.net/swag</a>. Prices there are generally higher than the Teespring offer we have setup, but there are more options and the products can arrive much quicker. <br><b></b><br><b>Update 2:&nbsp;</b>We have now cancelled the Teespring offer to lessen confusion. Upon contacting Teespring, I have learned that the products they display appear quite different to how they look in person.<br><br><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.avicus.net/swag"><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/qzIvvmU.png"></a>

Looks great, sadly, not able to buy any D:<br><br>It might be better to make the designs more interesting, like perhaps a dark blue shirt and logo like the Avicore Logo, and maybe "The Avicus Network" written underneath the logo, with whatever designs would make the T-shirt look better ^-^

Never use credit cards, use debit cards which pulls from your bank account. &nbsp;Credit cards are basically a gigantic scam of douches, you are borrowing money that has bloody interest attached on it, yes you may pay it back in small increments but you are ending up paying the cc companies more with each of those 'small' increments of monthly payments because of the hidden interest fees and transaction fees. &nbsp;So you use a credit card, then pay it all in full once and then close the damn thing. &nbsp;And it stays on your freaking credit history "forever" so when you do want to apply for say a loan on a car, or whatever, it follows you, and effects your history, which can increase your loans if you wanted to purchase a car, etc. &nbsp;Please do not ever use credit cards, even if it says 0%, that 0% will only be for a short bit, if you are one day late or few days late past the due date, they jack up the rates from like 12% to 25%, it is quite freaking ridiculous. &nbsp;Please DO NOT EVER use credit cards. &nbsp;Just use debit, which is like a cc but it is directly attached to your bank account, or your parent's bank account.<br><br>Okay sorry for my ranting (^_^)v

I love the Blue and Green a lot. Red is iffy but still cool. Still am having difficulty deciding, because it costs so much and i'm sure I want it, just don't know which color would be the best ;p

In my opinion I like the blue over the green. But it's totally up to you :)

Great Idea!However, more colors would be great. And, almost nobody would know what this is unless you had a label on it as well.&nbsp;I'm sure a small print saying "Minecraft Avicus Network"&nbsp;wouldn't hurt. When people see a logo, it has to stick in their head. They would have to know the services provided behind it. I can see this being a great stepstone for Avicus. Congratulations. Also, those prices are very good. Regarding more advertising, I would suggest implementing the Teams update as a top priority. People like to be competitive and most of the top servers are about competitiveness.

just got my avicus hoodie and mug! would anyone like a review? :3<br>EDIT:<br>review~<br>(hoodie) I can't wait to wear it! i really like the material that it was made of, especially inside the pockets (extremely soft) but it is a bit big on me, i'm the same size for all the rest of my hoodies, small adult so this is what i ordered as my size, but it was a tad too big; i recommend for anyone buying a hoodie to get 1 size smaller than what you actually are to fit you or it might just be me lol :p I'll still wear the hoodie tho &lt;3<br>(mug) I LOVE it!

Awesome! Have to say the same about the hoodie being awesome. Mine fit pretty well, so I guess it just depends on your previous purchases. They also have specific sizing measurements if you want to get detailed.

You probably ordered on the old shop which never went through (no money was charged). If you think otherwise, send an email to support and we'll figure itout.

[TIP]&nbsp;<br><br>I don't know if anyone here has heard of hydro-flasks but, it a pretty big trend here in Hawaii and I think it would be a good addition to this shop.&nbsp;<br><br>A hydro-flask is basically a large water bottle (not a jug) but fits more water without going overboard. You can do some research if you like on the differences between a hydro-flask and a regular water bottle :p
