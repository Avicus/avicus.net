I honestly don't know, I was told it wasn't possible at all. I woke up and saw the commit and was shocked as everyone else. We've been trying to have it added for a long time now but it wasn't on the basis that it would be too hard to do, so obviously the developers found an easier way to do it and have done so.<br><br>Pretty sure the reason we didn't want to was because more than 90% of the playerbase used 1.8 so at that point they didn't want to, not 100% sure on that though as I wasn't in the Senior Team at that point.

Just to add on to what was said earlier. 1.7 is there for opening up advertisement opportunities but also it's there for people who want to use it. If you want to use it, well now you can, if not then just continue to use 1.8. Majority of us will still use 1.8, which is fine.&nbsp;<br><br>If there is lag that is being caused by <b>this</b> change then we'll try to fix it. If it's just the same old lag spikes that have been happening for months now then that's a completely different story all together.

This is a great step in the right direction imo, now what is left is to correctly advertise the server.<br><br>for those complaining about the lag, maybe it would be cool to have some version-specific servers, so they are "less laggy" and can also use features from newer versions.<br><br>i'll try this by myself once i'm back home, gj ALM boiii

Nothing has changed except 1.7 clients can join. Same thing goes when you're in 1.9 or 1.10 and playing on here.<br><br>From an advertisement point of view I think it is needed. If we were relying on it to just bring new players then I'm not sure. But it's been done for more than one reason so I do think so.

It's good and all, but most of us have accepted 1.8<br><br>If this prevents the new, confirmed competitive gamemodes (Tourney 5), then this is halting or even <b>damaging the remaining player base</b><br><br>Competitive events are known to bring players and the keep the server alive, so&nbsp;<b>fixing scrim servers&nbsp;</b>must be a priority

Some people prefer it. I personally have gotten used to 1.8 and I don't care for 1.7 too much, but I'm still going to use it for certain mods. There are a few different mods that I love but they are only 1.7.x. Now I can use them on Avicus. It just adds the option for more people who like 1.7 to join.

I can't list every single one.. xD I just mean that there are some mods that weren't updated past 1.7.x for whatever reason. As well as the fact the some people just prefer 1.7. Why not give them the option to play in 1.7? It's also good for advertising.

I don't know where is the problem on adding a new version I would say that it's even worst having 1.10 and 1.11 on the server, 1.7 it's grate for pvp it's less laggy ( fps ) and its even better. Let's say u have a faction on an HCF Server ( 1.7.x obs) and u die and u want to go to avicus but O SHIT U HAVE TO CHANGE UR VERSION but then u remember that avicus is supporting 1.7 so u don't close it.<br>See how practical it is??

Why? The strawpoll showed a 10% higher margin of people that wanted to keep 1.7 You said the strawpoll alone would decide the outcome but it seems like you just disregarded it.

If you were going to count "I don't care" as a yes then why was it even added as an option? You already have Yes as an option. Even though the 3rd option shouldn't even be there considering if you don't care then you wouldn't be voting in the first place, using it for yes instead of leaving it as it's own opinion isn't fair to the 1st option <b>which</b> <b>got the most votes</b>, it's a separate option and should be kept as a separate option. The way you did it, without telling anyone beforehand as well, is literally giving the 2nd option the benefit, and if you wanted to do that even if it makes no sense to myself, a warning should have been given in advance or it should have been said when posting the link.

the deployment of atlas was extremely shoddy and for like the first month it was hella buggy and laggy and the scrim servers were gone for the longest time. all of the atlas-related issues are what caused the current playercount crisis because of the amount of people that stopped playing around then.

So... so... so wrong.<br><b><br></b>People I've debated in the past will agree that I'm actually a compromising person who will listen to your point of view and take it into consideration -&nbsp;<b>provided that your argument has substantial reasoning and facts to back it up.<br></b><b><br>------------ Immaturity<br><br></b>Immature... yeah you got me there. But I highly doubt that you're more mature than me. I had no problems with you whatsoever and even though I did not even START the argument you attacked my character and did it so poorly and incorrectly that I chuckle.<br><b><br></b>So with these facts considered:<br><b>- Attacks guy who was called delusional.<br>- Attacks his&nbsp;<i>character&nbsp;</i>in an incorrect manner.<br>- Says an&nbsp;<i>immature and smarmy comment at the end.<br><br></i></b>YOU, are the immature one my friend.<br><b><i><br>----- His density! Oh god look at those love handles, CHRIST!<br><br></i></b><i></i>You can probably tell that I'm not taking your comment seriously by now because, simply put, you're wrong.<br><b><i><br></i></b><i></i>I am not that dense and I'm actually a very well educated person as you can see from my vocabulary and my reasoning. For instance, when I see a rule that makes no sense I don't make spammy posts that just clutter the forum.<br><b><i><br></i><i></i></b>I don't immediately strike down someone just for disagreeing me and I'm actually a curious person. I want to know why people think the way they do.<br><b><i><br></i></b><b>---- His Failed Ambition! Such a failed conqueror!<br></b><b><i><br></i></b>I have no defense on this one. I've held stations before that I wish that I did better in or should've ignored people on.&nbsp;<b>(See that fellow you're defending? I partially blame him for the chaos in 2014 which led to my demotion from Jr. Mod.)<br></b><b><i><br></i></b>Now, my first demotion from mod was because I didn't ignore trolls. I was harassed for a period of a week and was promptly banned from my ranks by higher-ups who just didn't care.&nbsp;<br><b><i><br></i></b>I was harassed ingame by people who said&nbsp;<b>"Hey Zintenka, would you marry an autistic woman?"<br></b><b><i><br></i></b>Or like:&nbsp;<b>"What's your favorite Hentai?"&nbsp;</b>not to mention that when they were doing this I threatened to kick them off the server because I was a Jr. Mod and I was merely doing&nbsp;<i><b>MY JOB.</b></i><br><b><i><br></i></b>They tried and failed to frame me for threatening them with DDOS.<br><b><i><br></i></b>After this, I was swiftly demoted. No communication whatsoever and I still hold some resentment for the people that demoted me at that time but I'm a forgiving person. I just never forget.<br><b><i><br>You don't know me and you probably never will. So, before you try to spread me open like a Canvas... make sure that you got the right tools first, kiddo.<br><br>And some protective gear as well. Lots of layers and special armoring techniques. Those materials better be made of Mythril or Adamantium too!</i></b>

If you really can't read that even though the words are spaced out to avoid clutter then I really don't know what to do for you.<br><br>Like... seriously.

Since this thread has just turned into a pointless argument, and since we are removing support, I'm going to go ahead and lock this. <br><br>Thanks everyone for your feedback on the poll!

I unlocked this to give an update. I'm going to relock it though because this post has essentially turned into a flame thread.<br><br>I apologise for the mixed messages that have been going on. There was some miscommunication between the Developers and the Admins. We managed to fix 1.7 so that you are able to play 1.8 maps, 1.8 items are just substituted out for 1.7 ones, so 1.7 <b>will not be removed&nbsp;</b>for the time being. Once again I do apologise.<br><br>The only real issue is you can't play CTF if you are in 1.7. So if you want to play CTF, you need to be in 1.8.x and over.
