<div>Hello everyone,</div><div><br></div><div>        It is with mixed feelings that I must inform everyone that Avicus will be shutting down on January 25th. On that date, our servers will no longer be accepting connections and the website will no longer allow new content to be posted or updated. Running this network has become increasingly expensive over time, and it is unfortunately no longer economical to continue with this wonderful endeavor which started back in 2011. Along with an increasingly diminishing and inconsistent playerbase, Austin and I have become increasingly busy with college and employment and Avicus is becoming more and more of a burden than a fun hobby. Money flow is at an all time low, and with the impending new year, we have decided that it is time for this chapter of our lives to close.</div><div>        We have been at the lowest possible server plan for a while now to support our internal infrastructure and downgrading is unfortunately not an option. There is no money to hire developers, pay for any form of advertising, or even to pay for simple server upkeep. We can’t expect anyone to want to develop for something with an overwhelmingly unstable future, or to want to make plans when there is nothing to aim for. We have weighed all the options, and it is with a heavy heart that the shutdown option has been chosen.</div><div>        Over the past six years, Avicus has evolved from a simple Hunger Games server to a Walls server, and then to a combination of the aforementioned games with one lobby. Over time, Nebula was added and became increasingly popular. Other games, such as Frenzy and SkyWars have come and gone, but Nebula has always remained. We would like to thank everyone who has ever worked as any member of staff over this time and especially would like to thank the administrators and developers who have poured in countless hours to make this server great. We ask that you use this last month to enjoy Avicus, and to not let all of their hard work go to waste just yet. After this server closes, we wish you all a great life and that you would go out and live it and not stay tethered to a video game. That is what the owners and admins are going to do, and we encourage you all to go out a live life to the fullest.</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks you all again for everything you have done to make this server and our lives great,</div><div>Austin and Keenan</div><div><br></div><div><b>Shutdown FAQ</b> <i>We will update this post as more questions arise.</i></div><ul><li>Why is Avicus shutting down?</li><ul><li>We decided it’s time to move on. The playerbase has been shrinking for over two years and we can no longer afford to keep Avicus online. A lack of players and money means we can no longer afford to develop Avicus or keep the servers online.</li></ul><li>Why didn’t you sell Avicus to another network?</li><ul><li>We will entertain any serious business inquiries that are sent to info@avicus.net during the process of shutting down.</li><li>Don't offer to run Avicus as your personal hobby, it's too expensive.</li></ul><li>Why not accept donations to keep the server alive?</li><ul><li>We were ran off of donations in the beginning, it wasn’t sustainable. We considered this but it wouldn’t be enough.</li></ul><li>Will any purchases be refunded?</li><ul><li>Unfortunately, no.</li></ul><li>When will the Minecraft servers turn off?</li><ul><li>The Minecraft servers will no longer accept connections on January 25th.</li></ul><li>Will the code become open sourced?</li><ul><li>We have not decided what to do with the source code. Once a decision is reached we will make an announcement.</li></ul><li>Is there an event planned for the last day of Minecraft servers?</li><ul><li>We are most likely going to plan a Throwback event sometime before shutting down the Minecraft servers. We’ll update you when these plans are made.</li></ul><li>What if there is some miraculous growth over the next month and an influx of purchases?</li><ul><li>This is unlikely. If it does happen, however, we may reconsider under extreme circumstances.</li></ul><li>Can I get unbanned since the server is closing?</li><ul><li>No, all bans stand as is.</li></ul><li>What about the discord?</li><ul><li>The discord no longer really serves a purpose. It will likely be removed sometime in February.</li></ul></ul>

It is hard to see this project go. I've spent for what seems almost 4 years of my childhood on this server, and to see it go like this is absolutely surreal. This server became a part of me and it really changed who I was. I admire the hours of time the staff team always put into this network, because it was unlike any other experience I've ever had.<br><br>The rough ride I've had, I remember seeing this network on the Overcast forums when it was MCZone as well as after Avalanche Network closed down. I remember building up a relationship with the staff in 2013, and trying to submit my maps to Blackhawk/Keenan in a Skype call. I remember getting promoted to junior moderator and joining the map committee, which was the biggest accomplishment I could've ever attained.<br><br>I remember working on new gamemodes, meeting new people, and making one of the closest friends I ever had: Evocal. We spent hours trying to progress the server for weeks at a time, every day working on something new for the players to enjoy. That progression eventually went to a crawl with internal problems within the staff, and I feel like this closure reflects the last few management issues that have been persistent, even since at least since Howsie was an administrator.<br><br>When I became admin, it was the best moment I'd ever had. Something I admired helped me build up to take charge and become a leader of something I held the most closest to me. However, it didn't last long and about a month went by, proceeding to get demoted by the seniors. It was a hard time and affected me personally, being taken out by people I had worked close with for 2 years at that point. However, I kept going.<br><br>Retired from senior, wasn't let back in. But they still let me be mod, and that's what I've been since (other than the huge gaps of retirements I've taken.) Even though I have little now, I'm very honored to have been a part of a project of this scale.<br><br>This server, for better or for worse, was still the best thing to ever happen to me. I appreciate everyone, including the community, who made these years worth it.

I know I basically left when the server shifted from MC Zone to Avicus around 4 years ago, but I've joined the server consistently every Christmas Eve just because of how much it helped me grow up and mature. Seeing the server shut down makes me grateful for the memories I had on it 4 years ago.<br><br>Thanks devs

This server meant the world to me at one point. And I still love it a ton. Its sad to see it go, but it was a great run. There have been lots of ups and downs, drama, staff members, and players.&nbsp;<br><br>Thank you, Keenan, for running the server for a majority of the time. It helped me grow as a person: I acquired some form of responsibility, maturity, and purpose while I was active on the server.

Remember being a moderator here way back in the day, probably 2015ish. Just joined the server yesterday for the first time in probably years and was greeted by a few people who referred to me as an "old timer" and who recognized my name from the old days, which was pretty cool. Y'all caught a lot of flack for being a rip off OCN or whatever but there was a thriving community here just like any server. I made some real friends and I'm glad to have been a part of this while it lasted. Take care, everybody!<br><br>Oh, and you can find me at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/nathancard" title="Link: https://www.youtube.com/nathancard">https://www.youtube.com/nathancard</a>.&nbsp;Hope that's okay to post.

I've been hiding in the scariest place to a developer–the real world. Since leaving Avicus I was forced to interact with people face-to-face and it has left me a shell of the dead-eyed internet-addicted freak that I once was. The other week I had a MEETING. With a PERSON. We sat at a table and discussed budgets. It was horrifying. Don't go to college, kids.

I'm really sad to see this. Although I haven't been on Avicus for very long — only about six months — Avicus has by far been the best Minecraft server I've seen. The community is great, and the moderators are a great anti-cheat substitute. I really appreciate all that the staff members have done to keep Avicus going, but I've noticed the dwindling number of frequent players with increasing disappointment. I hope we can all preserve the Avicus community across other Minecraft servers (and I'm curious to know what servers everyone else will frequent when Avicus is gone). You guys have all been great to have around, and it's really saying something that I'm so sad to see a Minecraft server go. Much thanks to ALM and everyone else for the fun times we've had together (regardless of your opinion on my bowspam, I will carry it with me to the grave) and hope we can all keep Avicus alive by kicking butt on Hypixel or Mineplex or whatever. You guys are awesome. Here's to the next seven years of Minecraft, and may we all keep this server going by sticking together as an awesome Minecraft community. Long live Avicus. Long live us!

This is a message to Keenan and the people who influenced my time here on Avicus.&nbsp;<br><br><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e0a8ea3a16343b1e99b507e2d342e8bb?s=20&amp;default=mm" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/Newcleus.html" style="color: Gray">Newcleus</a> - Michael, I hate to admit it, but you changed me as a person and it was for the better.

Other than the bad things you did, you were a good friend of mine. It's a shame we haven't kept in contact because you were so laid back.

Not sure what to say to be honest, because there's many reasons why I want to thank you. I guess one of the main reasons is that Avicus has survived for so long because of you and your efforts within the development of the server has been extraordinary. Now you're a map developer on another server... I respect your dedication to help communities. You've been through some dark times and you've spoken to me about most of them, but I'm glad you're doing well (from what I've seen on your instagram). You're a legend man, and thanks for being a good friend of mine whenn I was still administrator / map developer on the server. I might make a map for Stratus, we'll see, but if I do, please accept it hahahaha!&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/f546f56a6ac9473c9db6b09693da2121?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/Jake41901.html" style="color: Gray">Jake41901</a> - The state farm guy. You won't see this because you haven't touched Avicus ever since you left but I want to say thank you. I remember having a conversation with Gill around the time he retired and we both really wanted you to be promoted to Admin. It was the right decision, because we worked so well together. We spoke for hours on end, talking about our issues and dreams and whatnot. I was worried for you at one stage (you know what I mean) and still am because I haven't heard from you, but I want you to know I hope everything is well for you. Did you end up enrolling for the marines? I hope you did, because that would have been an awesome experience. I want to catch up with you if you see this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/578434bc303048548e6b8e60df523412?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/UnkelBen.html" style="color: Gray">UnkelBen</a> - Yoav. My first friend online, not even kidding. I was a shy boy who didn't know anyone in the community and you welcomed me and showed me around Avicus - I remember the first night we spoke on Teamspeak, and you invited other people who would then soon become onne of my best friends here: Koo, Nolan, Tech, and then later... Howsie. Who knew this would form the core of the Sistahood - a group of individuals that I will never forget. I don't care if this sounds cringey as fuck, but without you and the group you formed I would never have been Administrator. I strived to make the server a better place because of the ideas we shared within the group, and most importantly... memories. I still remember sharply of the video calls we did everyday, for hours. I hope you don't go shirtless still when you're video calling people! Remember that lucky charm you sent to me (the dragon)? I still have it on my bedside table. I know you quit Avicus because of boarding school and I lost contact with you after a while. I want to talk to you man, it's been way too long. You'll probably never see this, but if you do, say something. Still, you need to come to Australia - I'll show you around.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/7f054339a0c347ba8fca0ab2074b7d82?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/NolanDalton.html" style="color: Gray">NolanDalton</a> - I've said things about you already (especially in my initial leaving post) but I will say it again. Your hard work was inspirational and I never questioned what you did because I had full faith in your ability to fulfill tasks beyond expectations. Near the end of your time onn Avicus you did get toxic, but that does not change the fact we shared many memories together (especially the promotion to senior mod together) and the Sistahood. I have a good friend named Nolan too IRL - coincidence? Haha!

I still remember that man, that was hilarious. In all seriousness, you mentored me when I became Administrator well, annd I think that showed when everyone appreciated the work I put into the server - disregarding whether or not the decisions I made were correct. You constantly (and to an extent you still do) set up video chat parties and teamspeak parties regularly to communicate with the server.

I would have never and still believe I could not completely fill the shoes you left for me, even after the help I seeked from you.

ahahaha you guys fucked it up in 2015 when you got rid of prestiges. Before then there would be a player base of atleast 200+ people every time. The Omega update came and it started declining when that happened. A really dumb decision and almost 3 years later the server is shutting down.

MCZone/Avicus was one of my favourite servers back in the day. It was really a pleasureful time but the fall of the server was definitely because of the staff who were put in charge in 2013-2014.

Damn... First Overcast and now Avicus... all the old CTW &amp; DTC networks are dying. Even though I never really played or liked Avicus that much it’s still sad to see it go because it’s still a hit to the PGM community... Hope Stratus doesn’t end up like this too. I guess Avicus and overcast will have to come together now after all.

i must say it was inevitable that this was going to happen the server has been dead for so long but i can't say i didn't have memories on this server. <br><br>It was nice knowing all of you and playing with you all, the teamspeak chats and the UHCs and the early tournaments and 2013-2015 as a whole.&nbsp;<br><br>Heck, I even created a youtube channel and got somewhat known from it so I guess I owe some parts to this server lol. It gave me a foundation so I can't completely roast this server.<br><br>Once again I mean there's a lot of people out there; I don't play this game at all but just came to see because I heard that the server was shutting down. A lot of things happened was fun whilst it lasted once again nice knowing all of you appreciate everything pce out.

Hearing this news wasn't as shocking - probably because I expected it sooner rather than later. Now, most people reading this probably won't know who I am, but I don't care. This is a message to Keenan and the people who influenced my time here on Avicus.&nbsp;<br><br><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e0a8ea3a16343b1e99b507e2d342e8bb?s=20&amp;default=mm" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/Newcleus.html" style="color: Gray">Newcleus</a> - Michael, I hate to admit it, but you changed me as a person and it was for the better. I was naive about everything; from how I approached things to the ignorance of the malicious scene. You manipulated me and a lot of people, and at the time I overreacted to it - but looking back, it really shaped me into a confident figure. Other than the bad things you did, you were a good friend of mine. It's a shame we haven't kept in contact because you were so laid back. You said you wanted to be a lawyer, at least I think you wanted to be... good luck with that man. You'll be an amazing one too.<br><br><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f27b353e11cb32f042fd692da64a5952?s=20&amp;default=mm" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/Pelpelajax.html" style="color: Gray">Pelpelajax</a> - Towards the end of my Administration efforts here on Avicus, you continued to be my friend - not because of the power I had within the network, but for me. We have each others snapchats and I still occasionally check your stories which are always interesting. You visited USA recently didn't you? Every now and thenn I get a message from you on steam asking how I am and how I'm travelling with going pro in Overwatch and/or Call of Duty. Pelly, I love you man. I still need to visit you in Amsterdam!!! I'll bring my meth lab haHAA.&nbsp;<br><br><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a3fd4ab1ed8eabd9cb07dcce0f64724b?s=20&amp;default=mm" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/FrostedCupcakez.html" style="color: #FF5C5C">FrostedCupcakez</a> - Jessica we've been through thick and thin but between you and the group of Brandon, Kat and Britney was probably the most... interesting time haha! Please though, put something else on your snapchat story other than happy birthday wishes!!!

I remember the pushes we had in public games and go full tryhard mode, and won most of our matches that way.

Damn... First Overcast and now Avicus... all the old CTW &amp; DTC networks are dying. Even though I never really played or liked Avicus that much it’s still sad to see it go because it’s still a hit to the PGM community... Hope Stratus doesn’t end up like this too. I guess Avicus and overcast will have to come together now after all.

Ahhh my heart is broken &lt;/3<br>I will write a long message when I can cuz Avicus/MCZone changed my life for the better in many ways that, looking back now, I can really see and appreciate. Thank you to the people that played alongside me back in the day, y'all were the bomb. I'm really heartbroken but I also couldn't see any other future for Avicus.<br>Thank you all and thank you jozzmcozz for telling me on Snapchat &lt;3

wow, weird to think that this place gave me so many friends and memories for several years of my life, and now it'll cease to exist. mczone/avicus&nbsp;consumed a lot of my time when I was younger so obviously it holds a very special place in my heart. just wanna say a quick thank you to all the people who have stood by me since I left avicus&nbsp;after retiring from staff over 2 years ago.&nbsp; even though I've popped in a few times since then, it still feels like forever since I was truly apart of this community- and to me, that's what kept me around for so long. even back then we could see the player numbers falling and yet the appeal of the community kept me around. even though there was the occasional toxicity, the good always overcame the bad. thank you, avicus, for all the mems and friendships that you've brought me.<br><br>rip

I'd just like to say that I first played on this server in 2012. there has never been another server that could compete with the extraordinary nebula and walls. The people who played on this server were also a big highlight! Thank you so much again for all the wonderful memories and I wish you all the best for your future endeavors!~

Wow...I was telling my high school friends about all the great memories I used to make on here. I’m glad I came back in time to see this so I could reflect. From Nebula spawnblockers, to winning SkyWars for the first time...I look back on it all fondly. Three cheers for Avicus (MCZone). Wish it didn’t have to end :(((

I think this has been a long time coming and we all knew it'd happen<br>Such a shame nonetheless, I've met some great people on this server, including my (now ex woops)<br>Great memories have been made tbh, and it's been wonderful to see the server and community grow, though then descend to the inevitable downfall.<br>Thank you for having held this server up for so long and for keeping many people entertained with the games, and annoyed with the hackers, for hours on end, myself included.<br>I wish you guys good luck in future, and thank you again.

I joined Avicus probably during my 8th grade year as a shy dude. 2+ years later I became a decently known person in the community (mostly bc i somehow got mod but hey I'll take what I can get). I can't exactly say I will miss you all since I know you all will be fine but hey. I want to thank you all for making this server possible. Without you, we wouldn't have made it this far.<br><br>I have been in this community for a fraction of the time you all were, but I can say that there is nothing quite like good old Avicus gameplay,

Unlike a lot of people that are commenting i'm really going to miss Avicus.<br><br>Back in 2013 when i got Minecraft, the first server i got was this server (named MCZONE back then). I enjoyed a lot of the games and made a lot of memories and even made friends with a future admin in the server.&nbsp;<br><br>Thank you for all those amazing times I had and its been a great honour playing on Avicus.<br><br>(Sorry for making this sound all really cringe)

I'm not much of a pvper, but this is where I loved it.&nbsp;<br><br>Soon these deeds and words will go into stasis, these memories forever entombed in history. State is volatile: time is the undoing, the flexing and beating into anew. A point in the sequence once lived, never to be iterated upon again. Conditions may rise to be the same again but the world is not combinational. There is no repeat, only imitation. Only the actions of now.<br><br>My thanks to avic.us
