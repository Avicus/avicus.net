<h2>Community Slack Rules and Punishments</h2>
<br>
<h3>Preface</h3>
<p>For the longest time the community slack was a place of low moderation and lenience. There were many arguments and unnecessary drama. In order to resolve this and overall improve the atmosphere of the slack, a new system will be implemented.
<br><br>
The Community Slack is a privilege provided by the slack admins for the community of the Avicus Network. Disobeying the rules listed on this document will result in a punishment in the form of a channel kick, a warn, a temporary deactivation or a permanent deactivation. The punishment is dependent on the severity of the rule broken and the judgement of the slack admin. Previous punishments will be taken into account when punishing an user.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Slack Administrators</h3>
<p>If you have questions, suggestions or want to report a user, please contact one of the following slack administrators:
<br>
</p><ul>
<li><b><a href="https://avicommunity.slack.com/messages/@resepignev/">@resepignev</a></b></li>
<li><b><a href="https://avicommunity.slack.com/messages/@jahaj/">@jahaj</a></b></li>
<li><b><a href="https://avicommunity.slack.com/messages/@piez/">@piez</a></b></li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<br>
<h3>Rules</h3>
<h4>General Rules</h4>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Maintain a calm and civilized atmosphere in all channels at any time.</li>
<li>Scamming (stealing information, money, accounts or other private information through deception or trickery) is not tolerated.</li>

<br>
Certain names and profile pictures can be deemed inappropriate by the slack admins.
<br>
Refusing to change the username or picture will result in a temporary deactivation of the account.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Slackbot Commands</h3>
<p>
One of slack’s features are slackbot commands that can be used to ping a certain group of users. Use them with caution. They normally start with an exclamation mark (!).
</p><ul>

</ul>
<p></p>
<br>
<h3>Public Chats and Channels</h3>
<p>The slack consists out of various channels with different purposes. The rules can alter from channel to channel. Look at the description of the channel for more information.
</p><ul>
<li><b>#announcement</b> | Dedicated to announcements and important information.
<ul>
<li>If you wish to discuss anything that is posted in this channel, please head to #general.</li>
<li>Do not post in this channel without explicit permission by one of the slack admins. Failure to do so will result in a punishment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<br>
<li><b>#feedback</b> | Give feedback to anything avicus or community slack related.
<ul>
<li>Be constructive and give feedback in a calm manner. Try to back up your argument with evidence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<br>
<li><b>#general</b> | This channel is for anything that pertains the slack or the avicus network.
<ul>
<li>Since all users are in this chat and can't leave, try to get along.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<br>
<li><b>#help</b> | If you need help ask here and others can help you out.
<ul>
<li>Keep the atmosphere calm and civilized.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<br>
<li><b>#maps</b> | Anything map related goes here.
<ul>
<li>Questions and suggestions regarding maps should be asked here.</li>
<li>It’s not limited to avicus maps, all types of maps outside of avicus are welcomed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<br>
<li><b>#music</b> | This chat is for sharing and listening to other's music and posting your own.
<ul>
<li>No ear rape or objectionable music or music videos.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<br>
<li><b>#news</b> | Talk about news stories and debate about new related subjects.
<ul>
<li>We have a designated bot for this channel called diggbot. He’s pretty self explanatory.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<br>
<li><b>#random</b> | A place for non-work-related flimflam, faffing, hodge-podge or jibber-jabber you'd prefer to keep out of more focused work-related channel.
<ul>
<li>Out of all channels this is the most lenient one. The general rules apply to some extent.</li>
<li>Use /mute if you don’t want to get notified but don’t want to leave the channel.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<br>
<h3>Punishment System</h3>
<p>
Along with the new rules a new punishment system will be implemented.
<br>
It consists of 4 instances that don’t necessary have to be followed by the slack admins.
<br>
Evidence is not necessarily needed, users can request evidence but it’s ultimately up to the admins to provide it. Punishments are not up to negotiations, yet if you approach the admins in a civilized and calm manner, it might get reverted. Past punishments will stay how they are but will follow the principle that evidence is up to the admins.
</p>
<h4>Channel Kicks</h4>
<p>
If a user is breaking a chat/channel specific rule or is found disturbing the calm atmosphere of a chat/channel he will be removed or an unspecific amount of time. The user is not allowed to join the channel by themselves until the time set by a slack admin ran out. The admin will notify the user for what he was removed and for how long. Rejoining the channel will result in a next higher punishment.
</p>
<h4>Warns</h4>
<p>
Warns will be issued if an user is found guilty breaking a chat/channel rule or rejoining a public channel by themselves after getting kicked out of one. It’s a reminder that the behavior is not tolerated.
</p>
<h4>Temporary Deactivations</h4>
<p>
Temporary deactivations are the next higher instance of warns. If an user collects more than 2 (two) warns or breaks rule which severity warrants this instance, his account will be temporarily deactivated for an appropriate time. The time depends on the severity of the rule broken. The maximum amount of time is set to 30 (thirty) days and temporary deactivations to 2 (two), exceptions can be made in time and amount.
</p>
<h4>Permanent Deactivation</h4>
<p>
Permanent deactivations can be appealed after 2 (two) months of continuously deactivation and good behavior towards other users and slack admins outside of the slack.
<br>
Upon receiving the notification of the account getting deactivated, you have 20-24 hours time to approach an slack admin on the manner, do it in a respectful manner. In this time period you are not allowed to post in any of the public channels, disobeying will result in an instant deactivation.
<br>
A deactivation should not be appealed on the forums, rather message a slack admin on skype or another communication platform.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Postface</h3>
<p>
All rules in this document are up to change and it’s the user's responsibility to stay updated with it. There will be no grace period for rule changes, a change will immediately take effect after it was added, changed or removed.
</p>
<br>

Because we don't want to see any keyloggers, links to scamming sites or pornography in the slack. It should be appropriate for all ages. That's why you get removed as soon as you post a link to such sites.<br><br>And rumors and dramas are annoying and can cause unnecessary trouble.<br>Dramas aren't as bad as pornography or phishing sites...

I think you misunderstood, pornography = 3 strikes, your out.<br><br>Not that you need to link pornography three separate occasions to get kicked, one occasion = 3 strikes, so if you link it one time, you'll get kicked.

Hellow,<br><br>We just made some changes to the slack.<br>We just promoted Jahaj to administrator and added two new channels/private groups (#tournaments and staff).<br><br>The administrators are still looking at the sign up form, so if you want to join, fill it out and within the next days you are added.

Don't know if you ever got a response, but the only ranks are admin and owner, and you have to be a moderator to have a chance at becoming admin.

What great news! We have now upgraded the slack to the next higher plan (paid plan), because slack offered us a 30day free trial, this means a bigger message archive (more than 10.000 messages) and more features! Have fun with it!

A new system for the community slack just has been implemented.<br>Hopefully the atmosphere will now be less hostile and more enjoyable for staff members and community members.<br>If you have any questions or suggestions, post them below or in the #feedback channel.

The "Community Slack" isn't an official Avicus platform. It's unofficial.<br>Meaning the no Avicus staff member unless Slack Admin on the community slack has a say when a warn or a punishment is given.

coincidentally, all the slack admins are staff members.<br>feels more like "by some of the staff, for the community" and of course not to forget that they get to post about it in this exclusive announcements subforum<br>if us disgruntled people started a competing slack and posted about it on the forums, you think they'll delete our threads?

Go ahead and make your own slack channel, no one will stop you. They won't delete the thread if you make one.
