<div>Teamspeak has currently undergone some leadership and structural changes. Most of everyone's questions will be answered here.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Why?</b></div><div>Teamspeak, up until now, has been run and managed by the Teamspeak developers. Recently the Senior Staff Team has been planning to change who manages Teamspeak back to how it originally was. This was done for a number of reasons but mostly because it's easier if Teamspeak is managed by the Senior Staff Team as they manage every other official Avicus service. There are other smaller reasons as to why, but it really makes sense if one body manages everything and not just the majority of it.</div><div><br></div><div><b>What will change? Will it affect me?</b></div><div>No, all that will happen is the Senior Staff team will manage Teamspeak. So if a moderator doesn't follow policy on Teamspeak it goes to the Senior Staff Team ect. We will be dealing with the issues that occur on Teamspeak instead of the Teamspeak Devs. So nothing big is really changing/happening that would affect the average Avicus teamspeak user, just some internal changes that most of you won't notice.</div><div><br></div><div><b>What's currently happening with Teamspeak right now?</b></div><div>Right now Teamspeak is down and it will be down for a bit while we try to fix some things. We will alert everyone when it is back up.</div><div><br></div><div>Just a general note to all those who want to cause trouble regarding this issue, we'll be using network bans.</div><div><br></div><div>Senior Staff will be happy to answer anymore questions/concerns anyone has regarding this change in Teamspeak.</div>

Even as a former teamspeak developer, and yes, I really do miss my rank. I believe the seniors should take good care of it. As long as most are active and they don't mess up.

It always sad having one of your ranks removed, whether it was terrible or very good, it was kind of someone removing one of your responsibilities.
