Sorry!<br><br>Message from Javi:<br>If you are one of the 1.7 guys, please don't claim the whole universe and stars and pickle jars are with you.

1.8 good decision. about time tbh. don't worry about those people that are like awwww 1.7 is gone omg i can't blockhit etc etc. they have to learn to pvp with 1.8 and it's not that hugely different anyway.

Btw u can still block hit in 1.8, just because there is no animation doesn't mean it's not there. I block hit all the time.

It's people's decision whether or not they want to play OCN or Avicus. The versions don't matter OCN used to be 1.7 then they updated to 1.8 and people got used to it. Let Avicus update to 1.8 and people get used to it because we've been waiting a long time for this update.

True, OCN has way more features and uses the same version but you have to remember dude that 5% FIVE PERCENT of Avicus' Community uses 1.7 whereas the 95% that use 1.8. You gotta remember it's for the publics benefit :c

Pretty much this. There are users who have been playing on 1.8 ever since Avicus made it available, and it feels natural now. Blockhitting is still there, it's just harder to do and the animation is a little wack.

For example, like me. I can adjust to both 1.7 and 1.8 and they're both the same imo. I think tbh people want to stay in 1.7 because of the glitch with Avicus' KB with 1.7 and it sends you flying (correct me if I'm wrong).

I don't mind 1.8 but 1.7 and 1.8 is more beneficial for the server as OCN is 1.8 and most good pvpers and good players prefer 1.7 (just from my point of view). If there is a loss of players, you'll know that it is because of 1.8 (again this is my opinion).<br><br>OP: So official servers (tournament servers) are upgraded to 1.8 too?

Remember when 1.7 came out, everyone said it was laggy as hell? There are a crap ton of ways of getting more frames, one of which you can do through the MC launcher. If you want the link, just ask. Another way to help your FPS in 1.8 is to toggle "VBOs"

Sorry, but are you an misinformed?<br>Badlion, Kohi, just 2 examples of extremely popular servers, both a mix of 1.7 and 1.8. May I add hundreds of times more popular than avicus and they still keep their shit as lag free as possible, still keep their shit as quality as they actually can, and you're going to tell me the devs on here can't even handle like 150 players without it lagging to shit, or fuck, even fixing relog (simple as fuck) on CTH and Nexus?&nbsp;<br><br>Yeah, writing all that stuff out makes me realise how bad this server actually is without 1.7 backing it in comparison to OCN.

Remember when 1.7 came out, everyone said it was laggy as hell? There are a crap ton of ways of getting more frames, one of which you can do through the MC launcher. If you want the link, just ask. Another way to help your FPS in 1.8 is to toggle "VBOs"

You realise block lag etc can be fixed so easily on mixed version servers right? Also I find it pretty fucking hilarious how you're like "learn to pvp on 1.8" when I can beat everyone who plays on here with 1 hand behind my back regardless of what version. Updating to 1.8 brought more negatives than positives to avicus, which is the main point. Updating to 1.8 has done absolutely nothing, and what people claim can be done on a full 1.8 server is very possible on mixed servers. Like literally the only thing it has done is make the minority of players unhappy, whilst doing absolutely jack shit to "improve" anything. If you're actually going to sit here and argue that making the server less enjoyable for a few more people, whilst fixing absolutely nothing at all that they updated in tge first place for, is a problem solved then I really don't know what literate thing to say to you.

There will be consequences? We're talking about the flipping server owner here, he's incharge. There is no way you can punish him, unless you were to leave. Big deal, we lost 1 player. Atleast every server has a tiny bit of lag; meaning no server is perfect. I do agree though, it will be disappointing if lag isn't fixed.

I support your points since I use 1.7 to play Avicus mainly but let's be realistic man, I'm pretty sure none of the 3 devs we have right now know how to sort out the lag when using 1.7 and 1.8 and I think that's the issue they don't want us know about.<br><br>Just take a close look at Kohi and Badlion, both of them have devs who are at least 18 year olds and have way more experience than these ones who seem to be 15, 16 or 18. Not sure but I guess you get my point. They would've implemented both, 1.7 and 1.8 by now (lag free) but I'm 60% sure they don't have a clue on how to do it.

I'm sorry, but you cannot deny that. Honestly, just the fact that you staff are arguing to us, while the server still has MAJOR issues is funny. I'd honestly recommend for Kylo to just ask one of the devs at Kohi or something to help him and even pay him if needed. This cannot go on.

I agree with you, what else can I say?<br>That's what happens with most of the players in here, their computers are not the best and if 1.7 was near the lag line, 1.8 will go through it.

I'm sorry, but you cannot deny that. Honestly, just the fact that you staff are arguing to us, while the server still has MAJOR issues is funny. I'd honestly recommend for Kylo to just ask one of the devs at Kohi or something to help him and even pay him if needed. This cannot go on.

You realise block lag etc can be fixed so easily on mixed version servers right? Also I find it pretty fucking hilarious how you're like "learn to pvp on 1.8" when I can beat everyone who plays on here with 1 hand behind my back regardless of what version. Updating to 1.8 brought more negatives than positives to avicus, which is the main point. Updating to 1.8 has done absolutely nothing, and what people claim can be done on a full 1.8 server is very possible on mixed servers. Like literally the only thing it has done is make the minority of players unhappy, whilst doing absolutely jack shit to "improve" anything. If you're actually going to sit here and argue that making the server less enjoyable for a few more people, whilst fixing absolutely nothing at all that they updated in tge first place for, is a problem solved then I really don't know what literate thing to say to you.

Remember when 1.7 came out, everyone said it was laggy as hell? There are a crap ton of ways of getting more frames, one of which you can do through the MC launcher. If you want the link, just ask. Another way to help your FPS in 1.8 is to toggle "VBOs"

1.9 I believe prevents block-hitting. All 1.8 did was add a bunch of community-requested features like underwater dungeons along with other add-ons like slime blocks and more redstone commands.<br><br>I think I still see some using block-hitting unfortunately...

Jajaja, Pero cuando especifiqué eso?&nbsp;<br>Por ejemplo, en primera ronda hay aproximadamente 4 - 6 candidatos, para que haya segunda ronda ningun candidato puede tener mas de la mitad de los votos, lo cual es muy común. ¿Que pasa con la otra mitad que no gano lo que quería o pensaba "conveniente"? Simplemente tolera la opinión de la mayoría que voto por el otro candidato y afrenta ello, Por algo existe la democracia, Ya que , como había dicho antes, es imposible siempre satisfacer a todo el mundo, Y en este caso, el 5% de Avicus.

Updating brings more hell <b>a lot </b>more&nbsp;negatives than positives, most of the issues most people were complaining about can be fixed easily on mixed servers, especially with a player base of having a max for 150 players, lol. Avicus went full 1.8 before, and it downgraded about a week later, everyone started complaining and the player-base eventually started declining. Do not blindly walk into something that harmed the server before. Avicus still has a spark, don't kill it. thnx

Jajaja, Pero cuando especifiqué eso?&nbsp;<br>Por ejemplo, en primera ronda hay aproximadamente 4 - 6 candidatos, para que haya segunda ronda ningun candidato puede tener mas de la mitad de los votos, lo cual es muy común. ¿Que pasa con la otra mitad que no gano lo que quería o pensaba "conveniente"? Simplemente tolera la opinión de la mayoría que voto por el otro candidato y afrenta ello, Por algo existe la democracia, Ya que , como había dicho antes, es imposible siempre satisfacer a todo el mundo, Y en este caso, el 5% de Avicus.

Si te entiendo pero aca, en un server de MC, no seria necesario tolerar al que "gano" por mayoria puesto que es un juego, y se puede complacer a todos ya que es posible que se use la 1.7 y la 1.8 pero ellos no lo quieren hacer porque aparentemente "lagearia" el server mas, cosa que es mentira.

I think some people are miss interpreting the graph as well. The graph shows what proportion of people that have logged into Avicus are using 1.7/1.8. More of the players that log into Avicus with 1.8 are exploring servers and might not come back, whereas a larger amount of the 1.7 players are regular Avicus players so if you take the proportion of 1.7/1.8 players at any one time, it would probably look a lot different.

I'm wondering why you're comparing a block game to terminal cancer?<br>Terminal cancer is a whole different thing where people die if not treated in time.<br>The 5% of 1.7 players can easily install 1.8.<br>You can't please everybody, so why still keep the blocklag and all the other lag because the 1.7 players (who are of course 5%,, the huge minority) are complaining.<br><br>Like legit you guys can't be happy.<br>First y'all complain about block lag and how we gotta fix it, the devs pinpointed the area of the lag and made a decision because the vast majority of the server uses the version that will fix the block lag and now you guys complain about how we should go back.<br><br>Be happy one problem is solved and learn how to pvp in 1.8 like all the other 95% of the players that play Avicus.<br>You guys aren't some people that need to have everything they want or cry a giant tantrum about it.

I was one of the people that started complaining about 1.8 after that update. Yet after about a week, I learned to live with it.&nbsp;<br><br>It's really not that bad.

I doubt that's a player count on the graph. Very rarely do Minecraft servers ever it 70,000 people.&nbsp;<br><br>(I mean,&nbsp;<i>maybe&nbsp;</i>Hypixel but even that's a stretch)<br><br>I'm not quite sure what else it could represent though.

Yes, I must have said that the graph was misleading simply because I don't like the fact that Avicus updated<br><br>Solid Analysis bud<br><br>No, but seriously, it's because the graph is just 3 numbers, paired with 3 different versions of Minecraft. You don't know when, what, how that data was collected. Which is why it's misleading. And like GoldBrick stated it's definitely not daily player count because Avicus doesn't have 70k players. Which is why anyone saying "only 8% use 1.7, the graph CLEARLY states that" is simply misinformed because the graph itself is obviously not a correct, up-to-date representation of Avicus' daily playerbase.

It could also be interpreted that most players who even&nbsp;<b>joined</b> the server joined with 1.8. Which it shows that more players will come on 1.8 even if they visit.<br>You gotta be thinking about the future.<br>We're not gonna be stuck in 1.7 forever and the 1.8 update was bound to happen.

Haha it's bound to happen. The vast majority of users are set to auto update and aren't entirely aware of how versioning works. Once the majority of Minecraft users are on 1.9, we are bound to update! It's inevitable, just like every previous version!

I'm sure the map developers will do their best to keep the games balanced and fair. It would be awesome to throw in new features where appropriate, like shields in different arcade style games and what not. I'd be super excited as a map developer.

Meh. It depends where. We already have stalemates often with no shields on many DTM &amp; CTW maps. Maybe TDM would be fine but really any other would kind of ruin the game/stalemate it even more.

If AVN updates to 1.9 it will just cause more problems, see i'm kinda OK with the 1.8 update but 1.9??? PFFFFFFTTTT! The delay is going to kill the player amounts and the enoyable experience on AVN, No blocking? Shields?? that will just stalemate all the matches and the no blocking will just make it worse, I hope AVN never updates to 1.9... alot of servers and players are not going over to 1.9 because all the bad fixes and the other implementations, The community is already outraged by the snapshots...

I figure asking for a reversion now is better than in a few months when development is already far under way and there's no turning back, even if everybody realizes how shit 1.8 is. That's what happened on OCN, and I would rather it didn't happen here if at all avoidable.

To be honest, the "time being" was around half a year ago when Avicus was updating to 1.8 like all the servers. Then, from my rant and flame war I created to make it back 1.7-1.8 it became that. Now, even me, admit that we need to update to 1.8. It's about time, and since Avicus isn't really "competitive PvP", except for everyone in a team,which is not much compared to the rest of the community, we have to. Servers like BadLion and Kohi have stayed 1.7 because literally all of the BadLion community and the Kohi community wanted 1.7 over 1.8.
