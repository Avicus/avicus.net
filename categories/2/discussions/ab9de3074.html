<u><b>Announcements!<br></b></u>It's been a while since I posted an announcement - here's some things that may be news to you. I ramble on. Condensed version below:<br><u><b><br></b></u><b><i></i></b><blockquote><i>tldr; </i>New host, might switch again, idk. New Avicore YAML stuff soon. More development, better development. Tournament wrapping up, it was awesome, more to come!</blockquote><b><br>New Host</b><br>We recently moved most of the MC servers over to a new host. Right now we're seeing how they operate here on very different hardware and in a new location. Don't assume anything is set in stone - I'm actually not too happy with how it's working out so we may be looking for more options. We've been cutting some corners to make ends meet, but I'm pleased with how we have progressed despite some difficult pressures that are largely outside our control.<br><br><b>Announcements and Things</b><br>I have been working on big changes coming to Avicore soon - YAML enhancements that I have yet to go over with the map devs so that means it may be a ways &nbsp;out, but it's something to keep in mind. It should add new capabilities that allow for new, unique &amp; custom game types via a simple map.yml file. I know many who are eager to get new games on Avicus and are going out of there way to do so. I'm hoping this makes it much less difficult.<br><br>Some new things to hit the credit shop soon, and perhaps new things in the real shop over at avicus.net/shop. We'll have an announcement, don't worry!<br><br>Don't forget about the <a href="http://avicus.net/swag" rel="nofollow" title="Link: http://avicus.net/swag">merchandise shop</a>! It's still up.<br><br>Oh, and a new dev? Maybe. It's been an interesting process for me learning about the dynamics of group development since I recently took on a job at a software company. It occupies a lot of my time, but luckily I can apply these lessons to how we operate at Avicus. Avicus needs some more organization on the development side more than anything and I'm ready to make changes now. So expect a new feel to the development side of Avicus.<br><br><b>Tournament<br></b><b></b>It's been a fun tournament, but The Omega Championship is wrapping up soon! Tune in this weekend for some great matches. I'd like to thank everyone now who has helped to make it possible: the officials, refs, map devs and staff who have chipped in. And thanks to the players who have complied to the rules and made the matches exciting to watch. We will be having more awesomely organized events in the near future.

Thanks. Will there be a votifier plugin setup? This can reel in the players. <br>Also, if you are looking for a new server host, <a title="Link: https://www.minespan.com" href="https://www.minespan.com">https://www.minespan.com</a> is one I recommened. $1.50/GB. The minespan host is being used on alexanderjoe10's build server and so far, it has been doing very well and despite all the World Edits being used, the server never crashes.

It might reel in players if we had more players to begin with. Unfortunately voting sites are somewhat rigged for large servers who have the player base to vote them to the top. Take a look at the first two pages and factor out how many votes would be needed... We'll consider it though.<br><br>We can handle the host - We are looking for dedicated servers as well :P

Well as of now, we are below 500 which is a good start. (mcservers.org). While you have been busy, I made a post and a number of us have been voting as much as we can for the server. Lately, there have been 150+ people at peak hours. I think the voting helped. To this day, I never see less than 50 people on unlike how it used to be before. Right now, we have 150 votes from people voting just because. With an incentive, i can easily see 100 votes a day. I believe Avicus could reach at least a spot in the Top 150. Avicus will get their soon with voting incentives :D<br><br><a href="https://avicus.net/forums/f26fc248a">https://avicus.net/forums/f26fc248a</a>

Hey. <br><br>There is no room for pessimism here, the devs and us staff are trying our best. Its talk like this that reduces morale and drives away new players when they see comments like this. <br><br>I don't have anything against anyone expressing their opinion, but could you do it somewhere else and at a more appropriate place and time? There are a lot of stuff coming along and you're doubting something that isn't even here yet.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>And as Poker said, he and some other avicadians have set up a voting thingy and the player amount has been boosted a bit for it. So please, if you're not even trying to help the server then I have to ask that you please refrain from making comments like these.&nbsp;<br><br>Especially when you're not offering any advice or pointing out key problems (Stuff that we already know, mind you...)<br><br>Please, be more constructive and considerate.

Looks great. Thanks for putting in the effort!<br><br>I still get blocklag when placing around 10-15 blocks per second, but that isn't really an issue.<br><br>In regards to the tournament, I just want to say sorry for being salty to you on the first match.

pretty 2-sided on this new host thing, it will give alot more east coast players better ms/connection (or atleast thats what they said since i heard its now hosted in New Jersey) but at the same time, this is greatly affects the connections for those who are west coast, and most especially for those who are from AU or asia (philippines and singapore especially cuz we have a few Avi's from both countries that play alot here; like me) so i was wondering w/ this concern and might ask if i may<br><br><br><ul><li>Is it possible to move the host to the west coast?</li><li>Can the server have 2 or 3 seperate hosts, 1 for US, 1 for EU and 1 for AU/Asia?</li><li>Can they move the server host back to its original host?

We can't have separate hosts because &nbsp;first, we won't have the funds to do so, and second we are too small of a server to be having seperate hosts. Maybe when we have 1000 players on daily.

The east coast is probably the best single location to provide a good connection for North America and Europe, which is where the vast majority of our player base lies. Expanding to new locations is costly and we don't have enough players spread out to consider it currently. Those in Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe and Australia will have to be patient I suppose :P
