Hello!<br><br>As you may have heard we are introducing a new automated appeal system and will bid adieu to our old, forum based, appeal discussions. This should profusely increase productivity within the staff team and it will be fairer for players, earlier responses, fancier user interface, etc... So please thank <img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/c2a4c847653e482ab62ed7f8b64330cb?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/ALM.html" style="color: #E77400">ALM</a> for leading this project and creating a new awesome system. How to use it? Explained below!<br><br><b>The Appeal an Infraction subforum is now in thread-read-only mode, which means you won't be able to create new threads over there, but existing threads will still be dealt with and you can create new replies. We will hide the subforum when there's no appeal left to handle over there.</b><br><br>Oh no! You got an infraction! An unfair infraction! Burn the staff! Well time for an appeal. You'll simply head off to <a href="https://avicus.net/appeal" title="Link: https://avicus.net/appeal">https://avicus.net/appeal</a>&nbsp;or if you are that type of person that is truly complicated you can go to <a href="https://avicus.net/appeals" title="Link: https://avicus.net/appeals">https://avicus.net/appeals</a>&nbsp;and click the "Submit Appeal" button. Longer? Yes Better? That I don't know.<br><br>You will then be faced with a page with all your infractions and a respective "Appeal" button:<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/KaL65F2.png" title="Image: https://i.imgur.com/KaL65F2.png"><br><br>Select the infraction you want to appeal, and click the "Appeal" button next to it. This will lead you to the next new page, where you will explain how the staff was wrong / you were right / my cat hacked NASA. How? Type.<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/lR9nnaY.png" title="Image: https://i.imgur.com/lR9nnaY.png"><br><br>After you are done telling us the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-TE_Ys4iwM" rel="nofollow">story of your life</a>, you are then to click the "Submit Appeal" button. Are you ready? I don't know, are you?. When your appeal is filled in it will ping the staff needed so that they can come extinguish the fire. Now how to carry on with your appeal.<br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/eVdF7za.png" title="Image: https://i.imgur.com/eVdF7za.png"><br><br>The appeal tree will be shown on top, below the infraction, date, and staff that dealt it. Under it you will find the action panel. Juicy fancy buttons, eh??? Well only staff get those :) You do get two, though. You can<b> comment</b> on your appeal, which is basically responding to it again to add &nbsp;extra information / explain NASA fingerprint security exploit, etc. Then you can also <b>escalate</b>; if you, after discussion, still want to burn the staff member that punished you, you can appeal to the senior court, the senior staff team. Click the button, it's all done. The previous staff member will lose privilege&nbsp;to deal with the appeal, and seniors will get to work and reach a final verdict. Now about the rest of buttons for the staff:<br><ul><li><b>Appeal</b> → Appeals the infraction</li><ul><li><b>Unappeal</b>&nbsp;→ If the button was already clicked, it can be undone with this new button. The function? You guess it.</li></ul><li><b>Close</b> → Closes the appeal, user can still respond but it indicates that a verdict has been reached.</li><ul><li><b>Re-open </b>→ Re-opens the appeal. It was closed, now it's open. Boom.</li></ul><li><b>Lock </b>→ When the appeal can just get nothing but worse, a final final verdict has been made and simply the point of its existence&nbsp;is gone, senior staff can lock the appeal and user can't comment any further.</li><ul><li><b>Unlock</b> → If we mess up and kill the appeal before it was to be killed, we unlock it.</li></ul></ul><br>If you find any issue, please report it at <a href="http://avicus.net/issues" rel="nofollow">our issue tracker</a>. As always, thanks for your attention.<br>Happy Appealing,<br>The Development Team.
