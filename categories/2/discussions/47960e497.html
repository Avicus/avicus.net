Hello everyone!<br><br>I am proud to announce that as of 20 minutes ago, you are now able to rate and give feedback on maps that you play.&nbsp;<br><br>A message will be displayed at the end of every match that will allow you to rate maps on a scale of <b>1&nbsp;</b>-&nbsp;<b>5</b>.<br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/uT1kHDa.png" title="Image: http://i.imgur.com/uT1kHDa.png"><br><br>&nbsp;After you submit your rating, you are given the option to write additional feedback in a book.<br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/4F0g7KR.png" title="Image: http://i.imgur.com/4F0g7KR.png"><br><br>Ratings will be shown on the corresponding map's website information page. The map devs will be using this data in order to choose maps for rotations that a majority of players enjoy.<br><br>This is sure to help make Avicus map development more reliant on player opinions than ever before!<br><br>Thanks, and Merry Christmas!<br>The Avicus Development/Map Development Team

No. The point is, to rate a map ingame right after playing it.

This is an idea that is definitely aspired from servers such as Badlion. We wanted a safe and easy way to get feedback to know if players are enjoying maps or not. With this we will be able to provide the best rotations for the community.

well since this isn't going to happen i'll just put what i wanted to say here<br><br>"castle adventure" is easily the worst avicus map and honestly, just thinking about it makes me mildly ill. i can only assume that the terrible, terrible sequence of events that led to it being added were only possible thanks to the influence of copious amounts of mind-altering substances, because no person in their right mind would think that it was an acceptable map to put into the game. each game i was forced to play on "castle adventure" was nothing but pure agony, a form of torture that i would not wish upon anyone, not even my greatest enemy (who shall remain unnamed lest his followers lurk among us). i think it should be possible to give maps a negative amount of stars, if only so that we may accurately model my strong dislike for "castle adventure".

No, with this I completely agree. Castle Adventure is a shocking map and needs to be removed, however, this isn't the point. The point (I also agree) is that negative stars should be a thing, and that is very true. For other specific maps such as clay wars, players need to have the chance to say what they find boring about the map (most of the complaints are about lack of entertainment).

Thank you for your feedback. The Map Developers would love more of these types of comments, so we can design a rotation around you; the players. This is why we have decided to implement the map rating system, as it has been on our "to-do" list, and probably pestering the developers, for a long time!

Nice! But can you let us keep the book until next map starts?<br>I'm not Always a Quick writer and if I want to write longer texts it's pretty hard to make it in time.
