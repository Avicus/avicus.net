After talking to the rest of the Senior Staff we have decided we will be opening up staff applications in March. We're looking for active people more than anything else and we're going to be quite lenient. If you wish to apply for a moderating position then on the 3rd of March post your application under the Staff Application subform.&nbsp;<b><br><br>Dates:</b><br>24th of February - Announced.<br>3rd of March - Staff Applications open.<br>10th of March - Interviews start.<br>3rd of April - Applications close.<br><br><b>Application Format &amp; Criteria:</b><br>Will be released within the next few days.<br><br><b>Rules</b>:<br><ol><li>No vulgar language, unless being used in the scenario section.</li><li>Do not make troll applications, they will result in a <b>permanent website ban</b>.</li><li>Do not harass Senior Staff about your application, doing so will <b>decrease </b>your chances.</li><li>These applications are only for <b>Moderating </b>staff.</li><li>You must use the proper formatting, using anything else will instantly get your application <b>denied</b>.&nbsp;</li></ol>Instead of creating another thread for questions we'll just use this one. So if you have any question feel free to ask and an official response will come from a Senior Staff member.<br><br><b><u>Criteria</u></b><br>- Must have at least 1 day of play time.<br>- Must not be banned.<br>- Must speak fluent english.<br>- Must be active on all Avicus services.<br><br><u><b>Application</b></u><br><div>Age:&nbsp;</div><div>Timezone:</div><div>Do you have access to TeamSpeak? Yes/No:&nbsp;</div><div>Do you have access to Skype? Yes/No:&nbsp;</div><div>Do you have access to a recording software? Yes/No:&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>CRITERIA 1: SELF REFLECTION/EVALUATION</b></div><div><br></div><div>Do you have any experience as a staff member on any servers?</div><div><br></div><div>What is your biggest weakness and how do you believe it will affect your moderating? What is your biggest strength and how would this affect your moderating?</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>How do you believe you can help improve the Staff Team?</div><div><br></div><div>What qualities does a leader need to have in your opinion? Do you consider yourself to be a leader? Why?</div><div><br></div><div>What attributes distinguish yourself from other players that qualify you to be a moderator?</div><div><br></div><div>What skills do you believe you should have when interacting with the community? Do you believe you have these skills?</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>How much time can you commit to being a staff member (Rough Idea)?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><b>CRITERIA 2: GENERAL SITUATIONS</b></div><div><br></div><div>You are currently undergoing your junior moderator trial. A ban evader is online and he is constantly ban evading and hacking. You are the only one online and the only one who is able to be online. What would you do?</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Another staff member is constantly joining and harassing other people on Teamspeak in their team channel. The staff member is also referee and has physical permissions to be in that channel. However the leaders do not want this staff member in there and they have asked him to leave multiple times. What would you do?</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>A player appeals a punishment you gave them. You realise that the evidence file is corrupted and therefore there is no physical evidence. You know however this person did indeed break the rules, what would you do?</div><div><br></div><div>You are in an Avicus team. One of your teammates is also an Avicus Staff member. One day in your team discord the team member/staff member posts a screenshot of a thread that only staff members can see. The content in the screenshot isnâ€™t very important/confident but only staff members could see it on the forums. If anything, what would you do?</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>One day the Senior Staff team makes a decision you do not agree with. You do not know all the details of the decision or the circumstances in which they were made and you were simply told by another staff member. However you do not like the decision based from what you know. What would you do?</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><b>CRITERIA 3: OTHER</b></div><div><u>NOTE: This is a new criteria and these questions are less to do with right/wrong answer and more to do with us getting to know you. Please answer these honestly. There is no right or wrong answer.</u></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>What would getting moderator on Avicus mean to you?</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>How passionate are you about Avicus? What does Avicus mean to you?</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Do you speak any other languages than English?</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Do you have anything else to add to your application?</div><br><br>Good luck to those applying<br>- Senior Staff.

because as you can see in recent studies, recruited mods were quality over how active they were, which needed to be changed for a little. what happens is people apply for it, get jr mod, then get promoted to mod, and then go inactive. It happens&nbsp;<i>very&nbsp;</i>often.

i dont understand why you take this personal .... its not its in general to the staff attitude.... in the other hand i need to improve myself in other things actually be less lazy and stuff like that. Also you only stick to this problem when you were mod i don't have anything against &nbsp;you, and the thing is that im sure that my last post things haven't change a lot , doesn't that prove my point, but now i just realize its impossible, so the only think im asking now is that mods before they leave the server the call another one so they don't leave the server alone.

Most mods do this already, but it can take tremendous amounts of time for another mod to get on thanks to apathetic staff members or ones that are on leave.
