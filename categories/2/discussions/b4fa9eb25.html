The update has largely been a smooth and successful transition. Thanks to the hardwork by the map devs and the testing done beforehand, few serious errors existed prior to launch, and ones that did were ironed out pretty quickly. If you have errors to report, head on over to&nbsp;<a href="https://avicus.net/issues" title="Link: https://avicus.net/issues">avicus.net/issues</a>&nbsp;and report them if they haven't been already. I'm here to keep the community in sync with the bug fixes and improvements over the past week or so. You can expect dev updates fairly routinely in the future, but not weekly like this one.<br><br><ul><li>Fixed monument credit farming exploit (we'll punish those who took part in this... we have records).</li><li><b>Rotations have been made public!&nbsp;</b><a href="https://github.com/Avicus/Rotations" title="Link: https://github.com/Avicus/Rotations">https://github.com/Avicus/Rotations</a>. Follow the rules when contributing to the repository.</li><li>Made map pages live (example: <a href="https://avicus.net/maps/Axis" title="Link: https://avicus.net/maps/Axis">avicus.net/maps/Axis</a>), but sort of hidden. When we get more map.png's and make reviewing possible in-game we'll add a maps tab to the website.</li><li>Game selecting is more clear, each type of game has it's own category in the game menu.</li><li>Fixed cancelling friendships.</li><li>Progress towards making scrims live! It's coming :D<br></li><li>Modified minimum player counts required for numerous servers. Finding a good balance that prevents credit farming, but still enables good quality games with lower player counts.</li></ul><b>Things to keep in mind:</b><br><ul><li>I'm aware many lost a lot of time online for some reason. Still looking into fixing this!&nbsp;</li><li>I'm also aware of all issues listed on the issues page. They'll all be addressed over time.</li><li>We plan on releasing scrimmage servers mid- to late-April in beta (limited availability).</li><li>Advertising is in the works, we're thinking up methods to get people interested in Avicus.</li></ul><br>Thanks for reading! We'll keep you posted when we have more to say!

Thank you for the update, Kylo.<br><br>I'm trying to become more active with my YouTube channel, so hopefully that will help attract more players.

Great to know what being fixed and what to expect.<br>Also, an Update Channel Log would't be such a bad idea.

Yes but Kylo can't keep his server for the next years on 1.7. Many players (more than 50% played on 1.8) are up-to-date and if the server would still be 1.7, then many players will leave and leave...
