<div>Heloohoho all!</div><div><br></div>It’s that time of the year once again, and we have some great things planned for this holiday season! If you can remember, I released 15 special presents last year for Christmas. This year, we are taking things to a whole new level! I am releasing <b>25</b> special things this year, starting TODAY (Dec. 1)!<br><br><b>Day 22 (Dec. 22)<br></b>With the Christmas Mini-Tournament being kicked off tomorrow, It seems as though it's time to bring back the Hall of Fame! We are bringing back the Old Hall of Fame but adding more recent events but we need your help! The Hall of Fame has special areas to show off events that occurred during tournaments. Here's an example:<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/U0syKQu.png" class="post-image-placeholder" style="max-width: 100%; min-height: 409px;" title="Image: https://i.imgur.com/U0syKQu.png"><br>My Elves asked me to tell you guys to give us events that you believe deserve to be showcased in the Hall of Fame! Please respond to the thread or discuss in #competitive in the Avicus Discord.<br><br>Here's also a picture of the top 3 finishings for the last 3 tournaments:<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/50ebbVa.png" class="post-image-placeholder" style="max-width: 100%; min-height: 409px;" title="Image: https://i.imgur.com/50ebbVa.png"><br>and if you've never seen the Hall of Fame, here's a snippet of the rest of the Top 3 awards:<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/P1c7Xgt.png" class="post-image-placeholder" style="max-width: 100%; min-height: 409px;" title="Image: https://i.imgur.com/P1c7Xgt.png"><br><br>The Hall of Fame will be released with the end of the Avicus Christmas Mini-Tournament (How ALM Captured Christmas) as well as a special room dedicated to the Top 3 of this event:<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/RNKOzHC.png" class="post-image-placeholder" style="max-width: 100%; min-height: 409px;" title="Image: https://i.imgur.com/RNKOzHC.png"><br>But if you look closely, there's a room below the First Place statue. This room is that "secret prize" I've been talking about for the First place team! This room is going to be a permanent addition to the Hall of Fame. Each player in the winning team will receive a personal 20 by 20 by 30 zone inside this room where they get to build whatever they want (as long as it follows server rules. If abused, the winning team will no longer receive the prize and the second place team will instead be allowed to build). Good luck to the teams participating in the tournament! Hope that your team may be the winning team so I get to see all your creations inside the How ALM Captured Christmas First Place trophy room! May the best team win! See you guys tomorrow.<br><br>----------------------------------------------------<br><br><b>Day 20/21 (Dec. 21)<br></b>Hello everyone. Today's wonderful announcement is in regards to the Super Nebula Event that will be happening starting Friday and ends Monday. What the Super Nebula Event is will be a surprise. Not only will the server be open for 4 days, each day will have a new assortment of old throwback maps! Each day will get 16 maps that will total up to 64 old maps that have been on the server at one point.&nbsp;Remember maps like Dry Heaven 1? How about Encryption? Maybe you guys will recognize maps like Venomous TDM or Coconut DTM! You can find the maps listed here:&nbsp;<a href="https://avicus.net/forums/discussions/7fbc5cf14" title="Link: https://avicus.net/forums/discussions/7fbc5cf14">https://avicus.net/forums/discussions/7fbc5cf14</a><br><br>Another quick announcement. The Mapdevs will be returning the Hall of Fame! More details to be this weekend.<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><b>Dec 19 (Dec. 19)<br></b>Ho ho ho, today I have some holly jolly new web icons for you! Feast your eyes upon the cold-as-ice snowflake, and the warm-as-fire gift! Get them, along with the christmas tree icon, at&nbsp;<a href="https://shop.avicus.net/" title="Link: https://shop.avicus.net/">https://shop.avicus.net/</a><br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><b>Day 18 (Dec. 18)<br></b>For the 18th day of Christmas, we have another morph being released as a promotional gift! You can obtain a White Rabbit morph which will be released within 24 hours to the general public. Make sure to acquire all 3 morphs mentioned (Snow Golem, Avi Claus, and the White Rabbit) before the 31st or else they will be gone forever! The tournament is also on the 23rd so make sure to be there! There may some gifts that will be given out on livestream by yours truly so be ready for that! See you tomorrow!<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><b>Day 17 (Dec. 17)<br></b><b></b>Today is going to be a little short. I’m here to announce that our new ranks for Avicus have been released! Learn more&nbsp;by going to the Avicus shop or by going to this thread:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://avicus.net/forums/discussions/0228d003e">https://avicus.net/forums/discussions/0228d003e</a>. All current donators have also received free upgrades to their ranks! Make sure to support the server by donating. I hope to see you all tomorrow and the following days for the daily presents!<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><div><b>Day 16 (Dec. 16)</b></div><div>We're almost to the final 25 days and there's a week left until the highly anticipated Christmas Mini tournament! Make sure to sign up for the secret first place prize which I will announce later this week. Now for today's gift, I have updated the server's destroy and capture rotations with even more holiday maps! Capture has some new maps such as a Christmas version of Darkwoods and Madness. Destroy on the other hand has Christmas versions of Quintus, Luar, and Ternio! Go out and have some fun with those maps!</div><div><b><br></b></div><div>Also, make sure to be here tomorrow for the discord event which will start at 1 pm EST in the Avicus Discord!<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br></div><div><br></div><i><b></b></i><b>Day 15 (Dec. 15)<br></b><i></i>Hello everyone! There is no need to worry. The snowstorm has finally passed and our elves can finally get back to work. For today’s gift, we have something special. Avicus now supports Dynamic rotations&nbsp;and it will be put in place in the next couple of days. What this means is that the server’s map pool will adjust depending on how many players are on the server. If the player count is low, you may see a variety of small maps for a small player count. Once that player count increases, you will start seeing bigger maps to fit the player count and maybe some small rewards in the rotation for getting the player count up high. You can make a suggestion either by making a pull request, by suggesting it to&nbsp;a Mapdev on discord, or by responding to this thread. You can find the repository of our rotations <a href="https://github.com/Avicus/Rotations?files=1" rel="nofollow">here</a>. We can now have countless numbers of rotations used for one server and in the future, we'll potentially support automated rotation cycling every day and different rotations on special occasions or holidays! We also have customizable rot&nbsp;names for such events and automation.&nbsp;Thanks for tuning in let’s hope this snowstorm doesn’t hit us again.&nbsp;<br><br>Make sure&nbsp;to be here on Sunday (the 17th) for our discord party! The time of the event will be posted in our discord (which you can join at <a href="http://avicus.net/discord" title="Link: http://avicus.net/discord">http://avicus.net/discord</a>) as well as the game being announced a couple of hours before.<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><b>Day ?? (Dec. 14)<br></b><b></b>Hello? Is anybody there? Oh, finally!&nbsp;This message is getting through. Our North Pole headquarters was recently hit by a severe snowstorm and we have lost all communications. This snowstorm halted our present delivery so we will have to deliver more presents and double up days! With the terribleness communication because of the snowstorm, I can still only send out one present for today. For a limited time only, you can get an Avi Claus Morph from the credit shop for free! Get there before the snowstorm reaches mainland! The snowstorm is coming back so that&nbsp;means our communications will start going down again. I hope I can communicate with you guys again&nbsp;<br>tomo........<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><b>Day 11 (Dec.11)<br></b>Did anyone hear about our upcoming Super Nebula Event? Starting on the 22nd, you can play some old maps you may remember or some you may not remember. Here's a list of maps that may seem familiar to you or unfamiliar, but they were all a part of the server's history! What maps do you remember from this list?<br><div>Bleened Rings Origins&nbsp;</div><div>Dry Heaven 1&nbsp;</div><div>Mistrock&nbsp;</div><div>CherrylandMC</div><div>Boolean 1&nbsp;</div><div>Ternio&nbsp;</div><div>Broken Ages&nbsp;</div><div>Rendezvous 3&nbsp;</div><div>Palm Rust Origins</div><div>Decay&nbsp;</div><div>Gladiator&nbsp;</div><div>Broken World</div><div>Trinity&nbsp;</div><div>Wasteland&nbsp;</div><div>Senex 1&nbsp;</div><div>Diamond Shore&nbsp;</div><div>Windmill Plains&nbsp;</div><div>Alpha Complex</div><div>Mystic&nbsp;</div><div>The Minefield Campaign&nbsp;</div><br>That's all for today. Expect some big things to be announced in the near future of this calendar!&nbsp;<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><b>Day 10 (Dec.10)</b><br>Hello everyone. Today isn't going to be as special as the previous day with a new feature (expect some more in the following days *wink wink*) but instead, I have decided to send this message in order to remind players that our Christmas tournament,&nbsp;<b>How ALM Captured Christmas,&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>has been announced and revealed in the last couple of days. I am here to tell you guys to make sure to sign up as this is the first time in the server's history where you don't need a team to sign up! You can join in as a single user and create a whole new team with others who joined as a single. More information can be found <a href="https://avicus.net/tournaments/how-alm-captured-christmas" rel="nofollow">here</a>&nbsp;or <a href="https://avicus.net/forums/discussions/4db780e0a" rel="nofollow" title="Link: https://avicus.net/forums/discussions/4db780e0a">here</a>. You can also now set 3 of the maps in the map pool on a <a href="https://avicus.net/scrims" rel="nofollow" title="Link: https://avicus.net/scrims">scrim server</a>&nbsp;(which you can reserve at&nbsp;<a href="https://avicus.net/scrims" rel="nofollow" title="Link: https://avicus.net/scrims">https://avicus.net/scrims</a>). The maps you can now set can be done with the commands:<br>/sn Draxel Holiday<br>/sn Yukon 2 Holiday<br>/sn Alpine Holiday<br><br>More maps will be available for testing soon! If you find any issues with these 3 maps on a scrim server, please ping a Map Developer on our <a href="https://avicus.net/discord" rel="nofollow" title="Link: https://avicus.net/discord">discord server</a>.<br>That's all for now. Make sure to join in on this festive tournament as there may be a secret reward your team may earn for winning this mini-tournament that you won't want to miss out on!<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><b>Day 9 (Dec. 9)<br></b><b></b>For the 9th day of Avimas, we are releasing a limited edition Christmas Tree Web Icon that you can obtain by donating one or more USD to the server via the Avicus Shop. This web icon will only be available until the end of the month (31st). You can buy the web icon here:&nbsp;<a href="https://shop.avicus.net/" title="Link: https://shop.avicus.net/">https://shop.avicus.net/</a><br><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/0MmMhWE.png" style="max-width: 100%; min-height: 354px;" title="Image: https://i.imgur.com/0MmMhWE.png"><br>Remember that the present hunt is still ongoing! Make sure to check out the new portals near the Map Development Team board to continue the hunt!<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><b>Day 8 (Dec 8.)<br></b><b></b>For Day 8 on our calendar, we have our Conquest and TDM Map playing. We might play some walls maps too depending on how many people show up! You might also see some old TDM maps.&nbsp;We will begin at 6 PM EST on a server that will be announced later today.&nbsp;<br>I hope that I’ll see you guys later at the Conquest Event!<br>Tomorrow and for the next couple of days, we’ll (hopefully) have more presents that you guys can actually be&nbsp;using on the server! Be ready for those.<br><br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><b>Day 7 (Dec. 7)<br></b>Can't you believe It's already been a week? Today's small notice is just a reminder that today at 8:30 PM EST, there is going to be a discord event. Hop onto discord and come join the rest of the community in a game you guys voted to play! Here is the vote link:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.strawpoll.me/14571124" title="Link: http://www.strawpoll.me/14571124">http://www.strawpoll.me/14571124</a>. And that's all for now, I'll see you guys again tomorrow!<br>A quick reminder that The Conquest Event tomorrow will be at 6 PM EST. Come on and give us your opinions on the Conquest gamemode!<br><br>Another portal for the present hunt has opened! These newer portals will have harder to find presents to good luck hunting!<br><br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><b>Day 6 (Dec. 6)</b><br>Hey everyone. it's day 6! Today we are releasing a long requested feature from #suggestions in our discord.<br><br>We have added the <b>1k</b>, <b>10k</b>, and <b>100k</b> credit blasters to the gadget store. Now you can shower your friends with even more credits!<br><br>Also, speaking of Discord, tomorrow's event will happen there! Be in a VC at 8;30 PM EST to join in on the fun!<br>Adding to Yesterday's present hunt release. One of the portals has been opened for you to access a different lobby. You can now enter the sandstone portal!<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><b>Day 4-5 (Dec. 5)</b><br>What a week it has been so far, and I am just getting started bringing you all kinds of holiday cheer! Sorry for not delivering yesterday, we had some issues at the north pole. Nevertheless, today I am releasing <b>2</b> presents to make up for lost time.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Present Hunt:</b> The first feature is a present hunt! When you log in to the lobby, you will notice some presents (labeled with nametags) that when you click, you can claim the present. Currently, the presents you have claimed don't show up anywhere, but they are stored and we are planning to use them for some rewards and achievements later in the month. As a part of this hunt, we are bringing back some old lobbies. Every 2 days, a portal will open up that allows you to teleport to an old lobby. These lobbies contain even more presents that you can claim. In order to claim the reward, you only need to claim 2 in each lobby. If you claim all in a lobby, you will get even more rewards when they are added.<br><br><b>Snow Golem Morph</b>: We are also releasing a <b>FREE</b> snow golem morph that can be purchased in the in-game store for the rest of the month. Morphs also work now so enjoy that.<br><br><div>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</div><br><div><div><b>Day 3 (Dec. 3)</b></div><div>Isn’t it a wonderful sight to see all our players coming together in the month of December as we approach the Avimas Celebration? Today on Day 3, we have a small schedule of future events you may come join in on during the month of December.

As a part of this hunt, we are brining back some old lobbies. Every 2 days, a portal will open up that allows you to teleport to an old lobby. These lobbies contain even more presents that you can claim. In order to claim the reward, you only need to claim 2 in each lobby.

<b>Day 10 (Dec.10)</b><br>Hello everyone. Today isn't going to be as special as the previous day with a new feature (expect some more in the following days *wink wink*) but instead, I have decided to send this message in order to remind players that our Christmas tournament,&nbsp;<b>How ALM Captured Christmas,&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>has been announced and revealed in the last couple of days. I am here to tell you guys to make sure to sign up as this is the first time in the server's history where you don't need a team to sign up! You can join in as a single user and create a whole new team with others who joined as a single. More information can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://avicus.net/tournaments/how-alm-captured-christmas" rel="nofollow">here</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://avicus.net/forums/discussions/4db780e0a" rel="nofollow" title="Link: https://avicus.net/forums/discussions/4db780e0a">here</a>. You can also now set 3 of the maps in the map pool on a&nbsp;<a href="https://avicus.net/scrims" rel="nofollow" title="Link: https://avicus.net/scrims">scrim server</a>&nbsp;(which you can reserve at&nbsp;<a href="https://avicus.net/scrims" rel="nofollow" title="Link: https://avicus.net/scrims">https://avicus.net/scrims</a>). The maps you can now set can be done with the commands:<br>/sn&nbsp;Draxel&nbsp;Holiday<br>/sn Yukon 2 Holiday<br>/sn Alpine Holiday<br><br>More maps will be available for testing soon! If you find any issues with these 3 maps on a scrim server, please ping a Map Developer on our&nbsp;<a href="https://avicus.net/discord" rel="nofollow" title="Link: https://avicus.net/discord">discord server</a>.<br>That's all for now. Make sure to join in on this festive tournament as there may be a secret reward your team may earn for winning this mini-tournament that you won't want to miss out on!

<b>Day ?? (Dec. 14)<br></b><b></b>Hello? Is anybody there? Oh, finally!&nbsp;This message is getting through. Our North Pole headquarters was recently hit by a severe snowstorm and we have lost all communications. This snowstorm halted our present delivery so we will have to deliver more presents and double up days! With the terribleness communication because of the snowstorm, I can still only send out one present for today. For a limited time only, you can get an Avi Claus Morph from the credit shop for free! Get there before the snowstorm reaches mainland! The snowstorm is coming back so that&nbsp;means our communications will start going down again. I hope I can communicate with you guys again tomo...

<b>Day 15 (Dec. 15)<br></b><i></i>Hello everyone! There is no need to worry. The snowstorm has finally passed and our elves can finally get back to work. For today’s gift, we have something special. Avicus now supports Dynamic rotations&nbsp;and it will be put in place in the next couple of days. What this means is that the server’s map pool will adjust depending on how many players are on the server. If the player count is low, you may see a variety of small maps for a small player count. Once that player count increases, you will start seeing bigger maps to fit the player count and maybe some small rewards in the rotation for getting the player count up high. You can make a suggestion either by making a pull request,&nbsp;by suggesting it to&nbsp;a Mapdev on discord, or by responding to this thread. You can find the repository of our rotations&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/Avicus/Rotations?files=1" rel="nofollow">here</a>. We can now have countless numbers of rotations used for one server and in the future, we'll potentially support automated rotation cycling every day and different rotations on special occasions or holidays!&nbsp;We also have customizable rot&nbsp;names for such events and automation.&nbsp;Thanks for tuning in let’s hope this snowstorm doesn’t hit us again.&nbsp;<br><br>Make sure&nbsp;to be here on Sunday (the 17th) for our discord party! The time of the event will be posted in our discord (which you can join at&nbsp;<a href="http://avicus.net/discord">http://avicus.net/discord</a>) as well as the game being announced a couple of hours before.<br><div><br></div>

Please respond to the thread or discuss in #competitive in the Avicus Discord.</span><br><br><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Here's also a picture of the top 3 finishings for the last 3 tournaments:</span><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/50ebbVa.png" class="post-image-placeholder" title="Image: https://i.imgur.com/50ebbVa.png" style="max-width: 100%; min-height: 409px;"><br><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">and if you've never seen the Hall of Fame, here's a snippet of the rest of the Top 3 awards:</span><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/P1c7Xgt.png" class="post-image-placeholder" title="Image: https://i.imgur.com/P1c7Xgt.png" style="max-width: 100%; min-height: 409px;"><br><br><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">The Hall of Fame will be released with the end of the Avicus Christmas Mini-Tournament (How ALM Captured Christmas) as well as a special room dedicated to the Top 3 of this event:</span><br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/RNKOzHC.png" class="post-image-placeholder" title="Image: https://i.imgur.com/RNKOzHC.png" style="max-width: 100%; min-height: 409px;"><br><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">But if you look closely, there's a room below the First Place statue. This room is that "secret prize" I've been talking about for the First place team! This room is going to be a permanent addition to the Hall of Fame. Each player in the winning team will receive a personal 20 by 20 by 30 zone inside this room where they get to build whatever they want (as long as it follows server rules. If abused, the winning team will no longer receive the prize and the second place team will instead be allowed to build). Good luck to the teams participating in the tournament! Hope that your team may be the winning team so I get to see all your creations inside the How ALM Captured Christmas First Place&nbsp;</span>trophy<span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">&nbsp;room! May the best team win! See you guys tomorrow.</span>
