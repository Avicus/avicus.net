Swearing rules loosened, revised exploit rule

<b>What changed?</b><br>Today, the staff have<b> revised the ruleset </b>to allow swearing as long as it isn't <b>excessive or directed</b>. This is pretty much the same as it was before swearing was made illegal, and we encourage the staff to update to this new update as we update swearing guidelines and inform the staff to not punish off of it. All <b>active swearing punishments before the rule was updated</b> are still going to <b>be active</b>, as the rule was broken when it was active regardless. As well as this, we will have a senior staff member work on a more uniform document on which swearing words may be legal, and which ones may be illegal. More about the swearing rule is not set in stone, however for the future we may have more open debates about it.<b> As well as this change</b>, we have defined exploits better. Under this, we have mentioned severity, exploits in gaining advantage, and more of an "instance" view. It was to differentiate between small-scale abuse such as block glitching, and being able to, say, teleport other users into the void.<br><br><b>Why would you revise it?</b><br>We revised it because it was causing more harm than it was helping. I don't believe in "hiding harmful words" on the internet, especially since (taking a gander) that a majority of our playerbase is teenagers, and from that, I can tell alone that most are okay with swearing being possible. Censorship is one thing I don't want Avicus to turn into.<br><br><b>What next?</b><br>Feel free to suggest rule changes in this thread, and discuss it further.

Rather curious, could you list a multitude of examples which shed some light on different contexts on swearing? Is it just a streamlined system? (if it includes word X no matter what it'll be illegal).

This is not gonna help your situation Jamo. The old rules weren't idiotic they were put in place because Minecraft is a little kids game pretty much, and swearing and getting angry at the mods because they punished you and your mad you got banned. What do you think was gonna happen when you got all of those infractions? A cupcake and a super hero sticker? No a temp ban. Sorry Lad but thats the way she goes...

Completely banning swearing was a horrible idea in the first place. In fact, some mods didn't even go by that. They still went by "as long as it is not directed a someone"

No.. But you were banned because you were excessively swearing which built up your infractions so..

I counted, 8 out of all my infractions are related to rude lagnauge/swearing, does this mean I should be unbanned from excessive infractions considering these make up for about half of my infractions?

You will not be unbanned just because something isn't illegal anymore. You broke the rule while it was active.
