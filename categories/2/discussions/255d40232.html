<div>Walls is now supported thanks to <img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/eb1216878b1a4944bd4de0a818d9dfe2?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/Kashike.html" style="color: Gray">Kashike</a> . We're currently testing it so it shouldn't be too long before you can play it.</div><div><br></div><div>Because now we're using XML, compared to when we used YML, this will open up some new doors as to what we can do in Walls. A module has been added that makes it possible to put falling walls within the XML to recreate the old Walls gamemode, and this may be used with other gamemodes depending on the usage. You may submit maps as we go through testing phases at this time.</div><div><br></div><div>- Administrative &amp; Development Team.</div>

Awesome great work by Devs!&nbsp;<br><br>Just a question though, will past statistics be re-added? I mean quite a few players had a lot of Walls kills and wins before they were removed (including myself).

DTM and Nexus stats did kinda carry over when the leaderboards switched to credits/points from exp. Walls stats were removed completely though.

Oh yeah.. xD I think I messed it up with the prestiges and the credits system, because you didn't get any credits if you had like level 10 prestige

This is. Remember it's a module and not a gamemode, it can be used to make The Walls but can also be used in other gamemodes so technically we are focusing on the main gamemodes as well :D

Please note that the Gamemode is now coded. This does not mean we will be implementing it as a server in all of its own yet. The map devs/admins understand the past failures with frenzy and sky wars and will remain more cautious so we are able to sustain the gamemode when implemented with its own server (We are not adding it to mix at the moment). I do hope that this helps any confusing posts made by any of the map devs or admins earlier on this thread. Thank you ^.^

Awesome great work by Devs!&nbsp;<br><br>Just a question though, will past statistics be re-added? I mean quite a few players had a lot of Walls kills and wins before they were removed (including myself).

Why do people complain about "none will play it" like guys give it a chance be more positive about things and it will succeed I promise or at least don't be so mean, good luck with walls expecting the best.
