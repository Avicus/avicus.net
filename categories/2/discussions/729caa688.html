Hello everyone,<br><br>A few minutes ago I pushed a long-worked-on update that completely revamped the way Atlas determines winners and handles ties.<br><br>Previously, if more than one competitor had the same amount of completions the match would simply tie and no one would get any rewards. Also, if no one fully completed an objective when a scenario's check was reached, a tie would also be reached.<br><br>Before I explain the new system I need to explain some terms:<br><b>Competitor</b>: Player (During FFA) or a Team<br><b>Shared Objective</b>: Objective that can be completed by multiple competitors (has no team above on sidebar.)<br><b>Specific Objective</b>: Objective that can be completed by only one competitor.<br><b>End Scenario</b>: Stuff defined in XML to customize when the match should end (see docs for more info).<br><br>Ok so here's how it works,<br>If a competitor completes all objectives that are required for it to win, it will win.<br>If the total amount of completable objectives is completed and no competitor has completed all of their needed objectives, the competitor who has done the most (completed, damaged, touched, gotten the closest (during competitive)) will be chosen.<br>If multiple competitors have done the exact same thing, a ranking will be displayed with the most to the least who have completed that number of objectives.<br>Ties will now be a lot less frequent and false ties should now be nonexistent.&nbsp;<br><br>Also, monuments with no owner will be colored the competitor who has completed the most, or will be white is there is a tie for most.<br><br>Thanks, and enjoy playing.<br>ALM
