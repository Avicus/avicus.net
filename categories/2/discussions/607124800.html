Administration Log

After recently having an Administrator meeting, Fouled and myself have decided that we need to increase transparency between the staff team and the community. The administration logs will be filled out when an update/progress has been made regarding anything related to administrating the server; eg advertising, ect. Obviously we aren't going to put everything on here and some information is classified but the stuff the the community can and should know will be posted below.&nbsp;<br><br>- Peter &amp; Fouled.&nbsp;

<b>Mod Activity<br></b>In order to keep moderator activity high after the holidays we're implementing a new system to assess moderators activity. We'll be tracking things like punishments, extra activities they do apart from moderating, leave and general activity. Senior Staff will be doing this bi-weekly.

- I've assigned Passively as head translator for the time being as I don't have the time or the motivation to be dealing with them. He'll be providing a proper structure to the team and he'll fix what i couldn't.

<div>Although it has been a while, the Administration team will continue to post on here to inform you of recent progress and administrative work.&nbsp;</div><div>So here is our most recent work:</div><div><br></div><div>- Looking into new payment methods for the online Avicus Store. We are trying to cover a number of different methods of payments for our customers, so expect new payments gateways soon!</div><div>- The Avicus Instagram account (@officialavicus) is now a business account, to cater to our company's needs.

Recently, we introduced an Administrator Trello for better organization and rate of work.&nbsp;</div><div>- Promoting voting more.&nbsp;</div><div>- Organising and improving Moderation tools (guidelines, mutes (thank you to ALM, etc)).&nbsp;</div><div>- Formation of the assembly team (more info here:&nbsp;<a href="https://avicus.net/forums/discussions/168791e0d" title="Link: https://avicus.net/forums/discussions/168791e0d)">https://avicus.net/forums/discussions/168791e0d</a>).</div><div>- Working with Owners to decide the direction of Avicus.</div><div>- Looking at new ideas to improve the state of the Avicus store - better prices and perks.&nbsp;</div><div>- Keeping consistency throughout all sectors.
