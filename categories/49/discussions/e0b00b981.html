<b>Hi my name is Dzekio3.<br></b>&nbsp;<br>I prefer to be called Dzekio though. I have been on the community for 9 months now but this is my first time on the forums. My computer gets approximately 200-300 although I sometimes get mouse lag. My K/D isn't very good because before I got my good computer, I played on a 0-10 FPS P<b></b>C, it was 9 years old... XD. Anyways I am 12 years old currently and my birthday is in February. I get about 50-150 ping on Avicus. Not to brag here but I think I am an above average PVPer, don't quote me on that though. Some other things about me are, I love Monstercat/Dubstep, I play to win (most of the time) and I have high strategic thinking skills.<br><b>&nbsp;I am looking forward to play with you all.&nbsp;</b><br><br><b>P.S. I am level 39.4 on Nebula<br><br>ASK ME ANYTHING!</b>

The Forums community is way better than th in-game community. I think it's fair to say I've got quite good at PvP so if I ever see you in Nexus I'll see what you're made of :P.&nbsp;<br>Looking forward to seeing you in game!&nbsp;<br>Only issue is that I can't combo well on Avicus :P&nbsp;<br>And welcome!&nbsp;<br><br>If you want to be staff use, ^_^ and other edits of it every single time you write. Do so and you'll be sure to get in!!!1!1!111!1!!11!&nbsp;<br>Jk, although staff seem to use it every single sentence like it's a rule anyways -_-. Sometimes it's better to be more original. I believe in being positive, yet not using the same sentwnce every time. But that's off-topic ;)&nbsp;<br>No hate for the staff. They're cool and I'm fine with them, I'm just poking fun at you all :)

I like it when people call me out of hacks I find it amusing and it makes me 'feel warm inside' (it sounded better in my head), like the other day I killed a full iron and he said : RagingLumberjack has regen hacks, LOL l2p haha scrub. <br>He went on and on and I couldn't stop laughing! So I killed him a couple more times, and he got so annoyed with me that he logged off. Called out for hacks on my 2nd day back from a 3 week break (since my laptop broke). Achievement get!

When I get accused for hacking I get a little scared. But then I'm like "hah I'm too good for him!" not in like a negative way but like to encourage me to continue fighting :3
