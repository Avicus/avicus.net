Hiiiii everyone. AMAs have been getting more popular lately and I haven't done an AMA in forever and Cat of course has never done one so we are posting an AMA here. Ask a question and you will get a reply with both of our answers. You can also adress each person just use @Zero or @Cat or don't and we will both answer.

Zero: I already knew before I talked to you that you were a boy but I am going to be 100% honest and I hope I am not annoying you but your voice is really cute LOL (a little gay is ok). ANYWAYS You are very friendly and active and seem to go along wtih everyone :3 First impressions was basically that aswell<br><br>Cat: 1. You're very nice and I would like playing more with you ^-^<div>2. I honestly thought you were a girl at first and after we were on TS together with Buster and we were building bears and I got into a Skype call with zero I only found out you were a boy... SORRY! You have a very cute voice though ^-^</div>

Both 14. Zero actually 15 soon.. very soon.. I have plans for his birthday&nbsp;<br>Its not really a pixelgame relationship, more an online relationship. I actually wish people would stop calling it a pixelgame relationship :P not that I mind but everyone makes it seem like its a bad thing.

Zero:&nbsp;<br>To be honest you are confusing me alot XD I can't really tell your personality. You can be really nice &nbsp;to alot of people at the same time you can get very toxic out of no where (although I understand most of the time why but still). You seem like you have an incredible fragile personality as a lot of times you feel attacked from people for no reason at all. Apparently you once said that you had problems that people help fixing you so I hope you will fix that problem :)<br><br>Cat:<br>I dont really know you but you seem like a very nice person that I would like to know better ^-^

Zero:&nbsp;<br>One of my better friends on avicus. Lately your personality has change a lot in a very good way :3 Your core features are still the same though. You are a very shy person and also very ambitious. Sorry for ignoring you on skype alot. Its just that you mostly message me when I am very busy<br><br>Cat:<br>You're very nice to me so I like you XD basically it. but I guess you're a (good) friend of zero so yeah.. I never personally spoke with you but I heard many good things about you :P (also I litterally had to help him edit his part cuz he didnt know some words and such xD)

Now later after we didn't talk for a while you started talking and it has always been a lot of fun to play with you :3 Your swedish accent is also very funny :PPPP<br><br>Cat:<br>You are straight up and tell it how it is (atleast from what i've seen) you see to be very interactive and social but I also get anti-social vibes.. If that makes any sense (probably not) I love your skin ;D Its cute :P

In terms of knowing they are possible I don't know xd kinda everyone knows I guess ? In terms of building those constructions is actually a long story. Basically I wanted to build a game in minecraft and needed some way to calculate a value in the game. So I looked around how to do such stuff and done lol<br>school :P Building PCs (but am kinda doing that while shes watching so idk if that counts)

1. Well at first he was very nice and awesome to hang out with. The first time we skyped we actually tried to kill people with poppy's (one of my favorite memories in that conversation probably) and after that he was very easy to talk to and he understood me and supported me when my ex-girlfriend and ex-best friend flipped shit at me because I spent too much time with him (whoops)<br><br>2. I would describe him as a very funny, cute, awesome, pervy, nerdy yet he's a complete moron (he says I make him a moron -,-) basically how I would describe him in a few words. I could go on for hours though, as I said above he always understand me and we can have very deep conversations about anything. We know everything about eachother and I wouldnt want it any other way :)&nbsp;<br><br>(@both)<br>Cat<br>1. My brother found minecraft in BETA 1.2 and me and my other brother (we are both younger than him and we looked up to him) watched him play it. Sometimes we were allowed to play but only in our own worlds and such. They both dont really play minecraft as often anymore but I do. One of my brothers came on avicus recently which was a lot of fun. I guess I have to thank my second oldest brother for having Zero right now C:&nbsp;<br><br>2. I would hug him to death, pretty sure. Well not to death because I can't live without Zero but yeah. <br><br>Zero: <br>1. I found out about it by first playing it on my tablet actually xd One of my irl friends who has been playing it since ages (Lukas alot of you know him) then introduced me to the PC version and then I bought it for PC aswell&nbsp;<br><br>2. Hug her, probably the first thing both of us would do.
