<b>*opinions</b><b><br></b>Very toxic girl, however has a heart, you just need to find it :'). The memes are 10/10. I didn't like you since idk how many days now, but after I was demoted, it got way worse. When you however told me your real age, I knew you were just a troll in the internet and my respect dropped a lot, lol. Also, after I got into Cacalmarin, we had lots of fun scrims, I enjoyed playing in your team. Now, I think we're good? and I would love if you wouldn't abuse your screenshots in the future <b>:&gt;</b> don't hurt me pls<br><br><b>am i your best friend<br></b>No.<b><br></b><b><br></b>

<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>*Opinions?</b><br>You're a great mod. Back in my trial, I used to ask you lots of questions and you didn't just answer them, you also gave me optional tips and feedback, which I really appreciated. :) That of course, makes you a nice person from my point of view. I had a few laughs when you were on TS and when we were moderating together, but you never heard them. :P<br><br></span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>If you ever come back as Junior, what are your plans?</b><br></span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">As a Junior, I will first thank each Sr. Mod and Admin that they gave me another chance and I'd probably just do the same job I did last time. But of course, I would try to <b>always</b>&nbsp;act as a Junior/staff member and be more respectful towards other moderators/staff members. If you want to know more, just read my application, you have permissions to do it.<br><br></span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>What motivates you to play Avicus?</b><br></span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Back in the days where prestiges were still a thing, the prestiges of course. I always played and played just to get as much XP as possible. There were fun gamemods such as Red Alert, Minotaur, OITC (It had another name) and of course DTM with lots of great maps. (Quintus, Original Luar, Ternio, Ravaged etc.) Today, to be honest, the biggest reason I'm still playing is that I want to become staff members to help the mods with their inactivity problem and just to help other players who need help. If I wouldn't have that reason, I'd probably be very inactive and just come on at special events and scrims. Right now, I'm a little bit hyped about Arcade too. I know it won't get played very often but it's still nice to have it back!<br><br></span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>Favorite number?</b><br>I don't have one (right now) but if I must say one, it'd be 142 because it's at the end of one of my usernames. xD<br></span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><br><br><br></span>
