<b><b>hey Everyone, i would just like to say that i love this server!<br>I like some of the original ideas and the awesome games!<br>But what stands out for me a lot is the unique website and how&nbsp; you can check out every single stat, like you can see your kills, deaths (K/D), your ranking, etc. and i find that awesome!<br>I dont know who will be reading this but i just want the creators and staff to know that this server is wicked!<br>Also, while i'm here, i just have a question: What exactly are the emerald, gold, etc. ranks and how do you get them? <br>Is it from getting to level 50 or something?<br><br>Dunno - Thanks Guys,<br>OPTOBAT&nbsp; <br></b></b>

First of all, Hi!!! It's great to see new people!!<br>Emerald, Gold, and Diamond are the standard donator ranks<br>you purchase them under the category "shop" at the top<br>They all come with different perks, to enhance gameplay!<br>For example, gold and above allows you to join any team you want!<br>Plus, you get a greater xp gain from killing people! (the more xp, the higher your level)<br>They are all better than eachthoer<br>Gold - $25<br>Emerald - $50<br>Diamond - $100

If you get to level 50 in any gamemode, you can just type<br>/prestige<br>and POOF! all your levels are gone, but if you type in chat...<br>you'll have a coloured star next to your name!<br>There are 5 different prestiges in all

Hello, welcome to the community! This is one of the best communities I've ever been in, personally. I really like the forums and profile, too, I just think it's really cool :D &nbsp;<br>Also, have you tried out Nebula yet? I think it's the best. Have fun playing here! (:

Hey hey and welcome to the Avicus forum community! Hopefully you like it here :)<br><br>Gold, Emerald and Diamond are all donator ranks which are given to users who donate X amount of money to help fund and maintain Avicus.<br><br>You can find the shop at:&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://avicus.net/shop">http://avicus.net/shop</a><br>As you may notice, there are two different types of payment options available. The "Subscription" option lets you donate in chunks. For example; Gold is $5/month, Emerald is $10/month and Diamond is $20/month.&nbsp;<i>You can cancel the subscription whenever you feel like it!&nbsp;</i>The second option is a "One Time" payment. You donate the full price, and your donator rank lasts forever! &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br><i><br><br></i><i><br></i><i><br></i>

Welcome! I'm glad you're enjoying the server! Like others have most likely said, Gold, Emerald &amp; Diamond ranks are obtained by donating. The money goes straight back into the server which helps retain a strong community.
