I was born in New York and moved to Florida when I was 1 year old. Grew up and was a pretty stupid and crazy kid when I was below the age 4. I started to think better and started school, I seemed to be a faster learner than other people, I had a talent of being smart in school. It still is fun helping my classmates when they have questions. But when I was 8 I figured out that I just dont have 1 talent, I have many. I was good at sports, school, helping, and much more. I wantd to find a talent where I was really, really good at. Took me a few years :P. When I was 11 my parents bought minecraft for my birthday. I played it and was pretty good at it. I then thought of my true talent, games. Video games, board games, hand games and more! Thats why I LOVE minecraft, its many games in 1. And there I am today, playing and having fun in Avicus, where I can show my talents. (Did I do it right? :P)

God dang, I feel like a robot now xD<br>Like, it was sad and quite touching but I don't really think it was that sad..<br>We're just beings who are happy sometimes and sad others. Like, when you're happy, it's inevitable that you're going to be sad. If nobody experienced sadness, we'd just be another organism on another planet that hasn't evolved to anywhere near its full potential. We only truly love because it releases hormones that make you feel good. Then, once you help someone, it will feel good for you because you know you're giving the other person pleasure in the present or the future, and then you feel good for making them feel good. Like, say helping people was un-pleasurable for both you and the person. Then no body would love or help because they'd think it's bad because of how they're raised and whenever you help or love, you'd release bad-feeling hormones.It's not necessarily human nature, it has to due to all of your genes, how you're raised, et cetera. Things that give you pleasure are dependent on how you're made.&nbsp;<br>I don't know, I guess when you look at this from a logical standpoint, it's not too sad xP

Thank you (:<br><br>Yes, it's all part of the equivalent exchange. All death brings life and all life brings death. The universe will die in its Heat Death because there's been so much life and creation, there has to be tons of death and destruction to even it out. :3

Are you being stupid? Seriously? What's your deal? He didn't want to put his story up so he put up a sad one in stead. It was just a story on a gif. It was about life. Not for attention. Don't be stupid and act all rude like that. It was just a gif because he didn't feel comfortable putting his life story up. Don't be rude like that.

My spine was really damaged. I was around 7 years old and this happened in New Zealand when I went go karting with my family. So guy from behind thought it was funny to acceralate at full speed and since he couldn't make a turn he pushed me out of the curve so he could MAKE that turn. I wetn flying out of my go Kart.<br><br>I look my myself, I had scars all over my face lines of blood just dropping down. Don't laugh but the part where my Spine joined to my pelvis was cracked. I really couldn't stand up straight and had to bend over. <br><br>NOTE this was in the middle of the track. Getting help was to have no choice get back in the go kart where I had to push it back onto the path way and take my time to slowly but steadily make it to the bottom. I may also add this track was down hill, that idiot could've used the breaks but he didn't.<br><br>When he hit my go kart I seriously had that douche laughing down the mountain. Anyway I did make it down the mountain and there were these skylines to take us back to the top of the mountain. From there I told my parents everything, they straight away took me to a hospital for check up.<br><br>FROM THERE that's when I knew my spine was damaged. Thank God I can still walk and stand straight. I mean I would've maybe died at the age of 7.<br><br>God Bless.

Lol ikr.&nbsp;<br>@soulreaper2012<br><br>Heres my life story. Geez, no need to be mean. that gif was only a joke :c<br><br>I was born on May 29,1999. I was a very playful and hyper kid, always loved candy and loved breaking things aroungd the house but i got some near death exoeriences. in my elemetnary school years, i always hanged out with kids 1-3 grades below me so i felt left out but i was still cool to my grade. I was always the shortest kid until 6th grade where i was taller than 1 kid. I was pretty smart in elmentary school. Learned my times table at 1st grade, got accepted in GATE program (Gifted And Talaented Education) and i kept geting lots of awards. 4th grade was my worst year cause i didn't get any awards lol. I also developed a cheating method in the 1st grade. When we took a test, we would always put these cubbie boards where we cant see the test from the persons next to you and in front of you. So what i did is i asked the teacher for tissue, she would say yes and i would walk around the class room looking on other peoples tests. Of course, i only did once or twice but the other students realized what my tactic was and copied me. Then, almost all the students startin usin it and when it was a test, all the students would practically ask for tissue. Teacher realized it and we all got in trouble lol. All the other kids would try to get homework from me so i was pretty ticked off from them. By the end of the 6th grade, i realized i had only 1-2 real friends. At middle school, i decided to leave my elementary school click and move on. So i found another group and hanged out with them. Middle school years were the best years. In p.e, we would alwyas towel whip each other, there were fights in the locker rooms, and this one kid that is not special ed, he is so funny. He would always get in trouble everyday for doing something random. One time, he danced on a tablle with a trash can on hi head and start throwing grapes at a teacher ._.<br><br>Ya i got some awards in middle school. Again, people ask me for answers, pretty ticked off.<br><br>Now im in high school. Got in algebra 2 honors, livin the life and gonna be a sophmore.<br><br>Are you happy soulreaper? hmmm
