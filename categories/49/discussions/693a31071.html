Well, I recently joined this server not too long ago, and I hope to have a great experience here, like many other places. I suppose I should get active here and get off on a good start, but I'm not really too sure about all the commands. Here goes, Ask me anything! :P

@puffycloud5751: Who doesn't like food?! Sour Patch Kids or any bag of chips I can find to devour<br>@HoboMatty: Dogs ofc! My favorite junk food would probably be chips of some sort (i.e. Pringles, Hot Cheetos, Takis)<br>@roboticboy16: Ohaidere, I don't mean to intrude but wanted to check this server out from DoctaPop or others, then found it actually really fun and addicting! :D<br>@CrafterPete1013: Well, haven't really played anything but Nebula and Nexus, so the only other choice would have to be Nexus! XD (I always choose the ones I see have the most players on)<br>@cinnamoncroc000: Here goes: League of Legends, Dota 2, Counterstrike Global Offensive, Minecraft, World of Warcraft, Starcraft 1+2, Hearthstone, Wii Super Smash Bros Brawl, Diablo 3 (quit), and some random Internet games that you probably won't care about.<br>@steven5703: Hmmm, I don't seem to remember you... I totally don't remember you from someplace... (not sarcasm)<br>@Ducksfanwaterloo: Yey, you replied to this thread! :D I want to know how to friend people, I don't want to be a loner ;-;<br>@kycrafft: Nah, I already have a Minecraft lover :P

@SWEET_Johny: It depends on which lottery. If I won the lottery my parents would probably force me to buy books or save for college :/<br>@steven5703: Any idea on how long it will probably take? So does that mean the players can't private convo in game, only on skype? Too many questions overflowing in my head... Thanks for the answer though! :D
