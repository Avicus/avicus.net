Well when I rush I like to find ways around the main part of the maps, so I'm kinda sneaky. I feel great when I get the mon and I only get an adrenaline rush when the mon is hard to get (Defenders see me, getting chased by 5 people..) if the mon is easy its not that exciting.

1: &nbsp; Halycon1, Hold Fast and Fantasy (one with elves and orcs, everyone hated it, but it reminds me of Lord Of The Rings. )<br><br>2: I have recently got into Ghost Recon Wildlands.<br><br>3: I really enjoy doing small details (eg. Patterns) as you probably saw from Heaven on your build server. I have recently discovered terraforming and im really getting into that, you can see that from my other un-named map on your server.<br><br>4: I find your a really really nice guy, who is easy to talk too. I love your voice, i don't know where your from though xD I feel your a very good map dev as i see you have a clear passion for all the avicus maps. Could do with some help to touch up some of my maps though :D

You are really nice! You probably don't remember this but you are the main reason I carried on playing Avicus. At one point I nearly quit as I was so bad at PvP that everyone always killed me, I just slowly got tired of losing. Anyways it was on Rendezvous Ctw and I was about to leave but then I accidently 10 hearted you.... You just had diamond rank back then. You asked me what mouse I had and what texture pack I used. You were the first person who actually talked to me. Back when my ign was Rocky_1969 (cringe) Every time after I looked for you in the lobbies, you must of had a break or possibly time zones but I never could find you. Anyways since then I started talking more and I slowly tuned into what I am today. So overall I'm not sure whether or not to thank you or not. You probably don't remember but thanks anyways!&nbsp;<br><br>I was really surprised as I felt like I did terrible in the interview. Of course I was really happy I had to stop my self from mic spamming and then just look dumb when I said "thanks he he" xD<br><br>My trial is going well so far I've been met with a lot of circumstances that I hadn't really thought of before.

You seem really nice! I'm still really confused to whether or not that ban was false but oh well. XD I enjoy scrimming you as your a team that is challenging to allow learning but not so amazing that we don't even have a chance.

You seem like a really nice guy! Very approachable and know a lot about competitive. Your activity as a whole in game could be better but your active on discord so idm. I can also see your activity is slowly improving.<br><br>Sorry i don't know anything about your pvp skills as every time you come to scrim the servers are down lol i also didnt lead against sc so i didnt see you. I assume you are good with a 1.8 kd but i don't know much more sorry. :)

You seem really nice, i don't think i have ever spoken to you on ts before but i hope we can soon. You are really good at defending from what i have seen and decent at pvp i think your rather approachable and pretty chill about life. We should defend some time i would enjoy that.
