Hi!<br>I'm a player from OCN, and I know I have trolled excessively and been a huge annoyance to many on this server. Firstly, I'd like to apologize for doing so. It wasn't very funny to instigate heated arguments and worsen the situation between OCN and Avicus. I should have also stood up for you guys when Howsie was hacked and when OCN players were bullying your community.<br><br>Anyway, hi! I'm moving in a bit into Avicus, hopefully I can gain some interest and let this be 1 of my 5 servers in my server list.<br><br>

Hi guys, my brother,treehugginghippy, was banned from Avicus a while back for Advertising and vulgar language and bad sportsmanship. He wants to apologize for what he did and I do miss playing with him on Nebula. It hasn't been the same since treehugginghippy was banned. I remember all the fun times we used to have together on Nebula. Bashing bad guys, mash the monuments, the Walls, Capture the Hill, and Elimination. He said that it was his favorite server of all time! He loved it so much. But he got so excited that he became carried away with Avicus. He hopes you can forgive him so he can get back in the game. Thank you. I hope this reaches the Staff of Avicus. If you do accept.&nbsp;Please do /unban treehugginghippy. And Id be happy. Thank you again.<br>

There was a large issue with some OCN regulars hacking Howsie's account, and giving ranks to OCN staff members and regulars without their knowledge or consent.<br>
