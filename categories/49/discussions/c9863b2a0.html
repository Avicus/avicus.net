I guess I should probably make another one of these, I made a long time ago like 2-3 years back on McZone but now I can't recognize any familiar names.<br><br>IGN: Nubbies231, there's this corny British TV show on Netflix, I can't remember the name and it's basically a rip-off of that movie where the cute little rabbit like creatures turn deadly at the night time. Anyway these creatures were called Nubbies, pronounced Nub-ees, but just call me Nubs or Nate.<br><br>Hobbies: Football, Rugby, Hockey, Weight Lifting, and Gaming.<br><br>I turned 17 in May, currently heading into my 12th year of High School. From Sackville, Nova Scotia in Canada. 6'3, weighing around 250 (Offensive Lineman for my High School). Decently big and I'll post a photo of me at a Halloween Party last year dressed as a Sailor (I was absolutely blasted at this Party so I look a bit odd, but whatever yolo.)<br><br>Favorite Movie: Hoot<br>Favorite Series: Band of Brothers<br><br>Picture: <a title="Link: https://gyazo.com/921a6e752307d85b37cb4cff8724ca20" href="https://gyazo.com/921a6e752307d85b37cb4cff8724ca20">https://gyazo.com/921a6e752307d85b37cb4cff8724ca20</a> the Theme of the <br>Party was Ocean/Water and the only thing I had was this Sailor shirt of a boat going across the water. No idea where I got it from but I still have it to do this day.<br><br>For any other Weight Lifting Fanatics:<br>Deadlift: 400 (I should be able to 500 but I'm not there yet)<br>Squat: 300<br>Bench: 250 (ewh)<br>Curl: 100<br><br>I also have tons of Awkward/Funny/True stories because my life is just like that, if you'll like to hear some just ask!<br><br>Feel free to ask me questions :)
