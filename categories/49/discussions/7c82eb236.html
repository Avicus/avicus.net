Contrary to LFT's thread, the newest senior is technically me. ;) Anyways, I'm a little late, but may as well do one anyways, right? Ask me anything!

A few years back. we were actually good friends and I remember playing a&nbsp;<i>lot</i> with you, and so much to the point where you even taught me some good rushing tips. I went from getting about 1-2 monuments a day to 14-21 whenever I played with you, and it was some of the most fun I had back then. I believe the last time we really had some kind of friendship was before you were promoted to junior, and I called you an elf since you'd always be sending in/calling me on to deal with rulebreakers. Nowadays, I sort of get the feeling you don't like talking to me anymore which kind of bums me out, but I'm alright with it I guess. You've gotten a bit more toxic throughout the months, but it's kind of died down now I think. I also really like how you're able to complete maps that would take me months to build in 1 day, haha.

tbh, I don't really "build maps in a day". I just build the shell of a map and post it on the forums for players to give opinions and make improvements based on those feedback. xd

Why did you decide to become a Mod?
</blockquote>
</div>
At the time, staff applications were some of the biggest hype fests around. I wanted to join in, because I thought it'd be fun and the idea of moderating a server I had played on for so long and grown to love came as an amazing idea. It took me three applications and two interviews to pass, and I''m still here to this day, mainly because I want to stick with the network for as long as I can.

I hardly really know you to be honest, and most of what I remember is from when you were sheamus4414, and you were mostly just a dude I saw around a lot who'd throw out some immature comments here and there. I didn't see anythig spectacular from you as a senior or mod except for your positive attitude, which most staff should have anyways. The whole "memes" gimmick is really annoying and cringeworthy in my opinion, but that's just me, I guess. As an Admin, I think since most of the community likes you you have the potential to help the server if you work hard.

A few months back where you did the whole "staying up super late to moderate" (hey, that rhymes!) thing, I found it a little scary that you were sacrificing so many hours of sleep for Minecraft. I've also noticed you've changed a lot whole from when you were mod a few months back, and I personally strongly dislike that. It began to look like you were trying to change a mass of things that made you you just to get a promotion. I personally like the old shadowolf a bit more than now, although you have your moments where your former self shines through the clouds. I also find the "meme" gimmick of you and Cammy a little cringeworthy, but I think that's just me. Other than that, you're a moderator that stands out to me and I would definitely support you "loosening-up" a little. Sorry if this was a bit blunt. :&gt;

I don't really know you too well, but I enjoy fighting you ingame since it seems like we're mostly on the same level (although, you're probably better at sword than I am).

Player: Avicus wise, I think we're on par with each other. Competitive wise, your better at pot and UHC (which I am REALLY bad at), but I think I'm a little better at soup. ;)<br><br>Person: You have rare moments where you're actually a pretty good person to talk to, not to be rude. You're usually pretty rude and/or immature.
