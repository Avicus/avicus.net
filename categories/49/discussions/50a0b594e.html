<b><i><u>~~ I have no idea which Topic this would go on! ~~<br><br></u></i><i></i></b><i></i>It's hard to believe I was banned 3 years ago by BlueberryMuffin7 who has not been on in 2 years. I'm actually a little sad. Hopefully my appeal will work.<i><u><br></u></i>

I see you were banned for advertising, so in my opinion they'll accept it :)

Little heads up. Firstly, Welcome back to the Avicus Network!<br><br>Appeals usually work like this. Normally due to previous experience you need to wait:<br><br><ul><li>1+ months if banned for "Abusing other players/Staff abuse/Toxicity".</li><li>4+ months if banned for advertising.</li><li>6+ months if banned for "Hacking".</li><li>9+ &nbsp;months if banned for one of the above and then "Ban Evading"</li></ul><b>Have I missed any? Just hmu with a reply or mods can edit this and make it more accurate.</b>

I don't think anyone has ever been permanently banned before for Team Spleefs but it would sure be an interesting ban.

Seeing as I didn't bring up minimods (Non-Staff acting like a mod) once in the other thread probably shows that they are not "sweaty". Also, you should probably get a life instead of replying to me on 3 different topics stating how much I hate minimods when that isn't true at all.<br><br>Let's get back on topic shall we?<br><br>Welcome back to Avicus again <img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/a43ec13fb0dc48e783e5ac9bf54d6f66?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/Cow_Man06.html" style="color: none">Cow_Man06</a>
