I am sorry for the behavior that I treated you before, but since I am unbanned I started to feel like a new player to be back on the server. And I get to start a new life playing mini games on the servers, and I want to fun with you guys, so we can hangout together and have lots of time. For now on I am no longer toxic person to you guys and I promise I won't say any miserable things to you. I am now a clean state person.
