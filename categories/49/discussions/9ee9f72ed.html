My name is Josh. Playing Minecraft since 2011, Avicus since 2012. My original username was macissad, and overall I just want to chill. I honestly think worrying takes up too much time, so who needs it. I now refuse to play minecraft without ts and skype open, because I don't play minecraft without talking to people, and never will. I like getting to meet people and hearing their stories. The players here on Avicus are chill, so while you're here, try to experience everyone as much as you can.

Called LightCraft, and I got mod which was easiest to work with because hacking wasn't really around. All we did was stop rude players, spammers, beggers, etc. It was really cool.
