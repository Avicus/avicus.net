Good mod. I think you should give your opinion more and become more of a leader.<br>shit internet<br>Same as it was 3 months ago. A few good seniors, a few outstanding mods, who aren't senior for whatever reason when they should be. A few good leaders in the staff team. People are too scared to voice their opinion.

Nothing between tournaments really. We have a monthly meeting usually, we normally know the gamemode before the next. For example we know the gamemode for the next 2/3 tournaments. &nbsp;We just wait for the devs and permission and a good time.<br><br>I've only heard bad things about you, I never remember anything bad personally. I know you originally came from ocn like me but you never told me what name you used.

No idea how you're still banned. I thought you cheated from one of your videos, but it's not enough evidence at all. Never really spoke to you either, but if you were legit you were very good.

Referee because they haven't had to do anything<br>Banning someone known<br>TOC<br>At what point? Now probably Lego Budah Raging but there isn't really a lot of competition as noone plays. A year ago though I'd say me kiwi and Loo.<br>Was always going to happen, mods kept complaining. Pisses me off how I get kicked because I can't be asked to switch versions and launch minecraft.<br>It will never actually die, just have 10 players on it like now.<br>PieZ<br>you<br>You've been tryharding for senior for a while now, and you will get it soon. You're a pretty good moderator - active, decent hack detection and you're not always afraid to give your opinon.

Well, when you were mod you became&nbsp;<b>very</b> defensive whenever someone criticised you or your opinions.

I'm taking it you're talking about my video -<br><br>idk, i'd just finished coding that and I was bored and bdf were scrimming and they were my team so i played and tested and I was dumb enough to record it. The game against street sharks I didn't upload they still thought I was hacking and they were right. It fucked me over in the long run, still done fuck all in OCN tournies and would've came 5th in that one :c. It was my fault so w/e

You're nice and chill you can be a bit repetitive with memes sometimes. You've improved a lot at pvp, I was never on a team with you so I've never thought you were so good at offence like public players circle jerk you x.x<br><br>i saw like one video on kohi which was fishy but you live in dubai anything is possible

You've improved a lot individually, your transition into OCN has helped that. You were the best player on the server around league time. First 2 tournaments though noone in Apollo really stood out in individual skill, everyone except ppb and bc were kinda shit tbh. I've never thought you cheated, cant say the same for ex teammates mine x)))).<br><br>You're chill too

You always used to take shit serious, but you've improved a lot on that recently. You originally improved out of nowhere when I got you in BC, and you've only really improved ever since. I don't really see you as much of a leader, but you could be good as one, not my place to tell.
