nigr: ur stupid<br>player: you're extremely underrated to be honest and can play really well in scrims and tournaments. glad we got to talk a lot on ts as you're probably one of my best buds on the server right now and I love coming on to ts and fucking with you for the whole day, you're a really funny and chill guy to talk to, especially when you smash your keyboard or throw somethig across the room !

you're a good defender and actually pretty chill and nice to talk to. Before when you were in apollo i had a much different view on you and it's changed recently. I haven't actually spoken to you on a personal level but you are pretty good in scrims and tourneys too (sorry don't have much lol)

you're a really funny, chill, and memey person and I love talking to you on ts, even tho we've only been actively speaking for a short while we've built a lot of memes and memories together (no homo). you're pretty good in scrims and can really act mature when needed. come back from vaca soon so i can talk to u again :c<br><br>sure<br><br>touch my tralala

you are very easily approachable and friendly to everyone. i never really knew you since you trialed for apollo and glad that i could talk to you in ts/ ingame at that time. in scrims you don't make very good choices most of the time and lack some gamesense, but that will just take time since i don't think you have played scrims/tourneys a lot

i don't speak to you a lot but in the past 2 months you've been an extremely funny and nice guy to be around. in scrims you are a tank and can take lots of fights with people and are pretty underrated. your humor is&nbsp;<b>questionable</b> but hey who cares lol. your laugh is also retarded i dONT UNDERSTAND HOW YOU DO THAT

Hello, Xuph. you are probably my best friend on the server right now and i like almost every day i spend in ts with you. your humor and taste in music is similar to mine and your memes are pretty top notch!!!!!! you're also an extremely well-rounded player and consistent in everything, and you underrate yourself now as well. &nbsp;sometimes in scrims we both argue and mess up comms but its honeslty just something to work on. i honestly think you subscriptor off too much in scrims tho :c<br><br>ur special white man born from the top of a white person only mountain and ascended down to the surface with your minecraft team apollo of black colored organisms

im not sure if you are memeing or not, but lots of people make fun of you because you are literally completely oblivious to memes or sarcasm to be honest. if it's not a meme sorry but i honestly can't tell. never actually really spoken to you but sometimes you are attention seeking and annoying sometimes not.<br><br>yea

you're probs one of the best in apollo even if you're rusty. your pvp is amazing and if you played more we could be really good because you are also good at leading too. as a person you're an extremely old friend and i really wish you came on ts more. i also am grateful that you spoke to me before i joined apollo and gave the leaders and me the idea of getting me in the team.
