I will probably not be playing here anymore soon.&nbsp;<br><br>You seem like a nice guy overal.

I cant believe im saying this but my favorite server. Overal the idea of this gamemode fits me so well, and the strategies in it (relating to nebula). This server brought so much joy into my life, and im pretty sure im the person with the most playtime overal unfortunately. (6 months playtime overal on all accounts. its crazy thinking i spent a WHOLE FUCKING HALF A YEAR OF MY LIFE and im only 14, playing on a single minecraft server). i put lots of time into this server and been here all along without taking a leave one time, through its ups and downs. im sad that the staff team is so shit and run by pussydon, especially the mapdev team is so bad and its sad to me since if it was good id happily put lots of time into making it good. Generally this server has gone down lots but tbh you cant blame anything, superior servers like hypixel simply took the space.<br><br>Im gonna assume you meant funny person in general and not a guy that actually creates memes. there are some very funny people that i know here that make me laugh a lot and im thankful for it like bloodoh, zeus, budah, and seuth.

Havent fought you enough so ill give a rough rating of 6.5/10 overal bow and sword.<br><br>Really annoying most of the time. I feel you need to grow up and not try to be somebody else basically mean my tip is be yourself. I played that HCF server once with you and you proved me kind of wrong you are not that annoying it was nice and fun.&nbsp;<br><br>Its organisation of everything, empty promises, and development most of it. Whether its code or maps. It needs more staff that are willing to put lots of time into the network and not throw tasks at eachother like it currently the situation is.<br><br>Right now its around the 6/10 gameplay enjoyment

I dont know about my opinion on you.<br>Youre nice and all, especially i see you being nice to me and i appreciate that. We are pretty good friends as of now, and im happy that we are and i enjoy talking to you in ts when given the opportunity.&nbsp;<br>That comes along with all the hackusations coming at you. to be completely honest from fighting you, you are very very sketchy but personally its hard for me to believe that a person im friends with is hacking therefore my opinion will be biased so ill stay outta this one.<br><br>Dont know about best all round. there are some really good people at everything they do. in avicus and apollo itd be lego since he can defend rush sky mid front back under top side unside fold unfold and spectate, all positions.&nbsp;<br><br>sure

Oh that is gonna be very long. i could write a whole essay for school describing how much i love you but hey im no gay so lets skip that part. Youre the best all round player on this server, you can do any position and do it well. youre leading so charmfully and so calmly i love it very so much. i love building with you on badlion youre very creative and working with you has always been a pleasure. im proud of you growing as a youtube, and i feel proud that i made you start editing with vegas and having decent renders unlike your previous movie maker xd. Youre a great person in general i LOVE talking to you and stop saying cba when you are asked to ts :(<br><br>Performance wise not gonna lie it'd be either Bloodoh or Eteh. lately theyre really inactive / dont perform well owait et is banned anyways ha ha !<br><br>Seuth and ryan.&nbsp;<br><br>??? in soccer? politics? what u mean

Yes i do<br><br>They are so unorganized. there are not enough people willing to help and shit. well basically once you are pretty much only one along with 2 others that put effort, they "take a ride" on that if u know what i mean and you basically become their bitches and they keep throwing responsibilities and tasks at you meanwhile of course they are very busy yeah fuck that well anyways it was pretty unorganized, ran by people who have no clue how to run something properly and not enough people putting effort<br><br>Apple or strawberry

Very longtime friend known you for ages. we both used to be the apollo memes at the time but look at us now banging as players ;)) Im really impressed of the skill level you achieve seeing as you play on a laptop, thinking youre around my level if not higher on a laptop i imagine how good you could be with a decent PC. just like lego, happy i got u budah lego seuth all of ya into vegas. you put effort into youtube will hopefully pay off soon, its hard to grow in numbers off a server like this. Youre good with bow and sword and you are calm. sometimes you annoy me by being really stubborn and not being able to listen to somebodys opinion, feeling as your goal now is to prove youre right and fuck everything else. i hope i dont offend i just sincerely hope you try to work on it :d

You were always nice to me and i appreciate it. you seem to comment on lots of my videos and its nice to see as i read all comments aha. Also youre a nice guy in general. Sometimes you can be little immature and such but everybody is so hey thats fine. As a player youre not too bad with the pvp though your defenses are not good in my opinion. you overdo them so very fucking much to the point where you waste your time simply and for nothing. you should try to go for effecient defenses that require less time and not overdo them so much. remember defense is 50/50 about the defense itself and the guy standing on it so remember to be aware and not get in pressure when calling out or being rushed.<br><br>avicus.net/staff, but if i had to chose one then daddy pussydon must go

Nice guy overal. seen you on the build server lots of times. You never tryharded and ur one of the most constant mods that have been mods for long time its good<br>Back in the day i didnt talk to u so i cant tell<br>I barely see you on ts so i never had conversation with you. You also spectated me for hacks so many times on all my alts and banned me once or twice but that doesnt matter haha were already over it i hope.<br><br>In real life im really nice and quiet, dont like to make lots of noise and stuff. im also acting very smart irl unlike in minecraft where i fuck around and give fuck all about stuff. in minecraft im not serious most of the time. i can be a dick sometimes. im also a very different person than i look once you get to know me, all people that know me well could approve. im really strubborn and sometimes i would pretend that my opinion is still right even if i see its wrong cause sometimes i dont have the balls to admit that im wrong. though most times i stand up and say what i want. i also disagree with people on lots of stuff even if theryre my friends. there are the people that would support their friends when they know theyre wrong im not one of those id argue with my closest friends if i think theyre wrong. i will always stand up and say what i think i hate being quiet when it becomes to expressing opinion.<br><br>My acts sometimes are taken without lots of thoughts. id like to put more thought into my actions sometimes.<br><br>Chocolate
