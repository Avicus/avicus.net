Obs is a amazing recording software (better than fraps) and is free. If you have to go to ocn and there head photos update for sure. Movie maker on windows is okayish but if we want a good you you have to pay(or crack it) I suggest the latest Sony Vegas. I don't really have much suggestions for a good microphone but overall if you enjoy what you are doing your videos will be great.

You can just google your Minecraft name in google images, it should come up with your most recent skin.

Get Camtasia Studio.. :3<br>It comes with a 30-day free trial and is really actually a lot of fun to edit your videos with. It's simple, straight-forward, and quite easy to get the hang of. I've never tried Sony Vegas because Camtasia is so dang good :D

Start with Windows Movie Maker so you get into the habit of editing, then use a pro program like SV.
