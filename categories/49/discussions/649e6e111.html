So, I've been on this server for more than enough time (2 years +) and finally decided to make a intro! I recently got CS:GO and absolutely love it. But that was taking a ton of time out of spending time and having a great time on TS. After a hard decision I decided to get back into Avicus :D( I still play csgo once a day at least) you'll see me on Avicus and on ts most of the day.I'm currently on the team liquidators :D And 1v1ing new and old people everyday! I also will start to reupload to my new channel!<br>(Finally got a 720-1080p recorder!) Also, if you have any questions, Ask!<br><br>Birdy<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>And, I don't know why I'm saying this but I'm a going to a water park tomorrow :D

Learned when I was a baby chick, got banned off a ton of mc servers when I was legitly playin, got mad so so smoked weed everyday, got high. Never got low. Started to get a friend on ts named mhanif which translates to Highlife420 and really started loving him. We smoked every day. Then we started playing Minecraft and got really into PvP. We learned how to 420 block and it was all ogre then. Oh, then we when to minecon to get a sweet a$$ cape becuz were just that good!!!1!1 we then were intoduced to Avicus, we became gods becuz we could. Then this random guy mhanif knows name shah which translates to 3blockgod wanted to 1v1 me and I'm like okieee, I then got my trackpad ready on my chromebook and started 3 blocking the 3blockgod!!!!!!!!!!! Then when we grew up nobody played Avicus much anymore, we all moved to a great server called mineplex! Me and mhanif played so much we got donator+++++++++++++++++++++++++++69+++ so we could get mod but then we didn't make it!!!!!!!! So we ddosed the god of mc captain sparkles and he said okokok u guys look based we will give u guys owner! We then made millions of dollars not by the ranks of mineplex, but just keylogging everybody on the server and selling their account. When nobody played mc anymore we moved to a MLG game named roblox which me then learned how to PvP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Then we decided we were to good and moved to cod and quickscoped everybody and made a YouTube channel named FaZe clan. And that's where we are today :) (this took like 45 minute cuz of all the swagness!!!!)<br><br>@Pingieee its indoor
