The ayy lmao aliens gave me a power. That power was not to be abused, but to lay the truth. The truth was wrapped upon several stars and ribbons, but sometimes you have to bring it out and show the world what really happens, even if you get abducted. The ayy lmao aliens are my love and I accept them as my god, praying to them every day and every night. Sometimes, they reward me with little gifts like these, and you know what I do? I bring them out. I unwrap the ribbon, and bring it out, like one should. Though they gift me things, they still know the risk. The ayy lmao aliens gave me a power. But it is up to me to use it wisely.<br><br>I found the screenshot in the spaceship the aliens were controlling.
