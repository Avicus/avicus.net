Pretty chill guy to talk to, and you aren't as KJ as you were before :)<br><br>Singapore is a great country to visit, even though i only stayed there for a week still enough to go around and see/visit spots like Universal Studios, Night Safari, Singapore Flyer and Formula 1 Track, Gardens by the Bay, The Merlion, River Safari/Singapore Zoo, etc. Also got to eat some pretty good food there as well and im impressed with how clean and disciplined the whole country is :) &lt;3 would definitely want to visit again in the future

HELL YES!!! THE FOOD, CULTURE, PLACES, ANIME, EVERYTHING!<br><br>Everything that happened in our tour/tour group<br><br><b>Night 1</b> - Landed in Kansai Intl. Airport, Osaka and ate a full on bento and went walking around near my hotel and even went in local convenience stores like Lawson<br><br><b>Day 1 </b>- Universal Studios Japan, then went out eating in a shabu restaurant at night<br><br><b>Day 2</b> - Went around the Kyoto, Kobe, and Osaka Prefectures and visited a couple buddhist temple, fed dears, saw the ever so great and probably one of the best Anime Studios in Japan, KyoAni (Kyoto Animation)(also some of the students there with their japanese school uniforms), and ate in one of Kyoto's traditionally known restaurants and tried some of its best japanese sweets, then went shopping around Osaka's city districts at night and went in a Don Ki Ho Te Market and had a try at some japanese sweets<br><br><b>Day 3&nbsp;</b>- Left Osaka for Hakone via Bullet Train and saw a glimpse of Mt. Fuji from the Bullet Train and also passing through Nagoya, arrived at Hakone and did some on tour activities in the bus while on our way to a Outlet store (such as learning Kanji, singing some j-music like the one that many of us Filipinos knew back in the day, Voltes V Opening Theme) then had lunch at Lake Ashi, took a ride across Lake Ashi and even took a ride on the Hakone Ropeway to the top of Mt. Hakone, where we got a view of Mt. Fuji from the top, after heading back down we headed straight to one of the Onsen Bath Hotel which was located infront of the bay, where we slept in a Washitsu (traditional japanese room) and ate in probably one of the best mix of japanese and western buffet, and immediately after went to the Onsen Bath Hot Springs in the hotel and played some Ping Pong after (I did ok-ish)<br><br><b>Day 4&nbsp;</b>- We left the hotel and began our long roadtrip to Tokyo, we 1st stopped by the Sakura Tree Farm, took some pictures, right after we continued the roadtrip and we got to experience the beauty of nature around the Kanagawa prefectures as we passed through some of the small towns located through the valleys and forests, then we stopped over at a top of the mountainous area of Atsugi and took more pictures w/ a view of Mt. Fuji and saw Yokohama and Tokyo Bay and abit of Chiba over the horizon view. After a long roadtrip and traffic through one of the highways linking to Tokyo, we finally entered the Shibuya District in Tokyo then ended up at our Hotel in the Shinjuku District, where we had a mix of Mediterranean and Modern Japanese dinner, then went out to visit some of the tourists spots such as Tokyo Skytree where we got a panoramic view of the entirety of Tokyo, including the Tokyo Tower, the Chiyoda Ward, Tokyo Bay, Rainbow Bridge and even just abit Mt. Fuji, right after we headed back to the hotel, i watched some anime right after just to chill before i went to sleep.<br><br>[Anime(s) I watched at the time of the trip: Kokoro Connect, GATE: Jieitai Kanochi Nite, Hai to Gensou no Grimgar, Nagi no Asukara, Gakusen Toshi Asterisk, Koutetsujo no Kabaneri]<br><br><b>Day 5</b> - Visited the Chiyoda Ward and took some pictures near the temple by the gate, drove over Tokyo Bay through the Rainbow Bridge, then went to Disney Sea Japan, then at night we went around the Shinjuku shopping districts, went to a electronics store and saw some great peripherals for gaming, and even got a try on playing on one of the store's gaming setups which included a DXRacer Gaming Chair, Logitech G810 Gaming Keyboard, Steelseries Sensei Gaming Mouse w/ Mousepad [CSGO was the game that was on it when i played for abit]<br><br><b>Day 6</b> - Went to Chiba and did some strauberry picking/eating, then we visited a Shinto shrine, got to see some shrine maidens and even made a wish and prayer (we were taught how to do the wish/prayer) then took some pictures even at the Torii gate of the shrine, then had lunch at a japanese family restaurant (Teppanyaki, which means Iron Plate, where we grab as much food as we want at the buffet stand or tray station then cook it at the iron grill which is in the middle of the table where you sit) where i pretty much i guess horded most of the food and yakiniku (grilled meat) and ofcourse had some ramen which i had to cook on my own at the tray station. Right after we stopped by a couple more outlet stores then got back to Tokyo and the tour group went last minute shopping for afew hours (on the way back i saw the apartment building which was used in the designing of Shu's Apartment from the Anime; Guilty Crown), some of the group stayed around GInza, and the rest went to Akihabara (and obviously i went with the latter :P), rode the Tokyo Metro/ Toei Subway all the way to Akihabara, immediately took pictures, went shopping for merchandise like Posters, Pins, Minifigures, and even a Attack on Titan T-Shirt, etc. had dinner at a McDonalds that had a multilevel restaurant setting w/ elevator, then headed for the Airport where we had our goodbyes with everyone in the tour group and departed for Manila, Philippines right after.<br><br>Also i was able to communicate and interact with some of the locals around the places we went to since i've been learning some Katakana and Hiragana for awhile now, though the language barrier was really on another level but both sides were still able to understand each other, considering i know most of the basics around nihongo.<br><br>the jetlag wasnt as bad but damn taking hot showers every single night felt good, except when i stay in the tub for way too long then begin to feel drained af xD
