Hello there Avicadians, so yesterday I got promoted to Senior Moderator and it's been 7 months since I got promoted to Junior Moderator. The last time I made an AMA was a long time ago so I wanted to do one now if you have some questions that you wanted to ask me before. (I'm not copying anyone :v)<br><br><b>Introduction</b>:<br>My name is Mario (don't make that joke ERIC) and I'm 15 years old. I joined into Avicus a long time ago (probably 1 year ago, can't remember now) and I'm really active on this server since I joined. I got promoted to Junior Moderator on September 2 and yesterday I got promoted to Senior Moderator.<br>I'm from Mexico and viva mexico.<br><br><b>Some usernames:</b><br><ul><li>Brokennz (kutirik)</li><li>AbusiveUser (I lost this account :/)</li><li>Passively</li></ul><br>I will try to be 100% honest, so this is a <b>brutal honest AMA&nbsp;</b>(I won't roast unless you want to). Also, if you see a question that has been answered before, don't ask the same question because I will not be answering those questions.<br><br>:)

Hello, so I can't give you a proper opinion on you because I don't know you that well but from what I could see from you, you seems mature and a little bit shy. As a Moderator you are good but I have to say your skills are weird, as a mentor you are good but I need to see more closely how you work with the Junior Mods.<br><br>Oh yeah, I forgot you are a Map Developer, so what I have to say it's that you are kinda good. I haven't seen any map from you in a while but atleast you are active making decision for the team.<br>I hope we can talk more often :)
