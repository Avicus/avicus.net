Hey, I'm name is Pedro (Obviously) I'm from Portugal and I'm 14 years old. I used to be a frequent members and I was one of the first joining of the Overcast Network. I was a kid and immature and I got banned for using BSM back in 1.6. (That was more than 1 year ago) I recently joined this community because it's very alike and it seems friendly :)<br><br>I'll see you guys ingame, good bye.<br><br>Also, Ask me anything.

Hey there, and welcome to the forums! Here's a couple things you should know if you don't already :)<br><br>Avicus currently has three different donator ranks. Gold, Emerald, and Diamond. Make sure you review the rules, which can be found here <a href="http://avicus.net/rules" rel="nofollow">http://avicus.net/rules</a>. Currently Avicus has Nebula, Nexus, CTH, Avicade, Walls and Elimination for minigames.<br><br>Staff applications are currently&nbsp;open! <br>To apply you can create a new discussion in the "Staff Applications" section by clicking "New Discussion" at the top right. Please use&nbsp;the format found on this thread <a href="http://avicus.net/forums/ef08bacb4" rel="nofollow">http://avicus.net/forums/ef08bacb4</a>&nbsp;Once you have submitted your application you should wait for a response.<br>If accepted, you then have to have a TeamSpeak interview, where you are asked various questions by the senior staff to see if you qualify for Moderator. If your interview is up to standards or good, you will be promoted to Jr Moderator and will be put on trial for approximately a month. If you perform excellence in Moderating over the month, you will be promoted to Moderator. If not, you will be demoted. <br><br>If you wish to create a map for the server make sure that you have it in a void world and that it is unique! You can upload your completed map to the forums under the "Map Releases" section with a download to the map, pictures of the map and a YAML. You can visit the Avicus YAML docs to learn all about how to create YAML's!<br>(<a href="http://docs.avicus.net/" rel="nofollow">http://docs.avicus.net/</a>)<br><br>If you have further questions, don't hesitate to ask anyone, and I hope you have a wonderful time on the server and the forums :) Hope this helped!<br><br><b>AMA</b>:<br>- What is your favourite type of cookie?<br>- What sports do you like?<br>- Muffin or Cookie?<br>- Pepsi or Coke?<br>- Pop or Soda?<br>- Whats your favourite colour?

Welcome! The better community is in the forums, usually the in-game community isn't a true representation of the server community. I play OCN a bit, not too much though :P .&nbsp;<br><br>If you're looking for a team to play on, there's the team section off to the side near the bottom of the categories. A lot of OCN players tend to come over to Avi and want to play on a team, so I figured I'd put that out there.

After the update, coming soon there will be a tourney some time<br><br>for now we're just doing scrims. If you know the good players it's easy to evaluate the team ofc. Learn who's good and who's not on the server if looking for a team. If you find a legit good player ask them who's good. You'll eventually get a good answer
