Well I think few people thought you were hacking (idk were you) but that was a while back. When you were tryouting for Dronken I was surprised because you actually did good.After steyn denied you were still supporting us and we let you sub every time we needed you. After we disbanded I joined Mutilation and you were with me.I remember when banjo had to go and you were kinda leading us and I didn't liked it tbh.You were really bossy which I didn't liked at all.You're nice person to talk with and good at melee.ily ambi

You:Your pvp skills are just amazing and bow is decent. You're the kind of person that can carry the team when its needed. As a person I love your dutch accent and your sense of humor.... Definitively a person to talk with.<br><br>Alfie:Skilled player for 1v1s.He has no idea how to play DTC/M which isn't that bad. He's like the elo tryhard(ily Alfie)guy.He's a e-Girl maniac and chill person to talk with..

Well at the beginning I thought Avicus is copying OCN because the server were kinda the same.After few months I realised that Avicus have less toxic players and pretty much everyone is kind to each other(I think so).On competitive scene Avicus isn't that bad as I thought so.<br>OCN is smiliar to Avicus but it has few things good and bad things aswell...<br><br>Sorry for late comment and for short answer.

One of my best friends on avicus.I met you like 2 months ago and when I first time talked to you in Dawson's ts you were really rude and weird af...I remember when you were fighting with Dawson's cousin and then you were playing Osama song and singing it at the same time...I also recorded it lol.But over a time I talked to you more and more and I confirmed my thoughts on you.You can be rude sometimes but in a good and funny way,best memer and best friend.I really do enjoy talking to you Eric and I hope we can stay friend after you leave Cronus.As a player you're really good at melee and decent at bow,I dont know your cannoning/icarusing skills but icarusing may be your type of game.I love you Eric &lt;3

Already said opinions.Scroll up or on 1st page.Only think I'll add is that I like you more now ;)<br><br>Your pvp isnt bad at all. Your melee is really good and bow is decent.Imma fight you on kohi one day<br><br>Well when it all started it was really good.I met dualzz and other people. It was basically dutch based team at beggining.After we started to add all dutch players and trial other players.We weren't that experienced at DTC/M but for CTW and TDM we were pretty decent.We had good melee players and few bow heavy.Most of the time we were scrimming opus,drops or other Spanish teams. We were getting better at CTW a lot.Then tourney started and we were practicing a lot for it.It was our first tourney as a team and we did pretty well. We got like 17th place.Then after few people left and steyn decided to disband and join opus... Pretty much it I guess so

One of the first people I met on avic ts.You're extremely helpful in game and in ts.You don't talk always idk why,but when you talk you're pretty chill.As a player you're good at melee and I don't really know your bow skills.You're taking 1v1s pretty easily tbh. Also you're a great friend :)
