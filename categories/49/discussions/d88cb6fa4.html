literally retard, i love u so much. ur a really funny person and i was rly the only person with this type of humour for a long time and im really happy u have the same type of stuff i laugh from and we get to talk quite a lot when im on since ur very active. i think ur a cool and funny person and im happy were friends<br>pvp wise ur uh-oh to me, although you can outpvp me like half the time still for some reason you havent proven me youre a good player over the course of your time in apollo, ive always felt kind of unconfident in you when being put on the same side or position with you for example, and i cant really explain the reasoning for it. i think its mostly your own self confidence you dont display, and if you plan on improving as a player in the future then i really advice u will be more confident and show it.&nbsp;<br><br>tldr i fukin love u mech

hey thank you<br><br>i dont know, im not playing minecraft as much as i used to last year. im focusing more on school, but when i do get the time to play i either play something fun on minecraft or overwatch.<br><br>a yearly school trip which will take place at the end of january. its really fun each year fukin around with ur friends and such. also im excited about building a computer for my cousin in february, should be fun.<br><br>nothing, i dont know where they are, i think half the downloads are lost unfortunately. i dont really care about most of them :(<br><br>youre a cool person overall. not gonna lie, u can be very fukin annoying sometimes with ur fish shit and whatever. i think that its cool that u always say your opinion and dont agree for nothing, you never sucked up to the rest of the mapdev team when i got to be mapdev around the time you were. i think youre a talented builder, your aesthetics are cool however i think you need to be a lot more creative of thinking how a map will play, most of your maps are really generic. you can look at a map like "the toys" and say "wtf eric is retard this is a unique map", and that will look right by the look, but still most map builders are kind of set on the template of horizontal map with objectives at the back and such. you need to think outside these templates that you are so very used to, and think like a player when building a map, how you would play it if you were doing it. overal nice person i like you :)

owell<br><br>i used to really dislike you, like very very much. u were, and still are, but a little bit less, god bless (that rhymes!), very cocky craftman. just like raging said in his ama, i feel like u always thought you were much better than you actually were. and then in like 1 scrim u just suddenly became a lot better but i do not think you are hacking, and your ban back then was bullshit, even though i disliked you back then.<br>now, i couldnt be asked to change my opinion on you by myself, but from playing and subbing for teams you played for i did change my opinion on you overtime. you are still quite immature, you still are annoying, but youre a nice person and it is fun to talk to you. you can take stuff seriously when needed. however, a tip would be to stop "OH MY GODDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD" everytime you lose a minecraft life, it is kind of ruining the comms for any team you play for, and i hope you take this as a tip to improve<br>other than this youre quite a nice builder, try to think creative, because u do have potential

one of my best friends over time. the amount of time youve stuck on this server is insane, you are the perfect example for how a staff member should be - youre very serious when needed, you think of shit before doing, you were not a fukin robot when everyone was, and you understood with hacks and stuff. as a person i love u so very much, we both now are a lot less active than we used to be and i miss talking to you for so long and having fun. :(<br><br>smashed potatoes with chicken<br><br>x factor israel XD&nbsp;<br>and family guy I LOVE IT&nbsp;<br><br>doggy style, otherwise in minecraft frontline and sky

Hey luis, youre a nice person and youre always so serious in scrims and like if i were to lead a team and i were to give an example of a behaviour and comms i want to see in a scrim, youre the perfect example. i dont think the sword is your valuable side though since you dont excel in that as much as you do in bow. youre a reliable and consistent player and i love being put on the same side as you because i feel more confident then. i think the only thing preventing me from properly comming with you was your mic but as far as i know you got a new one so should be good now. hopefully we stay in touch after this server is gone<br><br>A dream roster for me would definitely exist from players I am part of and that are my friends, people i enjoy playing with and not necessarily are 10 best players in the craft or the 10 that i think that have the best chance to win a match, so<br><br>- Eric<br>- Lego<br>- Budah<br>- Raging<br>- Seuth<br>- Peachy<br>- Iron<br>- Zeus<br>- Zero<br>- Spooks

hello :) i used to dislike you back in the days of cronus - you were always a nice person but you were a bit kindddd of cocky by that you thought what you did was always best - and in most cases it wasnt due to lack of experience (speaking of defenses mainly) and you didnt really take tips. since then youve&nbsp;<u><i>evolved</i></u> and now you take criticism well and youre a good defender. your comms are your weakest point, you get too excited while someone is pushing you. in my opionion, the perfect defender is to always consistently win 1v1s against rushers, and you dont necessairy need to be good in pvp, you need to be able to delay them using what you build, and i dont think you really get that because you try to pvp the people who rush you (at least from what ive seen in badlion scrims). to be completely honest with you, if i were to lead a team, i wouldnt put you into any roster other than ctw (a team with decent pvpers). youre not confident in yourself niether consistent, and when we play koths etc you seem to lose pushes most of the time, and that reflects by me feeling unconfident when being put on the same side as you. i really hope you prove me at least wrong. i dont think you lack the actual skill, you just need to work on your decision making and confidence really.<br>other than this as i said youve always been a nice person other than a really small bit where you were toxic but haha everyone is. so i really appreciate you being so nice and cool over all this time and you are definitely improving i hope you take my tips and get better.<br><br>i dont have any short term goals like certain events at the moment, its more of like right now i build for Badlion and Zildith so for the long term i hope both of these servers succeed and i take part in the map making process
