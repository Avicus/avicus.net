My friend named _iGhosty got banned yesterday for ban evading for using someone elses account.&nbsp; The Staff member is Brottweiler banned him becuase&nbsp; he pressed james pak for no reason and he loves this server. Anyone think of something to make him unbanned.

It may be because he's using a VPN that other banned players are using, or because he actually evaded. In evasion cases, those are quite difficult to prove innocence.<br><br>Just have him be honest. If he isn't honest, his frame of appeal is completely gone. The last thing they like to do is appeal liars and cheaters.
