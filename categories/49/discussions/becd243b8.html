Why avicus? I saw my brother playing it, and wanted to play with him. Then I grew to love the staff and players and I grew so much as I formed friendships with some players and got to know you guys<br><br>Past PvP stuff? I've played factions when I first started out, played mineplex dominate, a little of kochi and bad lion before my brother got us IP banned<br><br>Thoughts on those two people you mentioned? I am not really familiar with them since I tend to stay outta celebrity and political stuff, but my thoughts on you are you're a good person :D.<br><br>Potatoes? I love them, try them with eggs it's great

I haven't read much on those two countries but I've heard they aren't doing too good recently :/<br><br>Favorite food and music? I LOVE rice, and my favorite music is... not really a specific kinda, I don't like country or rock though<br><br>Best experience here? The one game I got 39 kills and all the mons, I didn't do it on BWD I did it on my brothers account<br><br>My skills are a solid 79/100, so pretty good and I hope you see me in game too ;D
