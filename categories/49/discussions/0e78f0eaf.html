u r my bolivian dude i love u man &lt;3. U r a very good leader and u have the ability to get good players, have knowledge of the game and u make the team work together. I feel like we have a lot in common like we both do cadets and then we share some similar stuff going on in our lives (i dont want to say it since i think it might be private to u but i think u know what i mean it was when u replied to my 'help' thread). Tbh ur english is actually very good ik we all like make fun of it in chat and when u r talking but like it is actually a lot better than u think. Ur pronunciation is probably better than every spanish person ive met so far tbh but its just some things that u can improve on like pronouncing 'girl' or 'ranked': i think you are tensing yourself too much trying to pronouce those words. Just speak like u normally do with other english words. In terms of ur pvp, ur aim is good but u need to click faster tbh like u have versed me in public servers before and i could always get like more hits on u because i click faster even tho i have like 50 more ping than u. I hope ur uni life goes well and u can find ur dream job and earn a lot of cash money and live a good life.

From what i have seen, u r a great person who is polite and willing to help other people. U r a very good swordsman and imo the best defender as an avicus player (tbh before meeting u i thought no one actually knew how to defend properly on avicus xd). Ur skills also reflect much on the good teams u are and were in like apollo, celestial, pureblox etc. From my perspective, u need to make ur defence more anti-tunnel like what inloc said before. The defence is great, but its just that tunnelers can get in easily if u dont dig a pit as smart people know when to tunnel and when to not tunnel so u cant hear them for example, they will tunnel when their team is ground pushing so when u r too absorbed into fighting the ground pushers, they will then tunnel into the wool and u dont hear them. As i said before with zic, I think we both share some similarities (im sure u know which) and I hope that things will go good for u over there and that they wont and will not continue to affect u throughout ur life :)

Ur probably the most underrated player ive known so far. I remember when u were thesus_ back in ocn and u used to be in midas so i thought u were bad but then at the end of the day, my ass would be kicked by u xd. As a person, I think u r a natural leader and someone who is cheerful and reliable. U always broke the silence when the channel went quiet and i think without u in celestial, the chemistry would be a lot worse tbh and the voice channels will sound pretty quiet xd.<br><br>NZ does exist as i went there before and i can confirm to u, its an island that is real and well xd. PS it is the most beautiful place in human existence even more than the country sides of australia if i have to recommend somewhere to go for a holiday, it will be NZ.<br><br>Depends what flavour of chips since im not really too much of a chocolate person but i love soy honey chicken, salt and vinegar and sour cream flavoured chips

As a person, I havent really seen too much of u but i think u r someone who is willing to learn and a reliable person. U r pretty chill sometimes tbh but then u r great to talk with. As a pvper, heck. I can go on for days about ur reach xd. Ur sword is pretty much insane and u can go on par with legends like tribal, impact and all of those good teams. U r also a great offender and u can pull off some really crazy shit that i have never seen before.<br><br>Well u look like u r but ur not xd. I dont blame avicus for falsebanning u but i think they still could have taken some consideration into it. That was definitely the moderators' fault<br><br>No u should definitely not be still banned celestial needs u as a player and a leader. And plus it was a false ban u were not hacking

I personally think that u r a great leader and someone who can bring players who have never played with each other before together as a team. Without u, I dont think celestial will be as coordinated and organised and definitely not as good as it is today. U were always there to keep us notified of whats coming and I could tell that u put into a lot of work into managing the team despite ur busy everyday life. As a person, I think we do have somethings in common for example we both do cadets (although mine is a lot tougher than urs ;) ). I really do hope that u can keep on improving celestial as a team.<br><br>Celestial used to be imo a team that wasn't too good in terms of pvp capabilities and teamwork. But throughout time, they got better and better at pvp and communication and all the while attracting new talented members into the team. I think that this team will only get better and better imo. The only downside is that ciyh got false banned :(<br><br>Im fine over here in australia but my life is kind of unstable at the moment but im sure that it will improve over time.<br><br>I'll have to go with banana for this one

Tbh ur really annoying at times and ive also heard others say the same about u. U always want to get into a good team from what ive seen but tbh ur not so good at the game. What i want to say to u is that getting into a good team isnt all about the skill but its also about how u r as a person. Like if u stopped being really annoying to everyone on discord then im sure that they will see u as a better person. Tbh the reason why i didnt consider u to join squadcatt was because of ur personality rather than ur skill in the game. And also u r pretty advantageous when it comes to pvp since u have a low ping. I mean look at me i have like 300-400 ping to avicus and im still pretty good at the game. What im trying to say to u is that there r no shortcuts in life. When u get older u will start to understand that. For now if u want to get into a good team and actually let them play u in a tm, u should start to focus on ur personality and training to become a better player. Really im saying this because its not only like this in minecraft or avicus but also in rl and thats when it becomes really important. Just remember that results come through effort and definitely not shortcuts.
