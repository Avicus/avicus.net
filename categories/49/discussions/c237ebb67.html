Hello! My name is DaBaderMC. My name was actually meant to be spelled "DaBadgerMC" but it was accidentaly misspelled. So far, I am yet to make friends, but I've only been playing for a couple hours or so. I enjoy playing Minecraft, WWE2k14, and many other video games. It would be great if some of you all could give me tips on pvp, forums, etc. If you see me in-game say hi! :D

Hey, DaBaderMC! :D Welcome to Avicus! Enjoy your stay here!<br><br>If you want to make friends, I'm sure that finding a clan/team is a great way to find new ones! I found a lot of new people there. Many of those people became my closest friends on the server. Why don't you try it out?&nbsp;<br><br>Final note: I like your name. Bader sounds close to Vader. XD

Welcome to the server bro (: enjoy your stay! If you have any questions you can ask me (: I have a feeling your going to like this server a lot! Maybe even become a moderator. Or change your name to PresidentBadger! And talk about politics in server forums and in game. Maybe you'll lock this for being a bumped topic. I don't know it might happen! Just saying (:
