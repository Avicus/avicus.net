@Semel<br><br>Nothing happened to it, and it never was a lie. I know it's hard for a person like you to understand it but I don't blame you for thinking that it was a lie. I have lots of irl people who can vouch for this, if you'd like to talk to ever, feel free to add me on skype.<br><br>@99250<br><br>Nope, because something happened to the accounts, and people were saying stuff I changed it too one alt, which Veopth/SamyBurgers had gave me.<br><br>Actually none, I haven't had access to my computer I've been out all day on busy with irl stuff.<br><br>I'd say almost 50, because I recently checked my logs, to see how many different accounts I have logged into and it was around that number.<br><br>You're a pretty chill guy and cool one too, sometimes to me, you're like a brother I never had, you're very intelligent and I respect you deeply as a person.
