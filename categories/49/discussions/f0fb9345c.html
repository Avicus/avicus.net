<b>My Past:</b><br>I assume most of you don't know me, I've been with the Avicus network ever since it was created. This was my favorite network before being banned for multiple reasons that were proven to be wrong. Besides this most recent ban of mine (Which was almost three years ago) which was a visual glitch in 1.6 which made it look like I was sprinting while crouching. I was on the top 10 players three years ago and was banned around the time of the team update. But I must say it's good to be back :)<br><br><b>Currently:<br></b>Well I gotta get used to the PvP systems in Minecraft again, which shouldn't take too long, once I do I'd love to join a team that is actually good (No offense To Specific teams is intended). Preferably very active as well with a good community base. I also am A YouTuber with 630 subscriber, and once I get my new PC Ill be uploading a lot of Avicus videos, If you wish to know my YouTube name, just contact me and I'll let you know.<b><br></b><b><br>A bit about me:<br></b>I'm 17, turning 18 in two months. I currently work at a Movie theater as a Staff lead (Sound boring I know). Like I said before, I have my own YouTube Channel, I'm currently taking college course classes for Game design. I love to meet some cool people, I'm also a very dark sided humor type of person. &nbsp;Feel free to hmu :)<b><br><br></b><b>Contact me:</b><br>For games, I only use discord which you can reach me at:&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(79, 84, 92); font-family: inherit;  font-weight: inherit; ">DiabetoThePedo#0189</span><div class="ui-form-item" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px;  font-weight: inherit;  font-family: inherit;   "><div><br></div></div>

I was not crouching andf sprinting, it is a visual glitch from when being teleported between dimensions (In this case servers) If you were crouching while teleported then took off sprint right away after the teleport, You look normal to yourself, but to others it loks like your sprint crouching. The glitch is fixed now but existed in 1.6 and I THINK 1.7, you can go into a lan world to find out with a friend. Im pretty sure if you look up "Sprint crouch glitch minecraft" on youtube, you will find what I'm talking about.

When your evidence shows you being held back by an anti-cheat and then it spamming in the staff chat that you were hacking, I'm sure its not just a visual glitch buddy.

I was shown a clip of that, but considering the things used to detect that also detects that im crouching and sprinting, is affected by the visual glitch. I don't want to get into an argument here; I know myself I was not hacking and I now record Every single time I play so I can have 100% evidence of it. I just wanted ot show you what the server was possibly detecting.

hate to break it to you chap but there's no way an anticheat would be putting up red flags for a visual glitch<br>if you were crouching and sprinting at the same time, it would detect your inputs and say as much, it could never detect a visual glitch unless you gave it eyes or something

Im not saying its only a visual glitch, It may be a glitch to be crouching and running at the same time. But it was indeed a glitch.

Most of the things I was going to say have been said by Vlad or prof. So I'll just say this: You were hacking no doubt about that. I knew about the glitch but to knowledge it did not work on Avicus back then, so it was not possible to abuse it in any way. You were being held back by an anti cheat plugin that would affect you if you were either flying, no fall, sneaking or using a sprint mod. Staff chat was being spammed by multiple reports from the console that you were triggering the anti cheat, which can be seen in the video evidence. So you are lying.
