First time I saw u was some time back when i had no clue how to do ctw and shit and had some badlion tryhard name like iKeztox or Atonicql or some shit and then i saw u with ur gang squadcat with romeoo, sharkproyect and u guys just rekt shit and im like yo wtf. Like two years later i saw my team HWEC dying before RGAOS and then i was like ah shit but then lft transferred to ur team so im like ill go as well why not. you seem really cool and funny as well and acceptable to people since u accepted me into squadcatt without tryouts and shit and gave me a chance to play in the last ocn tourney. When u play u seem like ur hacking like legit u were hitting me when u were looking the other way probably cause i lag since my internet is shit. ur english is really good tbh and i think ur a great person in real life too<br><br>probably squadcat since before i was in shit teams probably cause people didnt realise me as a player who would play in tourneys and i never got accepted into teams so yeah

ur the only person who truly understands just how shit australian wifi is so in other words ur already instantly my best mate. u seem really cool and to me u seem like a role model as ur living the uni life i always looked forward to living. U seem to always tease zicuri but i really have no problems with that and as a matter of fact i think its really hilarious as it ends up leading to censored stuff.<br><br>Life 4 me rn is shit due to some family issues. more so i just came back from an australian bush camp where i got bitten by a bull ant and my arm got freaking paralysed for like 4 hours and my finger 8 hours and had to build stick shelters while getting rained on so yeah... But school is pretty fun which makes up for all of the crap things.<br><br>Because i have nothing to do since exams r over and all i do nowadays is leave discord on, listen to music and study (since im smart my estimated atar through rankings and shit is 98+ so im too gud)<br><br>squadcats r all really cool guys and everyone is friendly. i really like both squadcat and horizon and i feel like both teams will go really far in tourneys.<br><br>cause my old team wasnt going to play in RGAOS anymore so i went around looking for teams i can transfer to and then zicuri accepted me into squadcat

Yes, especially after watching the new movie<br><br>Because I really enjoyed the movie and it really brought back the SAO memories so I was like why not since i can change it back anyways XD<br><br>I don't personally know you but considering you coming to this AMA, I have a good first impression of you as someone who shares possible similarities (such as SAO) as me and I look forward to knowing you better!<br><br>Because OCN/Lifeboat shut down and since I joined Horizon/SquadCat and we mainly play on Avicus<br><br>My life is quite uncertain at the moment with lots of unexpected twists and turns so I really can't answer that question, sorry.<br><br>SAO, Kuroko no Basket, OPM, Seitokai Yakuindomo, Your Name, Nisekoi, Hai to Gensou no Grimgar, pretty much anything comedic and/or based off a parallel world (usually fantasy)<br><br><br><br><br>Thank you &lt;3
