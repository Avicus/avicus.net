Hello! Just getting started here, I'm not new to the server, as I've been a part of the Avicus community since April 2013. I just make a post every now and then.<br><br>Now, I figure, with some important events coming up, that I should get to know the community a little better, or, in this case, vice-versa. Time to jump on this bandwagon of AMAs!<br><br>So, go ahead. Make my day. :)

Tbh, I don't know much about Doctor Who, just enough to know that bowties are the best thing ever, among other nerdy references. I've been watching it with my gf starting from New Season 1 (with Eccleston), and we're currently on Season 2, and we just finished "The Impossible Planet."

How'd you know? xD<br><br>Anyways, I feel very honored that they would accept me as an interviewee, but I'm also really anxious for the interview, and possibly being a Junior Moderator, mainly because I've used voice chat with people that I've never met in person. However, I'm really excited and can't wait to get it started! :D

How hyped are you about the new Super Smash Bros?<br>Favorite newcomer?<br>Favorite veteran?<br>Least favorite newcomer?<br>Who do you wish was added back from the older games?<br><br>And finally...<br>How many bears could Bear Grylls grill if Bear Grylls could grill bears?

Hype levels are over 9000.<br>Newcomers? I'd say Palutena, Dark Pit, and, most of all, Shulk.<br>Favorite veterans would have to be Lucario, Toon Link, and Zero Suit Samus,<br>As much as I love Mega Man games, I can't stand playing as him in Smash. :/<br>I really wish that Wolf was back. He may be a slight clone of Fox, but at least he's much more different than Falco.<br><br>And, Bear Grylls can only grill one bear, because he only owns a one-bear grill.<br><br>:D
