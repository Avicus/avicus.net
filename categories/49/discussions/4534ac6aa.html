Hey everyone my name is Max and I'm (fairly) new to Avicus!<br>I joined about four months ago but I did not stay on Avicus very long because of the games it had (It was before this Avicore update).<br>However, I now think that Avicus is a terrific server and I really look forward to spending more time on it!<br>In regards to my username; this account was originally vladthegreat100's, but he gave it to me because my parents would not let me buy an account of my own unfortunately.<br><br>Anyways guys, I really hope to meet a lot of you, and I look forward to seeing you all in-game!!<br>Please ask me anything!
