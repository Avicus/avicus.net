Hey everyone, i have actually made a My First Post discussion, which got some extremely good greetings and i am thankful and grateful for that, and i guess theres no harm in telling you all a little about myself in more detail.<br><br>My actual name is Fred, which i guess is alright, but i have had a bit of remarks and jokes about it, too :) Anyway i am 14 years old, which I think is a pretty "ripe" age to make a YouTube channel, which i have gone ahead and done! It is called OPTOBAT GAMING and i am willing to provide links once i have uploaded my first video. I won't go into too much detail about the channel because I've mentioned it in separate posts. I have NO clue if i will blow up and be famous yet but, i am hopeful and optimistic about it :) For some reason i have a serious and i guess weird enjoyment for editing, like putting clips together and adding music, sounds, slo-mo, etc. I dunno, i think its because i enjoy constructing a cool video that others can give feedback and enjoy, which is why i upload to YouTube. Thanks for reading, and please stay tuned for some links to my upcoming channel - OPTOBAT.<br>Also just to finish off, does anyone know a site where i can make a super awesome channel art for my channel? Please reply if you have one, it means a lot :)
