I was actually really suprised and I told my brother and he was like: What really. I actually never thought I would become Junior Moderator and kept telling myself that I wouldn't get it, but here I am with Jr Mod. It was also cool that the Robert's got promoted today.

1. It feels cool to be Jr Mod, but I am kinda afraid that I won't succeed the trial, but I will try my best at it.<br>2. I honestly think Acceqted will be getting Jr Mod, he's a cool dude to be around and I hope to see him Jr Mod one day :D.<br>3. I live a mile away from the beach and I would recommend people to visit. It's not too hot during the summer, but it is cold during the winter. I'm also located in a place where Finding Dory Started her journey (not a spoiler, I read it on an article)&nbsp;<br>4. I got the idea Junr from my brother when I was looking for a new name. My parents would always call me Junr when they were too lazy to say Junior, so yeah. I have 13 name changes, so I'm not going to explain all, but I can explain it to you in TS.<br>5. I just want to be happy and have happy team members :D<br>6. Before I bought MC, my friend told me to join these servers when I got it, so I did and I loved it ever since, but when they changed it to Avic.us, I lost it until I contacted support.<br>7. I think you are a chill dude and I hope to get to know/talk to you a lot.

Oh Cammy, where do I begin, you're an awesome person to talk to and an amazing friend. I hope one day, when it is needed, you will be a Senior Moderator. I am happy that I can be Staff with you :D.&nbsp;<br><br>Austrailia seems like a really cool place and I hope to visit there one day. I actually have some friends that are from Australia and also, Sia is from there too :D.<br><br>Your internet is good tbh. You don't have as bad ping like me lol.

Hey Junr!<br>Before I start questioning you..I wanted to congratulate and thank you. <br>Congratulations on being a Junior Moderator (it really fits with your name)<br>Although I have just began to know you, you really deserve the position. <br>Keep loving, contributing, and sharing to Avicus, because you are a REALLY awesome person. <br>Be optimistic as you have always been (I hope so..) xD <br><br>And thank you so much for inviting me to Emoji Team. <br>You are a very awesome, chill, kind, and empathetic person. <br>I am so thankful. xD <br><br>Now with the questions: <br><br>1. What is the longest you have gone without eating? <br>2. Do you have a girlfriend? <br>3. What would be an ideal birthday gift for you? <br>4. What is your dream job? <br>5. Do you think that you will be a famous YouTuber?<br>6. Should I make more intros for you? If so, what song would you like me to put? <br>7. What's your favorite book? <br>8. What's your favorite color? <br>9. How many places in the world have you been? <br>10. How do you look like? (I am dying to know how you look like. You got handsome voice xD) <br><br>And that's enough for the questions. <br>I have 20 more...but I think this will do for now ;) <br>Congratulations and thanks! <br>Hooray for Junr! <br>Bye! <br>See you in game! xD

I'm going to be honest, at first I thought you were annoying, however, once I started talking to you, I was wrong.

You are a really good and funny friend, and I always enjoy those little skype conversations we have :3. Sometimes I do like it when you ignore me, so I can spam you &gt;:D hehe.

I don't play OCN enough to have a favorite map lol.<br><br>Also, I was confused on what you meant there, I thought you meant Frames Per Second, but I only have COD on the Xbox so I guess that's my favorite, but the last time I played it was when I was 11.
