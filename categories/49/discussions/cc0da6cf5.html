<u></u><b></b><b></b><b></b><u><b><b>Hello Everyone!<br><br></b></b></u><b></b>My name is Acceqted and I am a member o<u></u>f the Avicus network :). You might of seen me in-game and now hopefully on the forums! What your reading right now will be my very first post of many to come. As for my first post I decided to do a little "All About Me." And well... Here it is :P.<br><br>Name In-game / In real life: Acceqted, Josh<br><br>Favourite game on Avicus: That's a hard one but I would have to choose either DTM or Nexus. I enjoy both types because of the goal being PvP.<br><br>When did I join Avicus: I am actually a fairly old player in-game, I was able to play on MC Zone and has carried on since then. You are probably wondering why I am just starting forums and the reason I guess is that I haven't really got involved until this day &lt;3.<br><br>Where do I live: Canada (Yes, that's all your getting!)<br><br>Favourite Colour: Neon Green<br><br>Favourite Drink: Starbucks<br><br>Favourite Food: Starbucks<br><br>Favourite Fruit: Watermelon &lt;3<br><br>Favourite Avicus map: Senex III<br><br>Favourite Admin: Vice &lt;333<br><br>Favourite Sport: Danceee<br><br>Biggest Pet-Peeve: People eating with their mouths open. (I die a little inside everytime someone does it)<br><br>Favourite Music Genre: Pop/ Mostly all new songs.<br><br>Fun Fact: I am an expert at learning lyrics from new songs. Once a song comes out (that I enjoy) I will probably now all the lyrics to it a week later.<br><br>Now this is a very broad description of myself. I will be in-game and on team-speak mostly if you would like to contact me. I can't wait to get involved and meet some fellow members. See you all later ~ Acceqted.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><u><b><b></b><br></b></u>

Hey, try not to double/triple post on threads, instead just reply everything in one post. I know it's less efficient since you can't alert everyone this way, but it helps reducing forum spam. Thanks.
