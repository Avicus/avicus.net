<i>So as you might know I am Cezbla I have played avicus since&nbsp;November&nbsp;4th 2014, I do not know the &nbsp;date mczone was made so I cannot say how many days after I joined but I think about 1 month.<br><br>I quit after for a week or two but came back for sky-wars it was rocking all day the best game mode I gave ever played<br><br>I donated for kits on sky-wars and nexus back then I would play all day everyday, my younger brother one day showed me a server called pvpgames which is known today as prx-craft this was back around 1.4.2 or 1.4, I liked it but then I got&nbsp;addicted&nbsp;to it because I wanted to improve my pvp for mczone known now as avicus<br><br>but I did improve, but the one thing that went wrong was I didn't like mczone [avicus] anymore compared to pvp games and so did rezbla, I would pass by every other week to play one or two games<br><br>One day I joined a sky-wars and the&nbsp;community&nbsp;was so nice I said "I am back and lets win" everyone in the game said welcome back good luck have fun, and "Nice! keep playing". &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then I knew that I&nbsp;couldn't&nbsp;leave again but I didn't want to leave the pvpgames either, one day I decided that&nbsp;hacks would be a fun thing to have not knowing all that much about servers or anything for that matter, so I would hack on every other server but mczone and pvpgames one day I forgot to turn off&nbsp;antiknock back&nbsp;and I played &nbsp;pvpgames I got banned on there, from then on I never would hack again I didn't&nbsp;know what to do at first but leave&nbsp;mine-craft, &nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At the time I played Call of duty black ops to, so it was no biggy for me to get banned and leave, but I met a friend, bone_crusher2001 this friendship was probably the strongest we ever shared in our lives yet, it started on the day I found a server called gizmo, bone_crusher2001 was a busy mod but he let me in his faction to up my chances at getting mod, he added me to his friends chats and etc. we would soon to be best friends, the day came the application day, I made the application with his help and his way to keep me going, I got moderator on the gizmo servers We soon resigned to make our own server, but this did not go as so well but we did get a couple famous youtubers to come and record for us anyway, &nbsp;
