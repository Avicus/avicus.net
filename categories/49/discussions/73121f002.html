Overall you're one of the nicest dudes on the server and I haven't seen anyone who doesn't get along with you. Even though we haven't talked too much, I can tell you're really genuine and a great friend. As a Mod, I think you do your job diligently; you don't talk in-game too much but you do a lot for the community regardless. As a player, I think you have a ton of potential. You have good melee and bow skills, and you listen well to the leaders when you're subbing. Both of those things allow you to do extremely well in scrims and make you a well-rounded player. Of course, everyone has room for improvement, but I think your dedication to the game and your overall skill level leave you in a great place. o/

You've been around here a loooooong time. We were friends for a good while and you supported me as an Admin when many people didn't, so I'm grateful for that. I always felt that you underestimated me as a player, which was pretty frustrating, but regardless I enjoyed your presence on the server. You were a great player in your prime and you did well on BC and Team Allah. Also, it would be nice if you came back one day xd

hi big boy<br><br>1) You're one of my best buds here overall and I'm really glad that you joined apollo over a year ago. I love our shared memes and talks on TS xd. I think you're one of the chillest and funniest people on apollo and I hope you stay.&nbsp;<br><br>In BoE you were a complete god, there's no way around it. I think you were the best melee player in that tournament besides maybe Zeus. You may not be as good now as you were then, but idk what you're talking about when you say you aren't good anymore because you can basically still rape everyone anyway. I hope you're more active in the next tm because that would give us a huge advantage. I'm not sure how you see me as a player, but I always feel like you underestimate me a bit although that may be a joke.<br><br>2) Left because I'm aggressive :D<br><br><br>3) kms

We've only had a few conversations but it looks like you're a nice and chill dude who people misunderstand. You might meme a lot, which may make you look toxic or something, but it doesn't really affect my perception of you. Your team is really good, no other way to put it. You guys work together really well and you don't have any weak players at all. I honestly hope that my team can reach a similar level at some point but I'm not sure how long that would take.

1) We used to be a really strong team with a lot of chemistry. Even though we've never won a tourney, I still think we've proven that we're not just a randy avicus team. In previous times, even though we may not have had as individually-skilled players as we do now, we were more successful because we played mostly for fun and listened to each other. We've been struggling a bit lately for a few different reasons IMO. First, we're in a rebuilding period where we're trialling new players and having different people leading after some people left (budah/lego) and others became inactive. Second, everyone has been getting really salty/mad during scrims and taking everything way too seriously, which fucks up our comms and generally ruins the mood. I hope that we stay a team for a long time because I've never met better people on the server, despite how toxic some of them (us) are.<br><br>2) Yeah, I haven't seen you much lately, but I've always thought you were a great Mod if that means anything. You think ethically and logically, which are great traits, and you actually care(d) for the community. I know you've been on this server for a really long time and that you've been extremely dedicated as well. <br><br>3) It's completely random

1) I would say that you're probably the best melee player on Apollo second only to Spyrovic. When you play it makes a HUGE difference in a scrim or tourney match because you know what to do and you're a god at sword. I really hope you stay playing the game because you're just that good. As a person, you're one of my oldest and closest friends here. We were Senior Mods and even Admins together waay back and I'm really grateful for how you always supported me both as a player and a person. I'm not sure how your view of me as a player changed over the last few days because I haven't been doing too well against you, but I hope you still thing I'm good.<br><br>2) Probably not but if I did I would def move to your country<br><br>3) CTW<br><br>4) We're at a rebuilding stage honestly. People left, new people are coming, etc. We've been getting kinda mad in scrims and not enjoying them like we used to. Once we stop doing that and finalizing our new roster and strats, I think we'll start doing better.

1) I don't really know you that well as a person honestly. You seem to be a nice guy, but I feel like you get kinda mad/salty quickly.&nbsp;<br><br>2) I haven't really fought you too much, but it seems like you got better because I think you were pretty bad before. I think you're determined to be good at the game, which will help you a lot when you actually practice.&nbsp;<br><br>3) Like I've said before, we're at a point where we're shifting. Many of our long-time members/leaders have either left or become inactive, so we're trialling different players and new strategies. As a team and individually, we've all come a long way IMO, and it's really surprising if you look at how the entire team and everyone on it has changed since the beginning.<br><br>4) You guys are an up-and-coming team with some individually-skilled players. I think if you guys remain a team, you'll eventually become really good, but there are a few things that I currently don't like there. I feel like you guys get really hype and shit when you win games against veteran teams, like Apollo, Tribal in the unofficial tm, etc. and then you start thinking that you're really good. IMO that's not a good way to think because it kinda makes you look like assholes and stunts your progress as a team. It's true that you have some good players but you won't form good relationships/reputations with other teams or grow as a team if you do that.

Holy fuckkkkkkkkkkkkkkk<br><br>You're honestly one of the most chill and funny people I've met on this server. I think you're one of my closest friends on the server and I actually get really happy when you enter the ts channel xd. Also, you probably have the best charisma on the team, along with Zeus. I really respect the fact that you stepped up to get the team together after lego and budah left because I know you put a lot of pressure on yourself. Even though you may not want to lead in-game, I still want you as a general leader because you're so responsible and authoritative. As a player, you're really well-rounded IMO. You have great sword and bow skills, and your experience being on the team for a while has given you a lot of game knowledge. I hope you stay with apollo/avicus for a while longer because you're an amazing friend and team member. &lt;3

Opinions?

Even though we haven't talked too much recently, I think you've changed a lot since I first met you. I think you had just gotten Mod when I returned to Senior Mod last year. Back then, you were a bit too hype about things and you were really sweating for senior even though Iron and I said that wasn't a great idea xd. Since then, though, I think you've really chilled out and become a lot more free. You've also improved as a player from what I've seen, although I'm not sure how much interest you have in competitive.

1) Being on the ATP Tour&nbsp;<br><br>xd<br><br>2) I don't know you too well as a person, but I think you're a really funny and respectable guy. As a player, it's crazy to think you're still that same guy with the owl skin lmao. Before I would say a year and a half ago, you only played public avicus and you weren't that good. All of a sudden, you became really really good and more memeful. For a while you were a bit toxic, but now you're really chill and good at the game

1) As a person, I don't really know you too well, but from what I see you joke a lot and don't take everything too seriously, which is a good thing. As a player, there was a point where you were pretty sketchy, but you were also laggy af so that might have been why. You took a long break from minecraft, so right now you're pretty rusty.<br><br>2) 9<br><br>3) Good, I'm happy that it's summer now but I don't have much to do<br><br>4) yes
