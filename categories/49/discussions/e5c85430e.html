omg koja one of my best friends probably on here and without you i would have probs been teamless for a while lol tho when you do lead you have to be a bit clear on your directions and positions as it can be very confusing but other than that great player &lt;3<br><br>idk they seem to be gaining players rather than losing so it may seem that they may be reaching back to the 100s player counts like they did in late stages avicore but we have to wait and see<br><br>Pizza?<br><br>u already know my age.... (its 12 if you don't remember)<br><br>Team allah winning again probably but would be exciting for a different team to come runners up other than apollo which i highly doubt.

When i first saw you on Dawson's team I didn't really know much about you, you seemed to be a decent player but wasn't too active though you got mod which surprised me as it was "Dawson's team" which he somehow lead even though he was banned but now you got promoted to Senior once you came back to the staff team, you seem to have been a pretty nice guy overall though so I must thank you for not really changing much as your a really great guy and fun to talk to &lt;3. Hope you do some improvements to avicus in the later future

Not really sure what happened between the stages dawson was around and then you turning less memey but your still the pretty good player i remember you as and seem to take things lot more serious now so you seem to have matured into a better player only if you were a lot more active but interesting guy to talk to on ts when we had our moments xd

tbh when you were on the b team on jalapenos i never really thought of you as a good player until i saw you play and you quite surprised me actually, and i wish you and jalapenos good luck as you were probably going to be there number 1 support player when it comes to scrims which jalapenos lacked when i was there and when u showed up you changed most of my games though one thing you do lack is communication so it would be great if you did talk a little more as a player since it would be helpful if we do have players around the defence area but have no idea if someone is rushing but other than that you seem to not really get salty and were pretty nice to people
