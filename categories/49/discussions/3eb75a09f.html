Well, this is gonna be a bit of a controversial post, I can already tell.&nbsp;<br>To start off, I'm gonna stick this right here, since it's no secret:&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://avicus.net/infractions/74579">http://avicus.net/infractions/74579</a><br>Tempbanned for hacking (Please note this is not a ban appeal, I'm unbanned now). I won't plead guilty, I did hack on avicus, I honestly can't say any reason other than that I was bored. Just earlier today, I saw this on the youtubez:&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUDmVZdEnmo&amp;list=UUeBuIjU_86wuswh9-6DeLhg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUDmVZdEnmo&amp;list=UUeBuIjU_86wuswh9-6DeLhg</a>&nbsp;This was filmed before I was banned, and I want to clear up any controversy about this being new, as I don't want to be banned again. I realized while banned that all the minigames on avicus really are unique, and you can't find a replacement. I have 100% stopped hacking/cheating/abusing glitches/not following the rules at all since then. I just made this post to say that I want to be a good player on this server and the next ones to come, not known as "that hacker guy". I really hope you guys can forgive me for that, and I look forward to minigames to come c:<br><br>(On another note, some people asked me why there is a green dot on my face. My character's hat is a headset which is also black and the mic part is green, you would have to see me in-game for it to make sense.)

He said he is unbanned.<br>Anyway I hope that you have indeed learned your lesson and will follow the rules from here on. It takes a certain level of courage to admit you were wrong so well done for that.

Thanks for your honesty, it's hard to do that especially in a server where many people are familiar with each other.<br>And I forgive you ;)

It should have been permanent. You can't just let hackers come back after a month.
