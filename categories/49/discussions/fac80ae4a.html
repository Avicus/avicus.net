He said that he is in fact "retiring", so this is <b>not </b>a temporary leaving thread.

Ironic how you are essentially telling me that because he is a regular or well known it somehow makes him above the rules, yet no doubt you would be the very person to complain about regulars getting special treatment or how it would be one rule for some and a different rule for others.&nbsp;<br><br>If we enforce the rules, we get shit.&nbsp;<br>If we don't enforce the rules, we get shit. Honestly, make up your minds because it gets very very tiresome.&nbsp;<br><br>Temperary leaving threads are not allowed, hence why I asked him if he was going for good or not. I could have just locked the thread immediately because I suspect it is just temperary but I decided I would be nice and give him the benefit of the doubt.&nbsp;<br><br>I've pretty much said everything I have to say so I shall leave it here. I shouldn't have to say this but apparently I must remind you of these few points.
