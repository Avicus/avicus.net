I've done too many but I'm bored, I'll give serious awnsers. <br><br>I'm Sem,<br>I live in the Netherlands and I'm 1/2 Indonesian. I've been a part of this community for over 1.5 years now. <br>Most of you know me as an annoying, extremely bad troll with poor grammar, which is true, sadly.<br>Due to that I lost a few good friends on Avicus, I had great fun playing with you guys through the first year I joined this server. <br>I regret becoming such a dick, even after I made an apologize post I continued being stupid. Sorry for that.<br>I now pretty much lost interest in Avicus and MC in general, school has started and I need to focus on it.<br>You'll probaly only see me in-game when I'm playing a scrimmage with Apollo, only on weekends. <br><br>So yeah, ask me things. :)

Adam, many people have told you but I'm going to tell you again. You're one of the nicest guys in this community.<br>We've been great friends for a while now and I have no reason to dislike you. <br><br>It's extremely annoying to play against you, you're smart and also really good at melee. I've always seen you as a decent defender but I never knew you played offence and that you were also good at it. In public games you somehow always managed to get atleast 1 monument every game and in scrimmages it's pretty much the same.<br><br>Pink Swedish meatball &lt;3

Markus, you too are one of the nicest guys I have ever met. It's so much fun to play with you, you seem always happy and you are always up for a good laugh. You're redstone creations are the best even though I have no idea what it does. You and Buster are a great combi, when are you both going to stop denying that you are a not a couple? <br><br>You've improved a lot in making defences, you make good call outs, you never get mad and you're also above average at PvP. Probaly one of the best players on Apollo, if you want you can get easily on a higher team. <br><br>Amazing friend and good teammate, love you Markus.

You were really bad at pvp when I first fought you, now you pretty much 
beat me in every fight. You've improved a lot. I was honestly a bit 
suprised that you got on BC at first, quickly after that I realized how 
good you actually were. Probaly thought that because I hadn't played 
against you in a long time. In the first scrimmage you played against me
 you destroyed me. You deserved to get on a top tier team. :) When you 
were on Apollo you had great communication but you could get a bit 
heated and annoying sometimes, but that was fine since I was way more annoying. We became good 
buddies, we made some really bad jokes together. You can take things a bit too seriously though. You're nice and it's really fun to hang out with you. You're by far my favourite cheesehead &lt;3<br><br>als ik skype heb moet je me een keertje toevoegen, heb een fijne avond.

Bringing this back up. <br><br>Hannah/Buster I think you're really nice, weird and fun to talk with. You're a great moral support and always in a happy mood. IMO you are actually pretty decent at pvp and good at crafting armor for us. :P We were friends before I didn't know you were a girl. I was so suprised when you told me you were a girl, probaly because of the name you had. It's really great to have someone like you in Apollo. :)

Didn't speak to you that much when before you joined Apollo. I thought 
you were a bit annoying but you probaly weren't. When I played against 
you in scrimmages I saw you as a normal avicus regular, good for Berzerk and nothing much more. TBH I was against you joining Apollo, I guess I got proven wrong. You make decent defences and you follow instructions very well. You have improved a lot, you're a valuable player for us. Now I think you aren't annoying anymore and actually really nice. Sometimes you need watch what you are saying in chat. (so do I) I like you Spookeh. :)

When I first heard your voice my ears almost started bleeding and I got close to a point of killing myself.<br>After having to listen to it for a while I got used to it, now it is quite satisfying to listen to. (atleast you got the balls to talk uhuh) You do a lot of great stuff for this community, you're mini tournaments are well organized and really fun to play. Thank you for keeping what is left of the competitive side of Avicus alive. You're great at melee and a good leader for a team. Other than that I think you're quite mature and you totally deserve to get Event Coordinator.

When I first heard your voice my ears almost started bleeding and I got close to a point of killing myself.<br>After having to listen to it for a while I got used to it, now it is quite satisfying to listen to. (atleast you got the balls to talk uhuh) You do a lot of great stuff for this community, you're mini tournaments are well organized and really fun to play. Thank you for keeping what is left of the competitive side of Avicus alive. You're great at melee and a good leader for a team. Other than that I think you're quite mature and you totally deserve to get Event Coordinator.

&nbsp;I get so frustated and irritated when I have to play against you, even more than playing against Zero or Kiwi. You're amazing at melee and I really hope you're legit. I'm glad you chose for Apollo.&nbsp; If I had to compare myself to someone with the same kind of playstyle it would be you. Being stubborn. &lt;3<br><br>&nbsp;As a person I think you are one of the nicest guys on Avicus, you're like the male version of Buster. You always stay calm and I think I've never seen you heated. I think your name is Dan. Dan you are a great human and I'd put you in my curry.

No problem, really cool that you're into designing as well. Anyway when Wolfgang Egger contacted me this was<br>the first sketch I had to make. <a href="https://gyazo.com/b018b76ed7c6c72b707547c9b4b7b400">https://gyazo.com/b018b76ed7c6c72b707547c9b4b7b400</a>
