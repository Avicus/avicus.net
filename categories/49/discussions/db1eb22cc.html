Hello guys I am going to be honest up front, I will be gone. This is a true post about My retirement or my leaving. Today I realized that it is time for me, I was in game and I got kicked for "Disrespect" but that's not the problem, the fact that everyone in the game was insulting me and being rude was the time where us old vets are not important anymore, new people we get thrown out.<br><br><br>Since when misscarmel left/retired I knew I was going to leave, she was my favorite moderator [NO OFFENSE], also today a moderator said to me I am low on the rep for mods, this kinda insulted me I felt bad and I thought about it and I knew It was today I needed to leave, I was rude to paraspider once and I can't stand seeing him again because It reminds me how stupid I was.<br><br><br>I never thought I would leave this early I thought I would become a staff retire and leave but everything changes nothing you believe &nbsp;you can do fully comes true...<br><br><br>thank you<br><br>~ Craig / Cezbla<br><br><br>[This isn't able to be archived because this is a honest post about my self and I want people to know so they don't ask]<br><br><br>Bye guys it was fun

Although I am no against people leaving and moving on with their lives, lemme just put this straight.&nbsp;<br>I thought a lot of you:<br>- A nice guy, never really spoke, seems ok;<br>- Has a whole group of "'ezblas", seems pretty swift;<br>- Good at PvP, +1.<br>- Helped with a map? Or was that Sezbla? Anywho, one of you was happy fr me to give a hand...<br>But today you surprised me. Don't moan about your infractions. And you'll regret this: you'll be back.&nbsp;<br><br>Today, you swore in game, with no official necessary reasoning. I could've been that mod that warns you for swearing, but seeing as I don't really know you to well &nbsp;and it was just once, I just gave a verbal warning a long with a few lines of advice.&nbsp;<br>This escalated into a full scale argument.&nbsp;<br>Not being funny but your Ego did get in the way a little, I mean, an Internet Ego... jake got a little frustrated, as I did, and dished out punishment. Not the first time, I say.<br><br>All in all, good bye. Best wishes for the future, and if you do come back, we'll be here to welcome you back.&nbsp;<br>Have a good one :)<br><br>~ April

Being a "veteran" you should know better. Don't expect any special privilege just because you've been on the server longer. Punishments will be given accordingly, no matter who you are or what rank you are.<br><br>Just because you were rude to someone once, doesn't mean you can't redeem yourself. Making a post like this is exactly what you don't want to do.
