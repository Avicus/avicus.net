Since I haven't done one of these in awhile and as I've been more inactive than usual due to my current school trip, I decided to hope on the forums to answer some questions and have a couple of giggles. Shoot-away and ask me anything.

As for the team, you seemed to fit quite well as a leader but once the time went through, your argues with Barney made me lose a lot of respect for you as well as you made your overall image look worse than before. Besides that, I think you're really funny as a person and some people might underrate you as a pvper but I know you're better than most of the people in here.<br><br>xoxo

- 1, eZ.<br>- Cause Pablo stalked me.<br>- I might visit my best friend who lives in NY next year.&nbsp;<br>- None of them were my fault. It was Robo's for leading and Tazz's for being a shitty toggle-sneaker and youtuber.<br>- No, Emmy is.<br>- Around 11.<br>- Goes from 140 to 250.<br>- Ask Michael for it.
