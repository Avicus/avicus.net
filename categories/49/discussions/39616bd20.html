crazy because of that ludicrous reaction to the whole demotion thing that was such obviously bs, but then again perhaps crazy from my perspective is normal from another?<br><br>many years ago, in the fourth grade, i went on a class field trip. this was back in the joyous days when everybody and their cousin johnny had a ds, so naturally everyone piled into pictochat (pretty much one of the only times i've ever seen a pictochat chatroom be completely full). it was all in good fun and it was pretty obvious who everyone was based on their screenname, so i just chose something completely random and decided to mess with people. i happened to chose the noble bananaslug, because they were often on my mind since they littered the school grounds during recess quite a bit. it was all good fun and everyone was super confused, and i kept it up for almost an hour until my friend sitting next to me stood up and yelled out that i was bananaslug. some time after gmail first came out of beta, some of my friends and i decided to make accounts that were all variations on "bananaslug", a callback to that fateful day. i happened to chose "profbananaslug" and then i started using it everywhere else the end.<br><br>i mostly like to rant about the current state of the server and how the server staff are doing a bad job, because of how much i care about avicus of course<br><br>i don't believe in quantifying memes so i decline to answer. feel free to count if you want, just don't tell me the answer.
