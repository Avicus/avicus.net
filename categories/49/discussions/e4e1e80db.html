1) One of my friend was playing, then asked for the IP then loved it! I'm in love with maps, monuments and people there.<br>2) Umm, needs better staff and people should learn to be polite to each ones.<br>3) My name is Borra that's why xd Borra was taken then went with'Borrah'.<br>4) I'm lucky that it's the best city of Turkey, but I'm unlucky that I was born in US but I live here :p So much traffic and education is really bad here...<br>5) Mars :p Martian is an awesome movie that's why.<br>6) I enjoy using Sword but I also like Bow while defending.<br>7) You are a really nice guy that loves forums xd. You should be promoted to Mod I don't know if you applied but anyways. Most important player on Cacal I think. Your melee is fantastic. It's nice to talk to you on TS. :)

Really nice guy that loves badges :) You should be promoted asap. I believe that Avicus needs mods like you that will improve this server a lot. Your pvp is pretty good. And you made an awesome team in a week with super OP players. Next tourney I hope your team plays :)

1) You are one of the best mods here. You are really positive and friendly. Whenever I have an issue I feel like I can always talk to you.&nbsp;<br>2) I believe that it will be better. Ranks have to give more advantages to players.
