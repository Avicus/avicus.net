Hey, guys! I'm StormzInvader. I've been around since the early days of MCZone. Right after Avicus came up, I started to become more loyal to the server as I slowly grew to love each aspect of it. In line with this, I would love to share a couple things with the community!<br><br>Ask me anything!

Lets start with a generic question...<br>How'd you come up with your name?

When I was younger, I used to love watching videos on YouTube. I remember clearly that I was watching videos of The World Ends With You, an NDS game. I saw that the uploader's name had a "z" in it, and it sounded pretty cool. I tried to find different alternatives and possibilities on what sounds nice. I finally found the word "storm" to be pretty cool, so I chose it.&nbsp;<br><br>Now, having the name "Stormz" was too generic for me. I needed another word in my name. This part didn't really have much inspiration, but I was just sitting down in front of the computer for a few minutes until I imagined the word "invade" next to "Stormz". I found this really cool, so it stuck with me ever since. I don't plan on changing it.

It isn't about the rank, Rilo. I just want to do my job properly; to serve the people of Avicus. As long as everyone is happy, then I am happy! :D

@Snow<br><br>Let's start with the bad first. :P Well, sometimes, there are a lot of reports that come in. I dislike leaving reports. However, I still try to answer all reports that come in. This is mainly due to me still on another report.<br><br>As for the good parts, I just find that helping the people in the community is good for me. Like I said, I joined since the early MC Zone days. During that time, this was when I played Minecraft a lot more than right now. (I still play Minecraft a good amount, just a bit busy right now.) It just gave me great memories to always cherish. Now, I want to spread this to everybody. I want everyone to feel the same happiness that I received last time. <br><br>@Rilo<br>I actually do not know how to answer that question! Haha! Well aside from video games, I like programming, playing Airsoft, producing music, drawing, and ponies. I guess I'm a jack-of-all-trades. If someone needs help in a certain project or such, I can always help them. They don't really have to look for someone else because I am proficient enough in these fields. XD
