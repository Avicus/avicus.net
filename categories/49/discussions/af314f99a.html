<span>Hello everyone!<span><br>
<br>
Well,
here I am. I can't believe it was one year ago that Avicus came out! I thought
I better make this thread as I've starting playing the odd game of Nebula again
(and am really enjoying myself!) and I never really said goodbye. Some of you
probably wondered why I suddenly left (or not?), so sorry for just leaving you
in the dark. I really enjoyed my time as moderator on the server, and I made
some great friends. However, due to the server lag, the community as a whole,
and a few of the staff at the time, I became unmotivated and decide to leave
the server.<br>
<br>
<span>Thanks
to all those that have said "Hello" and welcomed me back to the
server, it's really nice to see some people from the old days.<br>
<br>
Maybe
this is my return? Who knows, only time will tell.<br>
<br>
Nice
to be back!<br>
-Blue</span></span></span>

Ignore Mr. Negative up there. Since the new update things have improved a good bit! Server has seen an increase in players, a decrease in lag (from mine and others perspective) and the staff team are working well together. You came back at a good time and if the sneak peeks of the new site are anything to go by, it will only get better. Welcome back!

...The lag is gone almost completely. The random freezes, the block lag, the choppy framerate, the "ping" bugs... it's minimal now unless there is hit registering issues (which is rare)

Welcome back man, and i can relate a little with why you said so heres an update: :D<br><br>The lag/block glitching really has declined to a minimum and numbers are rising again on Avicus, there are quite a few a**holes that do ruin the game, but 7-8/10 times everyone is nice and enjoyed the game, so welcome back, i hope to see you around in game :)

Thanks guys! And yes, I do remember most of you! :D<br><br>The staff do seem to be doing a great job, I've certainly noticed a change in the attitudes of the players. I'm glad you've been working to fix to the lag issues, you don't get frustrated every time you try and shoot a bow now. When the staff apps open again (probably in a years time knowing my luck), I would certainly put in a app if I was still motivated to help out with the server.

Danke (that's German for "thank you" in case you were wondering, I thought it would get a bit monotonous if I just said thanks in each reply. Which is kind of counter intuitive, since I ended up saying thanks twice in this reply...).<br><br>Been a great day playing with you guys! Kind of you to remember me.<br><br>@Frosted: Haha, apparently you were spamming :D
