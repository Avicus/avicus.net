Life's been treating me pretty well. I'm really happy that school is finally over because this year was probably my worst ever. Other than that everything is kinda boring but I have family coming over to visit soon so that'll be fun.<br><br>I have a brother that used to play avicus Torquoise_Tortiz, I mean I guess he still comes on once in a while but he's not really active.

ayyyyyyyyyyyye<br><br>Yooo I remember us chillin back in the day and that one time I banned you xDDD good times. At that point our friendship kinda took a toll, but that went away as time went on. You're really chill but to regain all my opinions I'd have to come back on and play with you a bit because I have some pretty shitty memory lmfao<br><br>Life is well but fasting makes it sort of come to a halt. I can't do a lot because I'm trying to conserve hydration so I don't die lmfao. Still, the vibes and everything still make it worth it. Can't wait to go to a basketball camp in July though, that'll be fun :c<br><br>YES I DO PING PONG....BUT WHAT REALLY SUCKS IS I ONLY DO AT SCHOOL CAUSE WE HAVE ONE THERE AND AT A FRIEND'S HOUSE AKA PEACHY

Heyo, It's been a while since I last played but you've been on most of the time I came back on. You're a chill dude, and If I were to hang out on the server more, I'd like to chill more. Although we haven't been close, I'd love to get to know you more.<br><br>I'm alright, although my sleeping pattern is so screwed up xD<br><br>I don't play any other videogames, although I'm learning how to make beats and music on Logic Pro X

What's up birch!&nbsp;<br><br>Favorite sport is by far Basketball although I used to play soccer (football) and baseball. I stopped both to focus solely on basketball and lifting/training.&nbsp;<br><br>Yep I'm fasting for Ramadan. Contrary to what everyone thinks, it's not that bad and one get's used to it pretty quickly. You also don't do much so that kinda makes it easier.<br><br>Birch, you've been one of my favorite avi friends since I met you. I remember when I was still spammy878 and you were nuclearducky. Those times were great and I truly miss those great memories. You're a great and friendly person, who over time has matured and become responsible. I really don't have anything negative to say, and although I haven't talked to you for real in a while, we should some time. :D
