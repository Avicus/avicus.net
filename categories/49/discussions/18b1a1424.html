Hello fellow minecrafters<br><br>I'm bored, I want to answer some questions.<br><br>I will answer most things, all with 100% honesty. Don't ask me something if you presume you know the answer and my answer won't effect your opinion.<br><br>I'm 13, nearly 14, I play CS:GO mainly and I'm still in ESEA Open. I got back into coding a while ago but I'm bored with it now and I don't have time seeing as I play CS so much. I was a developer for Kohi and Avalanche 2+ years ago.<br><br>I'll probably add more information here when I think of it.<br><br>AMAA

No<br>Yes, but you shouldn't be unbanned soon. You should be banned for a decent amount of time seeing as your ban is 'permanent'.<br>I lost a lot of respect for you when I found out you were going to screenshare me and try to get me account details. I like you but I don't know whether I should or not. You are nice but you can also be annoying. You take a lot of things too serious, you've also carried Apollo twice!!<br>Yes<br>ly2

was never going to get your account details. said that as a joke. what would i do with your account anyways? i explained it on my own thread again, i was going just to try it on one person and never do it again. i honestly ask you to stop thinking of me on that kind of person, we all do mistakes and i would never do such a thing to you. dont lose trust in me

No, I never have<br>You should probably win the tournament. You've improved a lot but you are the only good team who play minecraft a lot. I think you might be at your peak as a team, but you do have a lot of pretty good players. The only teams I see beating you are PPB, maybe us and some OCN teams possibly.<br>I never actually realised you were a good team. Obviously I don't really scrim on OCN considering the fact it's 1.9, but I never thought you could be so good. However, I think the team have done quite well.<br>No clue.<br>Decent with sword and bow, I don't think you're outstanding but you're not bad and you're certainly better than me and kiwi. You're quite chill as well.

You never really came to me as a good or bad player, never really spoke to you.<br>Football, Manchester United<br>Arguments and being staff warned for telling Iron to 'shut the fuck up' on slack. Seriously though, I enjoy working with so many different people.<br>I don't watch a lot of videos from one person, it's more if I see a video that I like in my sub box I'll watch it.<br>I read quite a bit if I enjoy the book I'm reading, I could say I have a favourite book but I like fighting and secret service stuff.<br>I think the whole Berzerk salt stuff has just became a meme, you're weren't that salty. I only dislike the fact that you said no to letting bc play in the final, although that was Pelp's fault and he's dumb af because I probably would've said the same and so would anybody else. I still don't know how you found me toggle sneaking in my video.

You're pretty nice to talk to, shame you're banned because I never really saw you as toxic. You also somehow make it really obvious that you ban evade :D<br>I don't think Proxy will get anywhere, especially considering you are banned.<br>No comment

Good bro!!<br>Yes, we're doing pretty well and I think the team is at the best it ever has been.<br>Very nice, I hope your shit gets sorted out asap :c<br>Hanging out with friends, football<br>Yea, in real life I'm more quiet but I suppose I'm the same abusive cunt when I'm with friends. As with online, I don't take offence to anything lmfao and I'm quite laid back until someone pisses me off, though I'm a lot more calm in real life.

I've never really spoke to you, however on the few occasions I have you are quite nice. You are chill and you are pretty good at mineman. I disagree with your unban, however that's only because Iron is bias and he made Pantai wait longer than you because you were joining Apollo :c You are doing an extremely good job with Grim!!
