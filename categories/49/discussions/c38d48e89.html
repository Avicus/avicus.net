As you can see from the title, this is my second AMA. I thought since i'm starting to get more known on the server, but not to the point where everyone knows me. I'm starting up this AMA for those who want to know me better than they already do, and those who don't know me at all. I figured it's a fun way to connect with the community and get my name out there!&nbsp;<br><br><u>Some info on me:</u>&nbsp;<br><br>Hi, my name is Jackson, i'm 14 and I play MC (obviously), LoL, and am planning on getting CS:GO. I play Soccer (Football) and Baketball and i'm in 9th Gr. to be specific. Check my profile for more details! :D

Screw Bandwagoning. If I had too choose Madrid because you might as well go watch paint dry instead of a Bar√ßa game.

Was going to attempt to 1v1. I like a good challenge and I could definately take something away from it. I don't see why not. It's not for my series unless you request so. 

I've heard you're good and I wanted to see for myself whether it's just people hyping you up too much or if you're 100% legit. 

Skype's an easy way to contact people.
