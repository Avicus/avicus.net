Awesome leader, and remember it's never your fault if we lose a scrim. It's a team loss. We should really talk more +-+!<br><br>Definitely visit Calgary again, and possibly meet up with some of my online friends :c?<br><br>@ Jess<br><br>I'm so hooked on Zootopia right now HAHAHAHAAH<br><br>Twenty One Pilots :c. Or that new Grace girl on AGT, She's goals :3<br><br>Jess, you're basically my bestie! I love talking to you and snapchatting 24/7 haha. You're so nice to work with during the tournament and we should of really met up when we had the chance. Maybe some other time :(. But you are definitely one of my best friends here, we need to talk more!!<br><br>@ Blaze<br><br>Josh :)<br><br>I don't really know, just sounded pretty cool.<br><br>After my run of junior mod I still wanted to get involved and tried applying for referee. I liked the idea of watching live tournament matches looking for cheater, glitchers, hackers etc. It was also a great way to get involved with the competitive side of Avicus.<br><br>Probably from global warming.<br><br>1. Too have as much money as I want.<br>2. Be able to teleport wherever I want whenever.<br>3. To have 100 more wishes ;)<br><br>Super cool and I definitely think you'd be hopefully the next official ;P. I've never really heard you talk before though. :(<br><br>@ Borrah<br><br>Super awesome. I had a great talk with you yesterday and it was really fun playing (or defending should I say) with you. You should apply for junior mod, I think it would fit you very well. See you on Saturday!<br><br>@ ElementalAssasin<br><br>Kind of salty at some times but we've scrimmed together before and had some fun . <br>adventures. <br><br>If you try your hardest. Just don't get too salty over some stuff!<br><br>Yep, all the time.

Super cool and friendly. I remember when we had #ReporterSquad, good times!<br><br>I think will a little more strategy added to their game play. They can improve. You've done well with creating this team.<br><br>Hopefully bigger with a lot more players. Can't wait for updates &lt;3
