We all know the drill xP<br><br>1. What's your favorite color and why?<br>2. If you had one wish to benefit yourself (No donating to charity or anything), what would it be?<br>3. What do you think the meaning of existence is?<br>4. Can you easily do 56/24 in your head? (In under 10 seconds)<br>5. Is your power level over 9000?&nbsp;<br>6. If you were a food, what would you be and why?<br>7. If you were to use a common household object to fight in the zombie appocolypse (Microwave, chair, et cetera), what would it be and why?<br>8. If you could choose to be an animal and still had the power to morph back into a human any time you wanted, what would it be and why?

1. What's your favorite color and why?: Blue, because it is.<br>2. If you had one wish to benefit yourself (No donating to charity or anything), what would it be?: Me getting diamond rank.<br>3. What do you think the meaning of existence is?: 42<br>4. Can you easily do 56/24 in your head? (In under 10 seconds) If the answer isn't 1.33...then no.<br>5. Is your power level over 9000?: It's over 9,000,000!<br>6. If you were a food, what would you be and why?: Lima beans, because no one wants to eat that shiz.<br>7. If you were to use a common household object to fight in the zombie appocolypse (Microwave, chair, et cetera), what would it be and why?: Steak knife. it's a good utensil.<br>8. If you could choose to be an animal and still had the power to morph back into a human any time you wanted, what would it be and why?: T-rex. I can stomp Tokyo to bits now.
