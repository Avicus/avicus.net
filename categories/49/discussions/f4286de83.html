Hey, I ripped this idea off OCN.<br>Apollo was orginially called "The Game Changers" we have played every tourney so far and never finished below 3rd. The team was founded by Pizza334 and is currently lead by Pizza334, JustBudah and Legoche.<br><br>Remember, ask @everyone for everybody and @(playername) for a specific person. We won't reply to anything toxic.<br>Ask away! :)

You're pretty annoying at times and call people out all the time. You really piss me off especially by the fact that you pretty much can't handle any type of good competition AND YOU REALLY ANNOY ME when you try to steal players :P You can be nice though and you're a pretty good player.<br><br>As much as I want to answer, I'm not going to since I don't want a flame war, thanks.<br><br>To be honest every team is so fucking inactive it's too hard to decide.

Depending on the crowd you're around you can either be really nice or the opposite. Insults people a bit too much XP really nice to chill with and piss about with a little.<br><br>Not gonna say but I think yo know who I think does.<br><br>Not sure really, PPB have been really inactive, we (in my opinion) have gotten alot better in the past few months, CBT have always been good.

Best defender would have been Robin until he pretty much went inactive, so I would have to say Zero.<br>For Rusher probably Cyclones.<br>Midlines would have to be Falcon.

This is all based on competitive becsuse you dont need much skill to perform well in public games, in my opinion.<br><br>Defence: It was Robin before he quit. Zero is amazing too &lt;3<br><br>Rushing: lots of good rushers out there, Remy used to be great for CTW.<br><br>Midfield: anyone who can PvP well xP

I don't know too much about the city.<br><br>Yeah of course<br><br>I am for it, it's really good for the community - Badlion is taking over and at the moment it's probably in my top 3 favorite servers.<br><br>I don't want Trump, he is mean to Bloodoh :c<br><br>I honestly try not to give a fuck. It's online gaming and at the end of the day I can find better things to do.<br><br>I'm not far off my GCSEs and I don't know where the fuck my life is going at the moment.<br><br>I play for my team. Nothing else. I found Avicus a while back when I wanted something to do in my free time. At the moment Avicus since OCN updated but to be honest OCN was nearly overtaking Avicus when it was 1.8.<br><br>No. Too many hackers, hackusaters and the community is toxic as fuck. I really think that OCN/Avicus style game play won't grow too much but Badlion style PvP is growing a lot, if CTF there works then I can see it overtaking us and OCN.<br><br>When giving positions you need to think smart. Putting 3 good archers on one side and 3 good melee on one side isn't a good idea. Mix them up, know you're teammates individual skill.<br><br>We have gotten so far, I am really proud and I cannot see myself joining any new team.<br><br>Avicus is nearly dead. The competitive scene has no active teams and it's sad to see the direction the community has gone. I see a lot of OCN players coming here, but their community is nearly dead aswell.<br><br>I find it funny and annoying. It's kinda a compliment but at the same time gets constant and annoying.<br><br>No, sorry but it's weird being with someone you may never meet. Zero and Cat cutie are cute as fuck <br><br>Well you're good at all round PvP and bridging, work on communication and you'll be really good.

If you're in the right crowd, you can be a really nice and funny person. But with the wrong people you're super toxic and I dislike you highly. You're a good player and a pretty decent leader from what &nbsp;I've seen.<br><br>I've already told you<br><br>PPB are super inactive so ruling them out. Apollo just beat CBT but it's still really close. In terms of TDM Cacal are really good so it's quite close.

Sure i'd visit Singapore, if it's hot there :^)<br><br>I kinda like it but the knockback hasn't seemed to change and bucket lag still exists so i think that the community (Kohi especially) have the right to be mad.&nbsp;<br><br>I don't really follow it but i think it's pretty scary that a guy like that could come to power. Hillary Clinton?&nbsp;<br><br>Go outside or watch your favourite TV show. Doing anything relaxing is better than getting annoyed over your internet.<br><br>Life is awesome at the moment. England has suddenly gotten really hot where I live. Apparently hotter than Ibiza :D<br><br>Only really to Moderate, get 1000 monuments and to scrim. I played alot of SG/HG when i first came on but then I quit for ages. I came back when McZone had recently updated to Avicore and have only played Nebula and Nexus since. Avicus Since OCN is 1.9 (that I hate with a burning passion). The Sun will die in like 10000000000000000000000 years, therefore the Earth dying.<br><br>I think that people don't realise how competitive it actually is so I don't think it will become an e-sport anytime soon.<br><br>Remaining calm, speaks clearly, can think on the spot quickly.<br><br>In the last month i think we have improved in TDM alot due to more confidence.<br><br>I think Atlas and the new tournament will give it a chance to grow massively. If this doesn't work i don't know what will.<br><br>Don't care to be honest, pretty funny.<br><br>People can if they want to, i'd never do it because i wouldnt feel confident.<br><br>Your internet is really annoying to fight against xP Really nice and i like your sense of humor :) I think if you just keep playing you'll suddenly get better like most people do.

Really nice (grats on junior). Good at PvP.<br><br>Quite far since there aren't many good active teams at the moment.<br><br>I have alot of favourite songs at the moment.

Can't really tell since so many people hack and I don't really get involved with Kohi at the moment.<br><br>They're the same thing now xP Kohi knockback and hit detection.

they were great, even though i was there for a small amount of time, i enjoyed it a lot.<br><br>breaking mon vs bc in last 2 seconds in the league, double capping vs ec in 3rd place match in tourney, basically every match is actually great with this team<br><br>because sometimes we are salty xd

Constantly calling people out for hacks but to be honest everyone does it now, because so many people do client. Can be chill if you're around the right people.<br><br>Ive only been involved in teams for just over a year now and there have been so many good players that it's hard to really say. Ron is a god at PvP. Robin was a great defender, Iron was a tunnel snake. Overall I'd say Sem has been a really good player.<br><br>Nobody has been scrimming lately so I think we'll have to wait for the next tournament. Maybe the MVP of the tourney could be announced by then tourney team at the end XP<br><br>Nope<br><br>I'm not really sure. I think Apollo play the biggest part in me staying since I started to lost interest after the summer last year. Then I made a ton of new friends and gained interest again.

Really good at interacting with the staff team and community. Got stuff done as a senior so I. Hope you can do the same as an admin. Since you've gotten better internet I have to try pretty hard to kill you lol (your bloody latency is too op &lt;3). GG<br><br>Well my scale to 10 is slightly different from most. Up until some of the veterans left (love you guys) it was killingmycomputer/10. Now we &nbsp;only have Billy talking about his rugby and Leicester winning the league...<br><br>Well Apollo have improved alot at TDM in the last month so I hope it's going to be a good one.

You were alot saltier in the TGC days :P better at PvP now and much nicer.<br><br>With Apollo, ever moment is a best moment.<br><br>I think as a group we're nice people if you get to know is, but with the constant hackusations and insults some of us get too salty and makes the whole team look bad.
