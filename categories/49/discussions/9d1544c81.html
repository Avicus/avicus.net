It's been a very long ride yet I haven't been to all my stops, I hope I never reach my last.<br><br>It all started a long long time ago in magical forest filled with&nbsp;<i>*WRONG STORY YOU NUTJOB*</i><br>Once upon a time? <i>*NO WRONG STORY AGAIN*</i><br>On sunny day in Kylo's bedroom? <i>*NO DUDE WTF EWW*</i><br>I was walking past an enormous Peach named Yas&nbsp;<i>*SERIOUSLY, ARE YOU KIDDING ME &gt;.&lt;*</i><br><br>Way way back in the days <i>*Mmm, go on*&nbsp;</i>I played on a server called VoidCraft with SkyBeats and others and it was a multi-gamemode server with next to no staff, I lived my youthful days there (I'm not like 420 years old now, at least I think i'm not 0.0) and anyway things were quiet with a base of 100 players and the next day AvalancheNetwork moved next door and we merged together and that's when I met TheMasterCow (Para) and Zintenka on AvNk which had Equinox (DTM) and I was hooked instantly. Things weren't whoop-dee-doo forever and soon AvNk collapsed and so did VoidCraft as well. Stranded homeless I embarked on exploring the huge lands of Multiplayer and came across this settlement named Avicus.<br><br>I wasn't a donator or forums user or a teamspeak addict, just your average user playing Nebula... until February. I was inspired by Mango (SweetMango back then) who went from a donator to mod right in front of my eyes, and that is why I visited the staff apps building in central Avicus, sadly my first app was denied and I felt a bit put down (Don't worry Jozz I forgive you ;D) but I saw __SkyGirl__9 get the first interview on the interview session post and that made me determined to get my name on there so I sat on abandoned hills of Avicade writing and improving my second application and submitted in the Avicus post on the final day. When I got a response for Reviewing I was over the moon and soon I got an interview, now looking back it doesn't seem that big of a deal for me, but back then I was speechless, I couldn't make the interview sessions so Andy (Tel) kindly conducted my interview when I was quite ill and would sneeze every few sentences :D, a few days later of me drinking coffee all night getting xp for my first prestige, I got mail from PeachyYas at 5am saying I got promoted and got the job! I woke up my entire family with my horrific singing voice singing my victory song goes like <i>'Don't stop me now haven't such a good time, just give me a ri-ng *voice crack*'&nbsp;<b></b><br><br><b></b></i>Being a late Jr Mod I was never mentored or monitored so I made countless errors and thought I was going to get the boot when my 3 weeks were up, but no... I got another letter from PeachyYas saying I got promoted and I had room on floor #3 in Mod Hotel. Life was fine there meeting my room mates and learning their names, my best friend was Sesspee back then, we would stay up all night and roast marshmallows in the staff lounges.&nbsp;<i>*You're taking to long, skip to your next major change*&nbsp;</i>argh fine... let me see, what would that be? Ahah: Senior Mod interview.<br><i><br></i>It was a rainy Saturday in the staff lounge playing truth or dare with around 5 other mods 3 including myself were to have our interview anytime with the mighty Solurak. I was to go first and my ass were the flowers in Michael's hair smelly, anyway the interview was obnoxious and awkward for me and when I'd finished I went into a public channel with MasterClock and others and said my interview went crap. A few ways later on a MANIC MONDAY Iron said in Slack (a breakthrough technology of Social Media, Ikr bloody amazing fam) that in 10 hours results would be out, I sat there looking at the list working out who the five would be, no way did I ever think I would be one of them, until 4 am the next morning, which I nearly fainted, sung my victory song again (this time with no voice crack, well there was but don't tell anyone c;) and fell asleep just as I got downstairs, so I woke up thinking it was dream until I realised I was in another Slack group, had a sexy af new tag and everyone was saying 'Congrats Blizzem' and a miracle had happened.<br><i><br></i>Many staff meetings and heated discussions later here I am, and I can't thank every single one of you who helped me along the way, from a nobody to a Senior Mod, I mean wow the support was amazing.<br><i></i>I'd like to take the time to thank some remarkable people, sorry if I didn't list you- everyone says that, but I mean it :)<br><br><b>Sesspee</b>: You were like a brother to me back in the days of requesting bans from Mango on TS, I could tell everything without having second thoughts, you were always there for me even when you weren't, hope you get what I mean. When you retired I had a lump in my throat and I couldn't believe my eyes, when I saw you applying in May I was so happy and couldn't wait to talk to you again. Even now we are great friends and I love pissing you off, by changing your description on TS. Thanks for everything, God of Salt.<br><br><b>Jake41901</b>: We would team on Zao and Venemous all the time and do YOLO shots for dayz, the memories are locked in my brain, I'll never forget all the work you put into Avicus too and giving into temptation to chage your name even when you swore you wouldn't, hope you still check the forums dude, you were amazing and are such a great guy.<b><br></b><br><b><span>Peachy</span></b><span>: You've been here way to long and done way to much words can't describe how lucky this server is to have you. Not just as a staff member, but as a friend I can talk to and always trust. When you never respond in public chats on Slack yet talk so much in Senior-Moderators it's hilarious too see the mods in a frenzy :P. Your name is banter, your laugh is banter your skills are unquestionable. Just don't turn into a Mango for me, kthxbai<br></span><br><b>PizzaThePanda</b>: Hey Harvey! Welcome back to the staff team btw. You were the first guy I talk to on TeamSpeak whilst on Blue team playing Embers I, yes I remember well. ;) You're so funny and always make me laugh even when I'm pissed off, you taught me your b0ss defence and put up with my confusion and now I've let Raging play midfield on DTM matches which is where he should play, thanks for everything dude.<br><br><b>Raging</b>: Mate, we've scrimmed countless times and worked great together, I always feel more welcome on TeamSpeak when you're on, and the amount of trolls you've done and the time you put a screamer link in chat I got mad, but I can't stay mad for long cause of the way you take nothing serious, unless it's a scrim vs bc of course and you get your pants in a twist when they get a monument LOL. ^-^<br><br><b>Legoche</b>: Again, on ts you make it so much more enjoyable with your Northern accent, no offence there dude, you're great in scrims and always say things which help the team, you don't carry tho, that's sem. :)<br><br><b>Pelpelajax</b>: You deal with so much shit and your work ethic is outstanding, you organised the first tourney and worked your ass off just for our enjoyment of a tourney. You're a fantastic Senior and you make us laugh when times are dull and always are there to help. I've talked to you about a lot of sensitive stuff in Slack and I can't thank you enough for letting me trust you.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Evocal:</b> First off: LOOK AT MY SICK ASS PICTURE YOU DREW &lt;&lt; This guy is insanely good at drawing + building maps, I talked to you a lot building up to the Senior Mod results and you were always there to help me and vice versa, you're a superb head map dev and I wish you all the best mate.<br><br><b>Rilo</b>: I swear my ears must have burst by now, the amount of time you've raged on teamspeak and trolled in chat is hilarious, it's always fun talking to you on ts and you're a great friend, you wanna hear a long joke? YOUR INFRACTION PAGE!! ohhoho burnnn, jks you're cool dude :3<br><br><b></b><b>SkyBeats</b>: Yeah I know you IRL, but put you here anyway, can always trust you for 2v2's on Kohi when I'm stressed with the staff team and you're a great friend, couldn't ask for anyone else. Make sure when you see ShadowVoid or Sir2Sirosh you 10 heart them for me ^-^<br><br><b>Cyanide</b>: You're so funny when you get mad yet I can take you seriously, you helped build the map with me and you spark up teamspeak all the time it's amazing. You've been a great friend and hope you'll stay here for as long as possible<br><br><b>The entire staff team I've worked with</b>: Peachy, Jake, tel, Pop, Mango, Jozz, &nbsp;Brit, Maddy, Cole, Iron, Iz, Midnite, jav, pav, base, snooz, snow, petlas, tynvale, para, Res luv u bb &lt;3, john, michael, pavlo, steven, kammy, odacity, refuse, porky, joltz, stormz, billy and many many more...<br><br><b>The entire Apollo team</b>: Pizza, Lego, Raging, Daniel, Iron, Budah, sem, Billy, Ingi, ZESTY (Zero+Buster), zegita, somali, peachy, zeus: you guys are the best friends I could ever ask for and the skills each of you have are amazing, I'm proud to be in Apollo, ps: we've already won next tourney bois &amp; girls.<br><br><b>Bad Company</b>: Enough said.<br><br><b>Finally, the many friends I've made on teamspeak</b>: Merlin, Eric, Andrew, Robo, Ques... too many to list.<br><br>No I am not retiring, but I feel I aught to praise all of you who have helped me on my journey! :D<br>Much thanks no regrets<br><br>&lt;3 trend&nbsp;<br>What's with the big space at the bottom? wtf -.-<br><br><br><br><b></b><br><br><b></b><br><i></i>
