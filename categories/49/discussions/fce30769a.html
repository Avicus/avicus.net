Opinions: Where can I start xD You are a chill guy, who usually doesn't punish people, except when it's me. BTW, I don't forgive you for kicking me. Sorry about the story, which all started from that moment, but it will go down in my long memories of this server. I have to say, when you get mad, it's so hilarious. Especially when I hear it in ts... Favorite colour: Red

I don't know you that well, but you seem like a fair mod, who is takes moderating quite seriously. I'm pretty sure you understand I joke a lot, but if I make an "inappropriate" comment, you are always there to punish correctly; that doesn't only apply to me. Overall, you seem like a nice person.

Well, you are quite annoying, as you always call me remy and it slowly gets on my nerves. In to, you are usually arguing with someone, which is not the most pleasant sound. When you aren't being annoying, you seem like a nice person, who is okay at pvp :)

You are a nice guy, who makes me laugh quite a lot. You always get destroyed in sky bridge practice. About you being my favourite, that is questionable.

Eric, you were the first person I properly talked to back in the day, and I remember every day we would hope on to andtalk to each other for hours. Since I got banned and had a break from minecraft, we stopped talking as often and would only talk to each other every now and then. I still consider us good friends, as we had a great past together, and I hope we can talk more in the future and really catch up, like we used to. I have to say, you joining Apollo has changed you quite abit, but it still doesn't mean we can't be best buds like we used to be. Hope to talk to you soon buddy. P.S Be yourself.

The first time I met you, was when I joined your ts &nbsp;channel and you said "who are you?" repeatedly, until I said "who are you?" and you said "Wow, no need to be so rude!" That kind of mad me mad, but since then you have been a very friendly person, which made me forgive you.<br><br>I don't have a favourite staff member, you guys are all quite nice, but some don't understand my jokes xD
