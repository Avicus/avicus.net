Don't know any of the teams too well and it seems like there's only about 5 on the whole server but I'll try.<br><br>1. Bad company 2. Power Puff boys 3. Apollo<br><br>Bad Company has the best shot for OCN tourneys I guess. I think I scrimmed against you guys on some Conquest maps a few months back when I was in Origin and you gave us more of a challenge than some lower mid-tier OCN teams. I'd say that with practice and strats for OCN maps BC would make top 20 as there's not a lot of good OCN teams anymore.<br>Not sure about the rest of the teams as I haven't scrimmed them on OCN.

Better than Juan. Top 50 archers eu, gotta be.<br><br>@Zlik A friend of mine was talking about this game like 4 or 5 years ago and I thought it sounded pretty cool so I bought the alpha. Been playing this game on and off ever since. Probably would've quit like a year ago if I wouldn't have gotten into competitive OCN.

Not at all. TDM is by far our weakest gamemode and like third of our team is busy with irl stuff. Oh well, I don't mind us sucking, in the end it's just for fun anyways. I'd say that we'll probably make invitationals though if we practice as there's not too many top tier teams around.<br><br>@Zegita I don't think I know you, sorry.<br><br>@Scaglia_ I'm guessing you're meaning the avicus tourney and if so, I have no idea.<br><br>@Sevothesavage Don't hack.
