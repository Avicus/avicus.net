Hehe, quite funny actually.&nbsp;<br><br>I was looking for some skywars servers, and i stumbled across a trailer for a Skywars server, it looked very awesome as it had Team Skywars, which pretty much only few servers had ;/.&nbsp;<br>It was skywars.co(old avicus ip). I decided to join it and play skywars, but there weren't skywars lmao. So i decided to play something called Nebula as I never heard of it before ;o. And wallal,&nbsp;<br><br>btw Avicus was one of my first servers ever :O

Back in 2011, I was casually looking through Youtube and I saw a video called X's &nbsp;Adventures In Minecraft cuz it got alot of views so it must be good XD,&nbsp;link here lol<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bh4EexJO4I" title="Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bh4EexJO4I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bh4EexJO4I</a><br>And I decided to watch it ;o I really liked it and actually wanted to get it, but at the time, I didn't have a pc and my dads pc was a potato.&nbsp;<br>So then into 2013, I was scrolling around Youtube and saw a another video, Then i discovered CaptainSparklez, then i decided I want to get it, as I got my first pc at the time, So i asked it for my birthday.. So in 2014, finally got it :D.<br><br>Pretty much in 2011 and because of davidangel64 ,
