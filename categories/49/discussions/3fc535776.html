Yush.<br><br><b>Introduction</b><br>I'm MilkCream, going into 9th grade in early September and prepared for every high school math competition I'll be attending. Obviously, I love math; I've been competing since 6th grade, starting with the AMC8. I also like Piano and gaming. The two major games I play at the moment are Minecraft and osu!<br>I support #JozzForPresident and #PeachyForOwner.<br><br>But enough with that. Ask me whatever you want....under one condition.<br>R. Q. T.<br>Please answer at least 3 of the following if you ask me a question, one of them being number 7:<br>1. How many licks does it take to consume two scoops of strawberry ice cream?<br>2. If a tree is 8 feet in diameter and it is a perfect cylinder, how many times will you need to hit it with an axe to make it fall?<br>3. Name a random number. This includes negatives, nonintegrals, and imaginary numbers.<br>4. Your most hated fruit?<br>5. Jozz for President?<br>6. Frozen Yogurt or Ice Cream?<br>7. What do you think RQT stands for?<br>If you have already answered questions, you do not need to answer questions again.<br><br>Sankyuu~<br>And that's all! Enjoy asking me questions!<br><br>This post was <b>made in China<br>EDIT 1:</b> Clarification made, questions 1 and 2 changed to increase interesting level by 2.

@cinammoncroc000:<br>Dream job would undecided but would involve either math or CS, so maybe a programmer or a mathematician.<br>My mouse is a plain old Logitech mouse.<br>1+1 depends on how you think: It's 2 in base 10, 10 in base 2, and 110 in base -2. Jozz's vice president would be Peachy &lt;3<br>@smitdalt: My favorite genre of music depends on the day: it could be classical, dubstep, or happycore.<br>Cake. All the way. &lt;3<br>How did I get my username? Oh boy, that's a question that I expected but I knew would be a long story. You better be prepared. <br>First things first, I've always loved dairy products such as milk and cheese, and I have no idea why.<br>Now, the story starts when I was randomly searching Kongregate for Multiplayer games. After a while, I found a game titled "Realm of the Mad God." I took a look at it, didn't think much of it, and then stopped.<br>Later, I picked up the game again, and got addicted. At that time, there was a professional guild known as "Mafia" that played this game. They later changed the guild to "Cream."<br>Fast forward a few months, and I started getting bored of the game. My birthday was coming up in a few months, and I had heard of Minecraft being the new "thing," so I decided to get that for my birthday. I decided to come up with a good name. I thought of Cream because of the professional guild and also because of my love of dairy products, but I found out Cream was taken.<br>So, I thought, "what's cream made out of again? Right, milk." So I tried CreamMilk. Didn't work. Finally, I went with MilkCream.<br>And that's the story of my name!
