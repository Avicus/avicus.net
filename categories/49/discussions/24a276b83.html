Hi my name is PokerFace. I've been around since MCZone was here, but I played on another account called miyashiroboyz. This was one of my friend's account that I shared with him. I found the server by looking in the server lists for a good Walls Server. I played with a few of my IRL friends who have moved away from Minecraft now. In case you wanted to know, their names are ThisDuckOnQuack and hell_no_808. I absolutely loved playing Sky Wars after I found the server and especially loved playing on the map with the village. On the other hand, I don't think I ever played any Nebula while Avicus was MCZone.&nbsp;<br><br>After MCZone was done, I found this server called Avicus. I decided to play Nebula and I fell in love with the game. I got to grow and experience the level of skill around me increase. Back then, nobody knew how to "Ninja Bridge" and people covered the monument to defend.<br><br>I've come a long way as a person and a player and I have Avicus to thank for that. Surprisingly, making lots of forum posts and replies improved my grammar substantially and improved my level of diction compared to when I was first here. And believe it or not, this video game community has improved my social skills. <br><br>Ok, now that's enough of my story. <br>Please ask me anything! <br><br>* And not to seek attention or anything, but I turned 15 today :p
