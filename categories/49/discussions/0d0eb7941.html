Apparently I became mod on 10/08/2016. If that's right, then tomorrow I will have been mod for 4 months.<br><br>I'm a mod, mentor, mapdev, and ref. Which means that I ban people, talk to junior mods, manage maps, and watch teams play tournaments. This is the first AMA I have ever done.<br><br>Just a word of warning - if you ask me for my opinion of you, I will not make any attempts to sugarcoat anything.<br><br>Have fun asking me "anything".<br><br><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><i>Just as a reminder, please do not clutter this thread with your personal opinions, or posts that have no questions within them.

You love to complain endlessly about problems, but refuse to think about even lifting a finger to help solve them. You greatly overestimate the importance of activity when talking about the staff team; maybe you should have gotten a clue when you were demoted despite being one of the most active junior mods? You have no clue of what makes for good gameplay in a map; you love the old, terrible maps and hate anything that is of decent quality. On the forums, whenever you try to seriously argue something, you repeat the same thing over and over again without any new input. The appropriate response to most of your complaints on the forums is this:&nbsp;<img src="http://weknowmemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/oh-my-god-who-the-hell-cares.jpg" title="Image: http://weknowmemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/oh-my-god-who-the-hell-cares.jpg">

<b>Opinion?</b><br><b></b>You're nice. You sometimes build maps, I guess, but not many. I appreciate that you decided to give avicus a chance, instead of just leaving due to its current state.<br><br>I used to purposely avoid you because I didn't want to look at your minecraft skin (not your fault or anything), but you've since changed your skin so there's no problems there.<br><br>In general though, I have no problems with you. You're good.<br><b>How do you farm ranks ?

<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>Opinions on me?<br></b></span>I was disappointed when you were promoted to junior moderator, and then to moderator. You don't know the rules; you know some twisted version of them that you have made up in your mind. You are often stricter than you should be with your punishments, and tend to unnecessarily delete forum posts. The only reason I originally wanted you as mod was so that Cammy would be saved from the torture of being the only AU mod, but now that we have a decent amount of moderators in that timezone, there's no reason for you to be here. You do not add anything significant to the staff team.<br><b><i>Update 2/10/2017:<br></i></b><i></i>I'm not going to deny that sometimes, I genuinely believe the above. However, it isn't entirely fair to you. Everybody has their flaws. In my opinion, you have an above-average amount of flaws, and a below-average perception of how to improve. That's not to say you're a terrible moderator; in general you are fine. In my honest opinion, though, you make illogical decisions fairly regularly, and it's honestly sad to see it happen over and over again.<br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>Thoughts on the currently state of the staff team?<br></b>It's steadily improving. The main problem at the moment would have to be a lack of organization, in my opinion. (Or even if it is organized, that organization is not clearly visible.) Also, proper activity reviews for moderators would be nice.</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b><br></b></span>

It's a great project, and I hope you guys succeed with it.<br><br>I'm a bit wary about adding my maps to it, simply because <br>A) it means I don't really have control anymore of where the maps go, and <br>B) I don't really see people using my maps in a context where they are really needed. I doubt any PGM revival servers will get enough players to play 32 vs 32 maps at their full count, so there's no point in me giving any large maps up. Mini maps are simpler to give, I guess, but all my minis are more complex than average, and I don't know if people would enjoy them.<br><br>In terms of the avicus map stack, I guess I don't really know where people would use those maps. Atlas isn't public, and no other plugin accepts avicus xml. It's still a good effort on your part, though.

I want to improve the quality of Avicus maps (which will include some changes you will not like), and also expand things. I'm working on DTE right now, and in the far future I might even make a Flow map.<br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>On a scale from&nbsp;1-10, how "sad" are you about OCN shutting down (1 = I don't care at all, 10 = I want to kill myself)?<br></b>I'm very disappointed, but your scale is wrong because I doubt anybody would kill themselves over the shutdown. If 1 is "I don't care", and 10 is "I'm super sad", it would have to be about a 7. I don't know why, but for some reason I was much more frustrated and sad back when the original shutdown was announced, than I was after the shutdown of PGM was announced by Lifeboat.<b><br></b></span>

<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>Opinions?<br></b></span><b></b>I guess that, when compared to others, you complain more than the average person. You were an alright mod; I wouldn't say you were above or below the average. You were one of the most enthusiastic/active mentors, though, and I do think you helped make the mentor team better. In terms of personality, you can be a bit immature sometimes, but otherwise are fine.<br><b><i>Update 2/13/2017:<br></i></b>You are somewhat of a hypocrite; demanding moderator activity information to be public, when you are horribly inactive within your own department. Maybe you can work on your own faults before endlessly complaining about those of others?<br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>Why do you break my bridge?<br></b></span><b></b>It was fun, and ended up actually being a decent strategy in the end.<br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>Least favorite&nbsp;mod?<br></b>In terms of moderators who could use some improvement, I think SnowSX3 needs the most out of the entire moderator team. However, this doesn't mean I personally hate him, or anything like that.

A lot of your maps look quite bland, and even when you improve them nothing changes. That being said, I do appreciate your efforts. Even though most of your maps aren't top-notch, they are still good enough to put into rotations as filler, which is quite nice. As a person, you are fine.

You abused your powers; at what point did you decide giving a moderator poison potions, and throwing them onto players in a match while in observer mode, was okay? In addition, you're a hypocrite. You keep whining about no moderators being on, while it was you who decided to turn down the position of junior moderator. Well guess what? If you hadn't dropped the mod offer, you could have been a moderator who is online at your time.

<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>Opinions on me?<br></b></span>The day you retired from the moderator team, the staff team became a better place. We no longer had to see the endless arguments that you started from thin air. We no longer had to deal with your superiority complex. I am glad that you left, and am slightly disappointed that you had not retired sooner. You claim that you are intelligent, yet refuse to provide even a sliver of evidence. Ever since you retired from the staff team, you have been quite vocal in criticizing it. It's as if you have amnesia; did you forget that you helped make the staff team what it is? Even if you can no longer start arguments in staff slack, you still have a tendency to get into them over the stupidest things on the forums and community slack. What are you trying to do? Further prove your immaturity? (Mr. James the Period Joke Maker, huh?) It's not even as if you have good arguments for anything anymore. You say you do not care about Avicus anymore, yet stalk the forums and community slack. Please stay true to your word and just leave, or stop pretending that you don't care.<br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>Opinions on me as a moderator?</b></span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">You were a moderator. You performed the physical act of logging onto Avicus and doing the duties of a moderator. Your activity was mediocre, and general moderating skills were fine. In Slack, you had a poor attitude that reeked of a superiority complex (which extended to the forums as well). The only thing the staff team lost when you retired was a person willing to come on and punish people; nothing else.<br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>Why do I get the feeling that I'm in for the biggest grilling so far?<br></b>My guess would be that someone from Teamspeak (</span><img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/38cc237d92724e01ad24f5b0110130c1?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/Acceqted.html" style="color: #FF5C5C">Acceqted</a><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">) said a word or two to you. I don't really care, though. I think you got off lightly, because I wrote this response late at night and as a result may have forgotten a point or two.</span>
