Haven't done one of these in ages, and I want to be more open to the community. Feel free to ask me anything, whether that's a question regarding Avicus and its whereabouts, my duties or a question about off topic shenanigans. I'm reluctant to answer "opinions on me" questions but I will try and remain honest.&nbsp;<br><br>These threads are getting boring to read aren't they?

I've never had a 1 on 1 talk with you so I don't know many aspects that you may have, but you are an individual who can be trusted to get something done, which is seen greatly in the map development team.

You have definitely matured over these recent months, and is able to be quite independent. I appreciate that you take initiative by approaching me if something is concerning you. Another hard working moderator who is trustworthy of handling given tasks. You are also a legend for helping me out with those suggestions.&nbsp;<br><br>I don't see much improvement that needs to be made, but if there is I will hit you up on slack since I believe it's a private matter.

Ah Sam, I remember the time we had playing together back in the thriving days, you are fun to hang around with... Even though I haven't done so in ages.&nbsp;<br><br>Avicus is a network, no, a community that will remain with me for a life time. I've had so many good memories that came from this server so of course, I don't want to see it die. I guess that is the main reason why I've return a couple times, so I can be there advancing the server in any way possible. The community is tight knit, which is a vision that Keenan has had for many years. I'm especially thankful to the developers, especially Keenan and Javi for inspiring and motivating me to continue learning code. They have helped me with issues that I have struggled to get past. I could go on for days about Avicus, but I'll save that for an essay.<br><br>Favourite meme? Probably Camemes!

I find it hard to talk to you because most of the time you say something really unnecessary. You are also very persistent, even though you aren't particularly mature about your approach but then again all of my meetings with you haven't been too pleasant.

Every time I log onto Avicus you are always on. I have faith in you to keep the server monitored when no one else is able to come on. Absolutely legend too, never heard anything negative about you nor will I ever. That being said, your brother is so annoying!!<br><br>Well, in Bali we don't seem to notice its Australia Day, so it has been the usual day by day activities. I return on Saturday so maybe I can celebrate then!

I think you are misunderstood so easily, due to how serious and tense you are. You should try and loosen up, because some people (including me) can't differentiate your jokes between your statements :P<br>That aside, you were a core part of the moderation team. You were never afraid to speak up and be the voice of many. You have very strong opinions which is why I think you clash a lot, and to be honest you shouldn't have retired... Mainly because the conditions and moderating environment is improving rapidly.<br><br>Orange / Crimson<br><br>Halcyon!

Another great friend of mine, and we have known each other for a long time. I remember when we did public rushes together, coordinating pushes with random team members and it really enlightened everyone. It is such a shame you did something wrong as your time as junior mod, I was really hoping you could thrive and improve Avicus with your strong opinions.&nbsp;<br><br>I didn't meet meet up with Kylo? I met up with Mango, though. He was down in Melbourne for a Rubix cube tournament, and it just happened to be close by.

You were a hard working moderator, and Inappreciated the fact that if you wanted some help you approached me about it. It's a shame you retired though.<br><br>Good!<br><br>What I say can be impactful so I don't really want to name them publicly.&nbsp;<br><br>No. I am happy where I am now, and I don't want any added stress to my daily work - especially when I'm entering my final school year. Hopefully I'm just as influencial as a senior than I would be as an admin!<br><br>Avicus has been claimed "dead" for over 2 years now, and look... We are still getting by. The outlook seems positive, and we are currently working internally &nbsp;in ensuring that that positive future is soon, rather than later.

Great developer, any server would be happy enough to have you... I think we are lucky to have you and the other experienced and approachable developers. Although when your drunk, the things you have done/will do/ can do is frustrating :P

Another loyal staff member, and you are responsible.&nbsp;<br><br>Cacal has very good team chemistry, but almost everyone in it is toxic. It used to be fun, which is why I originally joined, participated and stayed, but now it's just a lot of trash talking to a point where it's pointless discussions.<br><br>No, see above why. I'm surprised how I haven't been kicked yet!

Never seen you ingame to judge your player skills. As an individual I think you're too negative and harsh on some people.<br><br>If you improve your attitude then maybe!

Trust you to make an inappropriate question! No I wouldn't - he is taken already.<br>Good question, probably demote myself to moderator since I am very comfortable where I am now; and I don't want the extra responsibility and stress coming into my final school year.<br>You are a funny one. One minute you act like a creep, saying everything with sexual connotations then the next you're serious about everything!&nbsp;<br>Yes, I'll try and find the image... I'm PM you on slack when I do!
