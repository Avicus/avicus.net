<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; ">Hey. I am Alex and used to be an active member of avicus. You may know me by the name of iznot4fun, YoUrFaCeHaHa and plenty of others because of name changes. I have been on here for 3 years (I think) and damn things have changed, I used to be playing walls all day but school has changed and I am doing pretty bad so I need to shape things up in grade 8. I never thought I was going to leave I love this server but I just can't stay active on here. I always thought I was an active user but no one knew me it seemed. I was here when the IP for walls was wallsmc.com and mc-hg.org was for hunger games. I also fell into the CS:GO trap and I may even quit that. (Steam is Atuism) Here is everyone I'd like to thank. (I am saying there old usernames because I can't keep track of all of the names)</span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; "><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; "><span>ebirdy9: We've known eachother for 2 and a half years and for a year and a half we would always talk and have plenty of fun. It was sad after the fountain incident.</span><br><br><span>clockracer: Omai we only met about a year or so ago but you are the nicest person here. You are so fun to talk with, you never get mad. Please talk to me still.</span><br><br><span>jakesandobal: You feel like my long lost older brother. No matter what happens you are always there to protect me, we have been through a few&nbsp;tough&nbsp;times but I am glad we're over it.<br><br>Cacalmarin: You guys all had something special and unique that was just made my mincraft experience so much better. Flooding messages &nbsp;every night through my skype. Wont forget you guys&lt;3<br><br>Tynvale: We never talked a lot but when you do its a fun time keep my skype so I can message you when you get a million subscirbers.<br><br>Petlas: Ayyy really fun person to talk to but timezones keeps me from messaging you :cc<br><br>Can't think of anymore. I still may be in scrims every once in a while and I'll be checking the forums. My skype is ItzMeRekt &nbsp;<br><br>I will probably be back at the end of the school year. Thank you everyone.</span>

Lets go back to the start. When I first met I thought you were a little shit and even though we didnt talk much/play together much, I realised I'd judged you too quickly and that you were actually pretty cool. I hoped you enjoyed and learnt something from your time at cacalmarin<br><br>Have fun with life man, Cacal is here for you anytime, you have my skype feel free to msg me anytime. And if you are struggling at school I can always try and help you in whatever subject you might feel challenged by
