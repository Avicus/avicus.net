Hey Abusive!<br><br><ul><li>You are a chill person. I have talked with you a lot on TeamSpeak. I still remember the day when I was SO shy to talk with you. :) I played with you a lot, despite the fact that our time zones differ. <br></li></ul><ul><li>I am having a battle with myself, whether I should apply or not. I really don't want the people to get the idea that I am a try hard for a position in staff, because it is not true. However, I would like to apply, so that I can hear what I need to improve to be a qualified as leader, not only on minecraft, but in real life as well. I also want to hear how the people judge me as a person. Therefore, I am going to apply for mod. <br></li></ul><ul><li>My real name is Athena-Su :) BTW, I would like you to know that I was NOT named after the goddess Athena, but from St. Athena of the 40 Martyrs. (I am an Orthodox Christian)</li></ul><ul><li>I am now 13 years old :D</li></ul>Thank you so much! I hope you have a great day as well. ^_^

Junr! Thank you so much! :) <br><br>-You are a very empathetic person. I am not going to forget the way you invited me to Emoji. You have a very good sense when you approach people. We talked to each other SO much on TeamSpeak. I really enjoy hearing you speak, and laugh. (You have a very strong yet gentle voice.) You always stay on topic, and don't like to beat around the bush. I like that! Stay like that, and you will create many friends :D<br><br>-I like Diamond. When you first introduced it to me, I was really looking forward to having it. It gives me unlimited amount of backpack storage which is awesome, and it also gives me tons of credits when I get kills. And finally, I can pick and join full teams! Yay! I love Diamond. :) <br><br>-I want to live in San Francisco or even Seoul.<br><br>-Never Be Alone -FatRat<br>&nbsp;Grass Ain't Greener -Chris Brown<br>&nbsp;Chopin -Gazebo<br><br>-I love frogs (they are really cute when the way they leap) , penguins (especially the baby ones), pandas (so cute) , and cats (awesome pet although I don't have one). <br><br>Thanks Junr, you were one of those people who made my experience in Avicus a GREAT one! I hope you have a nice day. :)

Thank you so much Jack! <br><br><br><ul><li>I haven't seen you much around, except on Slack and the Forums. You are very mature, and smart when making replies on the Forums. I really like people when they think before they speak or write. From what I have seen, you are one of those people. Stay like that. :) </li></ul><br><ul><li>Good question! Well, I began my day by going to school. The first day of school was on my birthday! Can you believe that? Then, I might go to the harbor and look at the sea for a bit. I will go with my parents to the mall and have a look around. After that, I will come home, watch a movie with my dad, eat what I want for dinner (pork rinds in spicy sauce), eat the cake, followed by spending time with Avicus, watch a few episodes of dramas, then go to sleep. :) It is really not that special, because I don't have much options since I moved to a new country, and I don't have friends that can spend time with me, so yeah. :D</li></ul><br><ul><li>I like hip-hop very much. It makes me happy when I am feeling down. <br></li></ul><ul><li>I find it difficult to update on time. But on the other hand, I love reading the comments, because it sometimes makes my day. I really want to upload my videos, but sometimes, I can't find the right time. So at the moment, I am taking a break :) <br></li></ul>Lol, I am hearing that a lot these days! Thank you so much, I hope you have a GREAT day.

Thanks Dipper! <br><br>I play flute, piano, and harmonica. I am not good with flute, but I am pretty good with piano and harmonica.<br>I learned piano for 2 years, and harmonica 5 years. I want to learn how to beatbox with harmonica.

Hi Josh! (I will call you that if that is ok.. :] ) Thank you so much!<br><br>I heard you in TeamSpeak a lot as well.

Hey DiabolicForce! Thank you very much :) (sorry. I am sprinkling lots of smiling faces because I am too happy).<br><br>I haven't heard much about you, or seen you in game. But from Slack, I can tell that you are concerned about people. That is very nice :) It builds a great reputation for yourself. That is all I have for now. If you want to hear some more good stuff or improvements, we should play, and talk more with each other. Just like I said to Jessica, I will save all of that for next year's Birthday AMA. :)<br><br>I am now 13 years old. <br><br>I don't really have a dream car, but it would be nice if I could have Volkswagen Golf GTE. It may be expensive, but I think that it is worth it. <br><br>More than movies, I love to watch dramas...but because it is "Fav movie" I will answer it accordingly. I like CJ7. It was a childhood movie for me :) You should check it out. Be sure to download the English subtitles. <br><br>I prefer chocolate, because I am chocolate :) <br><br>Thank you so much for the questions! Have a nice day.

Hi Snow! Thank you so much. <br><br>My favorite memory on Avicus is I was TempBan for team-spleefing. Yeah, I know you might be thinking, "Why?" Well..that was like a lesson to me, not only on Avicus or in Minecraft, but in real-life as well. I learned about the importance of responsibility, respect (through other punishments), and accepting the consequences for my action. It was a painful memory at first, but when I looked deeper into it, I learned that it was a life-lesson. Everyday, I have life-lessons, but this was one of those big life-lessons. Because of what happened that day, I started watching my behavior, words and actions, in minecraft, and in real life. That is how that was my favorite experience. Because it was the experience that turned the days that followed to great memories. Thank you Jiveh, and other Moderators. <br><br>You are very mature, and very smart when using words. You are very active on all platforms, so you can find a way to help Avicus and the people. Also, you have a great personality (although I don't know that much). In your videos, I really like it how you stick to your opinion towards the end. I hope you continue to be like this. Because in a way, this type of attitude is what upgrades the server. Not through plug-ins or codes, but in mentality. <br><br>Thank you so much! I hope you have a great day as well.

Hi Input! Thank you so much!<br><br>You are a really fun person in scrims and in game. It is really fun to PvP, build, talk, and listen to music together (though MusicBot in TeamSpeak). You are very considerate, and empathetic person. Also, you have respect. :) I am not going to tell you where I saw that! xD<br><br>Things are going great! I have a school, home, a great family, a great server to play in, a diamond rank, and lots of friends within the server. I got my birthday present as well! So everything is really ok (for now). <br><br>Thank you so much! I hope you have a happy day. See you in game! :)

Hi lgmatias! <br><br>I don't really know about you. So I can't say much. I have seen you around in game. You are a very cool person. You are nice to others, and you have a great sense of humor. I want to know more about you. I don't want to make any assumption. I hope we can get to know more about each other! I will answer your question more specifically, next year. :) <br><br>Ahh...here we go. She is has very good sense. In minecraft, in Forums and Slack. She is a really nice person. She answers my question with patience, and respect. She is like the girl version of Josh, tbh. :) <br>I haven't talked much with her on TeamSpeak, BUT, I am looking forward to talking with her soon. <br><br>Mmm...Jessie.....she is really fun, and cool person. I think it is really comfortable to talk with her, she is has a really similar personality type with mine. Like Liz, she is very patient. I hope she continues to be like that. Both Liz and Jess are great role models for Jr Moderators, and Avicus. I hope they continue to be like that. <br><br>Allah...now, before I answer that question, I will mention that I am an Orthodox Christian. I respect the beliefs of Muslims, and other religions. I don't have many opinions for Allah. God and Allah, I don't see them as equals, but I believe that even if I don't believe in Allah, I should still respect other people's beliefs. I think Allah is ok. :) Sorry, but I can't say much...

Hi Emily! Thanks a lot!<br><br>I was really happy to hear that there is another "half-Korean" in Avicus. I think that you are really nice, but really shy. I haven't seen you a lot in game, so I can't say much. I want to get to know more about you before I say anything. I hope we can get closer, so that I can answer your question for specifically on my next year's Birthday AMA. <br><br>Thank you so much! I will see you in game.

Hi Eric!<br><br>Hmm...I think that you are a nice, funny, and cute person. At the same time, you are very daring. To be honest, after the experience on Quintus, I started to feel uncomfortable around you. But again, it was my choice, so I will take responsibility for it. :) I am comfortable now, so whenever you want to talk or something, let's talk on TeamSpeak :) <br><br>See you in game!

Hi Crazy_Creeper! Thank you so much! <br><br>I was searching for South Korean servers on minecraftservers.org. I found Avicus. The first game I played was DTM in Yin Yang. I really loved it so much, and that is how my story in Avicus started. <br><br>My favorite map is Campi Erbosi, and Quintus. I like them equally. :)<br><br>I agree with the terms and rules. There is nothing I would like to change really. Every rule has its own cause and reason. <br><br>I haven't talked or heard about your personality. The only thing I know is that you are an awesome PvPer. I just can't beat you for some reason. :) I want to learn more about you so that I can answer this question next year :) <br><br>Thank you so much! I hope to see you in game.
