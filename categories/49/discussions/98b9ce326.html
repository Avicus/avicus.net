I really like you as a leader but you gotta learn to strat like rocky and xtra (sam used to be able to do it, but he's banned). Ask rocky for lessons.<br><b>Am I better than Rocky and Poofy?:&nbsp;</b>You're better than both of them and me combined lol.&nbsp;<br><b>Do i have better memes than Mongul?:&nbsp;</b>No. The only memes i see you posting in discord are these weird "Joeys world Tour" memes. They aren't funny. They are sad. Do you even watch that guy???<br><b>Favorite Food:&nbsp;</b>Chocolate or Tacos

For some reason you were accepted quicker, and I never really got to be part of the team for that long. I like you as a person, you are nice but your voice changer is annoying (do you still use that thing? I remember in jala you would always log on with some squeaky animal voice lol). Your pvp is also getting better, and it has been better than mine for a while (which isn't a big achievement).
