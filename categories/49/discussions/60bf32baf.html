Eh, its unlikely. My interest in minecraft has diminished really. Only reason I would come back (to the staff team, that is) is if they desperately needed me or something.

For your first question, the most honest answer is that (for personal reasons) I was no longer fit to continue my role as director of staff and admin. So I took a break, thinking I would be able to return in a month or so. That didn't really happen so I ended up getting demoted.<br><br>The reason I'm lonely is cause 'I aint got nobody.'

IKR I love it so much, its way too cool. Was even more stoked when I found out the guy who did it is one of my favourite youtube animators and did the rhythm is magic videos.<br><br>My surname is Howse. Not sure how 22 came about really. Back in the day my photobucket account was HOWSE22. (Probably from suggested usernames or something) Probably came from that. :P&nbsp;<br><br>I've had a few. And I guess there would be too many now.&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;</i>For a while now its been the yogscast and there whole family of entertainers. Probably sounds weird, &nbsp;but I am quite fond of their entertainment style and it inspires me to possible do that sort of thing one day.&nbsp;<br><br>The best dream I've ever had is kinda private and personal so I wont put it on here, sorry. :P<br>AND NO ITS NOT SEXUAL WHATSOEVER. &gt;:c

Two primary things. The first was having to deal with so many immature people daily and the fact that it would never change. Second, its a generally boring game imo. Theres just nothing to it for me anymore. I guess its given me everything its got and I'm tired of it.

Jesus, thats one hell of a question.<br><br>Well, it all started around march-april 2013. Essentially by that point I was fully aware that it existed and there was a fan base outside of its demographic, but it never struck me as something worth my time or interest in. I essentially dismissed it really. Never rejected it, just didn't care much for it.&nbsp;<br><br>So one day I found one of the songs from the show. (Winter Wrap Up) Being a fan of cool music and decent animation it was a very big shock to find out that I was actually enjoying it. One thing led to another and I was watching episodes of season 1. By the time I had finished up season 1, I was both incredibly confused and very curious about this new guilty pleasure I had discovered.&nbsp;<br><br>I did the research about the fandom, the show, its background, poured through pages of the &nbsp;MLP wikia. Essentially what I always do when discovering something new. Eventually I had become enough of a fan to finally become a member of the fandom (and while I'm not a great fan of the name) I essentially became a brony.

If you could replace one video game character with yourself (ex: replace mario with yourself), which character would it be?<br><br>Also, same question for an actor. :D
