<b></b>Hi everyone,<br>Today im gonna introduce myself. Lets start off with my name. My indie game is Koning_van_psy, my real name is Lukas. I am from Belgium. a great country they have awesome chocolate by the way. I am 14years old now. Im an very online player. I tried to help everyone who is getting killed by hacker, helping building on things, and i am also a good friend of some players on avicus.<br><br>I want to say sorry to all of you guys. I have sweared, cross teamed, advertised and lots more. Im now 3 days banned and it is a hell i believed that i won't get banned for this but instead I've got banned. So to all of you guys who are reading this i hope i can say sorry to all the people who I've disrespected. I know i was wrong, but i can't live without this server I've i didn't give something for this server then i shouldn't spam the mailbox of everyone ;)<br>Thank you for reading<br><br>Lukas,

Hi Lukas!<br><br>You know, Avicus will become more strict when it comes to this, you can't break the rules over and over again and expect nothing to happen.&nbsp;It's why&nbsp;I&nbsp;won't accept your apology until I see you change to "the better". <br><br>I don't think the staff appreciate you spamming them either, it will take time, just wait it out. I'm sure they won't forget you!<br><br>/ Santa

Sorry your ban might stay you can't break the rules over and over and still expect to be able to still go even when you should know your not allowed to do what ever you did wrong . If you didn't want to get banned you should have stopped breaking the rules in the first place instead of carrying on I know you may not of thought of this at the time but you surely had idea something like this would happened soon enough .Think about your actions before you do them thanks .
