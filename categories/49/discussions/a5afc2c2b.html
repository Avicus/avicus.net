Apology accepted. But its not good to be a rude person.<br><br>If you act like this IRL, then you will not get anywhere. Just do what you guys can to better yourselves.

Fezbla is still here, as this was a group leave I'm going to lock it for being false. If you state you're all gone, then don't say that you are when said person still plays.<br><br>As for Cezbla, as much as I want to forgive you, I can't. I had faith to restore your personality and put you on the right track, through emotional and economical support ranging from the general words I tried to put forward and a Minecraft account to contribute. Then, I was repaid with a lash out due to consequences not being accepted and generally, even though I tried to help you, it hurt and showed that the bad outweighed the good. You can keep using the account. I'm not motivated to speak to you anytime soon even if you take initiative. Hopefully you understand.
