Because I felt it would be nice do make a last AMA at Christmas.<br>Well, it depends. I like answering question regarding an opinion on a player, but, after I state what is wrong with a player or why I don't like him or her, I always get negativity.

Honestly one of the best players I have ever played with. Other then the fact that you are nice and smart, we share the same passion and we want to make people better in Apollo(Ryan, Eric, Eteh, Seuth and Bloodoh) because we think they have potential. I really like working with you because we are always on the same line. You always got my back, eventhough I'm not always right. Thanks for that. As a player you are really fucking consistent. This is something not many people can say. Other then that, you are a great anchor and as I said before, you are a good leader. Keep up the good stuff.

Hi Spookz,&nbsp;<br>I consider you as an experienced and allround player. You are good at what you do and somewhat underrated. I treat you as if you are a teacher for people in Apollo to get their skills up. You do good in that. As a person I used to dislike you because you cried about everything, now you are grown up, you know(most of the times) how to handle a situation properly which is something not many people have(raging) You are one of the people in Apollo, Avicus in general and even in the OCN community that knows how to play the game. Their might be some people that are better then you in pvp, you just out play them by using your brain. I'm glad that we have you on the team.<br><br>Mac. PC sucks dick

Hi Eric,<br>You are actually a really nice person, even though you sometimes might not come over like that. I respect you for the fact that you have improved on a scale no one has ever done. The only thing you have to do in order to become a top tier player is learn how to play the game, or the OCN style of game, since everyone is able to play Avicus without having gamesense. You are also willing to learn and improve, this is something people say they have but in the end they actually don't. Luckily, you do want to actually learn an improve and I'm glad we have you in Apollo and I would not want to swap you out for anyone else. &nbsp;You are also the person that always helps people out, thanks for everything Eric.

Hye Tazz,<br><br>You used to be a cock around old bc times, now, wince you actually grew up( a bit) you are a fun dude to hang around with. I love how you were the only moderator to actually ban ''known'' players. You were also one of the only moderators that actually stated his own opinion, most of the moderators are too scared to share their own opinion or they are too retarded to come up with their own opinion so they copy someone els' opinion. You are a good player, especially in rushing. Let's hang out more in ts.

I think that you are NuclearDucky but that's kinda all I know about you, sorry. I think that you used to build maps and play Avicus because it was fun, I now think that you only play on this server because you are a moderator on it and you don't want to let the staff team down, which is a good habit, I guess.

I have no clue who you are, sorry. Considering that you are in Jalapenos, which isn't a good team and considering that you like trade kills on Avicus public(looking at your kill stats) I don't think that you are a good PvP'er. You might be good at rushing, but then you can't really do anything because you are not good at PvP. Sorry if I sound like a dickhead but this is my honest opinions on you. If I was you I would sweat my ass of OCN in order to become somewhat decent. Though, I now think that it's too late to get good at the game considering that both Avicus and OCN are dying.

Sup Eteh,<br><br>You are one of the people I really used to dislike in the old days, back when lego and me used to shit talk you in TS ;) Though, you proved yourself to not be a childish player who is somewhat decent(Carrying, or whatever his name is) You actually have loads and loads of potential. Lego and I just have to give you the right shape to play in, which we are currently discussing. I don't know if you realise, but, you are REALLY good. Same counts for Seuth. DaFrozenBlaze is on a different stage, he still has a lot to learn.

Sup my nig,<br><br>Based on your character you are my best friend on this server, pretty gay that I used to fanboy you in the old days and look what we are at now, I told you this before and I will repeat myself; we could be really good friends IRL(sounds pretty gay but ok) we are interested in the same subjects and I like talking about them. I think that if we play on the same side and we are somewhat warmed up, we could beat any team of 2 wherever. Other then that, you are a fucking chill monster.

Hi Ghost,<br><br>When I first got introduced into the OCN style of Minecraft and to it's community, you were the first OCN friend I had. I never knew people could be this nice like you were. That probably came because I joined mutilation and I became good at the game. We haven't talked in a long time, a shame tbh. I started to focus me on Grim while you started to focus on getting ref. I don't know how you think of me, I think that we are cool.<br><br>My own santimal mashup.<br><br>Wow, this is a difficult one. Hmm, I would say old grim, or mutilation because of the randy's most of us were and how we were just a group of friends. Now though, I prefer grim with people like steyn and andrea.&nbsp;<br><br>Kinda late but whatever, merry Christmas Ghost. :)

Sup Jive,<br><br>You were also one of the players in the old days that I used to fanboy. Back in the day you used to be one of the best players on the server, later though you started playing worse, sadly. You were a really nice guy in the bc days, one of the only players in bc that wasn't a dick to other players, later(now) you grew up and started acting different which I totally get, it's normal. We used to talk a shit load, it kinda ended though, a shame tbh. Hope to speak you sometime and good luck in life!

I can't really give an opinion on you basing from when I talked to you cause I never did and I don't think I will soon. You seem to be that person that keeps trying to get into something(Apollo lfm) which is really annoying. I get that you really want to be in a good team like Apollo but it lowers your chances if you keep applying all the time. It has come to the point that lego and me don't even consider reading applications, we most of the times just look at who the person is and what they do/have done. If can give you a good advice I would stop posting an application every 1 month an start working on your skill level. Lego and me don't like players that are attention seeking. Sorry if this is a rude reply but that's just the only opinion I have on you and I actually try to help you. I said this multiple times on this thread already, if you want to get good at the game; start focusing on OCN and try to understand what would be the smartest to do in any situation.

I'm guessing that you are bennieboy and that you came back after a long periode. I don't really know you apart from the fact that you are annoying as hell in game, but that's probably a sign of the puberty change you are going through.

Well, I don't really have an opinion on you since I've never talked to you. I do know for a fact that you are the best defender on this server and that you are a very loyal player. We should talk more since this is kinda all I know from you. We'll see. You have the privilege of everyone looking up to you since you are a good defender, don't make them regret that.

Hi Ambi,<br><br>My experience with you is like a rollercoaster. 3 years ago you were a dick to me because I used to accuse every single player that killed me. 2 years ago we were pretty good friends and we talked a lot. The past year you have been a toxic player and somewhat nice at the same time. You made friends with the wrong people and started acting weird. It seems like you got yourself no track again by playing an OCN tournament. I think we are all good now, but it wasn't like that in the old days. Good luck living your life.

Oh, hi Jozz,<br><br>I will always remember you as the person that made Avicus good(with a few others). You were such a good admin and I liked how you handled certain situations. It's a shame that you left and what has happend to the server. I remember the first time I met you: you were about to ban me because I was using an ''autoclicker'' I remember I typed in /list a couple of times and saw that you were in game so I started up my recording program and luckily you didn't ban cause that would mean I would never get to play my favourite server. I don't know if you realise, but, you as an admin was one of the best choices Avicus has made. Good luck in life since I assume that you don't really care about this server/game anymore.
