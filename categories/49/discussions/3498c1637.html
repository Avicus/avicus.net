I live in Texas. My name is Noah. I like steak. My favorite drink is probably vanilla coke. I like both cats and dogs, rip. I guess banana is my favorite fruit? Favorite color is cyan. Uhh, I'll scapegoat and say I like a few equally. Don't make me butcher the names please! ;w;<br>And I think you're cool, you've been pretty nice to me. Good at the game, and pvp. I see you around a lot! Haha.

On Minecraft? Yeah, I was Darklight55z for a while. This username is what that one originated from though. Texas is alright, I don't like the heat much. But I also dislike the cold so I'm screwed either way I supposee. I haven't really seen anyone famous, unless you count 'YouTube famous'. xD<br>I don't have any particular aspirations in careers right now. It's not very good. Maybe one day!
