1. If you were to use a common household object to fight in the zombie apocalypse (Microwave, chair, et cetera), what would it be and why?<br><span>2. If you could choose to be an animal and still had the power to morph back into a human any time you wanted, what would it be and why?<br>3. What's up with the cinnamoncroc? xD<br><br>I'm&nbsp;really&nbsp;tired right now and don't feel like making up more questions, so if I remember, I'll&nbsp;just give you&nbsp;some&nbsp;more&nbsp;in&nbsp;the morning :3</span>

1.) Hmmmm... probably a baseball bat that I keep in my room. Effective weapon in emergency situations and provides occasional comedy effect.<br>2.) Either an eagle (to fly and stuffs) or a monkey (because I always wanted to know what it would be like to have a tail...)<br>3.) cinammoncroc000 was an account name that I made when I was in 4th grade for... guess what... my new WEBKINZ account.<br>...<br>yeah um I've carried that name ever since then.<br>I love cinnamon, but the croc... well... it's short for crocodile but idk rly.
