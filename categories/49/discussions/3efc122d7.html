Beginning this isn't easy. I could go for something really generic and be like, "Hi Avicus! My name is ___." I don't want to be that basic, but I also kinda do. So, I'm just going to treat this like an application, and see how that goes.<br><br>IGN: Nectorist (Long story), used to be augustboy01 (I was, like, 11 at the time I made it, don't judge.)<br><br>Actual Name: David<br><br>Life Story: This is the part where I put in an akwardly-placed sob story. I don't have one on me, so I guess that's a good thing.<br><br>How I found Avicus: I don't even know. It was, like, 3 years ago. I was just looking for pvp servers and I found this one. Nothing magical or special, kinda makes me sad.<br><br>How my experience on Avicus has been: Well, I was addicted to the sever when it was McZone. I'm not even kidding. I would play for hours on end, finding new ways to lower my k/d. When the reset came, I started losing interest. I gave up MC altogether for a year to focus on sports stuff. (I play football, basketball, and run track.) After I finally had time to do stuff, I realized it was actually kinda boring. My Xbox was being borrowed by my friend, and I had gotten 7 accounts banned from Club Penguin. I decided to load up MC and check out a couple of servers again. I remembered Avicus, so I loaded it up and started playing. I've continued playing ever since.<br><br>Hobbies: Gaming, sports, reading, talking (I am a conversationalist extraordinare. If that sounds fancy enough.)<br><br>Favourite Music: Rap/Hip-Hop<br><br>Favourite Movie: Justin Bieber: Never Say Never <br><br>Height (This is a fun one): 6'6<br><br>Credit Card, Home Address, and SSN: 123456789098, 2014 Forest Hills Drive, 133742069 <br><br>If you think I'm an interesting enough person, ask me a question. If not... I don't blame ya.

Tough one. I would probably say an Amazon River Dolphin. They seem like really cool creatures, and I want to see one in-person.
