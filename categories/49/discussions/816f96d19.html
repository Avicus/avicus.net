Hey there, and welcome to The Avicus Network! Here's a couple things you should know if you don't already :)<br><br>Avicus currently has three different donator ranks. Gold, Emerald, and Diamond. Make sure you review the rules, which can be found here <a href="http://avicus.net/rules" rel="nofollow">http://avicus.net/rules</a>. Currently Avicus has Nebula, Nexus, CTH, Avicade, Walls and Elimination for minigames. For a full list of current Avicus staff members, visit this link <a href="http://avicus.net/staff" rel="nofollow">http://avicus.net/staff</a><br><br>If you wish to create a map for the server make sure that you have it in a void world and that it is unique! You can upload your completed map to the forums under the "Map Releases" section with a download to the map, pictures of the map and a YAML. You can visit the Avicus YAML docs to learn all about how to create YAML's!<br>(<a href="http://docs.avicus.net/" rel="nofollow">http://docs.avicus.net/</a>)<br><br>If you have further questions, don't hesitate to ask anyone, and I hope you have a wonderful time on the server and the forums :)
