It's cute that you're bringing this to the forums, but since you bring it up, I'll give you my 2 cents.<br><br>What he was doing is not possible to do legit, plain and simple. Not only is he not doing the technique of Breezily bridging correct (which you need to in order to do it legit), but he jumps as well. Slow down the video and watch how fast he places the blocks when he jumps, and one cannot argue that it is possible to place blocks that quickly. I know people (Breezily and Epsilpha) who can click about 20 CPS, maybe ever so slightly higher, who cannot do what he was doing in that video. Clicking much faster really isn't possible without some sort of external thing to increase it.<br><br>Thinking he is legit is just naive.

You asked a question to provoke a response, and you got one.<br><br>umm... No where in my response do I say getting 20+ CPS was impossible, I said getting MORE than that was not really possible. Breezily and Epsilpha ARE legit, and click pretty much as fast as humanly possible, and even THEY can't do what he does in that video.
