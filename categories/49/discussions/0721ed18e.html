Our dreams mystify us&nbsp;and often leave us waking up confused, disoriented, frightened, or perhaps very, very satisfied.&nbsp;Freud,&nbsp;of course, proposed that our dreams&nbsp;represent&nbsp;unconscious&nbsp;&nbsp;wishes that we’re afraid to express in our waking life. The most recent explanations aren’t totally incompatible with this theory.&nbsp; According to the&nbsp;activation-synthesis model&nbsp;dreams are stories that we create out of the random stimulation that occurs in the brain while we&nbsp;sleep.&nbsp;The updated activation-integration-modulation (AIM) model proposes that dreams reflect the activity of regions of the brain active at a particular moment as well as the activity of particular neurotransmitters. This&nbsp;neuroscience&nbsp;<span>explanation regards the stories we make up as reflecting, in part, our hidden desires, but they are not primarily the products of repressed wishes.<br><br><br><br><br>Thanks! Means a lot!<br></span>
