I don't see how it can offend anyone, weed is a plant. If someone can get offended by a plant well.. but it's the internet so. Someone will be offended

It doesn't offend me. When I see your name, I think of the weeds in my garden, killing my plants. It just matters how other users view your name and how they take it in.

Heeya&nbsp;ChocolateWeed,<br><br>Don't worry about your name, it's appropriate and the staff don't punish you for it :)<br><br>And all the people that posted useless comments, you don't have to comment/reply. He/she asked if his name is appropriate before going on the server and risking being punished and he/she has a right to do so. Rather ask before than being sorry afterwards.

I absolutely see no way for someone to be offended by your name. Unless the person gets offended by chocolate or weed, nope

I would ask a staff member&nbsp;<b>before&nbsp;</b>changing your name, just in case it isn't allowed. &nbsp;Otherwise it's too late. But other then that, by the looks of it, the staff approve.

Thought you left because you had no time?<br>Also who the heck removed my post? It broke no rules... this topic even isn't necessary, if the player was concerned about having an inappropriate name they should ask before they change it.
