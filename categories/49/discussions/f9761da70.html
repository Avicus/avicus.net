Hey y'all, I'm not new here but it's been a while since I was active here (used to be HoboMaddy then it turns out I'm ftm so I changed the name to be genderneutral), I'm not even sure if the people that are still active here from when I was an annoying 10 year old even remember me tbh. Hopefully I can make some new friends this time around so AMA I guess
