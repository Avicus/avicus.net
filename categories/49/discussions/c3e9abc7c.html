Elsa cuz good friend! Jozzy used to be, but inactive pvp tore us apart ;((((<br>Obviously. &nbsp;<br>From when I've spoken to you, you seem like a pretty cool person, though we haven't spoken much.<br>Some peoples' kb = just screwy, but not as bad as some people say tho.<br>I joined a few months after MCZone, so Avi xd&nbsp;<br>Mod is actually nice, I get to ban cheaters and detecting/exposing players, which I enjoy. It allows me to make change for the server, which I also enjoy. The responsibility that comes with it is nice as well, I have thick skin so I can take hate and backlash, so that doesn't bother me much at all.&nbsp;<br>Dawson is pre chill most of the time, can be a bit toxic, hence the infracs and his ban, but he isn't nearly as bad as some make him out to be.

You're pretty relaxed, fun to chat and hang with, have a sense of humour, modest, always calm and collected. Though you don't talk as much as other members, you add a certain irreplaceable element to the team as a person and player.

Pre cool Aussie I used to be better friends with until inactive pvp. Fun to joke with, good banter and fun times with you. I remember the old days of avi with u as admin which was pretty fun. Overall considerate, nice person who can take a joke and deal tons, fun to jam with and always an interesting character to have around, someone irreplaceable for the community as a whole.

You have been pre cool every time I have talked (breifly) with you, you never seem to lose composure with other players and don't seem like a bad person at all&nbsp;<br><br>Actually, it references my ADHD mostly, since the brain of someone with ADHD requires more stimulation to remain entertained, which causes lack of focus and the wandering mind it's characterized by.

You're pretty chill most of the time, fun to talk to, always willing to learn more in the mod position and are a decent person who has been improving further as of late. Can take a joke, can dish them out, overall fun to hang around.&nbsp;<br><br>For PPB, if BC did exist, I'd give it a try since ik most of the people in there and enjoy talking to the members. Currently? I honestly don't know, but it Apollo would seem to be my next best bet, as it's the next best team and I'm alright with most there, though sometimes the attitude can be rather poor, I'd hope I could improve that. I'd only stay/join if that changed tho.&nbsp;<br><br>Eclipse, the next active and good US team I know is PureBlox, so I'd give it a shot. That or Padlock, since Greg is c00l and it seems like an alright group of ppl that are a good team.&nbsp;<br><br>Kohi. I dislike Badlion due to lower skill gap, awful maps, very abusable kb, though the further selection of fun ladders is nice.

I'd like to think I'm a good player who worked hard to get where he is. I can be determined or lazy. I like to think I'm usually pretty nice, that is until you overstep your bounds, then I'm not exactly the type of person you screw with purely for the fact I am a spiteful ass when pushed too far and I know how to hit people where it hurts. That being said, I am usually very laid-back and relaxed, I have a very long fuse and it takes quite a while to get there. I like to think I'm a pretty good debater, I'm not that humble, but I at least try to be modest.&nbsp;<br><br>I'd say I'm a good, loyal friend, I'll always stick up for my friends and help them anytime they need it. I'd also say I'm a decent person, can take a joke, dish them out as well and isn't too bad to hang around. I can be very sarcastic, I am very opinionated and stubborn, but I take my time to formulate my opinions at the same time. Sometimes I try too hard to help others (hence the pvp tips meme) and that can be my downfall. I'm usually very moral as a person and hold my values high.

I haven't scrimmed with you in a while, but I remember you being flexible and doing odd jobs, I guess you could call them, during scrims. I remember you being quieter and letting Robo lead, which can help and hurt the team.&nbsp;<br><br>Solo player you're regarded as good, you used to hack, but idk if you still do.

1. I wish I had actually looked around before turning with a plastic hockey stick over my shoulder and hitting my cousin in the head, cracking his skull open. But it was when I was small, I have an excuse (oops).&nbsp;<br><br>I try not to live with regrets though, what happens happens and letting your past drag you down is a waste of your energy and bars you from the happy moments you could be having instead of wallowing in the past. Mistakes happen, shit happens, but it's what forms who we are today and I wouldn't change my past if given the opportunity.&nbsp;<br><br>2. Why a lot of girls can't just be straightforward. Not all girls are like that, but I just tend to see it often. For me it's if you want something just say so, no better way to get what you want than that.&nbsp;<br><br>3. I usually get addicted to certain genres and flip between the main ones I like. Main two types are Rock/Punk/Metal and EDM.&nbsp;<br><br>4. You are an interesting person in many aspects, you can be crazy, funny weird and spontaneous, which despite the negative implications behind some words, you manage to pull off and make appealing. You can be rash with what you say and let your emotions get the best of you, which can lead to you hurting others without thought. You can be rather shy and evasive, which from my experience, makes things like apologies hard for you, which can be very detrimental to the bonds you build with others, regardless of the degree or type. Imo, not apologizing is generally seen as not having the respect to bother apologizing to the person, them not being worth your time and not owning up to your actions, which frustrates people like me. You should have more confidence in yourself, you have a lot of positive traits going for you, own those and be proud of who you are, regardless of what others say. Now for the more negative pieces. You can be a good friend, but can be touchy and shut others out as well, which can be pretty annoying when someone allows you to open up to them, but you don't allow the same. One thing that really annoys me personally is how you seem to choose to be ignorant sometimes or don't try to understand certain things at all.

Now that I can actually post:&nbsp;<br><br>More chill than most people think if talked to on TS. A bit toxic, but not too bad in TS, once again. Can take a joke, harsh, mocking, etc. or not (which is definitely nice) and can joke around as well. Actually nicer than most presume, welcoming air to those who are new to the friend/team group and takes initiative when needed. You can be blunt, which some people will take offense to easily, which I understand and get completely. I imagine you as the type of person who thinks being around the bush is dumb and would rather get to the point, cut the bull.&nbsp;<br><br>Sounds interesting (not the negative version of interesting rofl), would be down for it depending on where you pass though (Toronto area is where I'm at)&nbsp;<br>.<br>def 11/10

1.&nbsp;<u>I personally like Snoopy a lot because:</u>&nbsp;<br><br>a) major respect for being able to drop ComboDombo and other famous pvpers back in the day with 200ms (him being Japanese)&nbsp;<br><br>b) actually one of the nicer people in a community of pure toxicity&nbsp;<br><br><u>If you were to ask me my favourite to watch fight and favourite style:</u>&nbsp;<br><br>Dualzz, he has a brain, makes nice packs plus fun as hell to watch him circle and take no kb&nbsp;<br><br><br>2. Likely Eclipse in it's current state, large roster of very good players and active enough to be very good. PPB before lavablock, ihze and glitchy quit (also when silent was active) is a close second, very good roster and well put-together team which was actually active.&nbsp;<br><br>3. Very chill, modest and is easily approachable. You are understanding and logical when reviewing things like video evidence of hackers and debates, can hear both sides and evaluate, but don't get in on discussions much, which is kind of a waste imo. You have a tendency to doubt yourself unnecessarily in some situations and don't seem confident in your abilities, too modest for your own good. You can keep things on the down-low, are trustworthy and loyal. Have more confidence in yourself and you will greatly benefit.
