Recently in the last month or so,<br>I joined the Avicus network.<br>I love the community and everyone in it.besides Avicus, I love being active, hanging with friends, love bmxing, long boarding, hockey, soccer, playing the piano, making girls laugh, working out<br>doing stupid stuff at school that gets you in trouble and playing on the Avicus network! I don't know much of computors and stuff but all I know is that mines pretty bad, along with my internet and mouse. I will get a new computor and mouse shortly because I love playing on this server and hope to meet each and everyone of you guys in game! Your friend, Oraporo
