Hi Lego<br>As a player you're really good skilled at bow and sword, being able to lead and get others to work as a team.<br>As a person you can be really nice, but you're those kind of people who can become quite toxic at times. I believe you would be the type of person I could talk to if I ever needed one. Also still grateful that you gave me the opportunity to be in Apollo.

I just like it. Can't really explain it. I did stop playing for around a year but it wasn't too hard to get back, especially with the new games. People keep saying it's a kids game when it's really not. Kinda fascinating how a seemingly simple game on the outside is actually so complicated, with tons of mechanics combined with the RNG. It's crazy. Kinda sad I'm like the only person in my class who plays it lol.<br><br>Do holidays? I never get those questions. I do have holidays though, school and public ones.<br><br>I wasn't around during MCZone, though people say I was. Was I? So I can't answer that.<br><br>I don't listen to music, and not a big fan of them in the first place. However if I do it would be those catchy ones or those with a very obvious beat and rhythm. idk tbh<br><br>I don't know any texture packs<br><br>I don't have a favourite movie, just like how I don't have a favourite actor or song.<br><br>kelr, bow god, pinger like all those other american people. Scary person to fight. Been friends with you for a while, and you've pretty much remained the same nice and chill person.<br><br>Get off mobile then

People find you annoying a lot, and I can understand why. Sometimes you need to control yourself a bit, you get immature a lot from the times I've heard or talked to you. However, you can be a nice person to talk to. I would say you got a bit better at the game, though I can't really say, since it's been a long time since I fought you at all.

You were always the guy having "the latest reply" on almost all forum posts, but instead of spamming and being toxic, you helped and gave feedback. Thanks ;)<br><br>Questions:<br>- Favorite Throwback Map? (Avicus)<br>- Favorite Non-Throwback Map?<br>- Opinions? (If you know me good enough)<br>- Fish?

I always find it annoying when people bring up the topic of me "forum spamming" , but yea I've been becoming inactive anyways<br><br>Never had a favourite map, but maybe that map whose name I cannot remember. Two castles with three mons around it. Not sure<br><br>Same thing, don't have a favourite map. I also don't play enough here anymore to know maps<br><br>You've come a long way, from being a regular to a Map Developer. You're a nice person overall, can't say anything bad. I've talked to you on the build server (I think) and sometimes on Avicus, but that was a while ago. We haven't had any recent conversations but I'd say you haven't changed, even if you have it was probably for the better.<br><br>Fish?
