you were a really nice guy to me. It was fun to talk to you. But recently u started to behave like a 6 year old kid. &nbsp;You Always call yourself 'g0d'.

I hope its temporary.<br><br>Apollo is a strong team, roster is really good but we should be more active.&nbsp;<br><br>9.5/10<br><br>I like your team, you have good players but I don't like the way you guys play in scrims.

Im going to answer you a bit here aswell lel.<br><br>1. I hope it's temporary aswell. I've seen people ignore me when asking stuff etc and I will stop being annoying lel -.-<br><br>3. lmao I didn't realise you were going to give that high. I mean, most people give 7-8/10 not 9.5 but thanks &lt;3<br><br>4. Like, mostly we play seriously but often we play quite shit. Recently we've been improving quite a bit tho and we're hoping for a better place in any upcoming tournament.

I don't really know you as a person but I've never seen u arguing with someone. You are pretty chill, and positive.<br><br>As a player idk either lol xd but people say you are really good and I remember when u were subbing us. You got like 5v1. I haven't seen you fighting there but I saw it on chat. So I think you are really strong.

As far as I've seen you are a really chill guy. I like the way you lead a lot. Even though scrim goes bad you keep yourself chill. And team gets chill too. I like talking to you, we couldn't really talk on ts I hope we can talk more. You are a good pvper. You should kick Sam :p

I'm scared of your pvp xd I don't know if you are legit. If you are legit , just tell me how did you get that good.<br>I like your team overall. But I think you should join a bean team.

I've never really spoken to you but you are pretty chill. I can say that you are funny as well. You are a nice mod.<br><br>umm Holden :p actually depends on why you ask<br><br>My situation in turkey is fine for now. Governemt is pretty bad but doesn't affect my life a lot. I wish I could change some things but can't. I'm thinking of moving abroad as soon as possible but I'm not old enough to move by myself so this is sad. There are so many shit things here but except terror attacks it doesn't affect me at all.<br><br>Not really. Firstly, I don't think I could be a good mod. Secondly, minecraft is something I do for fun. I would not want to take responsibilities over it since it's getting boring and I'm loosing interest on it.

You are a really nice person to talk. We used to talk more but recently we don't really. I don't know your actual position but you are pretty decent at defending. Your pvp is great too. You seem like a cheerful person to me :) I hope we can talk more soon.
