Greetings muzzing community,<br><br>Almost 2 years on Avicus - majority being apart of &nbsp;the staff. I connected on MCzone around this time, ~couple weeks before Avicus was first released.&nbsp;<br><br>Ask me questions related to my job here on Avicus - as a former admin/mod; to my current responsibilities (mapdev and official). It can be personal, but remember, if I deem the question inappropriate or unnecessary... I will simply ignore it &amp;/or it can be miscellaneous!<br><br>It's been a bumpy 2 years :P and I'm still going strong... I guess. It's odd to think how much I've changed in the sense of how I've matured personally/publicly, how I approach things, and how I play minecraft today.<br><br>So I'll leave you guys with the questions :):)<br>keep muzzing \o/

<b>Why did I retire from Administrator?&nbsp;<br></b>At the time, it felt like the best thing to do. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed managing and dealing with escalating situations... the community seemed they wanted a new administrator. I admit, I have been bias before. I have falsely banned players. I have made many mistakes that couldn't be mended. All in all, I stepped down from Admin due to making way too many mistakes, alongside the communities opinion/feedback. I mean, if the community base doesn't like the admin who is pretty much running the show... it's best for a fresh person to come in 8^)<br><b><br>Why did I retire from Mod?<br></b>I was being relied on too much for the first couple months, even though I had no power. It got to a point wher I set myself a goal to assist the new moderators to develop skills... to be more independent - if you will. Before retiring, there were quite a few moderators who really became leaders amongst the staff team. Since my 'goal' was furfilled, my purpose as a moderator depleted. Additionally, &nbsp;I was lacking moderation (got lazy with reports etc).<br><b><br>Are you going fishing?<br></b>Yeah man, &nbsp;goin' fishin' for likes dard<br><b><br>What do you do while you r8 8/8?<br></b>Pvp and muzz!!!!!

My profile picture on the Avicus Network event slack is Dana Kareglazaya :)&nbsp;<br><br>My best moments would have to be... making a positive impact on avicus where ever possible. Whenever I saw someone happy, that made my experience so much better! Managing the stsff team was really enjoyable... had tons of fun :)<br><br>My worst...obviously making mistakes. If it's got to be specific, I would say fasely banning users for illegal modifications. You feel soooooo shit when you realise it!

<b>As an admin, what was the hardest decision you had to make?<br></b>When Avicus was being attacked by some hackers, (yes staff accounts were hacked), I was pretty much the only senior staff online at the time. I had to ensure that this attack stopped... so I went to contact the perpetrators and reason with them. After 3 hours of constant watch and coordination, my decision to conclude the attack was pretty hard. If I went offline and they started again, no senior staff would have been online.<br><b><br>Funniest moment in cacalmarin within first 13 days?<br></b>I can't exactly remember what was being said, but all I can recall was that we (cacalmarin) were in a call playing Kohi team fights and bagging Banway :PP<br><b><br></b><b>Favourite Anime?
