During the end days of ocn, you were banned for auto click. Was this actually true or a meme?

It was 100% a false ban. I didn't cheat on OCN or any servers I care about. (I havent hacked on, avicus, Kohi, Badlion, OCN and MineHQ I don't remember playing many other servers but I dont tend to cheat in this game xD).<br><br>Basically, it was like, all the staff wanted me unbanned but Brottweiler said no so yeah xd.

Opinion?: Howdy ther cowboy : )!&nbsp;<br><br>Inner you are one of my favorite people to play with. By far one of the funniest people I've ever spoken to "hilariously retarded" someone could say XD. As a player you're really good. I think, while you're good at TDM you aren't the best. There are people better than you at it, but it doesn't matter it's not your thing. I haven't played much CTW with you but you're probs pretty good at it since gameSENSE or something.<br><br>But, Collin you sure dang are the best DTC offender that plays this game xd! Idk, you're really really good at DTC probably Pureblox's best DTC player rn. While your mechanical skills (melee and bow) are really good as well. That's pretty hot tbh (u throw tho).<br><br>Favorite moment in avicus tourney: Probably the Grand Finals. Why? Because we fucking shit stomped Allah (which where in my eyes Yirang) again. While I like some of them, nothing is more fun than some spicy revenge xD! Also, I don't know playing each game was fucking fun/hilarious in its own way.<br><br>Did you like the maps?: I liked every map. The map I disliked the most was probably Powerhouse but we were the best at it (and all maps but UHH LUL) was just the worst gameplay/design wise. It didn't look or play well XD.&nbsp;<br><br>People yellin' bout zaoki?: It's honestly hilarious people can say so much when they know so little. Literally, it's like they witch hunt people on the fucking daily. It's sad Zaoki got banned, I honestly don't people should be allowed to act like that (you probs know everything else). Just yeah, bullshit happened, we still fucked'em all up :).&nbsp;<br><br>LOURD BLOKXC WHY HCAK?: ez 10 bucks buddy
