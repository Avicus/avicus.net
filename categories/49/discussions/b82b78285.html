Old friend, never knew you were Tom, nice person and great mod. We should talk more.

Good at sword, good at bow, great skill set, scared of you all the time.<br>We should talk more, though I don't talk much myself. You're friendly and fun to be around.<br>Kohi, I find Badlion PvP really weird for some reason. I hardly play any of them now though, because my internet is becoming worse and I lag.<br>I'll be honest, I've eyed Apollo for sooo long, only to have my dreams crushed.

I don't know you very well at all, but you are way less toxic than before, which I really like.<br>Haven't fought you much as well, but I can tell you're good at melee and the gamemode on general. Decent leader. Considering you originated from OCN, no surprise<br>I don't feel like making one, not that type of person. Most likely will be filled with players from top tier teams.

I don't have a favourite map or least favourite map<br>You shout way too much, I sometimes can't stand to be around you. The way you talk and stuff, sorry I'm too innocent. Otherwise, you're an ok leader, and can really make me laugh sometimes.

I knew it, you were ProjectMars. That was so long ago.<br>You seem to have coped well with the mega link joke.<br>We have not talked in a long time, but from the last time I saw you, you were more toxic than before, but as a player, from when I first met you, you've improved a lot, whether you were hacking or not.

Snapcraft Earthgames went down, wanted team pvp games. So I googled that and found this. Also inspired by something BajanCanadian played, Equinox was it?<br>Giraffe/Dolphin<br>Another friend that I've known for a while, went inactive after prestiges disappeared but back active again. Good friend and nice to be around, improving as a player in terms of both melee and bow, which is good too see. Almost always seen with NDLFC and 28cheetah :P
