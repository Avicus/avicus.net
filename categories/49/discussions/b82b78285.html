Good at sword, good at bow, great skill set, scared of you all the time.<br>We should talk more, though I don't talk much myself. You're friendly and fun to be around.<br>Kohi, I find Badlion PvP really weird for some reason. I hardly play any of them now though, because my internet is becoming worse and I lag.<br>I'll be honest, I've eyed Apollo for sooo long, only to have my dreams crushed.

I don't know you very well at all, but you are way less toxic than before, which I really like.<br>Haven't fought you much as well, but I can tell you're good at melee and the gamemode on general. Decent leader. Considering you originated from OCN, no surprise<br>I don't feel like making one, not that type of person. Most likely will be filled with players from top tier teams.

I knew it, you were ProjectMars. That was so long ago.<br>You seem to have coped well with the mega link joke.<br>We have not talked in a long time, but from the last time I saw you, you were more toxic than before, but as a player, from when I first met you, you've improved a lot, whether you were hacking or not.

Snapcraft Earthgames went down, wanted team pvp games. So I googled that and found this. Also inspired by something BajanCanadian played, Equinox was it?<br>Giraffe/Dolphin<br>Another friend that I've known for a while, went inactive after prestiges disappeared but back active again. Good friend and nice to be around, improving as a player in terms of both melee and bow, which is good too see. Almost always seen with NDLFC and 28cheetah :P
