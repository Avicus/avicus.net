You're a good friend of mine and the only ing I'm not a fan of is how you can sometimes be irritating, but that hasn't happened in a long time. Enjoy taking and moderating with you. :)<br><br><img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/f4eae547b4d8434898447e444e31b389?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/tomqss.html" style="color: Gray">tomqss</a> Hey tom! I don't have much to say since, well, I don't really know any competitive players due to my lack in the competitive scene. You were a great moderator and it was a heavy blow to see you and so many others leave the team.<br><br>I've &nbsp;tried, but over never really gotten into it. I also don't like he idea of being the only mod on and being in a scrim because that already happens with &nbsp;half the staff team.<br><br>I don't understand this question, I think you might've mistyped or something. I would have to be active in tourneys to become a ref which I'm not. :P<br><br><img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/309bd365f87b4077b5621aebdc7d3db3?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/AstroPizza.html" style="color: #FF5C5C">AstroPizza</a> Hey pizza! My favorite pizza is plain old Pizza Hut cheese or veggie pizza and my favorite gamemode is Nebula, or DTM.<br><br><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/31f2ccc2c0779b0e5e2c4d8cd7cc3701?s=20&amp;default=mm" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/Camemes.html" style="color: none">Camemes</a> Hey Cammy! You're always a happy, cheerful guy who does a good job moderating. I don't know you too well, but I know you're one of the friendliest on the team! :)<br><br>Australia is definitely a place that I hope to visit some day. It's so different from other places.<br><br>I don't have many goals anymore, really. I've been here for years and years and the fun in the game is almost gone, but luckily, moderating is keeping me here. My remaining goal is to become a senior staff member. &nbsp;<br><br>My my real life goals are to attend college (preferably the University of Virginia) and get some sort of job in technology, business, or both! I'd also like to maybe become an author and overall have fun in my life. Travel the world, go on exotic roller coasters, sky dive, and hopefully make a really nice amount of money, haha.<br><br>I'll do the rest later! :D

Before I was sort of neutral. Didn't know you too well so I didn't have an opinion. Now, I've had some time with you on the staff team and you sort of seem like you're 'try-harding' for a promotion. Your intentions are probably good, but from my eyes and I think many others it looks like try-Harding. The inspirational messages and overall attempt to get noticed drives me a bit off the edge, but other than that you're fine.<br><br><img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/3ec3ad7c563c45fbaedfdd32066a2e19?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/Sweedie.html" style="color: none">Sweedie</a> Hey!

I'm not part of the competitive community so I can't give an opinion on you as a ref. One thing I can say though, and this definitely isn't directed toward you, is that Refs are picked waaaay too easily. I remember when I got ref by making an app that took me around 4 minutes to write up.<br><br>I received my junior moderator rank at the same time as Resepignev, May 25, 2015 or something.<br><br><img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/398fb956587f4ec7ac8d9474648022de?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/TheMasterClock.html" style="color: Gray">TheMasterClock</a> Honestly, I don't know. I like talking to you sometimes, but considering you hate me, but call me homie anyways I don't know what to say. It's like you hate me and like me at the same time, lol. You get annoying when you talk about chicken or whatever, and I liked the old clockracer better.
