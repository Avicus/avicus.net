I don’t really know you that well so my bad I can’t give an opinion but you seem cool&nbsp;<br><br>I quit because there’s no point in me playing anymore. I have to focus on my studies and as you get older this game isn’t the same as when you were younger. Everyone also that I played with quit alongside and we do our own things. There are better games as well to play other than Minecraft. It just became so boring for me after 6 years it’s inevitable

Yo spooks you’re a calm guy and a good player very nice playing with you. Obviously at times init you used to get a little triggered but that happens to everyone loool. But real talk you’re a very nice guy and it was nice talking with you.<br><br>Ahh that’s difficult. Grim was amazing to play with just because I learnt a lot and grew as a player but I think towards the end of my playtime probably YAGA/Yirang just because playing with all the American boys was a lot of fun and it was a new experience. Plus everyone there was so good it was nice playing with people like that&nbsp;<br><br>yeah ah good luck to you bro
