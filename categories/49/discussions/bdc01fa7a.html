Well, Avicus has been one hell of a ride. I remember the day I came back in early 2017, and applying shortly after to miraculously make it to a moderator. I was basically a nobody back then, and I guess one can argue that i still am now.<br>First off, I’d like to thank the senior staff team for bearing with me and giving me the great opportunity of becoming a moderator, and later a mentor.<br>I’d also like to thank the officials for the chance of being a senior referee, and having the chance to ref in general.<br>I’d also like to thank Kord for my short time on the advertising team, it really opened my eyes as to how much work you guys put in for keeping this server running.<br>I’d like to thank the map development team for doing their best to put out multitudes or maps, and for having the chance to work with them.<br>But now, I’d like to apologize.<br>Even though I’m staff or whatever, I have of course made a bunch of mistakes, and I want to apologize for them. So to all of you who despise me, just give me a chance to start new, because the end of Avicus does not mean the end of these wonderful game modes.<br>Sometimes I’ve come off as rude or annoying, or maybe as a know it all but I’ve done my best to suppress those moments.<br>So, thank you to all that have criticized and despised me, even if enemies are bad, they still make me who I am.<br>Anyways, I want to thank individuals but there’s just too much to be able to give everyone an equal chance of recognition.<br>Nonetheless, I’m looking forward to working with new staff and others in the future.<br>Oh, and one more thing. While I’m at it, I guess I’ll do a face reveal.<br>That’ll be in discord at some point, so if anyone cares, keep your eyes open for that.<br>Anyways, here’s to the new beginning!<br>-Squid
