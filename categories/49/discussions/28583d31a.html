Hit me up on Discord (boldandbrash#4517) if you want to do one.<br><br><b>What is your IGN and team?<br></b>Patrikano and my team is called Jalapenos<br><div><br></div><div><b>How many tournaments have you participated in?<br></b>2, Battle of Eternity and Project Redemption<br><b><br></b></div><div><b>Any team in particular you'd like to face off against?<br></b>Not really, maybe Horizon since we never got the chance to play them<br><b><br></b></div><div><b>Any team you don't want to face off against?<br></b>No, we're up for facing any team. It's always more fun to play as many different teams as possible<br><b><br></b></div><div><b>How do you think you'll do this time around?<br></b>I think we will do well, i'm not fully sure what place since I do not know if it's groups or single/double elimination but we are hoping for top 5<br><b><br></b></div><div><b>Any teams you have a rivalry with?<br></b>No, but Celestial have been boasting about how they beat us last time we scrimmed so it'd be nice to play them in the tournament. Apollo are also a fun team to play since they never go down without a fight<br><b><br></b></div><div><b>What do you think is your team's best strength, and your best strength alone?<br></b><b></b>I think my team's best strength is that we have started to communicate very well recently and always go into the match expecting the best. I believe my strength is that I can get the team to listen to me during games which allows for good rotations<br><b><br></b></div><div><b>What do you think is your team's worst weakness, and your worst weakness alone?<br></b>Our weakness is that sometimes we mess around too much during a match and end up losing to teams we usually beat, though we definitely will try not to do that during this tournament. I think my weakness is that I sometimes make the wrong decision during a match and then don't know how to come back from it<br><b><br></b></div><div><b>What have you done to prepare?<br></b>We have looked over some maps that will possibly be in the map pool and have begun to scrim teams on these maps<br><b><br></b></div><div><b>Anything you'd like to say to your opponents?<br></b>&nbsp;We are better than you think. Oh and Rombey hacks and armored is a potato<b><br></b></div>
