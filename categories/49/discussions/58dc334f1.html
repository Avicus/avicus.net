So, I have been on Avicus for a year now. Here's my story.<br><br>I decided to check out Avicus after a discussion with fellow OCN players about Avicus. In the next 5 months, I barely played, until Staff Applications opened up, and I decided to apply. To everyone's suprise, I was given the Junior Mod rank. Every time I joined a game I would get questions such as 'Who are you'. I was the outsider of the batch. Inthe beginning, I struggled with the rank, but once I got the hang of it, Jozz got me in TS, and I got promoted to Mod.<br><br>Then, in January 2015, I was tempted to retire, however Jake talked me out of doing so, something I am still grateful for. Then Senior Moderator positions became available, and decided I'd try them out. And then, on the 15th of March, 2015 I got promoted. <br><br>That's a long story made short, here's to another year. AMA time now :)
