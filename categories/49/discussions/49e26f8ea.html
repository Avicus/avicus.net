Hey everyone I'm J420ac10k, but by all means please call me Jack! I'm 13 years old, but mah b-day is 9/11. I have actually been on Avicus for about a year now, and I've been having really annoying game bugs, so I can't register, but hey I'm here! Um I play Nebula a lot like <b>A LOT</b>. I kinda like Nexus as it's a constant battle of two teams, mostly having 5-10 players when I'm on, so yea lots of deaths. I'm not the kind of person that enjoys really slow gamemodes that all you do is eat, mine, fight, die. I would be tearing my hair out 15 minutes in 'cause of the all work you have to do, so lazy :P. When I'm on Nebula I always go straight to armour, I love being op :3. I can build and pvp moderately well, I <i><u>LOVE&nbsp;</u></i> team deathmatches, especially when they have pots :D. So I'm a player that likes fast moving pvp games and can get a bit too COMpetitive sometimes, but I mean c'mon it's a game. I will be watching the forums quite a lot, but won't post loads of replies/topics. So on the forums I am a brand new player, but in-game I've been here for a year. So yea. anyways. cool server. yea. um. I'm gonna go now... Oh and I love football and all sports ^-^

Hey man! Welcome to Avicus! Ignore the hackusations and such that you usually find in servers and you'll find some really cool people. Don't flame me if I kill you with barb because I will ask you to back it up. Which means when I see you I will request an on-server 1v1 with the same kits or Kohi and be calling you out :P. (You said you get overcompetitive sometimes so I figured I'd mention)<br><br>But I'm chill as long as you're cool with me. Give and get respect.&nbsp;<br>Hope to see you in-game sometime!
