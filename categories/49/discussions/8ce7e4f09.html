<p>Hello!</p><p>I am aagrant99, a former player who has returned to the Avicus Network.&nbsp; I used to play back in 2015&nbsp;and was&nbsp; an active player and forum member.&nbsp; I have returned again in 2017, since 2015 the player base has declined by the hundreds and so has forum activity.&nbsp; That just means I can get a more intimate connection with the members here.&nbsp; I remember the days of fun I had here, and now once again I can capture monuments, snipe people off bridges, and do other things like that.&nbsp; The fun that I once had now exists again. &nbsp;(Edit: as to not make a constant stream of thank yous I will issue a thank you to everyone on the main post here). &nbsp;</p>

I remember you. Welcome back! There are loads of people who'll be happy to answer any questions you have, so if you have any don't hesitate to ask either another player or a staff member. :)

I did realize that there were threads that contained my name soon after I left.&nbsp; They said very nice things, and people were wondering where I went.&nbsp; I left soon after the update about 2 years ago, more because of a decline in the interest of minecraft and more of an interest into steam gaming like Civilization and EUIV.&nbsp; That memorial thing that listed my name, the threads where people were wondering where I was even weeks later, was a very very kind act and I was elated when I saw them that people never did forget my presence here.&nbsp; Almost everyone I knew here has left in 2 years and the spawn has changed, the walls have been removed, the player base went from over 500 to now around 50-100, just a ton.&nbsp; I know it will restart anew.&nbsp; I will not necessarily be the most active player these days as I am super busy with clubs after school and school along with lots of homework, but will be here enough where I will still make a presence. &nbsp;Those players who once played with me no longer do as most of them are no longer here, but I do thank them in their memory for those things and the elation brought about by reading those posts showed that Avicus had a close knit kind community, hopefully that sense of community still lives on despite the other major changes that occurred.

I don't remember you, but I didn't play Nebula almost at all back then. I was a "walls kid". xD I still am, but I enjoy Nebula a lot now. The name you would remember me as would probably be MicahB222000, if you remember me at all. :p&nbsp;<br>Anyways, welcome back! Hope you enjoy your stay! :)
