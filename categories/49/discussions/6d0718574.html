Hello all people of Avicus!<br><br>Now, first I want to say that this is my first forum that I plan being active on, so this is very exciting for me to meet new people :D. Ive been playing Minecraft for about 3 years now and most of my time on Avicus/MC Zone's Nebula has been amazing! The reason I say most is because I have been a real jerk, and an idiot&nbsp; to some people (Of who I can't remember which makes me feel even more bad). For that, I want to apologize to anyone I've hurt. I may have been in a bad mood, I may have been depressed, but that is no reason for me to take it out on other people. So for being offensive, rude, disrespectful, and anything else, I apologize. <br><br><b><u><b>About Me</b></u></b><br><br>My name is Luke, your average 14 year old nerd who loves Minecraft. I'm pretty good at Sword PvP (With Fishing Rods, please add!) but I suck with a Bow. I love Minecraft as a game, and as a place for me to unwind and just talk with all the nice people on Avicus. <br><br><b><u><b>Bad Stuff<br><br></b></u><b>I Haven Been Banned!</b></b> Yes, I have been banned (Perm) once due to greifing. <b><u></u></b>I did actually greif, but It was my friend who got me banned. I regret doing things like that to the people in that server but I have changed and tried to become a better person :).<br><br><b><u></u></b><u><b><b>And A Bunch of Random Stuff</b></b></u><b></b><br><br>I'm really short for my age, I like sushi, I'm S. Korean, UNICORNS (Yes it must be in caps) are awesome, Everyone should have a Banana ready to go if a Giant Lizard were to ever attack, and in general, I'm just a weird person.<br><br>I'm so excited to talk with and meet you all and wish you Happy Avicus-ing (It should be a word)<br><br>See ya around :)<br>xXiGetDiamondsXx
