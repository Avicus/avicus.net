Besides probably ryan/wylt, I would say you were the nicest person on yirang. You always had an atmosphere of being really chill, and just overall seemed super approachable. I havent talked much to you, but from what I have you seemed really smart as well. I felt kinda bad for you in kfc when the team you left beat you in the finals ;v
