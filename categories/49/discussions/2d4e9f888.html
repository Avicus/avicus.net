After a dinner discussion with my parents I am deciding to leave Avicus and minecraft permanently. &nbsp;This I know came out of nowhere but is just a recent decision. &nbsp;I decided it this evening by looking at my actions over the last few weeks and what I have ahead. &nbsp;Minecraft is just something I cannot handle. &nbsp;I have victoria ii, europa univeralis iv, civilization v and all of these games with 100's of hours on them but minecraft is even worse. &nbsp;It is a never ending addiction that I just cannot control. &nbsp;After a discussion during dinner with my family I am just a little too addicted. &nbsp;I personally just don't think this is the best idea to continue on with this. &nbsp;I have a very busy class schedule and school is starting in a week. &nbsp;It will be my senior year and I am going to college. &nbsp;I would like my former posts to be archived. &nbsp;I have left Avicus before for month to year long periods 3 times. &nbsp;It is just a little much for me to be doing this. &nbsp;I just would like to move on and this is the final leave I am taking. &nbsp;I simply have an addiction problem that cannot be controlled unless by the source. &nbsp;I wish you all a farewell. &nbsp;I just don't really have the time with my schedule to play avicus. &nbsp;I just realized I wasted weeks barely doing anything besides gaming, &nbsp;just a lot of bad habits. &nbsp;This is my choice as I realize I have big things ahead. &nbsp;I have usually left unannounced but I wish to offer just a final farewell. &nbsp;It is my senior year and I have a life ahead of me, a cruise in December, a lot of AP and DE courses. &nbsp;I have my clubs I do afterschool, and perhaps relationships and doing fun senior stuff with people. &nbsp;Perhaps I will see you again next year, I am creating a youtube account and a twitch streaming service. &nbsp;This may come surprising to some (especially since I am known to be one to vanish out of nowhere), but I just thought about it and I truly have issues with this. &nbsp;The timing is very random and I just had that revelation. &nbsp;I knew I was going to stop minecraft at around 18 but I didn't really know when it would be. &nbsp;I just realized now with looking at my schedule and what is ahead that I just don't want to be remembered here. &nbsp;Real life connections are more valuable and I'm missing out. &nbsp;A lot of people on my facebook have been asking me how I'm doing and I haven't paid much attention. &nbsp;Any former posts by me I would like archived or deleted. &nbsp;I did this with my family's advice and with just thinking about how big of an issue it has become. &nbsp;I simply have become too addicted. &nbsp;This did come out of nowhere as new revelations appeared to me. &nbsp;Wish me look with what lies ahead and my luck and tidings go out to you as well. &nbsp;I am deleting discord as well.&nbsp; I have neurological disorders that make it very very difficult for me to pay attention and get distracted by the silliest things. &nbsp;I plan on getting a job as well next summer which would consume my time. Minecraft is just too much to handle at the moment, I am sorry for any inconveniences I caused by this unexpected revelation. &nbsp;I am just too busy, but you will all be remembered. &nbsp;Thank you for your time. &nbsp;Please do not be sad, be happy for me that I came to this realization. &nbsp;I just came to it after realizing that the last few weeks have been nearly nonstop gaming and a discussion. &nbsp;I ask of you again to not be sad as if you care you would see that this is the best for me, one day I want to do more then just minecraft. This was entirely my decision that I came to and discussed with my parents. &nbsp;Be kind to one another and keep positive vibes in avicus, That is the way to keep my memory alive. &nbsp;This is a very hard decision but I know sincerely it is for the best. My parents said it was up to me and I told them it would be for the best. Thank you very much for your time and have a great day. (If this account can be deleted off the forums as well I would like that at my request, I have recieved the email from mojang for account deletion and aagrant99 is no longer going to be an account after this)

I have finished, deleted my account through the email I recieved from mojang. &nbsp;Thank you to all whom were there for me for years. &nbsp;It was a very very interesting period but all good things come to an end. &nbsp;Dinner discussions can be very very productive. &nbsp;I feel like I have matured a lot by this choice.

Why would you delete your account (Yeah I guess so you can't get the urge to play) but what if you ever in the future wanted to hop on again..? Like maybe you someone could've changed the password for you and not tell you.

I could have requested a password change from mojang. &nbsp;Had them send an email to me. &nbsp;Temptation would have made it too great of an urge to try and find shortcuts out to get back to it. &nbsp;Thank you to all whom commented you will be missed as well.
