It's been 3 years since I have joined this server. 2 years of which have been staff. (Adding alt accounts)<br>Ask me anything<br><br><br>It's been a bumpy journey, but it's really assited me develop as an individual! Thanks to all of those who have been an important role model, friend and influence as a staff member and general community member. Here are &nbsp;wombats I've known for most of my time on Avicus :)<br><br>@howsie: You may not see this, but you were someone I looked up to back when you were an admin. Thanks for sticking with the sistahood while it lasted too :)<br><br>@para: I've known you for the majority of my time here, and I believe our first time we talked was during the onion throwing or even at OCN! Even now you are no afraid of speaking your opinion and I respect that. I remember our talks when we had no one to go to.<br><br>@yoav: General legend, you know it :) Too much to say about you but thank god I met you on teamspeak that one day.<br><br>@everyone: If you have talked to me for a while, you know I can get off the rails quite a lot, but it's all banter! Thanks for all the wonderful experiences here so far, and let's hope there are plenty more to come!

Wow, 3 years man. That's quite some time. Well, believe it or not I still remember when I first met you. That day man, you were freaking awesome. The first time I had a real conversation with you, I knew you were a great guy. I've never really met anyone else besides Apricot and Peachy that had that same effect on me. Honestly I'm just glad I was able to be introduced to someone like you in my life. It may not have been in person, but that doesn't matter to me. You've been there since the day I met you, and I can't thank you enough for that. Glad to see you're still going strong!<br><br>Okay so I guess it's question time:<br><br>How is everything?<br><br>How's the Administration going? Any significant changes since the last time?<br><br>Are you enjoying your time as a Staff Member again?<br><br>Oh and P.S. "The hill" was a success.<br><br>-Jake &lt;3
