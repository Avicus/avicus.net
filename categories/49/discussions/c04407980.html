Why? xD<br>1. What's your favorite color and why?<br>2. If you had one wish to benefit yourself (No donating to charity or anything), what would it be?<br>3. What do you think the meaning of existence is?<br>4. Can you easily do 56/24 in your head? (In under 10 seconds)<br>5. Is your power level over 9000?&nbsp;<br>6. If you were a food, what would you be and why?<br>7. If you were to use a common household object to fight in the zombie appocolypse (Microwave, chair, et cetera), what would it be and why?<br>8. If you could choose to be an animal and still had the power to morph back into a human any time you wanted, what would it be and why?<br>9. Why do you always "Just kid"?

@golden<br><br>1. What's your favorite color and why? white, because, it is simple<br>2. If you had one wish to benefit yourself (No donating to charity or anything), what would it be? Dont know exactly what you mean by "benefiting myself"<br>3. What do you think the meaning of existence is? There is no meaning, we're just here, a product of evolution. Wow that was deep :P<br>4. Can you easily do 56/24 in your head? (In under 10 seconds) yeah, its 2.333?<br>5. Is your power level over 9000? yep<br>6. If you were a food, what would you be and why? um probably nuts because who eats that stuff :D<br>7. If you were to use a common household object to fight in the zombie apocalypse (Microwave, chair, et cetera), what would it be and why? kitchen knife, it is a useful weapon<br>8. If you could choose to be an animal and still had the power to morph back into a human any time you wanted, what would it be and why? a cheetah, for its speed<br><span>9.
