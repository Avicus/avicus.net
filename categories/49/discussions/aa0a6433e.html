I saw you reporting a crap ton of players... I didn't want to look at them; purely because of some stuff you reported them for.<br><br>Anyways, welcome to the Forums!

It means that even if you are good at something don't go telling or bragging to everyone about it. Like you in OP saying 'I am very good at PVP'. You may be good at PVP but don't go telling everyone that as it makes you come of as cocky which is something you don't want.

@Eel: Hope you enjoy your time on the server. I'm sure there are a few of us that would have something to say about your PvP skills... modestly is a virtue.<br><br>@SkyGirl: Yes, however if the report was for an illegitimate reason the staff would have no cause to pursue it.

By the sounds of it, he did read all of them but didn't check them out because the reasons were not good enough.
