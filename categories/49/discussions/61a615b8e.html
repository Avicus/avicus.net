Well, it's been 3 years as of about 10 minutes ago so I thought I might as well do an AMA considering I've also been staff for pretty much a year. So, ask away.<br><br>Warning: Opinions will be very brutal. Ask at your own risk.<br><br>Love you all!

My two favourite people on Avicus. You're really nice and your flirting is cringey but hilarious. It would be nice if I didn't have to come on TS everytime we're on at the same time, though. :P

"<i>Opinions on the staff team?"</i><br><br>I think the mod team was good but it has become unacceptably inactive. The mods are of good quality but they definitely need to be more active.&nbsp;<br><br>The seniors really need to be more active and they also need to learn how to <b>listen</b>. At the moment, I feel like here are only 2 seniors who actually listen to us.<br><br>The admin team I don't really have any complaints about aside from their activity.<br><br><i>"Favourite Avicus team? (Disbanded or not)"<br><br></i>I'm not a part of it but most likely Cronus. I respect them as a team and the majority of their players are nice and don't take Minecraft too seriously. Of course, I like Home too (please don't demote me, Junr!).<br><br><i>"For how long have you been a moderator?"</i><br><br>A year now, give or take a week.<br><br>"<i>Do you have any pets?"</i><br><br>Yep, a dog.&nbsp;<br><br><i>"Favourite animal?"</i><br><br>Ooh, that's difficult. It's between the wolf, the dog, the dolphin, and the phoenix if mythological creatures count.<br><br>"<i>Hot drinks or cold?"</i><br><br>I like the cold, so hot drinks. You can't beat a cup of tea... ;)<br><br>"<i>Favourite map?"</i><br><br>I don't play much anymore since my mouse broke and I can't really PvP because of it, but probably Clay Wars.<br><br>Thanks!

Well, you don't like me as a mod for some reason that you still haven't explained, so I'm a bit sceptical about you. However, you seem nice (despite your chicken obsession - Gods help anyone who steals it from you).

To be honest, I sort of agree with that last point. I was back 5 days (as a moderator), which wasn't nearly enough time to catch up on everything I missed, and then now be expected to do Sr duties after being gone for a while.<br><br>On the second point though, while I was only a moderator on Avicus for a few months, I was a moderator on OCN for a year. This gave me the experience I think I needed, although I suppose you could argue it wasn't the "Avicus" experience. (Though let's be honest, the way you moderate both servers is pretty much the same, just the infraction guidelines are less (imo) harsh here - and of course there's less reports here)

As a mod: I thought you were a decent mod, not the best nor the worst. Your abilities to screen-share were valuable, but not as valuable as they were made out to be. If the rest of the mods had been trained, they wouldn't have been as valuable.<br><br>As a player: Pretty good at PvP, but you can get really cocky.<br><br>As a person: You don't know how to take a joke, you use sensitive topics and disorders as insults, you start arguments even more than I do, and you're incredibly overconfident. Oh, and you can be bitter. Very, very bitter.

Nice guy, a bit immature. You're one of the few Eastern staff members so you have a huge amount of responsibility, which I respect you for attempting to live up to.<br><br>Bit too hot for my liking (I like the cold). Also, I'm a bit concerned about the racism and homophobia that appears to be coming into play in Australian politics. Otherwise, it seems like a really beautiful country with lots to see (I really want to see the Great Barrier Reef someday) and on the whole the people are quite nice.

Don't really know you, but I find it entertaining that you appeal nearly every infraction you get. You do seem to have a lack of consideration for the rules based on your conduct on the server and on Teamspeak, though. You can also be pretty offensive, which annoys me a bit.

Pretty good at PvP but overly competitive. I love how whenever I join we start insulting each other. xD<br><br>Because:<br>1. They don't choose seniors off of time, otherwise Badger and Rese would both be senior.<br>2. I get into far too many arguments with the seniors and admins and I disagree with a fair few of their decisions.<br>3. I don't really have the attitude to be a senior.

<i>"</i><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><i>Opinions on me as person and as mod?</i><i>""<br><br></i>As a person, I think you're really nice and funny, but you can be really creepy sometimes. Your snaps in particular seriously disturb me. However, you've always been willing to listen to me when something is bothering me or when I just need a good rant. You've been almost ridiculously patient with me even when I'm being a arrogant brat, which I know is a lot of the time.&nbsp;<br><br>As a mod, I think you're one of the people who holds the team together. For me, you were pretty much a mentor when I first started out. You were the one who answered my questions, gave me advice, and corrected me when I did something wrong. You actually taught me far more about moderating than pretty much any of the mentors, for which I'm very grateful.<br><br><i>"</i></span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><i>Are you still mad at me?"</i><br></span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><br>No. I over-reacted before, and for that I'm sorry.&nbsp;<br><br><i>"</i></span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><i>Why did you became a moderator (like honestly)?"<br></i></span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><i><br></i>Eurgh, this is going to come out sounding like a golden boy answer, but I've been a regular on Avicus for over 3 years now. In that time, I've (hopefully) changed from a toxic little sh*t into a somewhat less toxic little sh*t with at least some maturity. Avicus has helped me a lot, and I wanted to give something back to it.&nbsp;<br><i><br></i>I guess it's more than that, actually. The cool rank aside, I've always wanted to help people, even if it's in small, somewhat insignificant ways. Where better to start than with people that I've known for over 3 years?<br><i><br></i>I hope that this answer didn't make you cringe too badly. You wanted an honest answer, so there you go.<br><br></span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><i>"</i></span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><i>Why do you still stay as moderator, why on avicus?"</i><br><br>I had a feeling that someone was going to ask this eventually, haha. The truth is, I don't know. I know that I can still help people, but the enjoyment of it has gone now. Truthfully, I believe that the only reason why I'm still here is because there are still people here who I like. However, whether that outweighs my personal disagreements with the rest of the staff team and my growing boredom when it comes to Avicus - and even Minecraft as a whole - remains to be seen.<br><br><i>"</i></span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><i>Kartoffeln oder Kroketten?"<br><br></i>Kartoffein.<br><i><br><b></b></i><b>You say this to everyone who shows you their face.</b><br><br><br></span>
