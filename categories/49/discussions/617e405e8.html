Being able to be part of the staff team with lovely people... (Most of them anyway.. ^-^)<br>I'm not exactly the best role model... So um.. *rolls face on keyboard*<br>Finally getting a house and moving out of our tiny apartment. Screw my old neighbours.<br>Apollo screaming during their match to beat the highscore while I was reffing them. Thanks for the broken eardrums and lovely entertainment boys.<br>You're alright, we don't talk much and we aren't that close. Sometimes you're a little too strict or salty, but eh.

I didn't know who you were at first so I was like... "Uhhh, who is this kid?" but I'm really glad I've gotten to know you over the past few months.

Hi Crazy ^-^!<br><br>Long ago, a fetus child by the name of Jessica went on the Internet to find Minecraft servers to play on... Then she found a server with Skywars (which was all she played, literally...) called....&nbsp;<u><i>Avicus.&nbsp;</i></u><i></i>She continued to play and soon began to realize that it was taking over her life. Then she realized she had f*cked up, but continued to play anyway.<br><u></u>I was actually inspired by Hunting_chick (wherever the heck she went...) But yeah, I was basically mini-modding in chat and she told me that I should try applying for it because I would make a good mod. Just went with it when applications opened and I wanted to help people, so yeah (:&nbsp;<br>Literally love all the random discussions we have through staff chat and Slack. Hella fun.<br>OH MY GOD, YOU WERE LITERALLY THE ONLY JUNIOR MOD THAT I LOVED IN A LONG TIME. I just remember giving you advice with Greg or something...? But you actually took everything in and followed instructions so well, so thank god for that. You were really chill (still are) and yeah ^-^<br><u><i><br></i></u>

Oh man, Cammy. I remember hating your brothers and you a <u>long</u> time ago because you guys would make me go insane. But after you made it on the staff team, we got to know each other better and you're actually so nice and really fun to be around! Also, the accent makes you like.. x20 better.<br>I actually want to travel there so bad. Seems really cool there, and there are Aussie boys so man, heavenly.

You're salty and full of memes. We don't talk much but like, eh. I guess you're alright? I remember when we used to chat on Skype when we both got interviewee. You came up with so many possible questions, oh man. You've changed a lot since then.

Whoa whoa, do you mean Ethan? jk, I love you both equally.. Sort of. I mean, I guess you're better since you have the accent? Please don't tell him I said that. But Sessp, you're hilarious and I love talking to you. Stop calling me an American and maybe I'll like you more. You're chill, and extremely mature.&nbsp;<br>Pizza, which is generally served hot. So therefore, Harvey is hot. I mean, at least his accent is. jk, he's actually pretty attractive. I think, I might be blind.

You're actually extremely rude sometimes, and I don't understand why you freak out so much when someone mentions anime. But, you're cool.<br>I don't know, I haven't really seen you moderate in a long time. So I can't really answer.

Cheers, I just don't like it when people like things that I don't deem to be mainstream such as anime lol
