Welcome back! I'm relatively new (5 months registered but I only really played on the server for 4 of those) so I wouldn't remember you. FaZe is a CoD (Call of Duty) thing, I used to play but it's not worth the rage tbh. I'm a pretty calm person but damn CoD is frustrating.

I just can say: "Heey". Everybody already told you the important things, but if you need someone to talk or just some map help, you can add me on skype: Flo.schmenni. Well just add me ;)
