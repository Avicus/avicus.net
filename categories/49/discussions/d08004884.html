You taught me how to be successful in the staff team, and I always looked up to you when I needed help on anything regarding Avicus.<br><br>I hope the tourney increases player count. I see Atlas opening a lot of new doors regarding creativity of maps. The server has a lot of potential in the near future.<br><br>Staff-player relations. This aspect had been lacking for quite some time and definitely could be improved in as the server progresses.
