Well I've recorded the majority of the questions, but I still need to do a few.<br><br>There were over 40 questions asked, so the video itself is about 20 minutes now, and I have to edit it all as well.<br>This is by far my most edited video, and since it's a 500 subscriber special; which is a huge milestone for me, I want to make this perfect. :P<br><br>To answer your question, I hope sometime during this week (no later than Friday or Saturday)!
