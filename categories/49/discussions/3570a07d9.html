Correct me if I'm wrong; however, I believe these types of threads are not permitted on the Avicus forums.

It isn't, but this is her only thread about an update of her. If she were in order to continue these threads, then she would get a punishment for it.

What? That doesn't make any sense. If it isn't allowed, then it shouldn't be there. Just because it's her first doesn't mean she gets a free ticket.

Think of it like this: Let's say you have a sibling. Your sibling and you are having an arguement and it's annoying your parents. Would you rather have your parents tell you to stop, and punish you if you continue, or would you rather have your parents punish you right away for arguing?&nbsp;<br><br><br>Athena: This is your warning, please don't make threads about a Personal Update as it is against the rules.

Ugh, if you warn her, doesn't it get locked? Just because you warned her it doesn't mean the thread can stay open lol. Unless the rules have changed.
