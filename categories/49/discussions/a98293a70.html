Hello, the name's<i><b> </b></i><u><b>Sumbody</b></u>, or Drew, whichever you prefer :p<br><i><br></i>I originially started playing here back in the MCZone days, which feels like forever ago now. Back then the whole concept of Competive Minecraft PvP (as nerdy as that sounds) wasn't really a thing for me, I enjoyed the game for what it had to offer and hardly anything more. I didn't really make any friends then and there, I had stuck in my own clique of 2 or 3 guys I knew IRL. I came back on a hunt to find a new main server to play on, seeing as my previous one is slowly decenegrating to bits of past memories of the old days when the friends I had made there were starting to<i> </i>move on to servers that they'd enjoy more.<br><br>I'm very open to questions so ask away!<br><br>~<i><u>Sumbody</u></i><br><i></i>
