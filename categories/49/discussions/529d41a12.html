Hello, as you have noticed I was recently promoted to Senior Moderator, so to celebrate, I decided that I'd do an AMA. Ask away!

If you had to choose (hopefully you won't), would you stay in OCN or in Avicus?<br><br>I know this is a hard question for you so I guess I'll do it. Also, not pretending so start any flame war at all.

Congratulations again Pelp, here's my list of questions I've been storing up, I fancy commenting on them as well, haha! :P<br><br><br><ol><li><i><u>How do you start a conversation?</u></i><u>&nbsp;</u>For me, I smile.</li><li><i><u>Have you ever been stung by a bee?</u>&nbsp;</i>To be honest, I'm pretty sure, we all have. Don't comment on that. ._.</li><li><i><u>Are you wearing socks?</u></i><u></u>&nbsp;Umm, yea...&nbsp;</li><li><u><i>List someone you know, and describe them in 5 words.</i></u><i></i>&nbsp;This is rather interesting sometimes.</li><li><u><i>Would you rather go a week without bathing, but be able to change your clothes? Or a week without changing your clothes, but be able to bath?</i></u><i></i>&nbsp;That means washing in general, (showering etc.). I'd chose the latter, because of my hair.</li><li><i><u>Name the most terrifying moment of your life so far. Have you recovered from it?</u></i>&nbsp;Playing "Five Nights at Freddy's" and being freaked out of my skin. Such scare, no fun.&nbsp;</li><li><i><u>What is the longest you have gone without sleep?</u><u></u></i><u></u>&nbsp;24 hours, back-to-back sleepovers, more like stay-up-all-night-overs. Heh.</li><li><i><u>You are walking home in the dark, you see something move. Who/What is it (guess)?. What do you do?</u></i>&nbsp;I hate the dark, don't even get me started thinking about that. &gt;.&lt;</li><li><u><i>What question do you hate to answer?</i></u><i></i>&nbsp;&lt;--------</li><li><u><i>What cheers you up?</i></u><i><u></u></i>&nbsp;Thumping music.

It works different here :P. You take an interview, along with the other Mods that would like to try. Then, after all interviews are reviewed, you get told whether you made it or not. I was happy, really happy. I was relieved as well, just to get told you made, it's great.
