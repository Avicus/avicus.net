Look, I'm not good at admitting I'm wrong and I hate it when people are right about me being a dick sometimes, but I've been thinking that I have to man up and say this to get it off my chest and at least try to be a better person on the Internet. I was having my doubts until I was browsing 9gag this morning and I saw a post that, I think, explains a big part of my apology. Here it is:<br><br><a href="http://9gag.com/gag/avng3R5?ref=mobile" title="Link: http://9gag.com/gag/avng3R5?ref=mobile">http://9gag.com/gag/avng3R5?ref=mobile</a><br><br>I've realized that most of the complaints against me are valid and that I haven't been reflecting on my behavior as much as I should. And even though some people will fail to see me grow from a toxic kid to a member of the community that people actually like, I won't mind.&nbsp;<br><br>I'm going to admit, I think the number one reason I've been such a pain in the ass is because I'm stubborn as fuck. I'm not going to blaim this on what I'm about to say, but stubborn kind of runs in my family. I always used to think that my father was stubborn as fuck and couldn't admit when he was wrong but I realize now that I'm guilty of this too. As they say, like father like son. As a result I've failed to admit when I was wrong and when I was being a dick on multiple occasions on this server, and how I've made myself seem dumb a lot of the time. That's one part of my faults.<br><br>The second part is the my cockiness. I'm not going to talk much about this because I don't have much to explain. Long story short, I can be cocky as hell without realizing it. I remember that one post where I was giving someone some PvP tips (not saying any names although I don't think it matters that much) and seemed like I was overrating myself quite a bit. Looking at that post now I realize why I received so much hate. I'd like to just say it was never my intention to make people think that I thought I was the best or some shit like that.<br><br>The third fault is my ability to get triggered really quick. I'm not going to talk about this much because I have no way of explaining myself or giving excuses. I could become downright butt hurt from a post that wasn't even meant to be taken seriously, and I apologize for being a dick in arguments to whoever was in one with me.&nbsp;<br><br>There are probably a lot of things I have done that I haven't covered on this post but I'm guessing you guys get the general idea. Also, it came to my attention that i really needed to get this off my chest after I received negative feedback on the TBH posts. Most people saw me as a stubborn kid who doesn't really realize when he's wrong and when he does, he doesn't admit it. Some people saw me as a good person in the core but that I tried to hard to fit in. I've realized now that in order to fit in I must be myself and try to not be a douche. Anyways, thanks a lot to anyone who took the time to read this, and even though I honestly think most people that I have pissed off before this post either won't read this or give a shit about this post, I'm glad t o get it off my chest and finally be able to move on.

@Tiger Stop. You've stated yourself that you dislike when people do that on your threads, yet you're doing that exact same thing here? That's hypocritical. You've just come back from a web tempban recently, don't get into further trouble.<br><br>OP:<br>It takes guts to make an apology to the entire community and to share personal details &amp; thoughts. Personally, I've never had a problem with you even though we haven't talked that much, but you've always seemed like a nice guy to me anyway. I hope you've learned from your mistakes and that you actually do change. Good luck! o/

As Junr said, nobody's perfect. You can be cocky, sure. It's in the same way that I can be bratty, childish and annoying. We are our own worst critic. There's nothing left to forgive, as you've already apologised and that takes bravery that I doubt many people are capable of. All that's left is for you to forgive yourself. Stop beating yourself up about this; we all make mistakes, all that matters is that you learn from them.<br><br>You keep mentioning all of your negative aspects, well, how about concentrating on your positive aspects? =)<br><br>@TwentyOneTiggers: Enough. If you're just going to behave like a belittling child, then stop commenting. He apologised, that's enough for me, just as it should be enough for you.

Hardly. I just don't like seeing people in pain or feeling sad, especially if they're a good person and have no reason to feel that way. =)

First step to fixing a problem is realizing you have one. People will say "oh, it was only over a screen" buy tbh when it is in front of a community you've been in and known for years, it can be pretty difficult. Respect for saying it publicly. As much as that's a good first step, words mean a lot, but are lost without actions. We also need to see change and words don't solve everything. Good luck.
