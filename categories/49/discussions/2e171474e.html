Hello everyone I just thought I would make a post about a couple things about me that may interest you if we wanted to become closer.<ul><li>If you ever need someone to talk to for any reason, I am almost always available and my skype is soccermaster89</li><li>If you ever want to play other games or do some banter stuff my steam name is soccermaster89</li><li>Basically almost all my other account names are soccermaster89</li><li>Do not ask me why they are called soccermaster89</li><li>If you really care why I was in the 6th grade and could not think of a name when I bought the game and I don't want to change it</li><li>If you care to watch my play some games you can watch my livestream on twitch @ <a title="Link: https://www.twitch.tv/soccermaster89" href="https://www.twitch.tv/soccermaster89">https://www.twitch.tv/soccermaster89</a>&nbsp;but make sure to follow ;)</li><li>If you ever want to discuss broadway musicals or just listen to the soundtracks just hook me up. ( I would like to host a ts3 channel where I play soundtracks from shows all day) </li></ul><br>About my team, The Baller Boys. Okay seriously don't judge the name, you don't know how hard the struggle is to come up with&nbsp;a name that the majority your team approves. Now some of you may wonder, hey I like this guy and I want to be apart of his team! Sorry, my team is strictly of my friends. Now, RARLEY I will let some people who I know try out to be on my team. My team is entering our first tourney on avicus that is hosted by Blood. For any teams who go up against up, we have our strats, don't complain about them, and good luck. I also will be a livestreamer in this tourney.<br>Lastly, I was going to let this be a "surprise" but I will be applying for moderator when the applications open up on the first.&nbsp;I wish luck to all applying. Thank you for taking time out of your boring day to read this boring post. <br>
