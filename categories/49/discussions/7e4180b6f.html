Hello!&nbsp;<br><br>I have recently hopped on here again and I've decided to give this server a go, as you guys seem like a very friendly and welcoming community, so why not.<br><br>First off, big shoutout to <a rel="nofollow" href="http://avicus.net/Pelpelajax">Pelpelajax</a> for bringing me here again. If you don't know this guy yet, I can say he is one of my best friends on the internet nowadays. Thanks for everything you've done for me :)<br><br><h2><b></b>Who am I?</h2><br>I'm a 14 year old spanish guy that likes making friends and new experiences. I will hope on the ts pretty frequently, so if you want to know me a little bit more, you could maybe find me there.<i></i> I'm also a pretty decent coder (java, html, xml, ruby). If you wish to contact me you can:<br><ul><li>Go on my twitter (link on profile): follow me and ask for a follow back to DM:</li><li>Shoot me on skype (link on profile) for any other private concern.</li><li>If you want my email for any official proposes, ask me when I pop on your screen.</li></ul><h2>I've heard your name somewhere, but where?</h2><br>You probably know me from the Overcast Network, where I'm a really active player, and recently became part of the tournament staff as a permanent referee. I'm also pretty active on their mumble server and on their web forums, so that's another place to find me if you wish.<br><br><h2>AMA</h2><br>This thread can be also considered as one of those Ask Me Anything thread, so if you wish to, go ahead.<br><br>Thanks for reading up this far, and hope to see you rolling on here!<br><br>Regards,<br><br><i>javipepe</i>
