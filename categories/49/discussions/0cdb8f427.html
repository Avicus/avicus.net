Heh, no problem ;)&nbsp;<br><br><b><i>-What exactly&nbsp;happened in that car accident?&nbsp;</i></b>- My dad was picking me up from swimming class at 6.

Hi Josh!&nbsp;<br><br><b><i>- Thoughts on me?&nbsp;</i></b>- You were always a kind, and warm person to begin with. I couldn't talk with you so often on TS, it was still fun to talk with you and hear you talk. You respect people's thoughts and think before you a make a judgement. Like I said on my Birthday AMA, because you respect people, people respect you. Keep it up! People like you are what keeps Avicus community a unique one. #Josh4SrMod

Awww, hope you get well soon! I hope everything turns out great and good luck with your studies! Everything comes to an end and I didn't expect it to be now :(. However, I hope life beings great treasures and memories that will always last forever. Good luck with life! Hope to see you on from time to time.

Thank you so much Junr. Same goes for you too. I thought I would stay here for a couple of years and then leave to prepare myself for high school, but then again, life is full of surprises. Entering into this community was a great surprise to me. Thank you so much for everything that you have done for me. You gave me a GREAT start in this community. #Junr4SrMod

Thanks Abusive! I will miss the community as well.&nbsp;<br><br><b><i>- Opinions on me?&nbsp;</i></b><i></i>- You are a fun person. When I first heard your voice I was like "wow!" because it was the first time I talked with a stranger (not anymore ;) ). You and&nbsp;<img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cddcbae20d91113c7013149149c87241?s=20&amp;default=mm" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/Junr.html" style="color: #FF5C5C">Junr</a> were the ones who gave me courage to talk with anyone, regardless whether I know them or not. You made me open up to everyone, and I could never forget that. Thank you so much Abusive. :)&nbsp;<br><br>EDIT: Hakuna matata! Btw, congrats on Builder, Jr Mod, and Ref! Serves you right :P
