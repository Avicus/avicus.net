LegoKee, probably one of my best friends on this game because you're the same age and in the same year.

Can't remember when I gave an opinion of you. I think you're a decent player with potential because you're actually active and want to scrim. We don't talk much but you seem quite positive most of the time&nbsp;<br><br>IvanKeyz

Pretty long time friend. Always enjoy talking to you and you're an actual god at the game. I still remember those mega scrims back in the day when we'd always tunnel together or something. Glad you got picked up for Apollo and we should definitely talk more

There was a period after you stopped playing the game seriously where I thought you were really rude and stubborn towards a lot of people. Now I think you're really chill to talk to and you seem to be succeeding irl which is nice to hear. You're also a god at the game when you're PC works properly&nbsp;<br><br>Probably raging<br><br>Working at the european space agency or a criminal psychologist<br><br>BMW i8
