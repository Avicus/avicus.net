Hi. I'm Al.<br><br>(That's why my alt's name is Ale.)<br><br>OCN was better than Avicus. But this was the next best thing, so I ended up here in 2016.<br><br>It's been a crazy year and a half. I have said and done many stupid things, but people have been strangely forgiving. Even looking back at things I did in early 2017 makes me cringe. (Don't give yourself too much credit&nbsp;<img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cddcbae20d91113c7013149149c87241?s=20&amp;default=mm" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/Junr.html" style="color: #FF5C5C">Junr</a>; you're still not cool.) Thanks for looking past the dumb things I did, and letting me play an at least somewhat important part in this server.<br><br>For several months, I made all the rotations on this server. A lot of people roasted me for them, which is fair since it's all just personal opinion. I also made a couple of maps. I don't think any of them were particularly popular, but knowing that at least a few people liked Green's Farms gives me the tiniest bit of joy. I'd like to thank the awesome people who have helped me so much on building maps.

Silly me. You've been great, both with maps and personality. I hope you've enjoyed the thinkfish emoji in Discord.<br><br><img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/47b15675a0484e8f863a0cbf86ba22dc?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/profbananaslug.html" style="color: #009396">profbananaslug</a>, I'll miss looking back at your appeals for some "interesting" music. I guess you're an ultimate memer, but by this point everything you say is such a meme that you transcend yourself.<br><br><img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/3feb57900603446c9bbfd5fb40759f41?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/dev_revs.html" style="color: #009396">dev_revs</a> is the final person I'm going to tag. Our relationship has always been kinda weird. Sometimes you're fine with me in public and roast me in private chats, and other times you publicly complained about everything I did, while secretly feeling sorry for me. You're an alright guy, but sometimes have questionable ideas that you don't like people questioning. From what I've seen on Kord's server, you're a good admin. I wish you luck with the server, and hope that in some months I can return to a thriving community of Avicus players.<br><br>If I didn't tag you, either I forgot you, don't particularly like you, or simply have nothing to say to you. Feel free to PM me on Discord if I didn't tag you but you still want me to give you a personal statement.<br><br>Take care.

Oh I’ve been recognized<br>No but seriously though we gotta do more maps<br>Like, the TDFW one you mentioned<br>MYOB might’ve been controversial but it was unique&nbsp;<br>I’d love to do a sequel I guess, fixing whatever problems which were in the first one<br>Yeah but actually though even though I’ve made a map that was designed and built by me, with some help from others, I always prefer helping other people’s big ideas<br>So if you ever need any help with anything let me know<br>This goes out to anyone else looking to make a map as well
