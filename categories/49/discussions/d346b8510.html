I really like me in Norway, but I want to try to live in the UK somewhere for a year or so. I am actually considering moving to an other countr and go one year on school there (have to get a bit older though).&nbsp;<br><br>Without schoolwork and training I spend a lot time on avicus, reading books, and netflix.&nbsp;<br><br>As a person: You are nice to me, and I really&nbsp;appreciate it! When someone do something you dont like at all to you you complain about it all the time, cut it out please :c.<br>As a player: You are a good pvper when you try, and you communicate well. You don't seem to get salty, and always remember us to write gg which is a good thing =p<br>As a leader: I like your strating. Sometimes you make weird choices with the sub in-out but I know that's up to you.<br><br>Fav music is anything really. I like to study to clasic music like Mozart though.

You are funny, dirty minded (sometimes too much), and nice. You don't complain so much, and that's a good thing!<br>I like talking to you so much, i've actually stayed up to 2am with school the day after to talk with you xD.<br>I still remember the first time I talked to you. We were playing Rendezvous and you and someone else made a op defend. I saw it and wanted to join, so I camped in the defend with you guys. I really liked your cake cape, so I asked if I could get it, and you added me on skype! :D.&nbsp;<br><br>:o can't seem to find the link?
