Well after 3 years of being a community member ;&nbsp;2 years altogether of being staff i have finally achieved what many have known how <br>much &nbsp;i have wanted to get for ages. I'm looking forward so much to hopefully do the best for you guys &lt;3<br>&nbsp;<br>For anyone who doesn't know i'm part of the community relations section of the senior mod team , so hopefully mr pizza is friendly enough for you all :D&nbsp;<br>In 2 days i'll be going on Holiday to Ireland just a disclaimer before you all start calling me inactive :^)<br>So if you have any questions about me or my trip go for it!

McFanta:<br>I am 14<br>I enjoy running and cycling *and playing games too much*<br>pizza and water (i hate fizzy drinks , i know i'm weird.<br>probably cycling<br>Fox<br><br>CammyGee: Nice guy we should really talk more.&nbsp;<br><br>Posighdun:<br>You already know my opinions on you :)<br>Great admin &nbsp;, really enjoy &nbsp;having someone on the staff team i can just go and talk to whenever. On top of that your just in general a really friendly , sociable guy!<br><br>What made me come back?<br>Well when Peachy &amp; Iron approached me the main thing that motivated me was 100% the community it's the only reason nearly all us do this.<br><br>Shami: If you need some pizza carry sure :^)<br>I'm 14<br>I mean , i would say Apollo. *no bias at all*&nbsp;<br>I remember you used to be quite toxic but you seem to have matured more recently which i'm really happy to see. We should talk on ts more :D<br><br>Eteh:&nbsp;<br>I would quite like to go to Thailand since i've been next door , Vietnam.<br>Cause it's pizza.<br>You have the best username ever. Eat-Tea<br>But besides that you yourself are a really mature guy and i was very happy when you got promoted to mod. &lt;3<br><br>Xuph I'm not even........ &nbsp;;-;<br><br>Borrah:<br>To good at pvp for your ping :P<br>If i do a good job and the community wants it. And of course if the opportunity arises then i would be willing to try it out , yes.<br>Well considering my Sr Mod my opinon on Avn is quite good :) I love this community i've never been able to find one i fit in to better and i'm so glad you guys are all here &lt;3<br>Windows hands down<br>Pc&nbsp;<br><br>DaFrozenBlaze:<br>Yes you can eat me , beware of the sauce :^)<br>As i said above on borrah's question if everything comes together i do think i have the right mindset to go for it.<br>Why do i sound like this? Puberty , simply put.<br>As for maturity even though that can partly be put down to &nbsp;that also. I like to think my parents are thanks to that.<br>Why 334? Boring story really. I wanted a mc name when i was 11 and i wanted to sound like 'james bond' so i was like , "oo i know pizza334" yeah boring i know.<br>Taco334 was a inside joke that sem used to call me 24/7 so i changed my name to it for a month.<br>Hard to believe now , agreed. :P

<span>Harvey! So glad you got to experience the feeling when you get that dark red tag, my heart jumped out of my chest at 5am.
