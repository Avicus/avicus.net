I poker and face.<br><br>I removed legend after name changes were allowed. Originally, I was going to just take out the underscore (and leave the Legend part), but I was shocked to find out that such an original name of PokerFace was available. I took advantage of the situation :D<br><br>I am very proud of you posting before Blaze.

No Pokerfack<br><br>Poker drunk= Yes.<br><br>I will leave my name how it is now.<br><br>I'm ashamed of you for posting after keller.<br><br>Hawaii is a very beautiful place. I wake up to the warm sun and blue sky. Everyday, I wear a T-Shirt and shorts. Everywhere you will see huge palm trees, even in the city! The ocean is crystal clear and you can smell the salt in the air near the ocean. Everywhere else, the oxygen is clean.<br><br>You are a very funny and cool guy. The best thing about your humor is that it doesn't seem like you try to be funny which makes it even funnier! Also during scrims, when I point out something stupid, I know you try not to laugh, but I know you want to xD

Super chill guy. You always make me laugh as well through in-game chat or form posts. Your subtle humor is the best :D Also super helpful with computers.You are also pretty good at PVP. I remember we 1v1ed sometime and I asked how many pots you had left. I think you only used half of your pots xD

Fun guy. Idk why, but you always have more pts in CS:GO then me. I know you like my AWP flicks though d:^) Regardless, it's always fun to play games with you and have some banter.

Prety good at pvp, I remember back in Predator days when you played with us. Those were the days :D<br><br>I think of Cacal as Team E-Frag in CS:GO.
