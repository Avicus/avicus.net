One of the people I'd be happy to see wherever, I've literally watched you grow up xd. You're a good player who can do much better if you focus and use your game sense, been with Apollo for awhile and you're one of the og's. Amazing player, even better friend; fun as hell to scrim with you or play with you whenever possible, always nice coming back at times and seeing you.

I blame the delevopers for the server's decline ever since the last major update. If the servers were consistent and didn't go down once ever 2 days or so, then there probably would've been a lot more playing on the server.&nbsp;<br><br>arabic version for sure

bahah, I saw my reply to you on the last AMA I made and holy shit that was rough. Anyways, I'm chill w/you, never see you in-game, or anywhere, surprised you're still even here xd. You probably matured over time and got used to your position so to that, kudos.

You improved a lot, yet, we should still 1v1 on lounge. You're a nice person who's come a long way, in a way I'm surprised you're still here ever since ocn shut down. Regardless, nice player, used to be more bow that sword but I think that's changing (pls stay good at bow xd) keep it up bro, wish you good luck in your exams btw :p

You're very nice to basically everyone personally, I can see a lot of people like you. I've heard some good things about you from your scrims with us and I can see you coming a long way with Apollo, hopefully you still improve though, because we all need it. btw, who tf is nia xd?

I do not know you personally at all so I'll give you my opinion on you as a player. You're average, not too good, not too bad, you could really improve though, since the game is actually very simple. Work on your shit outside Avicus, since strictly sticking to avi would be bad for your pvp. Was fun doing Bl w/you :)

Extremely underrated player, you can be a god in scrims, like no joke. Well done my dude, you came back from a long ass break yet you're still really good. You should really really abuse your ping as much as possible, because you could really be THE best if you tried to. You always have my back and I will always have yours, regardless of what happens.
