Hit me up on Discord if you want to do one, boldandbrash#4517.<br><br><div><b>What is your IGN and team?</b><br>Poofywoo and Celestial<br><br></div><div><b>How many tournaments have you participated in?<br></b>One. Conquest Inc, and some other unofficials.<br><b><br></b></div><div><b>Any team in particular you'd like to face off against?<br></b>To be honest i dont really have any team i would like to face off against, but i wanna see how Cacalmarin play.<br><b><br></b></div><div><b>Any team you don't want to face off against?<br></b>Puredogs and allah<br><b><br></b></div><div><b>How do you think you'll do this time around?<br></b>I think Celestial will do alright this time round. We have a strong roster, and are starting to improve. Last tm it was because of inactive players, but hopefully we'll have a better turn out this time.<br><b><br></b></div><div><b>Any teams you have a rivalry with?<br></b>We don't really have a rivalry this time around. Personally i wanna play SquadCatt<br><b><br></b></div><div><b>What do you think is your team's best strength, and your best strength alone?<br></b>We have a strong roster, like people know what to do. We work well as a team.&nbsp;My strength is that I work well with others. (mostly)<br><b><br></b></div><div><b>What do you think is your team's worst weakness, and your worst weakness alone?<br></b>Our weakness is that our communication is trash,&nbsp;my weakness is thatI i panic under pressure.<br><b><br></b></div><div><b>What have you done to prepare?<br></b>We have discussed team skins cause that's how teams win. Nah just scrimming lots with the tm roster. Working on strats.<br><b><br></b></div><div><b>Anything you'd like to say to your opponents?<br></b>Opponents, go to Mongul's wool first.<b><br></b></div>
