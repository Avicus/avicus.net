&nbsp; Hey guys, I have been playing on Avicus a little over a year, (My old name was EAJames11, newly changed it!) and have made 3 posts, but with the name and what not, I've decided that I should make a formal introduction. (Never did) So, I will start with a name explanation. I chose HyperNova_ because I have the tendency to go on a rampage and just own everything, for a short period at a time. Hence, Nova. I added hyper too it because it sounded cooler, my moment of glory is extremely short, and well, Nova was taken. I am a 13 year old human male from the planet Earth, and the continent of North America. The USA too be exact. ('Murica!) I am quite interested in map making, music making, Minecraft, (duh) and I hope to learn to code one day. Anyways, this is stupidly long, was just a "quick" formal intro, and I can't wait to see Y'all in game!
