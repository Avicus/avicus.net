<div>Hello fellow avicus lovers,</div><div>I want to make some clarifications about myself since I'm sure many players have opinions about me.</div><div><br></div><div>So...about 2 years ago, I made a post explaining myself and who I am.&nbsp;</div><div>At that time, I felt I received a mixture of support and disapproval. &nbsp;</div><div>I stopped playing avicus for awhile because I don't like to be judged.</div><div>But...in the end, I came back and have enjoyed many hours on this server.</div><div><br></div><div>I have made some new friends and I feel it's time to explain myself again</div><div>and let you decide if you want to continue to welcome me into the avicus community.</div><div><br></div><div>In a nutshell...</div><div><br></div><div>I am old.</div><div>I am much older than any other players on avicus.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I am a mother.</div><div>I have 3 fabulous children ages 14, 12, and 10. &nbsp;We are a very close family and live in California. &nbsp;</div><div>All of my children are extremely active on either social media, youtube, and/or online video games.&nbsp;</div><div>Sometimes I play avicus with them or on our mc realm. More recently, they have all moved onto other games and activities,</div><div>but I've stayed on avicus because of the community. &nbsp;My children are all supportive of my youtube channel and may start streaming with me soon.</div><div><br></div><div>I am a teacher. &nbsp;</div><div>I teach English to K-5th grade students. &nbsp;I work mostly with new immigrants to the US. They speak little to no English. &nbsp;</div><div>It is a very rewarding job, provides flexible hours, and summers off.</div><div><br></div><div>Why avicus?</div><div>I started playing avicus before McZone with the WallsMc or SkyWars ip. &nbsp;My son found the ip on a list server and we started playing together. Avicus has fun maps and enjoyable players. Every time I play avicus, I am always laughing at my mistakes and/or what other players are saying in chat. &nbsp; Most members of avicus are friendly. &nbsp;I try to treat players in a way that I like to be treated...with respect.</div><div><br></div><div>Looking forward...</div><div>I would like to continue playing on avicus. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I am part of a team HOME on avicus with 23 players. &nbsp;I will continue to be a leader of that team, unless members would like me to step down. In the past, I have built 2 maps for Walls that were accepted and put into rotations (Camp Creeper, Camelot).&nbsp;</div><div>Currently, I am working on a Walls map (The Station) and a SkyWars (No Name Yet) map and hope to release pictures/downloads soon. I may apply for Media, if the staff is open to it.</div><div><br></div><div>Again, my only intention for playing on avicus is to have fun and relax when I have free time at home.</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks for reading. &nbsp;Ask Me Anything.</div>

Hi AtditC - Good question!<br>I don't know when the counter started to track that amount of time. &nbsp;It does seem excessive...I agree. I'm trying to aim for bit more balance.<br><br>&nbsp;All I can say is that I have a lot of 'free time' and I choose to spend my time on avicus. My children are very autonomous. We are a very 'electronic device focused' family. &nbsp;If I'm playing on avicus, I'm communicating with my children all the time via skype, texts, or face-to-face convos. It may sound unconventional, but it works for our family. &nbsp;We do many activities during the week and weekends together including dinner, shopping, going to movies, the park, and/or school functions. Sometimes, we include grandma, their uncle, or their father.<br><br>In fact, today we are going to the local comic book store, Trader Joe's (grocery store) to pick up lunch, and then have a picnic in the park. The highlight will be a 'bottle flipping' contest. We invented a game called "BOTTLE" like HORSE for basketball or SKATE for skateboarders.<br><br>All my children support what I do and tell all their friends about it. &nbsp;Some of my Youtube subs are their friends from school.<br><br>Hope that semi-answers your question or maybe it was TMI.

Hi Random!<br>I haven't really thought about it, but yes, I'd say we are competitive with each other... &nbsp;more so with board games like Stratego, RISK, or DICEcapades. When I'm playing mc with them, we are usually on the same team or have the same objective like building a structure.

Hi Legoche!<br>I have many favorite maps...some are removed from rots though :( &nbsp;Most are from the old throwback rotation.

</blockquote>
</div>
Hi Precis!<br>Well, I created HOME for many reasons.<br><br>1) I kept asking for the return of what I call 'Survival Lobby' where you spawn into a survival world and could build, farm, and kill before choosing to go directly to Nebula. &nbsp;I really enjoyed that, so now I'm able to do that kinda stuff on the team servers.<br><br>2) I was curious what all the hype was about having a team. I wanted to learn all the commands. &nbsp;I like the ability to choose any map and play on demand.<br><br>3) Players were getting mad when I'd build houses during real Nebula matches. &nbsp;I like to goof-around, so I've recorded a lot of scrim sessions and will be putting together a montage soon!! :)<br><br>4) Practice PVP with my team, of course.

Hi PieZ - Any questions are welcome! I realize in advance that some people may disagree with my comments.<br><br><b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">How do you feel your school or school board(Which ever tells you what you have to teach the kids) is doing for your kids?&nbsp;</b>I feel that the school board and/or state&nbsp;legislators&nbsp;are out-of-touch with reality. They haven't spend enough time in actual classrooms to understand the challenges that teachers face and/or the various needs of a diverse group of students. &nbsp;They also haven't asked the students what works best for them.<br><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><br><b>Is it good enough or can it improve in some format where you are from? </b>Sure it can improve, but the people who make those decisions are listening to the wrong special interests (ie. testing companies) and implementing some changes that are not helping students. Not enough time is spent on actual instruction and follow-up to make sure students understand a skill or concept before they are tested on that subject matter.</span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>What do you believe is the best way to teach children in a school setting?</b> Well, having a qualified instructor is the first step. Besides understanding the content matter, they need to be able to engage students and check for understanding to make sure students understand what/why they are learning. &nbsp;Also, class sizes must be smaller (ie. 20 students max). Having more electronic devices available on campus for student use is only valuable when the teacher has had proper training (which most have not-this is a work in progress).<br><br><b>Are you stern or do you believe you are very free with your classes?</b> No, I'm not stern at all...maybe a little lax, but I always make it clear what student behaviors, expectations, and outcomes are necessary for them to learn. Students are in charge of their own learning. &nbsp;My classes are usually small groups between 3-15 students, so we are able to focus more on content and understanding.</span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Do you believe that Minecraft and other games have a role in the future of schooling with certain kids?</b> Sure, I've read many articles online regarding teachers using mc in their classrooms. &nbsp;Anything that makes content more&nbsp;accessible&nbsp;for students should be utilized even if it's in a game format.<br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Favorite flavor of ice cream?<br></span>Key Lime Pie, Chocolate Peanut Butter, or Pistachio - can't decide

Hi armored! :)<br><br><b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">what is your favorite subject to teach?</b> Well, I teach English exclusively now, so I'd say English. &nbsp;But...I was a former 3rd grade teacher and I enjoyed teaching Math then too! Science was only fun for me when we did experiments, so we did a lot of those. I'm a very visual and hands-on learner, so most of my lessons were structured that way...along with the additional auditory&nbsp;piece.<br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>do you plan on being more inactive due to the school year?</b>&nbsp;True, I will be more inactive because the school schedule is different than the summer routines. I get the same holidays/vacations as the kids, so that's a bonus. Too be honest, I've been more inactive due to the changes in avicus recently. I miss throwback.<br></span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>WHATS YOUR KIDS NAMES?</b> Olivia (age 14), Charlie (age 12), Sophia (age 10) - Charlie &amp; Sophia are the two that occasionally play mc.</span>

<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Hi 99!<br><br><b>Are you going to Minecon?</b> No, even though it's held in California this year, it's still more than a 5 hour drive away from me. &nbsp;We drove to Disneyland last summer and the drive is no fun. Plus, I think my kids would be more interested in Comic-Con. I think that's in San Diego 2017, so maybe that would be an option.<br></span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>Favourite Avicus memory? </b>Well, I have many. I enjoyed playing Walls, Nexus, &amp; SkyWars with my son when we first joined this server. Also, I really enjoyed the Walls community when we'd have tons of players interested with the old, original maps. After becoming more of a Nebula player now, I've enjoyed learning how to defend and trying more offense. All the players have been really helpful and kind. Many players make me armor which is always a compliment...or they're telling me that I die easily and I need extra protection.<br></span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>Do you enjoy teaching?</b> Yes, as a whole I do. &nbsp;Nothing is more satisfying than starting with a newcomer (no English) student and guiding them to at least the Intermediate level by the end of the year. &nbsp;I'm always amazed at progress. &nbsp;Besides teaching children, I also have to deal with some administration &amp; compliance issues. Sometimes discussions with fellow teachers and principals can be tricky when they aren't providing the extra language acquisition services mandated by the state.<br></span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>Opinions on me?</b> You always speak your mind and I respect that.

Hi DaBaderMC!<br><br><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>Favorite cake flavor?</b> I'm not really a cake fan...more of a pie person.

I'm afraid Trump will high-jack the election and become president, so I've always wanted to visit Vancouver &amp; Victoria. I will have to pretend I'm on vacation and get a job somehow quick. If I'm not considering the election, then US dream would be Hawaii. I've been before and love it. Global dream would be Egypt and the pyramids.</span>

Avicus needs more transparency and inclusion. There are some things that I would suggest for the website to attract more attention too.<br></span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>What are your children's IGNs?</b> Treehugger2016 and cuddlemuffin305.

I find myself in game chatting "mod like" comments, but I see that as just supporting the avicus rules as part of the community. &nbsp;I'm just not sure the players would want someone like their mom telling them what to do. So, recently I've been thinking about applying for Media since that's more commentary than actual directive. I've been playing around with Twitch to see if that's something I could even do with my computer. &nbsp;I'm still thinking about it.<br></span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>Pizza or pasta?</b> I like both, but lasagna is my favorite pasta.

One was in London and the other in Copenhagen. I lived with a local family in both cities and studied liberal arts and international business. While overseas, I was able to visit England, Denmark, Scotland, Wales, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Austria, Estonia, and Russia. Later, I traveled to Canada &amp; Mexico. All my travels have helped form who I am today and why I feel so strongly about helping others who are new to the US. I would love to travel more and take my children, but it's just too costly at the moment.<br></span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>When can we talk together in Tiger's TS server???</b> I'm open to talking anytime. You could talk to my kids too, if you want, or if they want.<br></span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>Favorite type of bread?</b> This is an interesting question.

Gee...I'm not an expert, but it sounds like things are improving, so maybe a 7. It seems like we tank during Republican rule and grow during Democratic rule. America has to get out of industries that harm the environment or the health of our people locally and/or globally. When Trump says he will save the jobs of the coal miners, I just cringe. We need to get out of the coal business.<br></span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>Favorite number?</b> 3 or 7.

I really believe that students should be the masters of their own learning, but first you have to teach them how to do that. Plus, students come into school with so many issues from their&nbsp;environment&nbsp;at home that sometimes instead of a teacher they need a friend, nurse, and/or counselor. Teachers have to be all of those. I've had students tell me that they have no friends and I always answer, "I'm your friend", and I mean it.<br>

Hi Okiba!<br><br><b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Has teaching ever been troublesome?</b> Yes. I decided to become a teacher after being a Literacy Tutor for Kindergarten and 1st grade students (5-6 year olds) through a program called AmeiCorps. &nbsp;It was like the domestic peace corps, but we went into inter-city schools (Oakland, CA) to help teach children how to read. This inspired me to get my Teaching Credential. As part of that program, you have to do a couple of weeks as a "Student Teacher". So basically, you take over a master teacher's class for about 1-2 weeks as practice. &nbsp;I had such a bad experience during this time that I cried and called the Principal to come take over the class. &nbsp;It was out of control! I&nbsp;actually&nbsp;decided NOT to become a teacher and did something else for a year. But.. eventually, I decided to give it a try again and I'm glad that I did because now I've been teaching for over 14 years. &nbsp;I found my niche.

Hi FrostedCupcakez!<br><br>Thanks for making me feel welcome! :)<br><br>I think the moderators do a great job!&nbsp;I've always felt that the mods have responded quickly to my reports, as well as, helped me figure out my setting on avicus when I'm having difficulties. Everyone is polite and friendly.<br>Sometime I question favoritism, but I tell myself that I might not have the complete picture, so I let it go.&nbsp;<br><br>The only issue I have is the lack of staff online during certain hours. &nbsp;I live in the Pacific Time Zone, and it seems like the number of mods dwindle after 9pm-ish. &nbsp;Many times during the summer I would play late at night and zero staff would be online for at least 2-3 hours. &nbsp;Eventually, the Australian crew would come online and support would resume.

Here I am thinking you're like 18-23ish... LOL&nbsp;<br>I think it's awesome that you're a teacher and a mother and you still have time to spend with us. That's a lot of dedication! I want to work in a preschool or daycare when I get a little older. It seems weird to say this, but you seem like a really great role model, someone who a lot of people look up to and can talk to about stuff. You have a job, a family and you still take time out of your day to talk to people online and enjoy your free time! That's honestly amazing, idk how you do it. lol<br><br>Some of my questions might have already been asked, I'm not sure.&nbsp;<br><br><b>What are the IGN's of Charlie and Sophia?

Hi Micah! :)<br>I think it's great that you are interested in preschool or daycare. We have a YMCA program that offers childcare after school and all of my kids went there for fun activities after school. All the young people working there were always happy, energetic, and had interesting lives outside of daycare (ie. artists, musicians,...) Great place to start!<br><br><b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">What are the IGN's of Charlie and Sophia? If they ever play on Avicus I'd want to say hi. :p<br></b>TREEHUGGER2016 is my son. He's playing factions lately. He may come on to say HI in the near future. My daughters share the account, cuddlemuffin305. My youngest may come on Nebula to build a house.<b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><br></b><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">What are your hopes for the new walls that will be coming out. (Hopefully updated)<br></b>I'm looking forward to any changes. I'm hoping they considered the UHC version someone described in post when all the discussions for improvements were being gathered.&nbsp;<b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><br></b><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">What is your favorite walls map? (This includes maps that are not in rotations)<br></b>Village. It's always been village. This map is just perfect in my eyes. It's simple and easy to navigate.<b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><br></b><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Did you know that you were the first person I met on Avicus, my first friend. It's been a short almost 4 years!&nbsp;<br></b>Wow! I believe you were the first player that I would team-up with on Walls as well! &nbsp;You're a great teammate! All the old school walls players are still the closest players I have on avicus. &nbsp;They are a solid, super nice group of people and some still play Nebula, so that's an extra bonus.<b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><br></b><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">What is your favorite animal?<br></b>Tiger.

Panda in Chinese I think means 'black and white cat-foot' (thanks Wiki). My daughter has a stuffed animal collection of over 15 Pandas of different shapes and sizes. Baby panda videos on YT are funny to watch too!

Hi Neb! :)<br><br><b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">What is your favorite book(s)?</b> I always find the word 'favorite' a hard choice. &nbsp;Do I tell you the book(s) I like to read over and over again? &nbsp;Or the book(s) that changed my perspective on an issue and was/were personally transforming? &nbsp;<br><ul><li>"<b>The Zombie Survival Guide</b>-Complete protection from the Living Dead" by Max Brooks - This is the book that I'm currently reading. He also wrote "<b>World War Z</b>-An Oral History of the Zombie War". I'm not a zombie movie fan because they're are too scary for me, but for some reason I like these types of books.&nbsp;</li><li>"<b>How to Defeat Your Own Clone</b> and Other Tips for Surviving the Biotech Revolution" - This is along the same lines. I find it funny, as well as, informative.</li><li>All the <b>LOTR</b>s and <b>Game of Thrones</b> series are entertaining.</li><li>"<b>Price of Honor-Muslim Women Lift the Veil of Silence on the Islamic World</b>" - This book is a collection of personal stories from around the globe. &nbsp;This was a powerful book in the sense that I didn't know much about how some women are affected by the rise of fundamentalism.</li><li>"<b>The Story of Ferdinand</b>" by Munro Leaf is my favorite childhood book.
