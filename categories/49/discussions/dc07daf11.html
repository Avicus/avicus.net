Uh.. old one got buried at Oldvicus. You can use this thread and this thread only to ask me questions over the forum, and ask questions about your maps/status of them. Anything you want, you got. Some FAQ on my profile x3<br><br>I don't expect many replies, but go ahead.

I never accuse players of hacking because<br>&nbsp;1. If they are, they will most likely turn it off.<br>&nbsp;2. It's not really respectful and it's rage-like.<br>&nbsp;3. It causes other players to go bonkers.<br><br>I've not called you a hacker.

I do not believe one has yet been chosen, however there certainly are suggestions spiraling. I can confirm, however, there will be more map developers in the future. The only issue is that not everyone is entirely qualified for it and if we had magic map-making YMLer ponies that knew everything inside and out, we'd probably promote them by now :P<br><br>EDIT: I used to be known as TheMasterCow, and before that, TheLegendOfGames. I switched over from TheMasterCow for some fresh stats on OCN, and after that I chose ParaSpider as another main account due to a project that I was helping on for a bit called "Athena", and I wanted to fit in with ParaPenguin and ParaPhoenix's name trend. Unfortunately, the Para himself is not very fond of me using this name, so when 1.8 rolls around with namechanging I will most likely try to get a more creative and original name.

I love maps and building/helping is one of my professions. While I had several mediocre maps, I was in the map committee, asked to have the maps repo access.. and somehow I got mapdev and got to where I am now. Followed along for a while though :P

<span><b><i>How did you become a Map Developer?<br></i></b><i></i>I was a member of the map committee when it first started, and I was asked privately by Gill if I wanted to be in it. I accepted it, and I believe I grew into a mapdev by doing a lot of contributions, eventually me asking if I could have access to the Github repo. I got it, then after a while, I got the user rank, after that Junior Dev (which lets me help manage docs.avicus.net and issue tracker). I'm now a mapdev :3<br><b><i><br></i></b></span><b><i>Why isn't Koodalord a Map Developer?<br></i></b>I don't know. I'm not really the one to ask about this, but I believe he's caught up with his own server right now xD<br><br><b><i>What's the most important quality to become a map dev?<br></i></b>I believe teamwork. Collaboration is very important instead of just personal opinions and making random changes to the server. We are able to do stuff faster, and better, that way.
