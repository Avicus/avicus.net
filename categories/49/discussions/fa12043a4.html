Hi panda<br><br>Youre a really nice person. i didnt get to talk to you a lot but you seem to be rly nice. i also like your memes and i think ur a funny person as well. hope we get to talk more<br><br>As a player i think youre not the best in your team in pvp, but youre still a decent defender and i personally struggle getting into your wool in scrims because you know how to hold off well and your rotations are really fast. good luck in this tourney.

Hi tazz<br><br>Great melee player. dont know about your bow. Can offend really well and i wish you played KFC with spectre because we lacked offence. I really like your playstyle. I think youre a very valuable player for a team to have, and youre also reliable. I hope to get to play with you in the future<br><br>As a person, youre two faced. by that i mean youre sometimes so nice to me and youd do that in order for me making you something like an edit or a map but in other cases you can be rude as well<br>Youre a great friend of mine though and i enjoy talking to you even if you can be annoying sometimes. I wish youd be more active :c

Hey james<br><br>You're hella annoying sometimes ngl. You just argue for the sake of arguining at times and your points make literally no sense, but at times you can be really smart and win arguements by this. I like your sarcasm when we used to talk in ts and sad that we don't do anymore, you should be active on ts again. I dont think youre very good in hack detection as a mod too, but that comes with time and experience so its fine<br><br>As a player i think youre decent with sword but i guess bow is your better thing since i saw you bow sometimes. Not much else to say, sorry :c<br><br>Practice on pot pvp servers, it improves your melee the most

Hey toms<br><br>One of my best spanish friends along with bloodoh. Youre such a smart person when it comes to game tactics and in general and i love seeing you play or think about anything since you always come up with creative and smart solutions.&nbsp;<br>I really enjoy talking and memeing with you. Really good defender, nice bow and sword and comms, you also got huge player potential and im happy to see youre on yirang, theyll get the most out of you i hope.

Hi scaglia<br><br>I don't know you that well, but i remember talking to you in whatsapp few times haha<br>I always thought youre a very nice person and i still do. You really helped the ref team and took the job seriously. I liked it when you made your beaner spotlights aha xd<br><br>I never really saw you play so i cant tell about your pvp but you were in EC and other teams which were decent so ill guess youre a good player. Hope we get to know eachother more<br><br>I have lots, gamewise id say League vs Bad Company my last monument break in 2 seconds, or either some double caps and crazy objectives i got on some tournies<br>Fun wise apollo is a great team so we have lots of good moments with eachother but one to remember is our rave session ft. earrape when we all sing in ts.

Hi sevo<br><br>I dont recall ever actually speaking to you over voice, just ingame. As a person you honestly annoy me sometimes by the fact you suck up to people you want them to do something. Ngl it feels like youre tryharding to get in apollo constantly and fanboy some us etc. Other than that i saw you being toxic so many times but later on you apologised and became a better person so gj on having the balls to admit and change. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>As a player i think you have great melee but your ping might be a factor since i fought you in avicus only, but lets say your melee probably wouldve been good anyways. Idk about your bow never seen it properly. Potential to become good competitive player<br><br><br>It's open for donator preview only<br>edit: for now not forever

Hi robo<br><br>Youre a cool person overal. you try to be nice to so many people but you get lots of hate for a reason<br>You can be extremely annoying sometimes and you dont understand the word stop. i think youre sometimes like this kind of victim people group up to make fun of. i dont think its right because even if youre annoying i enjoy talking to you sometimes and youre a cool person overal, but try to talk less and not be annoying sometimes<br>You also built some cool maps &nbsp;like that colors ctw map that was denied for some reason although i rly liked it.

Hey borra<br><br>Youre from the middle east habibi so i take you as a bud already haha.<br>Youre a nice defender and youre always working towards improving.&nbsp;<br>Recently my opinion has really changed on you since ive always seen you as a nice person but you seem to become a really toxic guy now idk why but id like to see you like you were beforehand.&nbsp;<br>You really overdo your defenses on scrims and imo defenders need to understand a very important thing no matter what team youre playing against so take that tip: prioritize everything you do. make an early defense and you gotta sort out all the stuff that youre doing by priority and make them match the playstyle of the other team. if youre defending right and your team got control of right sky for most of the match you can work on your defense monument but for example if they tunnel alot you should adjust to the game and work more on a pit etc.
