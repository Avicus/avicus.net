Easy to talk to and chill to be around. Glad you joined apollo because you're pretty damn good at melee. As a mod I've never seen you do anything drastically wrong so I guess you're fairly good at it. As a player I'd just say what I would say to most in apollo, work more as a team and communicate with each other.

Used to play MCZone with IRL friends in 2013/14 before they all left. I stayed for a bit before leaving the game for about 6 months too. After coming back I got involved in the Avicus community (this is around 2014/15) specifically on teamspeak with people like Iron and Sunrise. Again after around another 6 months I got involved in the competitive scene with Apollo and became mod (retired in January 2017). This led me to OCN when I joined Grim in 2016 and started playing tournaments (SOC was my first). It's really sad that I joined the competitive scene so late because I would have loved to play OCN tourneys in 1.7/1.8. And now here I am :p&nbsp;<br><br>Play more as a team instead of thinking we can take 1v3s.<br><br>Not much because you're a god :o Maybe learn other people's play-styles to play well with them.

Probably one of the most fun to talk to in the whole of this community. I fucking love your 'who cares' attitude towards avicus and minecraft in general. You're also an amazing pack maker and underrated af in pvp. RIP our old grim days &lt;3<br><br>If we improve the new apollo. Project redemption apollo was probably the best up until now though<br><br>In game just try to communicate a lot more effectively with other people, for example instead of complaining about dying in a 1v1 just tell someone else to come and 2v1 them with you. Other than that nothing really, I love talking to you and being around you.

ERICAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA. You're such a god as a player and your melee is insane but you should still try to improve on bow especially in scrims. As a person we've known each other for ages joining apollo at around the same time. I remember you back on fort and you kind of memed all the time but you don't as much anymore which is nice to see. I still love your sense of humour and find it hilarious to talk to you.&nbsp;<br><br><br>Teabag memes xdlol
