<u>Deezi </u>- Not more than you<br>-Working on it :)<br>-Deez<br><br><u>Cammy</u>-In all honesty, I don't really know you (haven't been updated on Avicus too much lately), but I can tell that you are a good mod and person in general.<br>-Avicus is the best Minecraft server that I have ever played on hands down. The mods are nice and are people that you can talk to easily, the gamemodes are cool, and the community is very friendly.<br>-I found out about Avicus because my friend (doesn't play MC anymore sadly) showed me this. In fact, I got minecraft in order to play on Avicus. He showed me some Camp Erbosi (Probably spelled it wrong like always), but I loved the look and wanted to play for myself. Been playing ever since<br>
