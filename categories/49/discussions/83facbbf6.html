Im 16 year old girl&nbsp; ( im not that good at pvp but i would said im average ) i used to play on this server years ago before they changed the name to avicus. If you want to play with me you can i dont have skype =( i use steam instead you can add me there and we can chat or you can follow me on tentacl =) i also play on other servers if you u ever see me you can always say hi if you want too =) <br><br>You can also add me on PMC my name is RoarPlayz_ i dont post and builds or anything maybe i will in the future =)<br><br>When i used to play on MCzone which is now Avicus i took a long break from MCzone then when i logged back on it was in public beta so started to play Nebula a few weeks later then i realized its the same server (Im so dumb)<br><br>-Pickle0207&nbsp; o3o
