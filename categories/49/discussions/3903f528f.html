HELLO PAIGE :D<br><br>Very well for the moments enjoying my friends before I go to Spain, wbu?<br><br>Well, one of the names that people knew about me was Sp__ (The "S" is by my name and the "p" is by my last name) I used that name until Overcast Network closed, so I started playing more often Avicus where i met Nemo and Nia who were the ones who told me to change the name to spi_pe and from there the name stayed
