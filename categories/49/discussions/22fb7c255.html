Me and my irl friend (RyanPearson22) were looking for walls servers back in march 2013 we stumbled across early MCzone and loved the walls on it. Then we played nexus together, i met Ronloyd and Panda also shoutout to Zeus, Zero and 1Theodore1 who i saw regularly, made my first friends actually learnt to pvp on 1.6 nexus and eventually joined the forums.Through the forums i played in the MCzone tourney, got knocked out by merlinmaster and emmy's team then I left for a while when Avicus first started because they had removed nexus but then re-joined because i decided nebula was fun and i wanted to be on the non-donor leaderboards&nbsp;&nbsp;(made it to 2nd at 1 point damn you fazer).around this point i also started Bad&nbsp;Company after a 5 month run, we grew fast and with the early roster i had some of the best times of my MC life but unfortunately summer 2014 we disbanded. I got banned for 5 months and in these 5 months i became the player i am now by doing a lot of Kohi and OCN, without my ban i would be no-where near as good as i am now and not have made many of my friends today so i am almost thankful for it. But hearing AV might have a new tourney (little did i know it would take another 5 months XD ) i appealed and was unbanned at this point i firstly joined Apex and made some more new friends namely the D00z. Apex disbanded so i created spin off team of BC called Blurred Dreams which invlolved a number of the early BC players and a few apex members, but it never really worked out I had a rocky road on AV for a while around here and was banned and unbanned a number of times with my infractions growing like India's population. Luckily Notal approached me and said "look i miss the old BC lets restart it again but properly, like the old one. So we did. That was the birth of today's BC a team most of you know quite well. It consists of about half old BC members and half new legends that have now become some of my greatest friends. This team became very good we competed in the tourney and got DQ'ed i almost disbanded the team and quit MC right there if i'm honest i was so pissed. But i realised we can still have fun with all the new AV teams growing and actually becoming more competitive i was happy to stay and keep this great team.&nbsp;<br><br>I know you didn't ask for my AV history but ya know thought i'd give it ya anyway.<br>Also talking with you more would be great you should hit me up on skype (b.banno321)

Well ever since i met you i always thought you were nice, like you were bad, but nice. You always used to say hi and were always friendly, it was a large regret i never took it a step further and talked with you on skype. This carried on for a couple of months i guess but i never really thought too much of it. Then the competitive scene of AV kicked off and i noticed that you were getting pretty damn good. One day you applied for BC and tazz and robin told me you were worth it, so i chanced it basing my entire decision on how friendly you used to be. AND BAM am i damn glad i made that decision, you are still one of the nicest guys in the team and wow have you improved, you're pretty freaking good.&nbsp;warmed up to you instantly and i like to consider us great friends now and i'm thoroughly glad to play and talk with you as much as we now do. :)

Well robin, i think you are one of the most resistant guys on the team no matter what shit is thrown at you, whether that's ingame, in skype or teamspeak or irl you can get through it all. I respect you hugely for pretty much singlehandedly keeping BC from all being banned and being the cool headed guy we need in those tense games. You almost never lose your temper and you're such a good friend, if i lived in sweden i'm sure we'd be friends there too, we have a lot in common except you're just like a kinder version of me. I'm so glad i chose you to join that one time and just keep doing what you're doing and we'll remain close for a loongggg time. :)<br><br>Because Avicus map devs are on the most part stupid. I mean come on upgrade to xml already your maps are crap, the regions are broken, you have no idea what good gameplay is and all you care about is that a map is massive and looks pretty, take tips from the MCzone, more functionable maps and the OCN ones to improve.<br><br>If kylo wants to keep this server running he needs &nbsp;to be more active, the staff need to freaking sort their shit out omg everyone's like an 8 year old drama queen running round looking for sympathy and trying to put each other down in some stupid revenge act, get a grip. I think all of the staff problems just come from the seniors and people who dealt with the applications to take more time, i remember about a year ago that the staff had far less problems and was run better as well as not accepting almost every single mod applicant, be harsher and more selective to get better results. Avicus' only real hope of attracting players and keeping the server interesting is it's tournaments so spend more time and effort on that would be a good thing to do.

Of course i do.<br>I willl be here all day.&nbsp;<br><br>I met you longg back in MCzone nexus and you were one of the few guys who really made me rage, i didn't understand the concept or bows and you made be pay for that dearly. Then in the dawn of Avicus i created dat lovely BC and you appeared, i was like heellll yeahh. You turned out to be one of our key players and a really nice guy. You were also on my team in my first ever scrim with BC (A TDM on Vallis against Kewl Kidz koodalord's team) &nbsp;you once again never ever EVER lost your cool and i always remember those insane redstone creations you used to make, i'm glad i see and talk to you a bit more now. You're a truly great guy zero :))

TDM because i don't consider Avicus' current TDM real TDM but other than that some variation of those sorts of gamemode e.g Control points, scoreboxes.

When i first met you, i thought you were some all powerful and knowledgeful OCN legend, then i learnt you're a l'il clienting skid ;))). I always respected you despite our many arguments and you always have interesting if not good idea's. You're a very good player with a lot of initiative (maybe even too much at times ;) ) and like me you're one stubborn git. I think we have more similar personalities than we realise and that is why we clash a lot but in the end we are friends and i'm glad to have you in the team.

You wish.<br><br>Well i think it's fair to say you've been around as long as if not longer than me and throughout my entire time on MCzone/AV you've always been there to provide the healthy amount of shits and giggles i require. I wish i had been in more teams with you because every scrim we've been in together i have always enjoyed. Also on a side note we need to do more banter evenings with seb, caiden and karim.

To think for the first few months of knowing you i thought you were firstly a girl and then a guy called adrian before finally learning that you have girl skins because you're kinky and adrianosborne was your friends account that you used. As long as i have known you, you've been a friend to me, in the old BC you were one classy "rusher" and now you're going back to that which is cool. It's amazing that you have stayed with us for so long as you've had your fair share of hardships in the team and i respect you for staying on through all that and still being such a nice guy.&nbsp;<i></i>All i can say is i hope we stay good friends for a good long time. :)

Welp you were one of the few people back in the day who made me actually rage via minecraft, then i found out you hacked but ya know, i thought you were a god for a while. Then you joined team allah, you were good, you subbed for us, you were really good, we stole you from robo because you're hot and then i found your really cool. Nice guy, great player, top notch lad.&nbsp;<br><br>But you'll never quite be Rau1.

You're right i don't know you that well but from what i can tell you're a nice guy at heart just very inexperienced when it comes to competitive matches and play, this may give the impression you're a bit immature or stupid but don't worry i don't think that. :)

I think that you've matured a lot in pvp and personality, you seem cool and collected in scrims and games. I personally quite like you and think you could potentially be one hell of a good player.

You're a really nice lad and very genuine, i always feel like you're honest and fighting against you makes me way better because of how similar both our style and skill level is.
