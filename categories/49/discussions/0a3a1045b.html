used to be one of my best buds, &nbsp;but with the time your personality has changed a little and now youre being really salty and rude to me for some reason, even though i help you in whatever needed and i dont feel you appreciate it, but it doesnt matter. as of a person, can be extremely annoying sometimes, but overal is a good friend and helping whenever needed. has a lot of knowledge about computers, and a god in csgo.

as a player, youre really banterous and chill, in all situations where i spoken to you on ts you were really calm, you never rage, which i like. you stick to your friends even if you disagree with them sometimes, which i dont know if is good or not. im not sure if you hackusated me in the past, but o well i client gf<br><br>as a player youre pretty good, much more with sword than bow. never seen you rushing or defending so i guess youre good in midfielding or frontlining.

never spoken to you. you are always kind of hating on me/ my videos for no actual reason. also you think you are much better than you actually are, and sometimes even cocky. that is only recent though, you used to be really chill and cool but now you turned into that kind of person. hope you prove me wrong in the future

never spoken to you. you are always kind of hating on me/ my videos for no actual reason. also you think you are much better than you actually are, and sometimes even cocky. that is only recent though, you used to be really chill and cool but now you turned into that kind of person. hope you prove me wrong in the future

If you get the feeling I hate on your videos I don't xD. I actually like your videos a lot. Also ik what you mean by cocky I'm working on that.
