Thanks, Snow! &lt;3<br><br>The funniest moments happened in the #random channel back when steven and para would spam their memes and gifs, haha. The worst was probably being framed for being the guy sending the false emails and being banned and demoted for 3 weeks, I believe. :c

Hey! :)<br><br>My favorite thing about the team are the people in it. They're all fun to chat with, and especially have some banter here and there.<br><br>Probably a PS4, I've still got my 360 gathering dust, haha.<br><br>The community &amp; gamemodes are my favorite things about the server. Two things we need are successful advertisement, and better donor ranks since as of now, they don't seem to have any worth. The key feature (joining full teams) sometimes doesn't even work.

My best moment as a staff member was probably my promotion to moderator. :&gt;<br><br>I'd like for it to star developing efficiently, get a bigger player base going, and improve the gamemodes. Fix the bugs, get some YouTubers over here, become a growing, large server. Reassess the current gamemodes (get rid of SG and replace it with Sky Wars, etc.)

My Xbox name was Da Badger, but DaBadger wasn't available when I got a new minecraft account for my birthday, so I could stop playing on NuclearDucky (shared account). Then, I told my older brother who was typing the names JJ to make it DaBadgerMC (Yeah, I was like 9) but he made a typo and forgot the g. Then, the name just stuck. :&gt;

It's fine, I'm more than happy to discuss it. :) And thanks! &lt;3<br><br>I came back to the staff team even though I was treated unfairly, but I believe everyone makes mistakes, and although the one they made was major, I still wanted to come back. Not to mention, if I couldn't come on Avicus I'd spend 12 hours of my day doing nothing.&nbsp;<br><br>Avicus us isn't dying, it's just stuck at a very low level. We're still maintaining a 20-80 player base most of the time (EST) but we can obviously do better, since we use to get over 1000 users on at once.<br><br>Get rid of SG, make gamemode events such as "2x credit multiplier on Nexus for 1 week" or "Person with most kills in CTH today receives 3 keys!" That would encourage users to try other gamemodes and get some nise stuff out of it, too! Another thing I would change is the credit system. Although I know Funky for some reason doesn't want prestiges anymore, I think if we could use the credits to buy things ingame, it'd be awesome! To make sure we don't have diamond armored players buying 100s of golden apples, we could have a cool down or a cap on how many credits you can spend per game. I'm just rambling on now, so I'll leave this to be discussed another day or something. xP&nbsp;<br><br>If an admin retired, I wouldn't really know who would be admin. As long as they got work done, stayed on schedule listened to all parts of the staff team &amp; community, I'd be happy. If I had to pick,it'd be Greg, I guess.

<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; "><b>Opinions on your demotion?&nbsp;</b><i>Obivously wasn't a fan of it. I had a lot of support from community members (including you!) and by a few staff members. Only one of them tried to get me unbanned and repromoted and it worked, and upon my return, apparently nobody thought I did it. That didn't bother me, what bothered me was that not a single one of them tried to maybe find out more about what happened, fix things, etc. So I felt a bit betrayed by the mods and the seniors in a way. :&gt;</i><br></span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; "><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; "><b>Favourite cake flavour?&nbsp;</b><i>This question seems familiar, I wonder where you got it? xP I like cookie cakes, cookies n creme cakes, ice cream cakes, and basically anything that is colorful and sugary. I'm not a fan of those walnut banana cake type of things. Nuts and veggies in cakes does not sound good at all!&nbsp;<br></i></span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; "><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; "><b>If there was one thing you could change in your life, what would it be?&nbsp;</b><i>Where I live.

Did you think it was a good choice?&nbsp;</b><i>I chose to apply a year ago because I felt that many reports weren't being handled, and because I wanted to make the community happy by showing them that they could play games without some teamspleefer going u punished or whatever. After I was a staff member for awhile, my reasons changed to being "help the server and stop it from dying" but hey, a mod can't do much about that can they :P. I am still staying here today because of the people on the team and to help make games fun when I'm online.</i></span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; "><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; "><b>Favourite gamemode?&nbsp;</b><i>SG MCZone version was pretty nice, but my most most favorite is either DTM or CTH.</i></span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; ">

WHY ALL STAFF ARE RACIST WITH THE SPANISH COMUNITY?
</blockquote>
</div>
I only know of a few staff who were somewhat racist back when the 18+ chat was super lenient. If staff members are currently being racist, you can report them to admins or seniors. :&gt;

Thanks, Pingu! &lt;3<br><br>My favorite food is probably tandoori chicken, or chicken in general. xP<br><br>Yes, they're great, I just don't like how they stick to your mouth.

DaFronzen tiene razón, no todos los miembros del staff son racistas, si hay alguno que tu creas racista trata de conseguir la evidencia para reportarlo.
