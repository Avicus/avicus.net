Hi.&nbsp;<br><br>I think there'll be barely people who know me but I first joined avicus 2 years ago with my friends when I was still 13 years old (the good old times &lt;3). Then i had a year without playing minecraft and completly forgot about this server. Now Im back again for 3 months now, I think! So feel free to ask me anything. Although I think there won't be many people answering. But now I'm like online on the forums the whole day ^,^ &nbsp;Thanks for being interested! Also the girls ;)

1st: What is Mc Zone if its a server avicus is better.<br>2nd: My parents :3 No, i was just being annoyed by my luck. I was playing games which I had to wait 5 mins to start and then i was killed instantly because of a lag. So basically it was my internet. (Ok I have to admit it was.also a bit because my parents were thinking minecraft is crap)<br>3rd I love the game .--...--.<br><br>Sry for bad writing, am on my handy.
