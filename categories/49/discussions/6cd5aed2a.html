Who is your favorite Avicus player and why?<br>Mine would be IzJustAPickax. He is unfortunatly leaving Avicus forever. He would always be there for me if people were making fun of how much of a noob I was on Avicus. If someone would keep bothering me, Iz would somehow shut them up. He would be a great friend in combat and when your playing. He would always keep your spirit up when your down or just to make you laugh xD. We &lt;3 Iz, good luck in life buddy.<br>In Iz we trust, In Bacca we must!

Vlad, Gallant, Centeralking, Zaidms, etc.<br><br>Vlad- Even though he reks me with his OP ping and 60 fps, he really says sorry about the ping and never brags. Really fun person to be around with.<br><br>Gallant- Friends since like forever, really funny guy and even though he thinks hes bad, hes pretty good.<br><br>Centeralking- Nuff said. :3<br><br>Zaidms, rEx0r, dosent brag. I used to have fun with him, telling him hes 2 good and for him to stahp, but he kept on. At one point I got better and now I can beat him, and he can beat me, in PvP.

MLGPorky - First friend I ever had on the server, back when I was a30ngamingz140. He's actually caused me to be a lot less introverted on the network.<br><br>goldenwalrus909 - Perhaps the least serious person on the network, as the one time I Skype called him so far, he laughed so many times. Btw, not being serious is hardly a bad trait in my eyes, if that's what you were thinking :)<br><br>Petlas - So happy I met you. SO happy. Although our friendship only started recently, I have a feeling it's gonna last a long time since we made that 50-minute Skype call to each other. Only thing is that we're hardly online at the same time! Anyways, you're still awesome, and I'd definitely enjoy talking again :D<br><br>I'm terribly sorry if I forgot you, but if I did include everyone I wanted to talk about, my post would probably take 15 minutes to read. xD
