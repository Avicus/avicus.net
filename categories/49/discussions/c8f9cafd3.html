Ctw: definitely Wahiz. It's my favourite because it is the only map I like defending on, and i like the gameplay a lot.<br>Dtm. Probably rendezvous 3.5 because it is one of the og tourney maps, and i will necker forget that league game against bc :)<br>TDM: Crossfire because it is a bow heavy map, and I like to think I play well in it :)<br>DTC: enoki definitely because of the lag free gameplay and the great memories from TOC<br><br>My favourite position is probably mid or sky because you don't rage from rushing or &nbsp;defending and it is chill :)<br><br>Favourite match was the bc match in the league. I can't stop myself from watching it on YouTube :p<br><br>Really nice guy with a sexy northern accent. [insert northerner joke here]. Still one of the only Northerners I can understand, but on the whole a really nice guy who has been a great friend in my time back here and even before i left. Great leader of apollo and nice guy to talk to :) &lt;3

I started playing again because I was bored, and every one in a while I would check apollo slack for nostalgia (don't ask xD) and they needed someone to sub on cause they were scrimming. I offered and then I realised that I had forgotten how fun it was.<br><br>Nice guy who posts a lot on the forums... &nbsp;I mean like loads. But it's really nice to see you in game and I hope we can get to know each other better in mczoners. :)

Ahhh Ryan. My joint favourite squeaker (seuth is the other one). You are a really cool guy, void at the game and you really deserved the spot in apollo. It's really fun to mess around on build battle with you and Eric xd.
