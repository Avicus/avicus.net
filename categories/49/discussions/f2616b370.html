Ok so, one of my favourite people although you've made some bad decisions... You're nice and funny, your videos are lit, the pack you made was lit. You're really bad at UHC/Skywars but I guess you're not bad with a bow... You're still ez though.&nbsp;<br><br>Overall youve use got a lot of shenanigans, and I've had enough of em.

Maddy, you're a cool person and one of my favourite people on the Server. We've spoken about loads of shit and had loads of bant. You're shit at Pokemon and you still think Pikachu is good, but you use #hoefilter so it equals out. You're the SC queen no balls Maddy g.

Liz i dont really know you that well but you seem to be alright. We had a fun time yesterday on CTW and UHC and im guessing youre a great mod. You use the snapchat hoe filter which im disappointed at but i will learn to over look it.<br><br>Bruh dinosaur chicken nuggets are the life nd soul of the party. They cure hunger and they almost make eating more fun. Who ever does like dinosaur chicken nuggets really need to think deeply about where theyre going in life as i personally wouldnt trust them.

Toby youre a nice guy and a good player. Although you said some weird creepy shit sometimes its not that bad. I do like portugal although your language sounds russian nd protugese girls are ok i guess. I went to portugal when i was 12 so i dont really remember them to well.
