No, before you say it, I have not been demoted. It was my choice, so technically I retired. But this is not forever.<br><br>At the current time I am going through a hard time / situation and I am not able to do my job as a mod. For the time being I am "off-duty" so my rank has been removed. When this current situation is over, I will regain my role and join back the staff team.<br><br>Thank you to all the people that have stuck with me and supported me in the current time. The community here is just amazing. &lt;3

Hope your problems are properly resolved; I'm a big fan of your YouTube channel and it's a shame you can't moderate the server atm but I guess life has priorities. Good luck!
