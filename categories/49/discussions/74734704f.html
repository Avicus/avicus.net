Over the past few months, I got lots of infractions for stupid things like trolling, swearing, spamming and lots of stuff like that. I apologize to everyone on the avicus server for anything I have ever done, and getting perm banned for Excessive Infractions has taught me an important lesson in life. It has taught me to not swear. It has taught me to be nice to everyone no matter what they do. It has taught me to not bait people to get mad and then get me mad. It has taught me to change.<br><br>I'd like to start off by apologizing to some of the people that I have hurt over the past two or three months. <br><br><b><u>MidnightBeats</u></b>: Hey man, I am so sorry for what you had to do to. I kept on being mean because I was angry . As soon as you said my name, I knew I had it coming. I'd would like to apologize to you for all this and promise to you that I will change if I get unbanned from my appeal. I hope we can all put this behind ourselves and be good buddies again. &lt;3<br><br><u>Glitchy1</u>: Hey, I'm sorry. I know I don't really see you on a lot and i know you don't like me. I just want to apologize for the things I say on Quintus when I call u bad names including swears about pinging and other things like that. I'm sorry if I've ever disrespected you or any other mod.<br><br>Slugbo_1: I'd like to apologize to you for all the mean things i said after you put that video up of me. I don't hack... but I want to say sorry for calling u bad and being a scrub noob who can't pvp at all. I don't want any hatred between the two of us and I hope you can understand that. &lt;3<br><br><b><u>Anyone Else I Can't Remember:</u></b> I'm sorry for hurting anyone or everyone that I have played with on the Avicus network. :'(<br><br><br>I would like to end off this by saying, "I know most of the people on Avicus don't like me as a person or a player, but I would like to change my ways and hope that you will accept that and let me have a second chance. This is one of my favorite servers and hopefully I will get unbanned. I got banned for a reason and have seen what I have done to you all in the past. I am so sorry for everything that I have done and hope that you can understand inside your heart." &lt;3<br><br>Thanks For Reading This :(<br>-ChampionCreeper

I forgive you, in my perspective (I saw the video when the post got locked, not sure if it was deleted) it looked more like ping since getting hit while behind someone has happend a lot of times, but its not my decision, I hope you truly mean you are to change and I hope you get unbanned :)

It's okay, bud. Everyone makes mistakes.<br>I forgive you &lt;3<br><br>EDIT: I feel like I have to say something more considering you were one of my first friends here.&nbsp;<br><br>Buddy, life is going to throw you up and down, and I'm pretty sure I don't possibly understand the anger that you felt that caused you to take these actions, but you're still one of the greatest to me. We've had our good times, from our hour-long matches to our prestige races, and it's been great. I of course forgive you, cause everyone makes mistakes, and you were one of my best friends. &lt;3<br>Lots of love, bud. Take care!

I have not seen you ingame, on the forums or TS before. But you have gained my respect with this sincere post. Not many posts touch me like this, but this one has.
