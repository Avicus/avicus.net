Different people that I don't know. I edit them myself sometimes and I only change it when I find one that I really like and would keep for a long time. I usually go to planetminecraft when I'm looking for a specific theme or just something cool as they seem to have the highest quality and variety.

You're probably the nicest, most humble and most chill guy I know. You always try to do the right thing and you stay calm when everything around you is falling apart. Your dedication toward helping the server and just people in general is amazing and I really respect you for that. I remember when I was new to the server I always wanted to be in your team because I knew we'd win because of you getting all the monuments. I'm glad there's people like you on this server and I'm glad I got to know you a little better.

How the staff team? The overall community is decent from what I can tell, I'm not involved at all so I can't say much but the competitive side is a bit disappointing in terms of behavior and skill level. The higher-up staff team lacks sophistication in some areas in my opinion, the regular mods aren't bad, people blame them for a lot of things but they fail to realize they can't do much about it, overall they get their job done as far as I can tell.</span>

I don't know you too well yet but from what we talked in TS you seem like a pretty chill guy that's not afraid to have a conversation about anything.

I have no set schedule, on schooldays I go to sleep around midnight but most of the time I stay up doing homework or I wake up really early to do it. On weekends I go to sleep anywhere from 10 PM to 6 AM, it's bad.

You're pretty nice and a good friend but I feel like you worry about things too much sometimes, I mean I can understand why most of the time but still. Overall a friendly guy, cool to talk to.
