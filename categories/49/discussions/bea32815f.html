<b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Your favourite ctw map to defend?&nbsp;</b><b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"></b>Probably Wits End or Golden Drought 3 because they are pretty easy to defend and you get loads of different supplies especially&nbsp;on GD3 to defend with and on WE you get TNT to make a huge pit. On both maps, once you have built your defense and dug your pit its so easy to just sit there and bow making sure nobody gets in (but skybridges are a pain)<br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>Any opinion?&nbsp;</b>Your nice to talk to and I'm surprised we hadn't met before OCN had shutdown. Sometimes you get really anxous in scrims and you get worried. Your a decent leader but you always think that you need to play and if your not playing we will lose. Also you get really angry if people dont call you valky like for examle when people call you Marcell which is weird since thats ur ign and if you dont want people to call you that then change to Valky or something. Your team is inactive asf but your a cool guy and im glad we met :)&nbsp;</span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">

<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>Why didnt u play for pb in badlion ctw tm?&nbsp;</b>Well right before OCN shutdown i joined Punishers for the last tourney. We didnt end up playing it and PureBlox wouldnt let me back in, they havent any time i ask and never will which is understandable since i left. I also wanted to make my own team for it, have a go at leading and get a group of friends who dont have a team. We had a pretty stacked roster (wayyyy more good people than i would have dreamed of from the beggining) and we played really well.&nbsp;</span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>I heard in a vid that u were like vex or slayahs cousin or brother sorry i cant remember who but is that tru?&nbsp;</b>No but me and Lorys leave on the same street and IAMPHIL is my dad.</span>

Opium were gonna play with some SS members but sadly we decided not to as many of us didnt like the versio so we arent but from teams who have signed up it may be would be PureBlox vs DARN in the finals. Maybe Cameron   against PB, not too sure</div><div><b></b><br></div></div></div></div>

A lot of people who I had really wanted to be friends with are now my friends. Adam, Phil, Ginie and I never expected to be on teams like Punishers or PureBlox lmao. It was always a dream to be on those 2 teams.&nbsp;</span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  "><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  "><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  "><b>How'd you join oktg?&nbsp;</b>Well as you know, Opium wasn't gonna play stratus so I just joined the first team that asked since I didn't want to try hard and I knew I couldn't play all matches and didn't wanna let my team down :p</span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  "><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  "><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  "><b>What other games do you play my dude&nbsp;</b>Sadly, none.

We went to LA for my dads work (not going into detail) and I hated it there. Hated the school and the people in my year. A few found out that I was bi and my best friend spread rumors about me. So all I could do is crawl and talk to mc friends to comfort me which my parents hated. In London I went out and hang out w friends much more so ya I moved back and I'm much happier.&nbsp;</span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  "><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  "><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;  "><b>Opinion fam&nbsp;</b>I'll be he honest but I used to hate you. I remember we got in an argument on Trinity trial groupchat. (I think I might be wrong) and also on Grim u were really toxic. On OCN forums u couldn't hold back from an argument and I would always see u being toxic on forums. I think u just gave me a really bad first impression but when people reccomeneded u for Opium I started talking to ya more and ur really chill. I'm glad I gave u another chance I guess and ur voice is hot. Ur an amazing cannoner. Your pretty unaware but ur still a smart player. Wow tthat's long, u should feel very #blessed my dude!!<br><br><br><br><br></span>

Your very laggy and so idk if ur good or bad at this game lmao. Ur bow aim is surprisingly good for the delay but not sure about ur skill in the sword department tho. Your team is kinda uncoordinated even with Ginie I still think u need to play a lot since a team usually listens best to the person the are used to which is u. Not much else to say just I'm hyped to play the tourney with u.

<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>opnion fagnace ;d&nbsp;</b>U r a really chill dude and im glad i met you on Supremacy, that was so fun in those scrims and im happy i played with u guys. I think you have grown a lot as a player and person. You are really good at bridging, whenever i defend, you and seuthy are always pushing my wool and doing some crazy bridges lmao. You and seuthy are good friends tho i think and u two have good chemistry which is something Supremacy wanted. You are acctually super underrated especially at offending but i awlays undersetimated u in sword too and just general, but you proved me wrong and you are rly smart in scrims and its always nice to have you by my side. We should talk more when we arent just scrimming with eachother or against eachother xd</span>

<b></b><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>Why do you think PB are "the best team right now"?&nbsp;</b>Because of their chemistry and communication.</span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Opinion, eh?&nbsp;</b>Hmmmm. Well ur really good at pvp,&nbsp;above avarege and i wouldnt be surprised that be people hackusate u a lot but ur not that sketchy i just think its ur play style and kb thats really effective or affective idfk. You arent easy to beat in a 1v1 melee but its not impossible, what is really annoying to the person ur trying to kill is that u catch them off guard a lot and send them flying out of the world. I noticed u do that a lot in scrims especially GD5. I was honestly very surprised and annoyed that u and matt joined pb since adam and hivlik always talked about u guys in a bad way and not many people really liked you on the team once of the reasons i left for Puni partly cos i thought pb were just asking so many people to join that&nbsp;i didnt think really fit in with the team and i didnt want to spend time with them but i guess i just didnt rly know them well enough when they first joined for the RG tourney (not gonna name ppl) tho im friends with them now and there were way more reasons so its not all about that. Somehow u got in and stayed for a while which surprised me even more lol, in a group you are probably the most annoying person to talk to in the world but 1 on 1 like if me and u are talking which doesnt happen very often u r much more chill and idk what it is but u just seem to get more immature in group talks from what i have experienced. I also left PureDogs because i felt tension everytime i talked to pureblox people and i was so uncomfortable, not just u but everyone. You seem good at bow too so ur an all around good player. Hope i didnt offend u just wanted to give u an honest opinion.

Your definitely my closest friend I have met online. I have told u basically every secret of mine and I just feel a nice connection when we talk like I know u irl. It's so nice talking to u and staying up late just talking about life I guess and I wish u could come to England but idk how long that will take to get money/persuade ur dad, it's funny how we have a plan for when we r older and hopefully our paths cross in the future cos I love u so fucking much. I honestly don't have much to say, I feel like I can't give a huge opinion since all I can say is the same thing and that is ur my best friend. I liked scrimming with OKTG and just me and u laughing together joking around but nobody knew our memes :p it was really fun, sometimes I fucking hated scrimming but I liked playing with u and that made it all better. Excited to play a tourney with u for the proper first time (sounds weird right, we haven't played a tourney together oWo). Ur a fcking legend at sword like holy fucking shit nobody can combo u, not even me and I'm the best. I like talking to u if I have problems or worries, when we talk I just feel like ur my big brother giving me advice helping me out making me feel better, our conversations make me feel so comfortable and that I can trust u more than anyone. I'm probably just saying the same shit over again but I love u dude and even when we both quit, let's still talk cos I don't wanna lose u. Love you lorys.&nbsp;</span></p><div><span style="font-family: '.SFUIText'; "><br></span></div>
