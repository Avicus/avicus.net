</h1>
Guys,<br>Sorreh all you guys,<br>But now I'm seeing obligated to leave Avicus. I joined May 27, 2 days after Avicore update (Avicus 2.0). In another server a guy invited me to play Nexus, he passed me the IP via skype and I joined Avicus. First, I played Nexus, it was beautiful. I felt very good and funny playing here. 2 or 3 days after it, I registered to Avicus website and forums. In that moment, I joined the best community in the world, based on a server and with awesome guys. But, in this community are awesome guys and, other guys....<br>&nbsp;I was part of Avicus for a long time, doing that day and day passed, I feel more special and fine in this community. I felt inclusive as a part of the Avicus Family. But days ago I had problems with the school, but,&nbsp;<i>what is so mattering school?!&nbsp;</i>To be honest, my problem wasn't only the school, was my friendships, my relationships, my real family, and all that make us really special.<br>So, I chose to leave Avicus. I don't know if you noted that for the last 3 or 2 days I wasn't online in-game. But now is the really decision of quit, leave a big community that was very special for me and now I feel this like my family. Understand me, leave Avicus is like leave my real family. But I can't stand it anymore.....<br><b>I want to feel special atleast for one moment to these persons who made Avicus perfect for me:<br></b>Trident: You was very special for me, you ever supported me and help Avicus, it is important for me. &lt;3<br>Glitchy: I know that your glitched heart, if you have, will know and understand why I love that you helped so much Avicus Network, good moderator, better person.<br>Tino: I wish knew you more, but you was a very funny person, isn't matter that if you know me or not.<br>Juano: Ever recommending,&nbsp;<i>tu siempre sabes lo que decir, aunque no me hieres,&nbsp;</i>so I love you, it doesn't matter. &lt;3 (You understand)<br>Flo: You are a very good friend, follow being it. You offer me too much support and attention when I cried, you recommended me what do. Thanks for you!<br>Robo: You was a good person, you obviously are forgetting me, but you have a big soul, use it and be good.<br>Steven: You always are funny, but at the same time you are helping and doing laugh me, doesn't matter if I am crying or not. &lt;3<br><br><br>And too much more people whom I haven't words to explain my love for they....<br>Netux<br>Dooz<br>Fluey<br>Peachy<br>Ducks<br>Dubby<br>ParaCow<br>Ivou<br>Emmy<br>Johny<br>Mooch<br>Carmel<br>Nolan :3<br>fishy<br>jobo<br>Cupcake<br>DoctaRock ^^<br>And too much more, thank you for giving a so good stay in this community.
