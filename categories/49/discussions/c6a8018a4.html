Hows it goin, I guess you could say I'm new here and just wanted to get to know the community. Just some basic info about myself: I joined Avicus Forums about a year and a half ago, but had played on MCZone before. I kind of took a leave from Minecraft because I started playing other PC games with my friends, but know I'm back and decided why not start at one of my first servers. So feel free to ask me anything and give me a shout if you see me on the server!

Thanks for the questions :D<br><br>I found out about Avicus when it was MCZone. I was looking for a small server and found it online, and when I tried it out, it was pretty fun so I stayed.<br><br>My name is pretty random, I was just sitting at my computer and tried to think of something unique but intimidating at the same time, and it kind of just popped into my head.<br><br>So far, I'm really enjoying my return to Avicus. There's a lot of new people and a lot of my old friends are at high staff positions. I still miss some people who I haven't seen active :(. But overall, its good to be back!<br><br>I don't really have a favorite food, cause I'll eat anything. But if I had to pick, it would be chicken. Any kind. I LOVE CHICKEN :D
