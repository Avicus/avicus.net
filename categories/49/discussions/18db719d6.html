Thanks for the nice opinion.<br><br>Also, I just wanted to say, don't take shit from people who think you try harded as a staff member. I rose up pretty fast too, and no one called me a try harder. People get to where you are for a reason, and typically it's because they're just good at what they do.

I've seen small improvements along the way and I hope you really improve faster. You're a great guy and you seem to have good intentions. You keep on talking about Cammy4Senior and it urges me more than you'd think. I also found you try harder for senior or anything the first couple months you were promoted, but it's seemed to tone down.
