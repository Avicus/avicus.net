Now that I am promoted. I feel the community should get to know me a little more. Doing an AMA sounds perfect in my mind so here is a little intro<br><br>I am PieZ and I am currently 17 years old. I am in my last year of highschool and going into broadcasting arts for college. I joined Avicus around 2 years ago and I quickly went into the competitive aspect of Avicus. I applied to teams like Fancy Soldiers, The old Bezerk-type team, What ever Dooz was leading back then, And a small team called BlackBear. I was only accepted to BlackBear and left because I really did not feel that team was going to work out. I joined Immortality and it was full of arrogant players who thought they were the best. That team died out and I was LFT again. I soon faced robo's team on OCN and I insulted his team right in front of him. 1 week later I was trying out for him. My trail lasted a month because robo was inactive af. I joined and the team named changed 5 times or something and we played 2 tournaments with me. I got bored of competitive minecraft and tryharded for ref. To me surprise I was asked to become a Jr mod and they did it with their new system. 10 days later I am here.<br>So AMA anything and I will be 100% honest. You may like that more than me.

What words of encouragement would you give to a player that is interested in applying for junior moderator?<br><br>Do you plan to eventually branch off into other aspects of Avicus such as taking up an offer of senior/official/map developer?<br><br>What is one of the core aspects of Avicus that you believe needs more focus?<br><br>Do you have any inspiring or mesmerizing quotes you like or go by?

I do not know you very well. All I can say is that I get a nice vibe from you<br>It is a pain sometimes not going to lie<br>I want to make things more organized for the staff team because it looks like the staff team is doing all this work for such small things which make their time for other important things less. Organization is key for a strong staff team.

I am just going to ignore Juano cause he can't mean.<br>I do not think of you as the smartest person but I do not mind you. People have issues with you and I know why but on a personal level I do not have anything against you. For you a little more.

On Avicus it was beating BC in the finals in the last tournament. A lot of their players were so arrogant and I like destroying arrogant attitudes<br>On OCN it had to be GM Blue in Conquest when I was with Infamous. We practiced so much and we wanted to beat at least one team that was considered top tear. We destroyed them in that match. #RipInfamous
