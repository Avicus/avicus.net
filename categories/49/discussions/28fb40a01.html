Hey everyone! It's nice to be here again. I'm really bad with words so I'll explain as best as I can.<br><br><b>Who am I?<br></b>My name is ViolentBoo, I used to play on this server religiously every day for a few hours. But then I stopped because school was getting too intense, and I wasn't really interested in minecraft anymore. I started to get into League of Legends, and lets just say I got addicted way too quickly. I haven't had internet for about a month and a half and I was going to shoot someone LIKE BRO THERE WAS NOTHING TO DO-<br><b><br>What&nbsp;Happened?<br></b>Well you see my parents went to go to Iraq for about a month and that was in the middle of June, so I was forced to go live in my sisters house. Three months later they're still not back and I have never missed my parents so much. Sure they call everyday but with my lack of Arabic skills and the bad reception there, it just feels like a quick blur of their voice. Anyway, my sisters are&nbsp;<i>niiice</i> if I could say the least. I have a wire leading into the modem upstairs and they just remove it when they want me to do something and they don't care about the things that I like which is pretty much just video games, but I shouldn't bitch about it, they're keeping a roof over my head even thought there was a nice apartment just sitting there that I could just stay but&nbsp;<i></i><i>nooooo&nbsp;</i>my parents won't let me xd. The interet was cut off for about a month and a half and we just got it back and Jesus it's great. I wen't to the apartment one day with my computer for the whole day and I played eighteen matches of league back to back. My god.<br><b><br>Where do we stand now?<br></b>I'm going to make more videos again but it's going to be hard to make videos here because I can't be loud at times and I like to be loud in my videos so it's a challenge. You had no idea how fun it was to make videos back then.<br><b><br></b><br>I don't really know how to end these things, lets just say that I'm going to be playing again :D<br>Also I changed my skin to Xerath from lol.
