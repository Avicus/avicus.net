Since it's Summer I thought I might as well do one too.<br><br>A little bit about me:<br>I'm from an area in/around London.<br>I'm 16 years old.<br>I've played on this server for 3 years when November ends.<br>I'm obsessed with swimming. xD<br>I like rock music, especially alternative rock.<br>I've been a staff member since December.<br>My name is James (dun dun dun!).<br>I have a deep voice (yes, I know I sound like a 40-50 year old, Sayah, but that's why my voice is so sexy).<br><br>Phew!<br><br><br>Fire away!

One of the nicest and funniest people I've ever met. xD I've known you for a while now, and you're probably one of the best people on this server personality wise. Don't ever change, mate. :)<br><br>Not a clue. I think we'll end up leaving, and I kind of hope we do, but I'm torn between remain and leave.

Cool guy. Funny, nice and patient. You, Rese, Sayah and Lokigh (yes, I didn't forget you, Lokigh) are amongst my closest friends. Come back soon!<br><br>It has the potential to be a great team, just more scrims against our own team members are needed.<br><br>Yes, although sometimes I do get tired off all of the staff drama and arguments. Still, it's nice to give back to a server that's given me so much.<br><br>James. :) :P<br><br>For me!
