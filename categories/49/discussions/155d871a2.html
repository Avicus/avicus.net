Let's hop on the AMA bandwagon.&nbsp;<br><br>I can't remember when I joined and started to become active (my profile says about 3 years ago, but I'm not counting that). I remember applying for Ref in early January, which later was what kept me around. Lets say I joined a few weeks before that, so just about now last year.<br><br>Anyways, let's assume it's been a year now since I actually joined this server and started to play regularly. Since that year, I've had the chance to be a Ref, a Moderator, a Mentor, a Sr Moderator, and a Social Media team admin.&nbsp;<br><br>And just as a psa in terms of opinion questions, I don't really know of a ton of you all that well. Sorry if the opinion is vague - I don't want to make assumptions.

I retired from OCN (it was still OCN then) at the same time I retired from here, and haven't rejoined the staff team since. I do play every now and then, and hear the odd thing about the server though.<br style="font-family: lato, sans-serif;"><b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: lato, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><br></b>To be frank, I'm kinda disappointed. I expected Lifeboat to really do something to change it up - right now it's still basically the same server, regardless of fun it is, that burned itself to the ground. I have hopes that they'll do something new to change things up - this goal of being more competitive seems promising.&nbsp;<br><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: lato, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><b><br></b></span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: lato, helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><b>Your plans for the future of avicus?<br><br></b>I haven't really thought too far ahead.

</div>
<b></b><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>How come you came to Avicus?<br><br></b>I first came to Avicus after hearing about it on some OCN thread a few years ago. Since then, I knew of the server, but didn't play much (I'd come to the lobby somethings to parkour though). It would have been about 2 summers ago, so 2015, where either Javi, Pel, or Vobaseball noticed me playing one day (again probably just parkouring in the lobby) and said hi. After about that point, I started to realize how much of a server Avicus actually was. Before that, I always just kinda thought of it as a server that started as an OCN clone, and then just didn't do as well.<br><b><br></b>I showed up some other time in the fall, and started to play then. Every now and then I'd check the forums. I saw ref apps open, and decided to apply (why not). After getting ref, I stayed here, and the rest is history.<br><br></span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>Favourite food or drink?<br></b></span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><br>I love apple pie.

I haven't played an Avicus one, and don't really plan on it. I did briefly try to get into the competitive scene here, though that didn't last long.<br><br></span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>And everyone's favourite question - Opinions on me? :)<br></b></span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><br>Wow ok. I'm going to be honest here. When I first met you, you really struck me as a mod fanboy or suck-up. I think the first time I ever really noticed you was ingame one time talking to Cera (and at this time I had a lot of friends who, at least from my perspective, were sucking up to her because she was a mod, or a girl), and I kinda just threw you in with that lot. I probably made up some excuse to avoid having to talk to you in mumble a few times too - like I did with JadSaa or McFanta.<br><br>Once I got to know you, I realized I was really wrong. I think this would have been around the time OCN was closing, and you were starting to play more and more Avicus. You were nice to talk, and friendly to get along with. You also strike as pretty mature for your age.<br><br>I'm quite glad you got Jr, it's going to be a pleasure having you on the team, and I really think you can make a great mod.<b><br></b></span>

Overall you're a pretty good admin. You're someone I can trust, and who is pretty easy going; willing to change things if they work out for the better.<br><br>However, I do often find that you either say you'll do something and never do it, or do it at a much later time. This was sort of frustrating when I first came to you with ideas for the social media team - I didn't feel like I had enough jurisdiction to be making &amp; carrying out big decisions, but you weren't always getting it all done either. Of course I've since found the solution to this is mostly just taking initiative to do it myself, so it's not quite as frustrating as it once was.

Best and worst part about being a senior?<br>Opinions on me?
</blockquote>
</div>
<b>Best and worst part about being a senior?<br><br></b>Alright, so best part first. I love the work Sr is responsible for and involved in. My responsibilities aren't strictly based around moderating the server, which means I can do my work without having to play Minecraft, or even be on my computer.<br><b><br></b>I think the worst part was the timing. It made learning how to be a Sr quite difficult, especially since I was thrown into it all days after coming back from a 3 month retirement as a moderator. I had to be making decisions based on people's actions over the past days, but I had no idea how they acted.<br><b></b>Adding to the timing of it all, while I'm sure I'd do a better job now then I would have 3 months ago, I would have preferred to have been a Sr when I was actually more interested in the game itself. I came back to have a little more to do, and got a whole lot more instead (which doesn't mean I won't do a good job, don't get me wrong. It just changes my priorities up a bit).<br><br><b>Opinions of me?</b><br><br>You always stuck out to me as someone who can do very well working towards something you believe in, but quick to bash what you don't. As a former moderator you stuck out to me as someone who most definitely knows what he's doing in terms of moderation (which is something I like to see in staff).

You've beaten me quite a few times, so I'd say you're at least better than decent :P<br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b><br>Person?<br></b></span><br>When I first joined TS, like first time ever, you welcomed me &amp; were friendly, and nice. This really meant a lot to me, since I was just some shy kid that knew no one on Avicus (and I don't do so well in settings like joining a new TS where I don't know anyone). You've always seemed like that type of person; friendly, and warm-hearted.<br><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>Staff member?</b></span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><br>Alright, so I touched a bit on this in PMs when you retired. But honestly, you were a great staff member who worked hard. You're someone I'd want on my team if I want the team to be productive, and actually going somewhere. It's a shame you retired (and I'm still hoping you'll come back later down the road). Seriously.<br><br>I guess the only part that rubbed off negatively was when you said you were "no where near Sr". Not that this itself was a bad thing, it's great to be striving towards a greater goal. It's just that it feels that you came to some conclusion that you can't be a Sr anytime soon, and gave up. This part kinda makes me go "ehh", since there's other goals you could have worked towards, like bettering the server, or the staff team, rather than just personal goals (and I'm probably making so many assumptions right here, you had your reasons for stepping down and I respect them).<br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>Demote 3 staff members.</b></span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>Promote 3 People or staff members to a higher position.<br></b></span><br>Eh, I'm going to pass on this one.
