I'd say I'm pretty well known here - I have been apart of this community for over 3 years, I was a mod for almost one of those years and I'm currently mapdev and media. I have played and lead for Apollo in every tourney and have never finished below 3rd place. I'm currently in grim on OCN and a mod on Badlion.<br><br>if you want a super honest opinion, put a * on your post

I never really had talked to you in the past before I decided to trial you, only in mega scrims really. I wanted to trial you because like Seuth, I thought you were going to become a really good player.<br><br>I do feel you are becoming a better player but you are far from being complete.<br><br>You are a really nice guy to talk to because you are so chilled out; I haven't spoken to you alot but when I do speak to you I do think you are a great guy to talk to.<br><br>You did good in the tourney, well done.

I don't know you too well apart from seeing you on public - we may have spoken on teamspeak, I don't remember.<br>I think you have a bit of potential but you need to focus on all aspects of the game in order to improve.

I've never properly gotten to know you but you seem like a pretty nice guy. You were good at melee before you quit, I hope you get back into the game properly. You have alot of potential as a mod, but in my opinion to succeed as a moderator you shouldn't follow the in crowd and should focus on what you believe in.

I think you were a good Jr Mod, although I think that you were quite argumentative. You should be a mod now though, I feel that your demotion wasn't fair at all. I haven't spoken to you properly but you seem to be an alright person, although I don't understand why you like throwback maps :V<br><br>I do not ever plan to return to the mod team, many of my friends returned and retired straight away, and I do not agree with how it is run, or any of the decisions that they make. They are way too inactive as a team at certain hours in my opinion. I'd rather stick to moderating Badlion.<br><br>I think Cacalmarin could be a good team if they actually practiced but since they're Aussie it's hard for them.

You are one of the better defenders in Allah. I've never properly spoken to you, just the All Stars match I think. You did a good job defending last tourney. I hope I can get to know you some time in the future.

You are a really nice guy who's always willing to help, I never used to like you but when you joined Apollo I go to know you and you are a really good player and a nice guy to talk to.<br><br>One thing I don't know is if you pretend to be not know stuff, or if you actually don't know.<br><br>You are a good player but have a bit to improve on. You've definitely come along way since T1 and I value you as a friend and honestly think you are a genuinely nice person.

I trailed you for Apollo because you were a defender and we needed defenders but also because you formed a strong bond with Eric.<br><br>You've come a long way as a defender but you still have to improve at stuff. I don't know how people get your objectives but I presume it's because you jump straight into melee.<br><br>In ctw you should only melee the player if you feel they can get in your wool, and support is NOT coming. If there's someone in your wall, you'd drop, but if someone is in your pit you can hold them off while support comes.<br><br>in DTM you shouldn't ever have to take melee, you should just bow until support comes, especially since after killing you it takes up to 20 seconds to secure a monument.<br><br>If you need help at defending just ask me and I'll help you.<br><br>I find you a bit annoying on teamspeak, but I suppose it's got something to do with your age. You are improving as a mapdev and I like to see how far you have come.

I always was surprised with your melee before you trailed for Apollo, since joining you improved a lot and your pretty godly now.<br><br>you are really fun to play with and nice to talk with on Ts, you've improved a lot recently at pot pvp but your not as good at avicus imo<br><br>I think everyone who has ever accused you is retarded and knows fuck all, you literally have to sit in a channel with you for a minute to know your not cheating, I can't hear shit over your keyboard/mouse, it's louder than Ragings...

I've never gotten to know you so I don't really know, sorry<br><br>theyve improved a lot but I can't see them becoming a top team until they sort out the team... it seems posighdun adds any OCN players he gets a chance to, which ruins the chemistry of the team and wastes a roster space because they don't show up<br><br>cronus don't have a dedicated leader therefore I can't see them improving, they need someone to take over, kick the useless OCN people who will never play and improve the team as a whole
