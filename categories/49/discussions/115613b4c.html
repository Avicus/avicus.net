Hi, I'm Zac. I have the record for most false punishments on one account. I am also a former and TeamSpeak Dev. I had my retired rank removed for overall immaturity despite not having broken any rules. Finally I am banned on TeamSpeak for Excessive bullying for saying "I think ALM's grandmother is going to come by TeamSpeak" in the nightclub channel. Go AMA.

I've got plans to move in with some friends of mine in the area around Seattle. So I'd assume I would be there and have a job in whatever major I end up going with.<br><br>Opinion. I liked you a lot before you joined Apollo and stuff, then imo you changed a lot. I still like you but definitely less than back then. You were just a lot more chill and less serious about things.

TeamSpeak has gone down the drain. I think the senior mods are either unqualified, inactive or abusive.<br><br>You're chill at times and salty at others. I get along with you most of the time when we actually talk but on the forums, in game and on matters of debate we tend to be on opposite sides of things.

I met you and you were chill, then you annoyed me for a while. After that I became TS Dev and we were friends again with me actually convincing you to stay as TS Dev at a point when you wanted to retire. A while later you sent a message out behind my back asking people to demote me along with a bunch of lies about me, since then we don't like each other.
