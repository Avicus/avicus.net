For those who don't know me, I'm an Official and MapDev on Avicus. I'm probably best known for Toggle Sneaking in the Semi Finals of the first tournament;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZuXKhk0No" title="Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZuXKhk0No">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPZuXKhk0No</a><br><br>I joined about 2 years ago but didn't really become active up until earlier this year. I came from OCN and then went to PotPvP and now I'm at Avicus for some reason.&nbsp;<br><br>I don't really play public here because it is so easy - as a MapDev I focus on Nebula and more specifically Tournaments. I became Official because I pretty much told Vo that I was interested, and Pelp had told me that I could become Official whenever I like, because of my unofficial tournaments with BmB. I became Jr Map Dev after being jealous of BmB getting Junior Map Dev, and it turns out he got it because I got it too lmfao.<br><br>I would say that I am quite good in melee but I'm a lot worse at archery. I only really offend for my team, normally on my own but now seeing as I am the leader of Bad Company, I tend not to tunnel so much and let Jive do the honours &lt;3<br><br>I will answer all questions but I might skip some - all of my answers will be 100% honest, so do not get offended if you ask for an opinion.

I don't really know you but you're chill in TS and you're a good player<br><br>Obviously Bad Company were a lot better in RFV, a tournament in where I think that we were the best and I think that most people would agree with us. After losing several players who were the core of our team, we are worse however I still think we are the second best team here, behind you guys (PPB).

I smurf at LE every day, what a great question.<br><br>So, the raw aim is generally a lot better and the spray, but it depends on the person. An LE just hasn't mastered certain mechanics, a common one is movement and crosshair placement.

No. The player count is going up, and if all teams join for the league (no no shows) we will have about 250 players on at once.
