Even if Avicus is boring, I just can't get myself to not play or leave. The community and my friends is the main reason why I'm still here to be honest, they make things fun and enjoyable for me. For improvement, the staff team needs a bit of fixing, I won't elaborate on that. Advertising is needed very badly. I think there is still some hope?...<br>Because I'm bored<br>Sorry if my sentences sound weird or anything, can't think clearly right now lol.

Before Minecraft got into my life, I mostly played online games and Pokemon (Which I've been playing and loving for 10 years, don't judge). After Minecraft, specifically Avicus, came into my life, I kinda stopped playing other games. Of course, I would realise sooner or later that I need to play something else at the very least. But yeah, currently I play mobile games, Pokemon (Sun and Moon hype), and of course Minecraft. Maybe you could suggest some other games I can play??

You're a great person to talk to, though you can be toxic at times. Good at the bow and sword, always scared of you 0-0. Never really heard your voice, or maybe I have but I can't remember.<br><br>You guys improved a lot, you guys work really well as a team and have the competitive experience and knowledge. Can be toxic sometimes, especially when it comes hack accusations, but generally nice people, being friends with many in the team. Good luck for T3 :)<br><br>I don't really have a favourite one to be honest.&nbsp;I prefer not to play maps with a lot of water.<br><br>Same as public maps, don't really favour any map.<br><br>Don't have friends I would consider best friends

You were once really toxic and annoying. Then you started to organise tournaments and got your staff ranks. You became better in terms of personality after that, though there are some instances where you are kinda toxic, but that's normal. You're good at PvP. Also heard you're a decent leader. Still find it funny that you came to Avicus and became a staff member. Idk why.<br><br>Probably some OCN team or the Top 3 Avicus teams being, in no specific order, Team Allah, Apollo and China Baby Toes.
