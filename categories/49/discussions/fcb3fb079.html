When I look closer, the demote one has a ban, this has been known for 6 hours. Both accounts attack a certain person or group of people, this again isn't simple banter, this is verbally attacking someone or a group of people. This account should be handled as an account name that is breaking the rules. I do not care who did it first, this action is done, the staff now have to act accordingly. It should be done from there.

This account shouldn't be allowed on Avicus as Pie has said. Both Iron4Demote and BerzerkIsSalt are, in my opinion, attacking a group of players or a single player verbally and it shouldn't be allowed.

For you and Bezerk I would ask if you don't post on this thread. Until it is rightfully locked players shouldn't engage a thread that is meant for a flame war to happen. I would suggest both parties but it seems the other party is one player doing this on purpose. It just makes it easier on staff so they don't have to issue punishment if someone goes overboard from either party

It is a derogatory themed username that should be against the rules. Iron4demote is on the same page yet it is not banned. This is a thread to get a flame war, no mods have indicated that they have answered my question/statement in a few hours. I can get a mod on OCN or Badlion in 15 minutes

There was an ImpactIsShit username that got banned and Impact loved that username. Also some of your team mates almost caused a flamewar in this thread. It is the same with PPB. I wouldn't care if someone made that but other could flame. It is a flame-wanting username. Also I was talking about the forums

i wouldnt give a damn if somebody made an account called Fortissimus is salt or whatever, but if berzerk is actually getting offended from it (which is wierd), then i think he needs to change his name.<br>but imo this name is completely fine, i dont see it breaking any rule from the rules page. if you see please comment on this with the rule.

A1 and D1 because the flame war would of happened and this is using<br>a derogatory word to insult a group of people. This caused unneeded tension from not only players but there is tension against staff. I could care less but what is annoying me is the staff haven't acted fairly on this subject and haven't justified why. Heck I should be punished because I acted as a mod on this thread
