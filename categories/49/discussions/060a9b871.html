Life was great during my time as senior but I guess it's even better that I don't have as many responsibilities as I did then because I didn't just step down from senior, I stepped down from mapdev also.&nbsp;<br><br>As far as I remember you were a pretty chill guy. I haven't actually talked to you since probably early 2016
