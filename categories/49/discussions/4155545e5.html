I started going on Ts, talked to Budah. Didn't know him before that, rarely saw him ingame lol, since he was always on Nexus. We killfarmed a lot and played avicus loads back then, it was at its golden age, with prestiges and a motive to play.<br><br>Pizza made the team, I didn't know him too much but I got in through raging/Budah. This was when it was called the game changers and before scrim servers on avicus, my first scrim was against Allah on SSB lol.<br><br>I honestly think you're a nice guy, I can't imagine you being a dick to anyone, despite how they treat you.

Kinda what lego said. We used to play avicus a lot <i><b>and</b></i> have fun. I still remember the first convo lego and me had, kinda awkward. Back in those days I actually used to fanboy people(Sem and Cookie_Tree f.e.) and I used to be nice to people. Being in a team that is somewhat good makes you cocky, sadly.

You drink coffee<br>Depends when and what I am angry on. If it's a scrim I think afterwards that I was stupid and that it doesn't really matter to be mad. In real life I actually never get mad, unless if someone asks to get smacked or something.<br>Haha, been there. I learned from the mistakes I made while doing that.<br>I'm not fat, nor I'm skinny.
