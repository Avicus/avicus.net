I would run away and question life.<br><br>@Connor4961<br>1. The community here is just so welcoming and great, I don't see how anyone could resist. Also the teamspeak is so great &lt;3 I have made so many great friends off of it!<br>2. I play cricket and a bit of basketball.<br>3. Nope, not even.<br>4. Dying before my parents.<br>5. Edwin Starr ("War" is too good)<br>6. Hmmm, I wouldn't say I have a favourite.<br>7. I would like to be haunted by Casper, I would just befriend him.<br>8.

@rese<br>I think that you are the only good mod that is still around. You were the only person back then that acted cool when everything went to shit so ur nice like that. Nowadays, looking at the mods I think you are what remains of the past. Hope you stay on Avicus. Also a nice guy to talk too, from the few times we have.<br><br><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">opinions the first time i met you?: The first time I met you was when you had just been accepted as junior. I won't lie as you probably know this now. I thought you were of the other gender. Which confused me when people told me you were a guy. Regardless, I remember the enthusiasm that you had and it was interesting seeing someone as excited as when I was when I got promoted.</span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">opinions now?: Way more mature, you turned into one of my good friends. When everyone is was leaving you stayed and we developed our relationship with Peachy and Ethan. It was so much fun ranting with you. I still hope you took all the advice I gave you.</span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">opinions on new junior?: They are all very interesting individuals with strange personas. Although, I will concede that a few of them are gonna be good (based on the past).</span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">opinions on the current mods?: All the mods are pretty bad, although the old ones are great. Excluding two.</span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">opinions on the new seniors?: I do not know who Passively is. Kyoal knows how I feel about him, I struggle to grasp how Camemes is a senior. Crazy_ actually has a brain, but I never got to talk with him.</span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">do all the seniors and admins deserve their spot? who doesnt?: No obviously not. &nbsp;I think that fourout of the six active senior staff don't deserve their spot. I think that you know who I dont agree with.</span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">redo the whole staff team with people you think would be good: Senior Staff: Dream Team.(The Iron Reign) Mods: You and the mods when I was manager. &nbsp;</span><br>

I think you are a very average mod, or at least you used to be. You are however; Paki, so I gotta give you some credit. I think you used to be a bit of a bandwagoner, but regardless you're a nice guy with positive intent.
