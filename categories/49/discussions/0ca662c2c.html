Favorite type of cookie?

I don't know, I'd rather have cake than cookies. Kärleksmums, without a doubt. It's similar to brownies but lighter, with a coffee frosting and shredded coconut.

<div>Hey bud!</div><div><br></div><div>It is out of control, Swedes are afraid to be perceived as racists or xenophobic. We are and we have been so afraid of being perceived as xenophobes that we have accepted everything and questioned nothing. Our politicians are afraid of explicitly stating that we have problems which of course are related to immigration and integration of other non-secular cultures. Swedes know about this non-spoken threat so they prefer not to engage too much and remain in a bubble where everything is going along just fine, as long as we all take a stance against hatred, racism and intolerance.</div><div><br></div><div>We used to talk before, quite a lot actually, but you disappeared. I like your attitude and your honesty.</div>
