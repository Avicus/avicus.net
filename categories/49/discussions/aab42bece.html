Hi everyone! <br><br>It's been about 6 months since I've been here, so I thought I'd see how things are going. For those of you that don't know me, I was a staff member here for a long time, and I'm a retired administrator for Avicus (as well as a map developer and official). If you have any questions, just keep in mind that legitimate questions will get legitimate responses, and stupid questions will get stupid responses... if I decide to answer them. Ask away!<br><br>Regards,<br>Mango_

My opinion on Avicus is that it should bring back Experience because when there was experience everyone played Avicus. They need to bring back the old arcade maps too!<b> I LOVED ARCADE</b>!<br>Now no one plays...<b></b><b></b>
