If you are banned, any account that you play on to try to avoid the ban will make that account banned

Usually, Senior Staff can conduct IP checks on most servers, banning all accounts associated with your IP. Do not join any suspicious unofficial server you do not trust and you'll be fine.

Ban evading is not allowed. This is why you keep getting banned. Maybe instead of trying to get around the original ban by evading (playing on another account) you should just stop.<br><br>This is why you were banned on all the other accounts on OCN.

Just appeal if you're banned, don't try ban evade, it'll make things worse and lower you're appeal getting accepted chance.

It doesn't matter what account it is, as long as they are all used by you under the same address, it is considered ban evading.

Using&nbsp;<b>any</b> account, no matter where it's from will get you banned. It takes next to no time to do an IP check, which allows the staff to know that the person playing on the account is you.

I'm not sure if you totally understand what ban evasion is. It isn't just something for you to get around. Ban evasion means you've been banned for breaking a server rule in the past, and are still playing when you're not suppose to (because you've been banned).&nbsp;<br><br>This is why ban evasion is not allowed. Because you're basically going around the ban, deeming the ban completely useless. This is also why you <b>will always be banned</b> for ban evasion when you play on an account to go around that ban.<br>&nbsp;<br>If you had really wanted to play on OCN, you're best shot after being banned would have been appealing that ban. Then after appealing it, you would have been able to play on the server freely, without ban evading (or being banned later for that matter). However, since you decided to ban evade on multiple occasions, those chances of that original ban being appealed have gone down to basically zero. If not negative something.&nbsp;<br><br>So in all seriousness, you should move on. You had your shot to play on OCN, and you blew it. You've broken too many rules, and are no longer welcome to play there.

Ban evasion is just a cheap way of cheating your punishment, period. There's no point of getting banned if you can just get on another account. As people stayed, IP checks occur and various times, in which case it doesn't matter if you're on an alternate account or your own account. When you're caught, your punishment will be extended for a further period of time, so it would be best to just take the punishment
