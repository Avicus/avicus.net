Yo Characteristics! I'm glad you decided to come back to Avicus! We have a bunch new exciting things since last time you were here and still in store! If you have any questions about them or anything in general, don't hesitate to ask me or another staff member. Besides all that, you seem like a really interesting person! Hopefully I can see you in game as well, enjoy your stay! ^~^
