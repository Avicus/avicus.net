You're a pretty nice guy when you're not in a salty mood and when you're with the right people. You piss me off that you used to try steal all our players :P<br>As a player I believe you have a lot of legit skill although you used to hack, I know that as a fact.

Used to be really cocky, but you've got a lot nicer since you became staff. Nice to play UHC with, but you can turn really unkind if in the wrong crowd.

Well you're quite cocky and big-headed. You're really nice around some people like Javi, but yeah you got me banned so you're not in my good books. Decent at PvP with some room to improve i guess.

Sem definitely carried, especially since he never talked (rip sem &lt;3)<br><br>Best pack...hmm a hard one. There are alot of good packs out there but my personal favourite is Dantehs old purple default edit.<br><br>You can sometimes carry our scrims. Very nice to talk to. Quite sensitive and I think you find it hard to take negative feedback. You sometimes crack under pressure but in saying that you can pull off some amazing stuff in the last minutes of a game.

Bro, I'm not pissed, all I want you to know is that i'm actually not a bad person and that if you talk to me you'll know that, I mean, Just ask members in your team. I know I might've been cocky in the past, but I have changed. I just want you to know that.

Concoct 243.7ml of coffee mixed with half a teaspoon of salt and 12 tablespoons of sugar. Then get your kangaroo tails in your back shed (we all know it's true Dan) dip them into the mixture and bite the end of the tail off. Swallow the end of the tail. Bring the rest of the tail and a donkey's eye back to the mixture, crush and blend into fine pieces. Then repeat the crush and blend of the donkey's eye and kangaroo tail. Listen to 'Dis calls for a muzz' 23 times, drink 3 shots of turkey's urine mixed with 12 and 1/4 shots of tequila. Go back to your dongaroo mixture and mix with the rest of the original concoction and boil for 32 hours.<br><br>And there you have your cure...<br><br><br><br><br><br>...or you could see a therapist your choice.
