Hey everyone! &nbsp;Just recently I got unbanned, and I would like to start off fresh. &nbsp;I know I did some pretty unforgiveable things in the past, but over the summer I feel like I`ve changed for the better, and I hope you guys forgive me :).<br><br><br><br>Anyways, enough of that, AMA :D

So why you hack, you have a reason behind it, want to be as good as others but can't, so you'd use modifications that are consider as hacking to improve your pvp by cheating, another pathetic person.

<i></i>kk<br><br>It's funny because you're right, back then I was terrible at pvp and I was frustrated that I was always killed. I really didn't know how to minecraft properly. (I did know how to install mods *cough* youtube *cough*) When I said I hacked on mczone, I didn't really hack, all I had was this radar mod which I didn't know was illegal until I joined the mczone forums. I did hack on other servers (like hypixel and mineplex).<br>So you can call me pathetic if you want, because I don't care.
