@Dcraven, wasting my life???? I dun think so, &nbsp;it is a great game! &nbsp;Yes minecraft is enough but I feel I should broaden my tastes, and I have found a new game I like a lot...<br><br>@ EvilChrizzillah, &nbsp;I found McZone through the OCN McZone/soon to be avicus war. I used to be an OCN regular and would playa fair bit, but the mods I felt were corrupt, and they punished nathbrown unfairly, so he said one day at school to me that we should check out McZone cus the ppl on OCN hate hem and vice versa. So we joined originally to stick a big midle finger at OCN kinda like, nubz, we on ur enemy server now, wha5cha gonna do bout it? But we slowly realsied that was kinda dumb and kiddyish, and we found thatthis server has an awesome community. So we stuck with McZone, they did the update to Avicus, &nbsp;and we played through that, now here is Avicore, &nbsp;17 years later!
