Hello! I'm Rogal Dorn, I have been playing on this server for a very long time and just decided to make an account. I'm 23 and live in Michigan currently. I do a bunch of crazy stuff irl that I won't write a book about here, I just wanted to say hi.

I think I will! Good to talk to you outside of the games for once. Congratulation on becoming a moderator, from what I have personally seen you are doing great!

I'm doing great thanks! I have been playing Avicus for a LONG time, Either right when it started or at least close to then, i've been on multiple different accounts and names though (all legit lol). This is not only my favorite MC server, but honestly it's actually my favorite FPS as well. I can't explain it, but I enjoy the throwback matches as much or more than most modern high-tech fps games out there.

Hahaha I have been thinking about that since you brought it up, I think I was playing on a server with very similar rules to the avicus games we currently play when I started and got things mixed up. Thanks for preventing me from looking like an even BIGGER idiot.

I've seen you a bunch too, i'll make sure to say hi next time we meet! Thanks for the compliments about my archery, I used to be REALLY good but now I think i'm just OK to be honest. The reason I use a bow as my primary weapon 70 or so percent of the time is because of two things. <br><br>First, I enjoy taking my virtual life too seriously and desperately trying to actually survive through matches while still being effective. Ranged fighting is the best way to do that.<br>The second reason is mostly habit. The very first online PVP server I played on had a rule where archers can ONE SHOT KILL at any range over 25 blocks. In that OP system you get to learn accurate rapid fire fast. Nice to talk to you!

So I do have a question, I recently learned that this server has a friend function to see what friends you have online. What's the etiquette for that? There are lots of people who I don't know very well, but I like to see them on line so I know who to challenge. Would it be weird to add a bunch of friends I don't talk to much?

Not at all, it'd be understandable should you wish to do this. Even create an archer's nest with a friend or something, it's up to you.<br><br>I've seen you around a bit and I would like to get to know you a bit better :)
