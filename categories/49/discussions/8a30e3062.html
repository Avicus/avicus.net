Well my first IGN was Spooks_9900 and I picked that because 1) &nbsp;I was enjoying a book series called Spooks (this was a long time ago xD) and 2) I liked the number combination. This new username was unfortunately not picked by me as someone got onto my account and decided to change the name... I will change it to something related to spooks again when the 30 days is up.
