Hi I'm DaBaderMC or DaBadgerMC. I've been on this server for a very long time. I remember that in the very old days, they had a small (VERY SMALL) stonwbrick spawn that had 4 games. I miss the old days, but that is the past. If you want to chat, my skype is dabadger.sweggington. Hope you have fun.

@panda: No, staff told me so if I will get one more infraction it will be a perm ban, they were right.<br>then I earned my last infraction and knew I'm going to get the ban, so I requested to be banned faster so I won't feel sad more time, &nbsp;I didn't want to be banned.<br>then I appealed it and playing on Avicus again with you all &lt;3
