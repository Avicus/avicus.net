@panda: No, staff told me so if I will get one more infraction it will be a perm ban, they were right.<br>then I earned my last infraction and knew I'm going to get the ban, so I requested to be banned faster so I won't feel sad more time, &nbsp;I didn't want to be banned.<br>then I appealed it and playing on Avicus again with you all &lt;3
