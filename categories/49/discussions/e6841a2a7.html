Well I'm out, I'm leaving Avicus and Minecraft in general.<br><br>Why?<br>Well school is eZ, I'm not leaving because of that. But Minecraft just isn't fun anymore, kids client everywhere and Avicus, OCN and just PVP is so stale. The fact that you can't go against people that are "actually" good, is just a shame.<br><br>Anyways, I guess I have to do some kind of good bye besties thingy.<br><br><b>Jozz</b>, if you're still around, you're great and the best admin Ive seen.&nbsp;<br><b>Barney</b>, you're bad, but ily. Na but for real, you became my best friend on here and I really enjoyed talking to you, that voice just makes someone happy, hopefully we will keep in contact<br><b>Tazz</b>, good luck with everything, just stop hacking gg, na but you were great aswell, hit me up on skype and ill carry a few scrims for you.<br><b>Jive</b>, you're fat and I'll see you in school<br><b>Sli,</b> thanks for everything, you were chill and nice<br><b>Javi,</b> Thanks for teaching me some stuff, hopefully we can keep in contact.<br><b>Grape,&nbsp;</b>fat<br><b>Budah,</b> you're a cool kid, I remember when you were shit, you've improved so much and I hope you will do it even more, you're really great<br><b>Noah,</b> Stop clicking with ur feet, and stop being so stupid, but ily and you're great<br><b>para,&nbsp;</b>I know you're openminded, just dont make more stupid decisions, you'll do great<br><b>Yuno,</b> this isnt a thank you, im just calling you out for hacks lol<br><b>Juanoh, Danikas, Creephunter, ciaren ;), cedd,&nbsp;</b>you guys were fun, thanks for sticking around<br><b>BC</b>, thanks for the amazing time, even though we never won a tournament, we were the best team, and we would have won all the tms if tazz didnt client and maps weren't aids.<br><b>Apollo</b>, gl with everything.<br><b>Staff,&nbsp;</b>Thanks for the great times in slack, im going to miss it a bit. You've improved a lot, even though you still make some horrible decisions.<br><br>Ill probably stick around forums, slack (if i ever get invited lol), and skype.<br>But cya around, I guess.
