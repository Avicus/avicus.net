Hey, did one of these for Project Redemption and thought I'd bring it back for Conquest. If any team leaders are interested, hit me up on Discord.<br><br><div><b>What is your IGN and team? </b>dev_revs, Team Rocket<br><br></div><div><b>How many tournaments have you participated in?</b> This will be our third tournament<br><br></div><div><b>Any team in particular you'd like to face off against?</b> Apollo, I'd like to see how we do against them, its been awhile.<br><br></div><div><b>Any team you don't want to face off against</b>? Team allah :)<br><br></div><div><b>How do you think you'll do this time around?</b> I am confident in my guys, we are going to play our hearts out and do our best to make top 8, and even better.<br><br></div><div><b>Any teams you have a rivalry with?</b> I feel like we have always had a rivialry with Xenarch ever since our team was created.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><b>What do you think is your team's best strength, and your best strength alone? </b>I feel like our team does very well at keeping a lead once we have it in a match, one of my personal strengths is stepping up and taking the lead mid-match.<br><br></div><div><b>What do you think is your team's worst weakness, and your worst weakness alone? </b>We get frustered when we are losing, I put the blame on myself because I do get salty and it doesnt help the situation.<br><br></div><div><b>What have you done to prepare?</b> We've studied the maps, we are solidifying our strats, and working together in team excerises.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><b>Anything you'd like to say to your opponents?</b> Prepare for trouble.<br><br></div><div><b>Anything else you'd like to say</b>? mom pls dont turn off internet</div>

You should make videos of this like interviewing not only the team leader but also a couple of key members

I'd say you could get in the top 8. It depends how you play on the day(s) though. Although you may not be the best team at pvp I believe you'll have good strategy.<br><br>Best of luck :)
