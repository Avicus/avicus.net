Jozz you're one of the probably best people I have ever met online. You're nice, and not like everyone els. You're not scared of saying ur opinion and ur arguments are always on point.<br>Such a shame you're not admin, because you are one of they few who can fix the mess.<br><br>Hmm, being a staff made me realise a lot of stuff, an example is how much some mapdevelopers do, even though I barely ever see them on. Sr mods did a lot of appeals and stuff, but they were never really there when shit went down, which I lost a lot of respect from. Once I realised that developers wasnt going to fix the broken kb and the messed up seniors (and admins), I decided to retire. I had hope in peacheh that he would fix it, therefor I temp retired (If it is still temp, im not planning on going back anytime soon).
