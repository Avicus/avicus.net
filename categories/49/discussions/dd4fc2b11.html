Oh, yeah. It was amazing. I'd &nbsp;have to play on tiny render distance with like 11 FPS, and never played multiplayer because our internet was garbage. I'd make box houses and would always play on peaceful because I was a wuss, haha.

I'd spent about a year of my life watching paulsoresjr play minecraft which I somehow found so amusing even though I didn't play the game but when I got the game I would just cheat in survival and say to my IRL friends: "I FOUND HEROBRINE" , "I KILLED THE ENDERDRAGON 20 TIMES" to look cool.

Yep I was playing the cracked "version" and I spawned in a jungle (Singeplayer). After a few weeks I think I joined a random server but I didn't know what to do on there lol. My second server I joined used to be my favorite server but like on Avicus, I got banned several times permanently for trying to hack the server and do bad stuff. xD The server closed years ago :(

I remember my first single-player day, like it was yesterday. It was a summer of 2011, my yard friends always talked about some strange game, Minecraft. I didn't want to start playing, till they told me, that it made of blocks and you can do everything there. OMG, SANDBOX GAME.&nbsp;<br>I went home and installed cracked 1.7.3 beta version, created world with normal settings. I spawned somewhere on the beach near the forest. It was a beautiful day and I messed around with cute animals and square trees. But it started getting darker.<br>Wtf, night?! It was super dark, I didn't see anything and somehow went back to the beach. White shadow flashed in the forest. Who was that?!!! Am I alone?! No. Strange green someone without hands (!) walked up to me. Who are you, little cute mutant? KABOOM! It dropped some sand, as I thought. Then white shadow came out from the forest and started shooting me! (Later I understood, that it was Skeleton and Creeper, being who blown up my beach. WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU, GAME?!)<br>I was super scared, began run away. Everything tried to kill me. I built half-dirt-half-sand box to hide there from evil surrounding, zombies and spider besieged me all night and in the morning I finally heard sounds of b̶i̶r̶d̶s̶ ̶s̶i̶n̶g̶i̶n̶g̶ zombies burning. Am I in the hell? Yes. That spider didn't want to burn or run away, he still remembered whom to kill (me)....<br>It was the great fight against the background of the rising sun (no). I won. Like human win nature. My first Minecraft day ended. My Minecraft life started.

I had the millebere mod and I spawned in a bunch of stuff and killed some dude in his hut and used his chest then he respawned and I couldn't get any back, so I spawned in a fire block and lit his house on fire and the surrounding forest, died from the fire, respawned in the fire so I jumped into a little water pool and drowned cause I didn't know how to swim. I proceeded to rage quit xd, I used to just build random shit in creative and played on parkour and SG servers a lot though I was terrible at both (I'm sure this isn't my first day but it's the oldest thing I can remember)
