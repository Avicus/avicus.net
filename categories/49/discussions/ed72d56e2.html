&lt;33<br><br>You're my favorite moderator probably because I've known you for a reeeeally long time. &nbsp;You're also one of my only friends who hasn't/has barely changed since we met, so that's awesome. Your promotion is long overdue, should've happened at around your 8 month mark to be honest.<br><br>Moderating is pretty fun, and this is one of the last things keeping me connected to the server.<br><br>Players.<br><br>Greatish, school's about to end but geometry is still a pain.<br><br>Cakes for sure.<br><br>I usually eat just cheese, but I like jalape√±os, banana peppers, olives, onions, and other veggies.

Thanks!<br><br>My favorite time as a staff member was probably back in my first few months when Merlin was a moderator, Iz was still on the team, and there were just so many old users on the team.&nbsp;<br><br>I like having a say in important decisions, although there hasn't been much of that recently.<br><br>Your one of the best seniors on the team and your one of my favorites. I didn't like that you were promoted like a day after rejoining the staff team, but now I understand it was for the better. :}

You can sometimes be annoying, but other than that I do enjoy talking to you. It has been some time since we've spoken, though.<br><br>I don't think I have a best moment. I use to play a LOT back in the day, and I had a massive amount of fun and great plays but I usually spend my time moderating or playing casually now.

A great friend and one of the better moderators. :)<br><br>The idea of being able to keep rulebreakers off the server and allow people to play the game without interruptions is a pretty big motivation of mine.<br><br>Avicus-wise, I guess when I was falsely demoted for sending some bad emails.<br><br>I'm not sure, I've had a lot of good memories.

Well, a few weeks prior to your promotion I truly hated that you changed so many things about yourself to become a junior mod, and the minimodding was a bit annoying. But after you passed your trial, I understood that the promotion did help the server wuite a bit considering you're one of the more active in-game moderators. I look at you as a friend, like I did back in the day, although we don't really talk very much. I don't think there really is anything you can improve on since you seem to do everything right and you ask for help when needed. Thank you! :)

You're a great friend of mine, and I enjoy the talks we had about real life. I think if you really wanted, you could help restore Avicus's former glory with the skills you have. The only other experience I can think of who has the experience you do is probably Cord.<br><br>I'd probably make myself fitt, which I probably could do now but laziness gets the best of me. :&gt;<br><br>I'm not as creative as when I was 9 or whatever, so probably something dumb like "my life.".
