<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; "><b>Thoughts on the quality of maps on Avicus versus OCN</b> Overcast has a huge advantage in gameplay over us: they can both look good and play good, but it seems that most of the maps we have aren't up to standards and are usually looking like some concept or thing that was released 50% into development. I dislike the huge amount of unbalance, flatness, rushing, lag, and generic materials when it comes to developing maps. I've tried to put effort into most of my maps, even joke ones, and unfortunately there seems to be a set on maps that are "classic" and not so directed toward styles like OCN, but maybe it's because I've played OCN for 3 years that I've adapted to it more. To be honest, both sides are strategic, but even defending on Overcast is more fun and cooperative.<br><br></span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; "><b>what direction the Map Development team needs to head in to make more quality tournament&nbsp;maps</b> I feel like the tournament map quality is fairly good, but if anything I'd improve, I'd get the community more involved so as long as they don't call random maps bad because they lost on it. I'd like to also have the officials who deal with map development be invited to scrims, and see if it should be kept or not. Maybe a period where players can test maps from a list, and throw back feedback to the officials? A rating system would help too.<br></span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; "><br></span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; "><b>meta of tournament OCN play and tournament Avicus play and how does the OCN meta influence current Avicus meta</b> Well, gameplay seemed to be directed a lot toward Overcast players and that essentially ended up being my fault. By introducing concepts, cannoning, layouts, and other things that Overcast would have and Avicus wouldn't, including using an Overcast map, I'm not sure if that was a smart move. I can tell you though, that Avicus wasn't much influenced on the tournament for OCN as much as it was for ourselves except through maps. If I was official again, I'd probably steer caution and provide toward the end of the tournament better gameplay for both parties. Wasn't completely balanced.<br></span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; "><br></span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; "><b>Also thoughts on me if you don't mind. </b>Fun&nbsp;and chill, good hearted.
