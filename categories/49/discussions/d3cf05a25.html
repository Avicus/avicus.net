Yo peeps and homies,<br><br>On this day, two years ago, I joined this server for the first time, it was the first server i ever connected to. &nbsp;And i was one clueless idiot. &nbsp;Now ive a done a little bit of everything, I almost prestiged in Elimination (ALMOST), Some meanie got me banned :,(, got unbanned, &nbsp;I played alot of walls, I started a minecraft Youtube channel, I applied for ref and then realized I referee soccer games on saturdays so i would miss every tournament game XD. &nbsp;I've made a few maps, I applied for Mod, backed out, then applied again and got Junior :3 &nbsp;Now here i am, its been 2 years. &nbsp;Crazy.<br><br>So AMA you people of the Avicus Community.<br><br>~Random_Pet/Nub/Guy
