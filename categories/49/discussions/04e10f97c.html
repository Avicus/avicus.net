Hiya guys, I'm Yamatzu! I'm a very good PvPer and loves to play Avicus! Recently I resisted on the Forums! I'm currently just using my account not my Bro's (OldManTigerMask) because I don't want to ruin his statistics although its not that good! <br><br><i>FAQ:<br><br>How were you introduced to Avicus?</i><br>I was Introduced by my brother then introduced my self to the forums and ever since enjoying my self!<br><br><i>Is your bro annoying?</i><br>Grr I hate to say this... YES he is VERY!!! Especially when he joins teamspeak and says that I can't join it too.<br><br><i>Do you like Avicus?<br></i>Why you ask? I don't like it... I LOVE IT!!<br><br><i>Erm.. are you going to make pointless threads like your bro?<br></i>No? Does he really make pointless threads? I have heard he gets in trouble on the forums by creating Bumps and a little more! But really? POINTLESS? How dare you call my brother's SHOW YOUR SCREENSHOTS pointless...<br><br><i>Are you a boy?<br></i>Certainly not I don't want to be one and I will never be one!<br><br><i>Are you annoying like your bro?<br></i>I don't think so. At lease I hope not I try not to be. If I am please tell me and I'll try and Improve!<br><br><i></i><u>Any other questions about me? Ask Away!</u><br><i></i><i></i>
