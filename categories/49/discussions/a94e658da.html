Now that I know more people on the network better, and upon the decision of me staying on the server (for those who saw my possible leaving thread, I have archived it since I, as a matter of fact, am not leaving), I thought I might as well do another AMA.<br><br>I'll answer pretty much any question you offer me, as long as it's not too personal and/or irrelevant :D

If you were a food, what would you be and why?<br>What's your favorite school subject?<br>What's the first object to your immediate left, and how would you kill a zombie with it? :o<br><br>Enjoy ^-^

Probably pizza, because who doesn't love pizza? :D<br>This year, world history. Next year, maybe algebra 2.<br>Ok, so I have a soda can to my left, and I would fill it up with sodium hydroxide, and just dump it on him. If that doesn't work, I'd close off the lid somehow, fill it up with Diet Coke, drop a few Mentos in there, and throw the soda grenade at it.

A minor part of that was just because of a really busy Summer schedule (even though I'm guessing it's winter in Australia?). Since it cleared up a lot, I was able to come back much more often than I had thought.<br><br>Plus, I &lt;3 you and nearly everyone else on the network way too much that I couldn't stay away, even if I wanted to.

It was Jason Voorhees.<br>Jk, nobody. Watch season 1 episode 26 and then you'll see why. She does get really pissed, though. You got that right.
