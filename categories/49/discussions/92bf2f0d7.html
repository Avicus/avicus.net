I doubt it'll be much different from your last AMA, but I'll follow the age-old tradition of asking for your opinion.<br><br>Also, in general, what are your Avicus-related plans? Where do you think you're going to go from the point where you currently are?

Yeah I was getting desperate<br><br>Hmmm this is a hard one the Boeing 787 is pretty cool, I fly that often<br><br>You seem really enthusiastic about moderating which is good, you have potential. Don't be afraid to ask questions. Also don't forget to ask before you do things.

Tradition is a key factor in a strong community :)<br><br>Anyway I thought you were a bit egotistical at first but now I see that you really care about the community.&nbsp;<br><br>I want to do my best to rehabilitate the competitive scene. Currently there a only 4-5 active competitive teams, and there need to be more. My goal as a builder is to build a map that gets played in the tourney and is of high quality.

I'll never forget when you SS me about a year ago xd. That was a cringe fest... Anyway we used to hate each other a while ago but now we are pretty close friends. You are a really skilled builder and you have great potential as a staff member :)<br><br>Yes, I would love to organize tournaments and do my best to grow the Avicus competitive scene.

You have a lot of potential in competitive and as staff, you just need to become a bit more active. You are also a really nice person.&nbsp;<br><br>Taco, not really much of a pizza fan<br><br>cold all the time, even in winter xd<br><br>Chips, I hate popcorn, especially when you put butter on it

You were pretty toxic in Xenarch, but you had skill. I think you aren't as bad now, and you are good at PvP so yeah

I haven't really seen you much but that's because of time zones... I feel like sometimes you try too hard, (trying is always good but there's a point where...) And sometimes you meme too much XD but otherwise you are a really good mod and a nice guy who is always there to help.
