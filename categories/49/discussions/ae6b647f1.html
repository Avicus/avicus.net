Hey guys!<br><br>I'm Elly, a new developer here at the Avicus Network. I first joined a bit over a year ago, mostly to play some scrimmages with friends for the tournament at the time. However, I had never truly become apart of the Avicus community, which is something I would like to do as I help develop for the server! I am very excited to be here as the community seems very tight-knit and kind. The warm welcome I got here was amazing! I thank you all for that.<br><br>So, you must figure, if I wasn't on Avicus, where did I even come from? Well, I started most of my Minecraft days on the Overcast Network. I enjoyed playing their gamemodes, and I eventually got involved in the competitive scene, winning two tournaments. Since then, I haven't played Minecraft as much, but I still enjoy it and I plan to come on a lot more now that I have the opportunity to help this server.<br><br>Please, if you have any questions for me, ask them down below! Besides anything too personal, I am willing to answer anything you guys ask me.<br><br>Elly

Hello!<br><br>Honestly, I was surprised that Overcast shut down as early as they are. I think several changes could have been made to sustain the server's life. Apple did end up making the decision though, which I respect. Some people have claimed that if the server was kept alive, it would not be the "true" experience, but I still think it could remain authentic as Overcast was not always this network that connects 20+ servers with all different gamemodes. It all started with one server, slowly growing into many more. Many people recollect the "good ol' days," while others claim it would not be right to revert to a state similar to them. While I'm sad that it's closing down, I don't think there was anything I could personally have done to help the server, nor any one individual could have done. Things die out after a while, and while it is disappointing, the memories will still be there and we have to accept that it will be going away.<br><br>I was contacted by Tazz about a week and a half ago, he first asked me for some help with CardinalPGM and then the next day recommended that I apply for Avicus developer. I hadn't really considered it in the past because I had never been too involved with the Avicus community and it might be uncomfortable for a complete stranger to get dev out of nowhere, but the community has been very welcoming. I'm glad I applied, and I think it will be both a good experience for me, to develop on a network that has a solid structure and foundation, and for the server, as I have worked with other game-managing plugins very similar to Atlas. I have some good ideas that I want to bring up to the dev team; however, I'd rather become familiar with the code and how things work around here before I get too crazy with wanting to add new stuff.

Yep, my first plugin that I worked on was the Scrimmage plugin made by ShinyDialga, RainoBoy97, and Barnyard_Owl. I had mainly done some cosmetic stuff that were just add-ons to the plugin but I still considered myself a contributor to the plugin. My first plugin that I created myself, though, was EllyPGM. I didn't know what object-oriented programming was at the time though so it was very hardcoded and difficult to add new features. Both of those plugins were on my cloud server though, back when it was one of the only scrimmage servers.<br><br><i>From response to Pelpelajax:</i><br><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">I was contacted by Tazz about a week and a half ago, he first asked me for some help with CardinalPGM and then the next day recommended that I apply for Avicus developer.

We were such good friends, and we actually won a tournament. It was very nice to be on a solid team that stuck around for quite a few tournaments. While I did win on Oklahomies, I didn't feel like I contributed much to the team and I wasn't friends with most of my teammates. I only knew who they were, I had no idea if they even knew me.<br><br>You were pretty solid on OCN. I believe we were on Poision Ivy together, but I'm not 100% sure. You didn't stand out to me for being a great PvPer or anything, but you wouldn't have been on the team if you weren't good enough!<br><br>I recall you being really immature back in the Overcast days, a year or two ago. I'd occasionally see you on the forums posting something that I didn't agree with or some immature comment, but you've improved a lot since then. You're much nicer and respectful of other people now, which I really appreciate and I now acknowledge you for being an serious member of the community rather than someone who always jokes around all the time.

Hey Zegita!<br><br>I'm really enjoying Avicus so far. The community is really kind and welcoming, which really inspires me to help with development.

In all seriousness, what do you think is wrong with knockback? I played for quite a long time both yesterday and today, and I didn't notice any immediate problems with it.

Hey Aura!<br><br>I'm not wearing socks right now.

Not too sure on that one.<br><br>I like to listen to the Discover Weekly playlist in Spotify.

Hey Elly,<br><br>Even though you're a developer for avicus, will you be getting into the competitive side of avicus and participate in scrimmages, tournaments, etc?
</blockquote>
</div>
While I did enjoy my time in the competitive scene in Overcast, I'd like to focus more on helping out with development here. I think that is a bigger priority, but as time passes I may reconsider joining a team and playing in tournaments.

Hey Eric! I remember Fortissimus! It's a shame I didn't get to play with you guys more; I was more of an Overcast player back then and I never got to know you guys well.<br><br>I've been well! Since the days of Fortissimus I've continued a lot of my personal development for both Cardinal, a project I've been working on, and an ultra hardcore plugin. Those have really given me a lot of experience as I go forward as an Avicus developer.<br><br>My favorite color is blue, especially if it's slightly green.<br><br>I love to eat bagels with cream cheese and smoked salmon. It is the perfect breakfast to me.<br><br>I don't support Trump, but I won't move to Canada or anything if he gets elected.<br><br>My PC is alright. I got a prebuilt around 4 or 5 years ago, because I didn't know about custom building a computer back then. I'm pretty disappointed that I didn't know that but I've tried to make my computer as best as possible. I've added two more hard drives and upgraded my old graphics card to a GeForce 750ti, so it's pretty decent overall now that I've made those upgrades.<br><br>As a developer, I'd like to focus on Atlas. I come from a competitive scene on Overcast, so perhaps I'll eventually focus on helping that part of Avicus.<br><br>Thanks for the warm welcome! I'll see you around.

Hello ImRaging! Sorry for the late response.<br><br>I've worked on CardinalPGM and am currently working on Cardinal 2, a scrimmage plugin for the Overcast Network. I've also been working on an ultra hardcore plugin for a friend's server. Nothing much besides that except for some libraries to help me more easily manage commands, localizable chat components, and GUIs.<br><br>Thanks for the question!

Hello DaFrozenBlade,<br><br>I'm very sorry that I gave off a bad first impression. I was busy filling out some stuff so I could officially get started with development here, and I wasn't really paying attention to chat.

</div>
It's just very inconsistent and some players take a lot less knockback then some others. Knockback is the main way to get a combo and get someone out of their reach to hit you but some people take close to none and some others take tons. It's just annoying sometimes.<br><br>In all seriousness though, welcome to Avicus. Hope you have fun here c;.

I don't think you can play while filling in your stuff too
</blockquote>
</div>
I played a game or two, then I mentioned to funky that the server was having some problems. I then went to fill out some forms that I had been given earlier, so I could start developing here. I was not trying to ignore either you or the question in any way. While I was in the game, I was talking to some of the other devs and was being introduced to the server and the plugins, so I was probably too distracted to look in chat. Again, I'm sorry that it appeared as if I was ignoring your question.
