Had never been the best team to play for skill wise, but I loved playing with them. I dont know what they are doing these days since I barely check discord. I think that at this point you shouldn't take teams serious anymore, atleast on Avicus.<br><br>What is T5?<br><br>Its great, I realised what gaming and talking over the internet does to you. My social life is really good and Im having fun.

Nein.<br><br>As I said earlier, I dont keep up with the changes. As I look at the team now it looks like some new players have joined. I think at this point good players don't really matter anymore. If I was still leader I would spend my time on making more fun inside the team, instead of practicing.<br><br>Probably, you seem to get along pretty well with the members.

Good defender, I was never close with you so I guess we were friends? I honestly don't know what to write. Sorry for that.

I don't know you apart from you being in team allah. I guess for being in allah makes you a good player, so good job on that. Again, I don't really know you. Sorry

We are good friends. You are a good rusher and you became much better the past year. The main reason for that was OCN. You are a fun guy to talk to, that sometimes takes jokes too serious. I think you are one of the best players Apollo currently has. Keep up with the good stuff.

They both look extremely attractive. If I really had to choose I would go for the left one. I like the orange color contrast more then yellow.

Great, as I said earlier. 2 weeks till summer, then I will have to work for 4 weeks and after enjoy my holiday. Party's are awesome too. Lot's of alcohol and girls.<br><br>Avicus isn't doing great, but you can't say it's doing worse either. It has been like this for the past year and they year before that was a bit better with a daily player base of 50 at EU times.
