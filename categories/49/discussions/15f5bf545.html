Hello, I hope you have fun here at Avicus! (:<br>Classic AMA questions :3:<br>1. What's your favorite color and why?<br>2. If you had one wish to benefit yourself (No donating to charity or anything), what would it be?<br>3. What do you think the meaning of existence is?<br>4. Can you easily do 56/24 in your head? (In under 10 seconds)<br>5. Is your power level over 9000?&nbsp;<br>6. If you were a food, what would you be and why?<br>7. If you were to use a common household object to fight in the zombie appocolypse (Microwave, chair, et cetera), what would it be and why?<br>8. If you could choose to be an animal and still had the power to morph back into a human any time you wanted, what would it be and why?

1. I like all colours tbh. Why? Cause it's like a tool kit for me to start filling in my drawings.<br>2. To benefit myself to have a Good Future.<br>3. Where oneself has life and a soul. To move, feel, smell, taste and to see. It is where one will notice someone else.<br>4. 7/3 Just barely xD<br>5. No it's over Nyan000<br>6. Rice. Because Asians stick together.<br>7. My Sword (White covered, white handled and it was something my friend had but I bought it off him).<br>8. This is a really tough question. <br><br>"Are you the Hunter, or the Huntered" <br><br>(You can't be Godzilla cause your bones would way to much).
