Hi guys! I'm not 100% sure of the forum rules so correct me if i've done something wrong, but this will be about me. I joined Avicus about 2 years ago, but have been very inactive due to my house flooding, me losing my brand new laptop, and me just not playing online games anymore. I love this server! My name may seem very strange, and there is a story behind it. I made this when I was younger, and I assumed 'mycolorisgreen' was a password, not a username. I know its very weird. I feel great to be back into this community. Well, Hi Guys!<br>-MyColorIsGreen

I'm pretty sure this is allowed because you're introducing yourself. WELCOME BACK!!

Heyo, welcome to the forums! If you have any questions or anything that you need you can ask any staff member and they will gladly answer you.<br><br>Also that name thing is totally something I would do, but green is a terrible color, should've chosen orange. And btw that house flooding sucks, hope that there wasn't too much damage.

Haha orange is a nice color :) Thanks very much for the kind reply. We have recovered from the flooding (not completely) and I thank you for your concern. Nice meeting you!
