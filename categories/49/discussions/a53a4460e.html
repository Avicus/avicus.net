I talk to brottweiler the staff member and I commeted that saids "<br><blockquote>I promise not to use any other ones account ever again in my whole life I am being honest and trust."&nbsp; He didn't respond back to _iGhosty and he closed the appeal that means that _iGhosty is banned for the whole life.&nbsp; He loved that server because he accidently pressed james pak and got banned for ban evading.<br></blockquote>

You have to stop this. They locked your other post for a reason. Avicus staff can't do anything, let him appeal again or talk to a staff member<br><br>I don't mean to sound rude but it's not the staffs problem on avicus, I would recommend asking around on OCN

Please keep concerns related to other servers off of our forums, Thanks.<br><br>Since this appears to be a recurring theme: if you continue, you will receive a punishment.
