You're pretty nice Chinese person, sometimes strict but also funny. I enjoy talking and playing with you no matter what. We've been talking a lot recently(well I was talking most of the times xd). As a player you're pretty good at melee and bow, AMAZING GAME SENSE ESPECIALLY IN UHC'S XDDDDDDDDD, and shitty pinger<br><br>And yes you're chinese

I know you for a long time but I havent talked to you before but in the past 4 months we started talking a lot. You're honestly very nice person to talk with and your ingles is funny because of your bolivian acccent. You let me sub for your BL team few times and I'm thankful for that. As a player you're one of the best melee players on avi(u secretly cheat tho xd). Good gamesense as well. Pretty good at leading too.<br><br>ALSO TELL YOUR SISTER TO STOP DDOSING YOUR EL INTERNET

OPINION; You are really funny and a good MEME, also up there as one of my favourite avi players. Although, you have been rather inactive on avi recently and can never hold a snapchat streak more than 3 days ;-( xD. You were also a really good leader in cronus and those were good times playing in your team.<br><br><br>POsIGhDUn CaN BrEEZily

Don't know you too well since you came form OCN but you are a pretty good player strategically and always 1st or 2nd pick in megas because of this. You are also pretty active ingame and seem like a nice guy ;) sketchy&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; ">(ง ͠° ͟ل͜ ͡°)ง &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><br></span>

We have a pretty high sc streak and can have some pretty funny convos there sometimes haha; although I am not allowed to say streaks or you will get mad LOL. Also you're Swedish which is one of the best countries in the world ;)

OPINION; IRISH LEGEEEEEEND. Really nice guy who is fun to play with in both ingame and whilst on ts. Really good at pvp but sometimes takes an L from Lokigh in pot ;-) xD. As a mod you are pretty laid back but gets stuff done since you are active and know what you are doing for the most part. Your youtube videos are always really well edited and fun to watch. Keep being Ciaan &lt;3<br><br>idk really, I like Clay wars and Halcyon.<br><br>CEREAL

You can trigger me in any other way I wouldnt give a damn fuck but just dont trigger in the way you did before. I honestly dont know what I've done to you so you started doing that but I'm honestly sorry. I wouldnt be a dick to person I liked talking with. You and I talked before you did that and you were pretty chill. Memeful person and shit and I liked it because I am one of those people that can joke around for whole day. You seem like a guy I could spend whole day memeing around the servers. You're inactive nowdays idk why. Hope we can actually be good friends for once</div>

I'd like to talk to you more</div><div><br></div><div><img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/fb4900805ca04f6597ccf62d1468b193?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/ImRaging.html" style="color: none">ImRaging</a></div><div><br></div><div>Don't know you a lot my dood sowwy. I just know you've been in apoLLo for a long time so I'd say you're pretty good. I liked how you lead your team in megascrim. I like how you think. I 1v1d you few times on minehq and we'd destroy each other(idk were you warmed up or no). We're same level at melee I think but you're better at bow.

I remember how you and budah started being fucking annoying to me and saying shit about me and egirl things. It made me super triggered. You said I'm with nia but you werent entirely sure(fyi i wasnt with nia lol... idk who made you think about it). I'd suggest you to ask first before you start saying shit. You can trigger me in any other way I wouldnt give a damn fuck but just dont trigger in the way you did before. I honestly dont know what I've done to you so you started doing that but I'm honestly sorry. I wouldnt be a dick to person I liked talking with. You and I talked before you did that and you were pretty chill. Memeful person and shit and I liked it because I am one of those people that can joke around for whole day. You seem like a guy I could spend whole day memeing around the servers. You're inactive nowdays idk why. Hope we can actually be good friends for once</div>

i dont remember what you're talking about or who Nia is, but don't take the things i say very seriously. i fuck around a lot if u havent noticed

OPINION; SALVO LAD. You've been around avicus for a while and I think I have got to know you quite well. When I was on Apollo you seemed like one of the nicest players there and it was pretty sad when you left avicus. Although I am very glad you came back and since then I have gotten to know more about you. You're a nice guy and good at the game. Although, recently on avi you have been a bit of a twat in the ingame chat XD also when you come on ts and ear rape everyone thats kinda annoying ;^(

OPINION; We used to talk loads when you joined avicus and you seemed like you would be the kind of person I would be good mates with if I had known you irl. I remember when you were banned for autoclicker trying to get into Apollo HAHAHA classic XDDDD. I kinda miss when we used to play as I could always rely on you for a good convo and it would be cool if you could come back in the summer if you're not feeling too old for it haha.

OPINION; JOSHHY, favourtie canadian I've ever met (sorry everyone else) and I think it's REALLY cool how you're a dancer. TBH, when you were a mod first time around you changed a bit and became kinda strict and not as fun as you used to be :( But when you got mod again you went back to the normal josh that I enjoyed playing with but you never seem to be online anymore. Also I miss talking to you on snapchat as you only seem to check it on occasion now which really sucks :( In general though, you're a good friend and a very&nbsp;charismatic &lt;3

OPINION; REALLY nice and funny dude, seems like you've been around on avicus for decades haha. Also a very good player strategically, and had great fun playing with you on BluEagle until you left us for a random spanish team ;v Hope you still stick around on avicus into the future :)<br><br><br>and yes I would consider playing it again in the summer holidays; suprised you remembered I said I played it

Thats all I can say now :(</div><div><br></div><div>How's life? - So far decent, I'm hoping it will get better soon</div><div><br></div><div>What's good? - Laurence is good ;p</div><div><br></div><div><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8b3809e84c405fbfd0be15ec33ddcf76?s=20&amp;default=mm" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/Crazy_.html" style="color: #D40000">Crazy_</a></div><div><br></div><div>We used to talk a lot before when ocn was a thing. We had many funny moments in mumble and in game. Sadly I didnt apply for your smp so we couldnt spend time playing a lot. You are really chill staff and nice to talk with. I miss talking to u cwazy :(</div><div><br></div><div>If you could change one thing on Avicus, what would it be and why? Posighdun XD, kidding. Tbh idk maybe maps? Maps arent really the best imo but that should change.</div><div><br></div><div><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/617db64dd8d43c27d0f53ba4d56049cc?s=20&amp;default=mm" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/Phjilip.html" style="color: none">Phjilip</a></div><div><br></div><div>You're a nice guy in ts. We talked a lot and played together many times. Only thing I dislike about u is that you talk a lottttt more than I do about some weird things xdd. You became inactive I guess or its just me. As a player you are decent. You bowspam the fuck outta me every time xd. Improve melee a bit more.</div><div><br></div><div><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/71383030ca8756e98de7076c2e720903?s=20&amp;default=mm" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/Hivu.html" style="color: none">Hivu</a></div><div><br></div><div>Idk you that well yet.

I'd consider you one of my closest friends now because we talk everyday. You're really talented map maker imo. Really quality apollo memer also. You are really mature guy when its needed. Idk what else to say but it would be something nice for sure. Now go eat lunch and dont shout.</div><div><br></div><div>As a player you're a good defender. You make really nice defenses on almost every map. Your melee skills are kinda similar to mine. I destroy you or you destroy me. You are extremely good at bow.</div><div><br></div><div><img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/3bd1bc6839e3460d9844ca943cfddbb1?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/PixelCat11.html" style="color: none">PixelCat11</a></div><div><br></div><div>I enjoy talking and playing with you a lot. You're such a nice person to me. I like you as a friend a lot. We talk and joke everytime we're in ts. We stopped talking recently because you switched to discord and I really dislike discord for talking. You're taking this game too serious which isnt good, trust me. Its just a block game and it cant really affect your RL unless you take it very serious. You're also getting pissed pretty easily. I told you many times, ignore things that annoys you even the people you can call your "friends". I'm telling you that from personal experience and I suggest you to listen me. As a player you sweat this game a lot. You improved so much in melee when prestiges became a thing. You make armor almost every time and that just shows how "sweaty" you are xd. Hope we can talk more before u go inactive too.</div><div><br></div><div><img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/3ec3ad7c563c45fbaedfdd32066a2e19?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/Sweedie.html" style="color: none">Sweedie</a></div><div><br></div><div>Do you know what floorball is? - Nope :(</div><div>-Have you played it?</div><div>-Do you enjoy it?</div><div><br></div><div>Favourite pie? - Strawberry</div><div><br></div><div>Hobbies - Pack making ofc xd</div><div><br></div><div><img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/bbd4d28fea954982b38b52ef4729c278?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/Hundres.html" style="color: none">Hundres</a></div><div><br></div><div>I either dont know you or I forgot who you are. You are good at the game but you're sweating pub too much imo. Also good melee skills.</div><div><br></div><div><img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/7a2f863f8ea948df97aa52089461e8dd?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/GITHANOS3.html" style="color: none">GITHANOS3</a></div><div><br></div><div>Honestly I have nothing against you but you're annoying imo. You should stop fanboying other people and be you. You should chill when you're talking with others in discord, when someone starts swearing and being a dick to someone else, you're legit doing the same thing as they are. Dont. You should understand people make fun of you sometimes because they think you wont do shit about it. Dont let people do that. As a player idk how good you are. Never played with you or against you.</div>
