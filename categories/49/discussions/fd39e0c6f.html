So I'm WaveConquerer. &nbsp;I've been playing this server since the days of MCZ (i believe i joined when Nexus was new, before even Candoria was released, when it was just Lights Out v2 and Zoo.) &nbsp;I have left and returned here several times and feel like coming back for my fourth run through &nbsp;the server (i've left three prior times, mostly due to life things and boredom with the forums). &nbsp;My favorite thing to do in regard to the server was play Nexus, Nebula and CTH. &nbsp;I attempted to build a few maps for the server (i made five in total, and one has been accepted). &nbsp;I would like to get back into making maps, if anyone would like to give me tips, tricks, and a bit of help finding SPC for Mac and writing YAMLs. &nbsp;I use Teamspeak or Skype (primarily TS) if anyone wants to talk. &nbsp;<br><br>I also have the tendency to be a bit of an ass, but i can repress it for the most part.<br><br>An outside interest of mine is Parkour, and i hope some kind of parkour can be found around here.<br><br>So thank you &nbsp;for welcoming me to your server. &nbsp;I hope to spend a lot of time slaying my enemies and having fun doing so!
