Hey guys, Giggity69Goo here and I am so happy to start to really become a part of the Avicus community. Although I have only been a member for 9 days now, I have spent 10+ hours on the server (mainly Nebula).<br><br>Before Avicus, my whole Minecraft career started in 2012 when I just turned 12 years old. A month later I found the <i>Minecraft Survival Games Server</i>. I was addicted to it, and I partially still am today (although I'm playing tons of Avicus nowadays). The MCGamer Community is one of the largest and (on average) oldest (in age) communities in all of Minecraft. I am proud to say that I am quite somewhat popular in the community being one of the top forum posters out of the hundreds and thousands in the community. From then on, most of my Minecraft life was all about PvP. I am currently a moderator for 2 PvP based servers. The PvP experience revolves around a sword, bow, fishing rod (who would think of that), and a flint and steel. It wasn't hard for me to get used to Avicus' PvP, and I think that's mainly why I have a pretty nice K/D ratio :)<br><br>Now I want to talk about how I was introduced into Avicus. My friend FuzzySnowXD introduced me to the server, and it all took off from there. I first played Perriculum, OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. I didn't get annoyed by it. I loved the PvP and I really love the TNT Bows. I would always play with friends for the first 2 days, but after...I started a career of my own.<br><br>After playing Perriculum, I saw that Nebula mainly contained "Break the Momument" games. I was <b>EXTREMELY</b> thrilled about this. I love being sneaky and always making the opposite team rage due to the fact that I was able to get passed their "impossible defense". It's also better practice for my brain! (A little off topic but it's a fact that Video Games help the brain: <a href="http://9facts.co.uk/en/Video-games-help-train-your-brain-to-make-faster-real-life-decisions.2896.html" rel="nofollow">http://9facts.co.uk/en/Video-games-help-train-your-brain-to-make-faster-real-life-decisions.2896.htm...</a>)<br><br>I will end it off here saying that it's great to become part of the community! I hope I make plenty of friends here. I also wish that once Moderator Applications reopen, I become a moderator of the Avicus community as it is an aspiration of mine right now!<br><br>Seeya later,<br>Andreas (Giggity69Goo)

Due to the fact that I have never been banned on ANY server because of my name, I think I my chances of getting banned are very low.<b> ESPECIALLY </b>since I have talked to other moderators in-game and stuph.

Vlad, his name isn't necessarily vulgar unless you make it out to be. It can be argued that the number 69 isn't vulgar in itself, because it really is just another number. If his username was something like SEXGOD69 then there would be a problem.

yea but I think the word giggity (which quagmire (a pervert from familly guy) would always say that when he is sexually aroused... I think that gives a red flag to most people... especially with the number 69 in it...
