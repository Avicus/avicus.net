1. Very very nice person to talk to. You can make my days better whenever I am not in good mood. We chat a lot and we should keep chatting ^.^ You're also responding to my requests whenever you have to and your job is done nicely.<br><br>2. "This kid looks like a good player. I should talk to him, to see what his character actually is like."<br><br>3. Um, let's say 85/100. I know, I could give you higher rate but that's it for now ;)<br><br>4. Ryiley for now :P<br><br>5. Probably you, I don't know that many people yet to answer this question but I'll say that's you. I mean I am not chatting a lot with other players except with you.<br><br>#ReporterSquad
