lego u dont know how much i love you when you lead. youre literally the best in giving instructions calmfully and shit and i always look up to scrimago when you lead because i love doing what u want me to do and getting the "nice eric" after capping a wool from you etc. lately weve all came into this kind of thing of scrimming in ocn because avicus scrimservers are down, and we usually scrim beans. weve all been hackusating them tons and its really annoying. we all know some of them cheat ok but you must have the balls to admit it gets over the line and there are really not as many cheaters as we accuse. they might be sketchy but they dont cheat. its that easy saying they cheat simply cause you cant accept theyre better than you. might even that zegan guy was just good idk. but we must stop hackusating mid scrim. it literally ruins our comms and our game. we dont need to start of a scrim by somebody saying "player123 is cheating, player_x is cheating" etc which we did for quite a while now. we need to treat every team like we dont know them and do our best. we need to stop hackusating, we try to focus on comms and then we get fucked because of this. we are a really good team ,its just that people need to understand that hackusating doesnt help. calling them a fat autoclicking beaner cunt in chat and leaving doesnt help. it wont improve us. im not the guy saying i didnt do that, i did, but after thinking about it, it ruins us.<br><br>also legoche ur the leader and imo you should set example for all of us, you do have a life and its completely understandable that sometimes you just cant give&nbsp; a fuck and be bothered, but in that situation say before the match because we are always looking for improve and when we dont take shit seriously it fucks up our comms and makes an arguement start.stop hackusating no matter if they hack, we keep playing. it doesnt matter at all.
