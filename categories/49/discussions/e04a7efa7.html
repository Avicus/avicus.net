Anyone whoever felt offended by what I might of said in the past, or any staff members I was mean or rude to, sorry. From now on I'm going to try to contribute to the Avicus community.&nbsp;<u></u>Once again sorry to all the people who were offended by me. From now on no more raging or swearing, or getting angry at staff, time to start new. So people, say hello to the new Luke; hope he's better than the old one!

The fact that you had the guts to come out and apologize like this, is just amazing. Not many people have this personality like you do. I haven't seen misbehavior with you, but if you had in the past I forgive you for it. It's always nice to see a player change their ways. :)

I haven't known you for that long, the first time I saw you was the game you got first prestige in, but you seem like a really good person :D

It tames great courage to come out and talk about your mistakes. I am sure that things will only get better in the future!

I truly admire the way you came up and spoke up! You have gained respect from me, the fact that you understand you done wrong makes it even better! People who realize they were wrong, and come back and put 110% effort to attempt to be a better person is even better :) I forgive you.
