<br><b><b>A:</b></b>I'd rather to be a lion then a bull. Bulls are cool 
but have you ever seen a bullfight? After the fight they just get 
killed. In the wild they get killed to by predators. Lions don't get 
killed by animals really fast. They are bootiful as well!<br>The lion is really fast too, I always wanted to be fast. I'm really slow. xD<br>
