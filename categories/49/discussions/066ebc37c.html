I have a couple of questions for you:<br>- When did you exactly leave?<br>- What do you miss about Avicus?<br>- What do you think about the new features Avicus has now?<br>- Who's your best friend here?<br>- Would you comeback someday? Be honest.

When did i leave?<br>&nbsp;I didn't, i always lurked around just never logged in. School has taken a toll on me and life has been hard.<br>What do i miss?<br>&nbsp;The people, everyone is nice and its just fun :)<br>New features?<br>&nbsp;I honestly haven't noticed anything with the site, and i was only in game for a couple mins today.<br>Best friend?&nbsp;<br>Hmmm, i dont really know honestly, im friends with everyone just not "super" close with anyone in particular.<br>Would i come back?<br>Im hoping so, school is tough right now and well its more important than minecraft at the moment but hopefully. :)
