You sure? .-. No history on OCN and 3mins on at the time and registered fully for the forums and made a topic :P&nbsp;<br><br>Which is kinda confusing to start off.&nbsp;<br><br>With all the new alts and new names, I'm keeping a lookout, not to be hostile or rude, but you know ;p&nbsp;<br><br><br>In case you didn't see, if you really aren't an alt, welcome m8 ;).

You've been quite spammy lately. If you wish to appeal, you must email support@avicus.net and do it there.
