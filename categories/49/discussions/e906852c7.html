Guys, I'm sorry to say, I'm probably leaving.<br>When I first found Avicus, I went on to MC Server lists and found an IP that said MCZoneWalls.net I thought to My self, MCZone sounds a lot familiar. So I joined and met so much fun and great people. They told me MCZone got switched to Avcicus and I was like no way I loved MCZone a lot and that was the only reason I ever came on MC. I met and found a lot of great people such as, Endsy, IzJustAPickax, 99250, PolarExpress, MurphTheCat, and many more! (sorry if I didn't name you.) When I joined Avicus I was a big noob and didn't no anybody. I sucked at walls and got better and better! I just loved Avicus but I have made a decision. High school is coming up and I need to meet people. I need to go out and be more social instead of sit down and lock myself in my room to play MC. If you see me, its probably because my brother wants me to come play with him on Avicus because he likes it too. So long Avicus, I had great memories &lt;3 guys
