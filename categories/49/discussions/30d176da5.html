hi<br>ND told me about McZone, so I joined in October 2013, played one ever game then left for about 2 months when I joined Avicus in January. I also saw legosean10 play on it.<br><br>I miss them so much, had such a unique system, sucks to see them go, aswell as the players.<br><br>Yes I am, 28cheetah is a little annoying when 1v1ing tho xd<br><br>Credit system: ehh, it is ok, but nothing to work towards like prestiges, would like to see something like that back.<br>Prestige system: Pretty unique, great idea, makes players come back and play to get that higher prestige, something to work towards.<br>I would love prestiges back, but with the credit system, I think they could do a lot more with if they actually think about it and develop new stuff for them.<br><br>Like Rendezvous I, first map I EVER played on in McZone.<br><br>Sword, I am shit with the bow xd<br><br>Yes, Definitely! I could just go to McDonald's for some free wi-fi xd<br><br>Known you for a while now, probably for nearly 2 years tbh, great at PVP, rushing, and making new friends c; cool person

hihi<br><br>Love porkchops ;)<br><br>Pretty chill, cool server. Would like to see more developing though, would love to see like, 1 thing added every couple weeks or so, quicker updates would be nice too, gain more players. Also, more players would be nice, hopefully this Atlas update does something ;) Would be cool to get a youtuber to record on here.<br><br>Avicus player countxd<br>jk. Probably war, why do we need it? i dont know, I know it is defending and stuff, but why start it? Would definitely change that/
