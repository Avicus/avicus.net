You see a blue tiger it then shrinks is eaten by a rat which then runs off and then is lifted of the ground by an eagle, the eagle and rat with the blue tiger in its stomach is then eaten by flying shark. You then take two steps forward and realize that you are walking on a cloud and you fall below, luckily you land in the sea but the sea has angry piranhas in it. After you cuddle every last piranhas you have a bowl of ice cream and look at you elbow for three minutes and notice there is some chocolate on it, you attempt to lick it but you cannot reach, the lady next to you asks you what you are doing, "I am trying to get the chocolate off my elbow" you reply, the lady then turns into the pink panther and the 'Pink Panther' theme song starts playing. In the randomness you notice the world has become animated and you see people with giant heads walking around, a young boy runs up to you and yells out "Lets battle," you have no idea what to do so you run into a barber shop and eat all their candy. You walk out the shop into a street, everything is now in black &amp; white, you take two steps forward, turn 15 degrees and wake up. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How cooked do you like your steak now?
