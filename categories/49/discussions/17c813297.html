Hey guys, back again with another there PR Spotlight. Today's interviewee is PokerFace!<br><br><div><b>What is your team name?<br></b>My team name is Cacalmarin. We are one of the first Avicus teams to be created and have been around for several years.<br><b><br></b></div><div><b>What have you done to prepare for Project Redemption?<br></b>To prepare for Project Redemption, we had one scrimmage against Team Allah and are hoping to squeeze in one more with another team before the weekend.<br><b><br></b></div><div><b>Has your team played in past tournaments? How do you think this'll effect your experience?<br></b>We have participated in every Avicus tournament to this day and a couple of unofficial tournaments as well. I think this experience will help with our communication and strategy a lot. &nbsp; Sometimes when teams pick up new members, it may be hard to recognize who is who. We have a general idea of certain team's tendencies and we are hoping that this will help us to win.<br><b><br></b></div><div><b>What are your team's major weaknesses and strengths?<br></b><div>Major weaknesses we have are coordination and strategy. Often times we cannot hold a choke-point and we often get overwhelmed because of it. Our communication needs some improvements as well, sometimes enemies aren't called until they are at the objective. I would say our strengths are individual skill. We have quite a few talented players and hopefully we can utilize these skills in our matches.</div></div><div><br></div><div><b>What do you think of the teams you are set to face?<br></b><div>I think the main teams that stand in our way are Apollo, Cronus, and Sagrevyum. Apollo has had the same core roster for a very long time and they are very well coordinated as a team. Their recent roster shuffle is something important to note as well. <img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/6fb20a2427f9448d8a77e460c5717481?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/DaFrozenBlaze.html" style="color: none">DaFrozenBlaze</a> &nbsp;has always been an outstanding support player. I remember when he used to play for Cacalmarin,he was the guy that kept the game competitive, even against top-tier teams such as Allah. Sagrevyum has always had amazing individual skills so I think they have a good chance making it to the invitationals. Cronus has definitely been growing stronger and I'd like to see what kind of battle they can put up against us.</div></div><div><br></div><div><b>Is there anything you'd like to say to your opponents?<br></b>I wish all opponents good luck and i hope to see a couple of upset matches!<br><b><br></b></div><div><b>Any predictions for Project Redemption? Upset victories? Controversies?<br></b><div>For Group A, I think Apollo and Sagrevyum will be heading on to the Invitationals, but Cacalmarin and Cronus have a chance to upset For Group B, I think it will be Team Allah and Team Cennet who will head to the Invitationals. There are a few new teams in Group B that I am unfamiliar with, but there is always the chance that they could upset.</div></div><div><br></div><div><b>Anything else you'd like to mention?<br></b>We hope to make I think at least to the invitationals.<b><br></b><b><br></b></div>
