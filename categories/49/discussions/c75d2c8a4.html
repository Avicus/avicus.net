Hey, I was that little aussie shit who used to play this server 24/7. I was the one who complained about the server and the staff team and owned the shitty team Xenarch. Shout out to my babe dev_revs, you are still my precious angel. So I left about 8 months ago with the reason, avicus and minecraft are boring. Well, little did I know, my friend msged me on skype telling me avicus had prestiges. At first I called bullshit, at 2nd my jaw dropped lower than my balls. Haha, I'm joking. My balls still haven't dropped. So most of you guys will probably not give 1078 shits about this post, but I could be coming back. So if you were wondering where I had been all quiet 8 months, I was playing csgo. Got to nova 3, deranked, now I'm nova 1. So, ye. I might be coming back.<br><br><br>to my calculations there is a 13.779% chance of me coming back<br><br>goodbye<br><br>also shoutout to my babe shadowolf

Sorry mate, but personal update threads aren't allowed.<br><br>Yes, we are quite lenient with these types of threads but a "I might be back" thread doesn't quite cut it.<br><br>Glad to see you're considering coming back though, hopefully more players do the same.
