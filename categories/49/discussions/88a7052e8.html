<b>Why am I so negative?</b> If you mean towards Avicus it is because the community asks for one thing, you do another and then you ban me for asking and complaining about why you didn't do what we wanted. Yes, you run the server, but we make it popular and play it and I feel we should get more of a vote than you.<br><b>Favourite Cake Flavour?&nbsp;</b>Any cake is nice expecially when it is homemade.<br><b>Opinions?&nbsp;</b>In all honesty I would say mixed. You seem nice enough and you are keen and getting better at moderating but you need to chill out at times and know when to say that this specific thing one player said will not hurt anyone and therefore he doesn't need a warn. ^ To word that differently, you also crack down on things in my opinion really don't need to be I guess so heavily moderated. TL;DR: Good at moderating just chillout a bit at times.<br><b>How do I like my steak?</b> To be honest I've never really had steak for the simple fact that it is too hard but how I like it is I think you say medium half cooked or something.<br><br>I hope you do take this on and you'll become one of my new favourite moderators.

No, in fact I love them and once wanted to be one. My point of my other post is just for them to stop being sweaty and to add more humour to their "job".

<b>Favour</b><b>ite Soda? </b>At the moment it's probably Ginger Beer (Root Beer for Americans) but I don't know if it actually classifies as a soda.<br><br><b>Favourite Soccer Player?</b><b> </b>There is a lot of people to choose from but any Arsenal player (I follow the Gunners) and also at the moment it is probably Antoine Griezmann<b>.<br><br></b>It's alright about not knowing me being banned, everyone makes mistakes.

<b>Opinions? </b>Where do I start? Funny person who always made memes out of the slightest bit of shit, brings a little humour to moderating but needs a bit m<b></b>ore. On how you did your job as a moderator is a little more detail, you were the only staff member on in the Australian timezone for so very long and I respect that because of how much shit you had to go through and how many hackers you did end up having to ban.<br><br><b>Opinions on your memes? </b>Amazing, like always and they definitely made me laugh and enjoy my time on Avicus. The recording of me and Josh singing Sweatshirt, maybe not so much.<br><br>Thanks and I hope to see you back when I do make a ban appeal.<br><b></b>

I didn't see you all that much after you retired from mod because I was banned on Avicus by that point but when I was there and currently a mod that is definitely someone that people can talk to. While back in the day you were the sweatiest mod it was always funny when you permanently banned yourself I think 3 times in total.<br><br>As a person someone who made me laugh because of his laugh (NZ laugh is godly) and also his wonderful bow spamming skills which made him somehow get a K/D of 2.<br><br>Thanks to you as well for the funny memories and I hope to continue those after getting unbanned.
