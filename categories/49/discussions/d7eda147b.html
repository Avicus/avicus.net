Pubs are a lot less fun for me now because I tend to get targeted a lot + I've been playing them for 2 years, it gets boring after a while. That, the competitive scene on OCN is more active and I want to make my impact on competitive at a higher level. I've already made my impact on the competitive scene on Avicus and I really don't want to be involved in Avicus drama anymore. 2 years of it is enough for me. I probably could come up with more, but this would run on much too long if I did.&nbsp;<br><br>Tl;Dr:&nbsp;<br><br>Avi pubs aren't fun for me anymore, I want to make my mark somewhere else now, I lack interest in Avicus after 2 years and I don't care enough about this game anymore to get involved with pointless Avi drama unless it concerns my friends.

Alright person but you've always had a bit of an ego inside and out of game along with having a bit of a short temper, which gets you on the wrong side of people often. You always stick up for your friends and have been loyal to me though, so I'm fine. You also seem to be a hub for drama due to your hot-headedness.

I saw you as annoying and whiny when you'd get pissy at people calling you a girl to aggravate you, but you started to calm down and not give a shit after a while instead of breaking down, which I like. You became a fairly solid competitive player as well and you brought reason and critical thinking to the staff team, which is great.

You were a pretty good mod and a reasonable person along with having good temperament and an ability to pick things up and learn quickly, which surprised me for your age. On the other hand, I've become more toxic and memey, so I'm not so sure how good of friends we could('ve) become, but I don't hate you. I just stopped caring about keeping my cool as staff and being staff in general, I'm glad that you can stay dedicated and patient.&nbsp;<br><br>Aussie land is pretty cool, just seems like just about any wildlife there is dangerous.

You are a really nice person from my experience with you (though we don't talk). I remember you were a solid player, but you were clearly cheating in your unofficial tm (not that I particularly care). I've heard people say sometimes you can make absent-minded mistakes, but if you can fix those you can be a really good player

You were always a major ass to my friends so I didn't take that well to you, but now that I don't really care much about this game and I'm barely a part of this community anymore. Because of that &nbsp;it simply doesn't matter to me all that much anymore. Tbh it's a wonder you haven't been permed for toxicity. I just see all the drama you're involved in (and were involved in) and think it's rather pointless and stupid, but it's not up to me to decide what you do with your life. It's rather difficult for me to support or stand by someone who freely hurts others without giving a shit though.

Tbh I like you a fair bit, but for a while I found you annoying because of how Apollo members tend to act around one another (though most are fine as individuals imo), which is pretty poor tbh. I really just saw you change from TGC on and it dissapointed me at the time. I still find it pretty idiotic that you can't admit to using a kb mod back when Avi was 1.7, not that I really care anymore. No drama intended from that. We started talking and I like you now. I tend to like people who are a little bit toxic, which I do see you as, so yeah. Not like I particularly think poorly of you because of it, given how I've been acting as of late.

You were fishy back then but like I didn't expect you to get banned off of like 30 seconds of evidence where some clips were slowed/repeated, I found that pretty dumb. I like you as a person in-game, though we haven't talked too much outside of it. Your main flaw as a player is that your positioning can be too aggressive, which causes you to get punished a fair amount. You're a solid offender and I really don't know how you consistently come up with touches, but you do. Kinda carried Spectre in a few matches, just wish we could have been more active.
