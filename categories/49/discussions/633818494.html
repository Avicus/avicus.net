Hello, I am Divide_23 and I am new to the Avicus Network. I usually play on the Overcast Network, but I currently have a 7-day ban. I decided to try Avicus out. Most people from OCN hate this server but I don't know why. It seems like a great place. I hope to have a great time on this server.

I don't know if this would be to much to ask, but could you tell me some things that would help me out around here. I kind of get the basics of this server, but I'm not really sure about it.

It's not too much to ask! ^-^ Do you have Skype, so I could tell you a little bit around here, and show you around? ^.^ Feel free to add me if you do! Skype; princezzdubby
