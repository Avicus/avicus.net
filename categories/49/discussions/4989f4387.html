Dont really know apollo cus Im not in the team and I haven't been in the team either. Youre a good team but I feel like they've actually been getting quite a bit &nbsp;worse than before. I dont really know why this happened but I guess it's because Budah and Lego quit. I also feel like they probably will 'rise' &nbsp;again as there's still alot of people who wants to join the team.<br><br>I like talking to you and I like that you left apollo xxdxd. You probably find me annoying sometimes qhich I know alot of people do. You're a good pvper and a nice person and you've improved alot lately aswell. You are an amazing defender, probabl one of the best I know. I dont rlly know but it feels like you are able to play other positions apart from defense aswell. Im honest, I dont think I have anything bad to tell you. Nice person &lt;3

Tbh you're usually nice but now I dont like you and I know you dont like me either. You used to be fun to talk to back in the days and you should still be but now you're not anymore cus we both hate eah other. Or at least dislike each other.

You're a rlly nice and calm guy. You're awesome at pvp and I thought u were cheating ar some point tbh and I think some ppl think so aswell. You are a good teammate and you listen to what we tell you to do which is what makes you good.

Tbh you are quite annoying. You keep apolying for teams even if you're banned and you're also lying about stuff. For example, if you want to be in a good team there's no point lying your way into it. Do not say you were ina team you havent even had your feet on. Be honest and play with a team that fits you.&nbsp;<br>You're not that good at following instructions and listening to the team leaders. You say you have tons of more experience than you actually do. You're a little more than average at pvp.

One of my best friends on avicus atm. You're really fun to talk to and you're a great leader. I remember before when we used to lose like every single scrim against jala and then I thought that you were a slightly bad leader because we always won when xtra lead. No offense, pls dont start hating me i sill love u.<br><br>Sorry I dont like onions<br><br>This team is actually amazing. At the beggining I never thought this was even going to become something. The team has improved alot and we're getting better and better. I love the scrims and the members in the team.&nbsp;<br><br>Before when celestial was a fairly new team I thought you were more of an average player. Since that you've been improving alot but I'd actually say that you have a long way to go which I actually do aswell. I'd say 6-7/10

I should know you as you're a popular player over this network but actually I dont. I never talk to you so I dont know your personality at all. You seem fairly nice and from what I have seen in discord you seem nice. You're a rlly good pvper but I havent seen your side of being a team-leader so I cant tell if you're good or not.
