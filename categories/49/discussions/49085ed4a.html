I've already given you my opinion in my AMA post.<br><br>Supposedly we're magically active again now that the tournament is announced.<br><br>I really don't know, it's probably a combination of decent strats and individual skill because it's definitely not practice. I also feel like there's a lack of competition because we definitely shouldn't be able to go into a tournament and win it without practicing, that would never happen in OCN.

You seem prety chill from what i know of you.<br>We're active in our team-circle and talk to eachother on a regular basis but we dont really play minecraft together often and when we do its just for fun never really scrimming, we'll probably be more active now as the tourney was announced.<br>We seem to just get stuff done, down to just team chemistry and individual plays. And credits to robos mic :)
