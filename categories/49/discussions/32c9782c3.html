Great job on being promoted and thank you very much for adding new destroy rotations I was growing restless. &nbsp;My questions : 1. Do you agree with my opinion that your face can be distracting with its beady eyes, gaping mouth, bushy eyebrows, etc. ? (I still like it tis a very detailed head with varying levels of shading). &nbsp;2. How many fidget spinners do you own?

To those people, I have to ask; what do you want me to do? Completely redo the rotation every two weeks? If we had a hundred <i>good</i> maps of each gamemode, maybe we could actually do proper biweekly rotation updates. But, there simply aren't enough maps (unless you want them to be endlessly recirculated in and out, which is just an unnecessary hassle in my opinion.)<br><b><br></b>Keep in mind that I'm talking here about&nbsp;<i>significant&nbsp;</i>rotation updates. Of course, we will still constantly maintain the rotations by removing bad maps, and possibly adding newer ones. In fact, maybe this can be we will do: Instead of having a large update every month (<i>certainly not every two weeks)</i>, we could replace maps more frequently in much smaller portions.<br><b><br></b>To definitively answer your question, the frequency of future rotation changes is currently undecided. My thoughts on the matter are described in the above two paragraphs.<br><br>If you have any questions about anything that I said in this post, feel free to message me on discord.</span>

What can I contribute? That is a difficult question. I can't think of any answers that aren't extremely obvious (such as, mod experience, mapdev knowledge, etc.) Take that as you will; I'm sorry for not providing a more detailed answer.</span>
