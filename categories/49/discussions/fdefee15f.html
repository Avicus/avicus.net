I do Other Video Games... :P<br>But seriously, I do Archery 2 and a half hours a week, 1 hour of cricket every week (Game Tomorrow, wish me luck :P) and I do this thing called Dungeon World, basically a new D&amp;D. I also do a lot of coding and stuff in my spare time, I really want to learn a lot and do game development.

[Please Ignore if this is a double post]<br>I'm definitely not happy about it, no way. I just try to stay positive and see the metaphorical 'Silver Lining'
