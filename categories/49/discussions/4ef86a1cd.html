All of them are good :D<br><br>Nexus and Nebula usually have the most people on them. Avicade has some, CTH and Elimination don't have many though. Feel free to explore everything :)

Nebula is the best and most popular gamemode, but Nexusis a very frustrating yet exciting one. Don't pay attention to people who call you a hacker in chatIf you are active on the forums, people will start to recognize you in game and say hiThe mods are very friendlyThe only pvp hack allowed is Dux Hax (inside joke)The hottest person on the server is killerbye22 (#killerbyeswag)I would recommend finding out who the good pvpers and and staying away from themfunkystudios is the owners, so if anything goes wrong, #blamefunkyDon't be afraid to sugest things on the forums, including map submissionsThere are a few bugs and glitches, along with unbalances in the server due to the recent update that need a bit of time to be fixedWatch out for and report team trollersWatch and learn from others. Good luck!

I'd say nebula, or nexus, they are both very easy to grasp onto and they are also very exciting, also when your board, play some walls, it is a fun game mode with a lot of unique kits.&nbsp;<br><br>Welcome to the Avicus Network!

In my opinion i believe that Nexus, Nebula, and CTH are the best although CTH is kinda dead and walls, eimination, and avicade are pretty fun too but go play and make your own choice<br>
