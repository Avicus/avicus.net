<b>Y</b>ou may have heard of me, but it is highly likely that you have forgotten. I'm that guy who never says the right thing at the right time and ends up being kicked in all typicality. You may even hate me. And I understand. There is a reason to hate me. I lose my cool very easily, which is, in the end, my downfall. Almost everything I do on Avicus soon merges into anger and gets me kicked. What is this anger caused by? A lack of cooperation. I express my dismay at this lack of cooperation from my teammates so often that soon, even I'm not cooperating. You are probably bored of reading this. I understand. You are probably against me. I understand. I am not a pessimist, but I hate myself. People tell me to lift my spirits up, I do, and I get labelled 'Cocky.' Which makes me hate myself even more. I play Minecraft as a way to let off steam, to forget my surroundings and endorse myself into a Magical world. The only problem is, when I do, reality catches up to me. Everybody is like they are in the real world. They are all trying to be noticed by going straight to the enemy's monument in an 'Oh so heroic' Fashion. I almost always stay behind attempting to preserve the Monument. It always ends like this: I am the only Player defending, 5 Enemies kill me and mine the Monument, I lose my cool and ask my team aggressively, "Why didn't we cooperate you idiots?" They say, "You weren't cooperating either" I rage, and I get kicked. As usual. I think, even after you reading all this, you still probably don't like me. I understand. After all. I can't play until February the 10th. I guess I deserved it.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I'm sorry. Sometimes I don't even understand myself either.<b></b>

&nbsp;It's normal except when u go too overboard with raging. It's ok to get mad that you lost though. Lol I'm going through something a bit similar to you. Just don't let anyone get the best of you and keep going :)

Do you have fun playing Minecraft? If you find it more frustrating than entertaining you're just wasting your time and defeating the entire purpose of playing the game.

This is what happened to me. Solution? Just god damn ignore it and have fun. Winning and defending isn't always fun. If you're rushing but aren't having fun, do something else. Some games I rush, others I defend, others I just kill, and others I just bridge. It depends on the situation of the game. Also, don't get so worked up about a game, especially a block game... That's what I learned.

Or be like me, have a mental breakdown, start crying, maybe hit your computer a few times and then go back to normal xdxdxd. That helps a bit as well :P

Turn your chat to commands only if you don't want to rage in the chat. That way you can let off steam but you won't be able to use the chat to do it.

A few things:<br><br>1. I was just like you some time ago, raging when my teammates weren't the brightest bunch, but eventually I learnt that they won't become any better by me raging at them.<br><br>2. I'm terms of teammate IQ, team up with some friends, or come join some of us guys on teamspeak, we don't bite I promise. That way you can have some good teamwork with some of your team at least.<br><br>3. If you're looking for a game to let off steam, try skyrim, it's a great game for bashing bandits with a sword

Not to be rude or anything :)<br><br>But you say you hate yourself? I'd like you to know my uncle has leukaemia and there is no way it can be cured as it's too late, still he lives his life normally and makes the most out of everyday. There's nothing to hate yourself about, you're blessed by God or anything you believe in. &nbsp;<br><br>It's the internet, it doesn't cooperate &lt;3

Hey, MARKSMAN. I've heard of you, I feel like you're ex staff(?). Listen, if you ever need to talk about anything, message me on skype. (JJTheGuy99) I'm really good at helping with your problems, and other stuff like that. Hating yourself... I hate myself too. &nbsp;It's really damn hard for me to keep my cool in a world of complete idiots. I know fully where your coming from, but I'm here, and I know others are here if you need help.
