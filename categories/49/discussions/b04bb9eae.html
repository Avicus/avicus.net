Hey guys, since I'm slowly coming back into the community, I thought it would be a good idea for you guys to ask me anything. I'd appreciate it if this wasn't as toxic as last time.&nbsp;<br><br>Here's some cool facts:<br>I'm 16<br>Former Moderator<br>Member of Insidia during tournament 1.<br><br>Shoot away, folks!

Fantastic question you got there, ParaSpider! Well, you see, I'm not too sure whether you heard of a software called "TeamSpeak"; however, it allows people all around the world to connect together and play. The Avicus network has it's own TeamSpeak server where a community has emerged, that's how you join the community whiles being banned. I hope you are satisfied with your answer.

Fantastic answer you got there,&nbsp;kjbsdgefawD! Well, you see, I'm not too sure whether or not you've heard of the fact that the TeamSpeak is for Avicus, the Minecraft server, which you're banned on, which also allows people all around the world to connect and play. The Avicus network, which it's modeled for, has it's own TeamSpeak server where the original community emerged and is a casual and competitive Minecraft network, which you yourself registered your forum account on.

Ah, where do I start. One of the most influential people on this network, I still can't repay you for the chance you gave me in the summer of 2014. Our relationship was always sort of confusing and weird but a large majority of it was positive. Even though we don't talk as much as before, I'm glad I could call you a friend.

Probably my best friend on the network. We've maintained a good relationship and you improved a shit load at PvP. I loved making maps with you and you dealing with my bullshit. I never seemed to give you credit for all the help you gave me which is something I regret. Awesome friend lets gooo
