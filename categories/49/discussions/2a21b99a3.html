... and I'm back!<br>After 3 months of playing a wonderful faction server, it finally reset, hence leading me to come back to the good, ol' Avicus :D<br>I'm really glad I chose to leave for a bit, it was quite a blast, and I needed a little break :3<br>I'm extremely happy to be back in this wonderful community; I can't wait to start making more montages and getting some monuments ;D<br><br>So, now that everything's up to speed, ask me anything!

Awww, thanks so much, everyone, for all the greetings! &lt;3<br><br>To answer your questions:<br><br><ul><li>My favorite type of cookie is snickerdoodle :3</li><li>The top place I would like to live is where I live right now; I'm not a big moving guy c:</li><li>I don't watch much that has to do with sports, but I'd say my favorite sports team is the Pittsburgh Steelers ^_^</li><li>My favorite thing to do in winter is to go sledding :D</li><li>No, I'm not a big fan of sports because of how stressful they are &gt;_&lt;</li><li>Dream job is quite an oxymoron, but I'm planning on either being a neurologist or engineer when I grow up c:</li><li>If I had any superpower, I'd definitely choose to be able to fly because of how exhilarating it is ^-^</li><li>My favorite sport is definitely chess if that qualifies to be a sport to you :3</li><li>Ooh, the best memory on the faction server was most likely yesterday, after the owner told everyone the server'd be restarting... The spawn was exploded, people could build everywhere in it, there were no safe spots, and there was a massive moshpit full with approximately 10 diamond god applers at a time.. You could find protection IV and god apples on the ground like they were candy. Although that was tons of fun, my all-time favorite part was blowing up my base 5 minutes until the server reset. It was freakin' awesome x3</li><li>My favorite color is a dark purple, and I still really can't think of any commonly-accepted sports to be liked by me at all xD</li></ul>
