@Violent and @Para: k<br>@Mooch and @Dooz: Gratzi &lt;3 &nbsp;Love yah too<br>@QFrog: Gillette is my last name, so I decided to do gilletteracer because I race sailboats. It was meant to be a play on words because of gillette razors. AviGill is the beginning of my favorite server and Gill to keep my identity.<br>@DaBader: I love to direct, and help people with problems over Skype.<br>@Boss: Big Boom<br>@Steven: Its pretty badass<br>@AWarrio:r Kat Daddy is a pretty Kool Kat<br>@mr_penguin: OMG, how'd you know?<br>@Ky: Sadly Iz isn't the father.<br>@Smit: its going to get pretty awesome pretty soon<br>@Ky: kthxbai<br>@Golden: Ill do yours at the bottom xD<br>@RCMP: I would rather be trampled by 100 duck sized horses. Thats a pretty memorable death.<br>@Ca:l Sì<br>@Cinammon: Once every few years I hit the gym, besides that nope xD<br>@Howsie: Sadly Avicore has ben further delayed due to some unexpected delays. It will be out in exactly 23.12 years.<br>@Maddy: I dont comprehend the intro sentence xD. But my answer will not be a no. My fav ice cream is soy vanilla with chocolate syrup.<br>@Clock: I usually make myself a killer bowl of cereal.<br>@Volt: Probably Vendadde, he's a chill guy.<br>@Quessadillas: I do in fact, I can breathe underwater forever.<br>@Murph: Finally an important question xD &nbsp; Basically directors watch over all of the server, and are ultimately in charge of making everything run smoothly. I run the community, Howsie is in charge of staff, and Ivy is in charge of EVERYTHING else. Managers are in charge of certain aspects of staff and other items of interest.

@YouFace: I assume 1 is the highest then, so I choose 1.<br>@Jake: Its magical, end of question.<br>@Rswizz: I hate the auto tune and lack of thought that goes into pop music. So I would have to say I dislike most of it.<br>@Awarrior: 1. I don't love any other games really. I like TitanFall, but I sadly don't own it. 2. I don't think it does, its not exactly official.<br>@Dark: Already answered it, its s Soy Vanilla with Chocolate Syrup.<br>@Justin: Appeal at support@avicus.net<br>@Howsie: I see that trick question. None because they all are dumb.<br>@Luca: Tigers (I was born in the year of the tiger), Ternio, Dogs.<br>@Cedar: We recently went through all ban appeals. Its possible for him to be appealed, but I can't guarantee anything.
