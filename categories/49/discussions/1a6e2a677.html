Hey everyone! What's going on? Athena back again. (my pickup line) <br><br>Firstly, I'm going to apologize for my inactivity from December until now.. I was so busy with school or schools (if I may say I was transferred several times from class to class then school to school). But then, that's me with my excuses. So I've come here to make an oath.. with you guys. Well.. instead of making it official, I'll just say it like this.. I'll stay in Avicus for good, and I won't leave.. for this summer, and the rest of the year. But hey, I didn't even have the time to play Minecraft!! It's been like ages.. <br><br>Secondly, and lastly, what did I miss? :D<br><br>Oh by the way, this is an AMA, so please, feel free to ask me anything..whether it be about my school life, or just the standard question for opinions. Let's hear it folks! Your girl, Athena has officially come back to this server.. to home, Avicus. <br><br>See you all in the server! Also, make sure to poke me on Teamspeak.. I'll be active there as well. (and by the way, can someone tell me how to register there? I keep on getting kicked.. saying that I have to be registered.. thanks.)

Heyyy Eric<br><br>Yeah..sure thing. One of the people who make up my strong memories of Avicus. You are pretty funny, insistent at times (I mean in a good way), friendly, and very devoted both to the server (and to me xD). I forgot that I added you in Snapchat..so when Rzging mentioned the shelves, I was like, how does he know that?? Well..those are my opinions, I really don't have much as we didn't spend much time together.. but I'll have more for you in my upcoming Birthday AMA. <br><br>See you in game!!!!

On teamspeak, after you get kicked go down to the several tabs, click on the "avicus" one, the bot will give you a command to type in game, that should register you on avicus

Hmm.. I don't really know much about you, but I can say a few things :D You are a pretty good PvP player (unlike me), and you sound pretty gentle like when you reply to players.. I'll be able to say more, should we play with each other more.. see you in game!
