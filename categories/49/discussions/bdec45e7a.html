Woo! Thank god I have a document for all these questions xP<br><br>1. What's your favorite color and why?<br>2. If you had one wish to benefit yourself (No donating to charity or anything), what would it be?<br>3. What do you think the meaning of existence is?<br>4. Can you easily do 56/24 in your head? (In under 10 seconds)<br>5. Is your power level over 9000?&nbsp;<br>6. If you were a food, what would you be and why?<br>7. If you were to use a common household object to fight in the zombie appocolypse (Microwave, chair, et cetera), what would it be and why?<br>8. If you could choose to be an animal and still had the power to morph back into a human any time you wanted, what would it be and why?

The person that made me love it so much has to be izjust4fun. The day I saw him, I said "I want to be just like that guy". At that time, iz was Admin on MC Zone.&nbsp;<br>3.
