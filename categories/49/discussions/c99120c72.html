<b>DaBaderMC</b>- I bought an Xbox and made my name Da Badger for whatever reason, I guess it sounded cool. I then got a minecraft account that belonged to me, and I wanted to name it DaBadger but it didn't work, so I tried DaBadgerMC, it worked, but turned out, I had a typo.<br><br><b>Pyrocumulus</b>- Wanted a cool name, looked up cool phenomenon, and found this. It's like a fiery cloud thing.<br><br><b>TheXiphias</b>-&nbsp;It means TheSwordfish I believe, I thought it looked cool, then realized I couldn't pronounce it.<br><br><b></b><b>Rapturous</b>- Looked up "cool synonyms for happy" since my IRL name means happy, and found this.<br><br><b>Gallant</b>- Originally wanted Valiant, but wasn't available.<br><br><b>Snoozin</b>- Loved this name. I love sleeping, so it fit me.<br><br><b>Excellence</b>- Sounded badass.<br><br><b>Eako</b>- Was given to me by FrostedXupcakez, and I'm not planning on changing it any time soon. :^)<br><br><br>Bonus:<br><b>NuclearDucky</b>- This was a shared account between me and my 3 siblings. Oldest brother picked the name and we all liked it. None of them really play anymore, but sister jumps on here and there.
