The player count for the server is pretty average at this point.<br>The staff team in general is pretty decent. <br>The mods are above average and the admin team is the best it's been for a while. Senior mods&nbsp;are meh.<br>Not sure about maps, I don't pay enough attention to those.<br><br>Hello anyways :)

<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Hi glitchy :)<br><br>Is the server going well? No, the server is dying. There are ~0/100 ppl on at AU times + it's hard to get the min. player count to start games at this time.<br><br>Staff team good? They/some should be more online on the server.<br><br>Map rotations good? They used to be better, many old maps got removed because they're "unfriendly for new players" :/ But we're getting new maps soon.<br></span>

Hey Glitchy. =)<br><br><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Is the server going well? Pre-Atlas we had a player count of 50 - 100 on average. Post - Altas, we have an average player account of 20 - 50. So no, it's not. xD<br></span><br>Staff team good? I can't really answer that for obvious reasons.<br><br>Map rotations good? They're decent.

Glitchy! I still listen to your quality Scotland 4ever ear rape everyday , it's the shit. <br><br>&nbsp;On a serious note: <br>The server although was going down is now stable imo <br><br>Staff team activity could be better but in terms of quality i think it's good. <br><br>Map rotations: Don't pay much attention , just play whatever is put in front of me ; which i seem to be liking.
