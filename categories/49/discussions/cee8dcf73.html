Hi Avicus I just want to introduce myself:<br>I have been playing since Sky wars was around, but just joined forums ten minutes ago. I got this server because I wanted to play the walls but Nebula is so much better, I remember that once before&nbsp;sfkwww was a JR MOD I accused him of hacking even though he wasn't. Speaking of hacking I am&nbsp;regularly accused of it but only on this server. This is my second favourite server my favourite being Minecade but they are&nbsp;extremely close, I was recently glitchy on this server when ever I tried to join it would say: "Failed to connect to the server, unexpectedly found 33 bytes in the first 0 seconds" as if I was dosed or ddosed(Weird). The final thing I would like to say about myself is I am a great sport and love having fun.<br>I hope to have a future as a staff member here on Avicus.<br><br>There are still a few things I would like to know, like to become a JR MOD are you required to buy a rank from the store.

If you can't login try older versions like 1.7.5, that should fix it.<br>Or it might be something with your internet connection or your computer.

Hi there :)<br>Mod applications are currently closed, and when they reopen you will be notified through a post on the forums. For now you can always send player reports and be active on the forums and teamspeak to better your chances.<br>Have a great day :D
