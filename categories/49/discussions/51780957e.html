Didn't get along with you a majority of the time I was on the staff team, and we never agreed on anything. I got exceedingly frustrated with incompetence or stubbornness coming from all different levels of the spectrum in the staff team when I was staff, and you somehow got caught in it. You weren't as bad as I remember, and I apologize for the rudeness. When you try to be progressive and get everything knocked out from under you (at least the entire duration of my mod+ career trying to fix things) you'd understand how I felt. You had good ideas and you were a good moderator, just needed to improve hack detection. We never really spoke but looking back on it I was exceedingly harsh on you.<br><br>You were pretty much my punching bag at the time, to be honest. You were mod at the most difficult period of time of Avicus.

You are the server's number one map creator next to Evocal. You are the most creative and absolutely hilarious person I've ever had the honor of talking with on this server. I believe we had a few disagreements, but you've always been there to lighten the mood back up. You made a lot of things more tolerable for me, and I thank you :&gt;

Unfortunately, being developers requires knowledge of how to code and most of it is beyond my ability. I'd love to be involved in the development cycle if they had a special role for helping determine what route the server is going towards.

You're third paragraph really resonated with me.<br>After being here for so long, and working so hard (on the Moderation team for me specifically)..it is very demotivating to see no progress being made.&nbsp;<br><br>So many talented people have put in so much work over the years and it feels like it's all in vain as this server keeps declining.<br><br>Also, you said somewhere in this thread that you feel you've made little real friendships with people..I just wanted to say that I've always considered you a friend :)

Oh, being a referee! Well, I've only been ref on Stratus and OCN. Haven't experienced Stratus reffing yet but it's pretty exciting :) reffing on OCN was hard because I was always assigned to Spanish teams (each time!). I am convinced they thought I spoke Spanish, lol... but I made it work. Felt weird being the oldest ref on the team and everyone getting a promotion except me, I was skipped. Was devastated when I was demoted for missing the last tournament :(

Team is in the best shape it's ever been in. I'm proud of what you've done to transform the team, because you were the last person I expected to turn it around honestly. Being a map developer has meaning and form to it now, and the only complaint I have is that we never do projects as a team except hubs. We need to make maps together, or discuss things over as a team, meetings are exceedingly rare and the progress could be much quicker with making custom gamemodes and such with what we have. If we met more, we'd have so much more success.<br><br>Wasn't aware a global team existed.<br><br>I got to know you more and I felt we connected better on a personal level once I had opened up a bit to you. I feel more comfortable around you and I have feelings that I didn't have previously, and I had misunderstood you for the most part. I'm sorry for anything mean I've said in the past.

Oh, being a referee! Well, I've only been ref on Stratus and OCN. Haven't experienced Stratus reffing yet but it's pretty exciting :) reffing on OCN was hard because I was always assigned to Spanish teams (each time!). I am convinced they thought I spoke Spanish, lol... but I made it work. Felt weird being the oldest ref on the team and everyone getting a promotion except me, I was skipped. Was devastated when I was demoted for missing the last tournament :(

Are you just a ref on Stratus or did you get one of those invites to join the Event Producer team too?

You're my favorite person to talk to on here, I trust you very much and you are one of the most loyal &amp; dedicated people I've ever seen in my life.&nbsp;<br><br>I would move to Germany in a heartbeat, and I might be visiting there frequently (one of my friend's family I've known for 10 years will be moving there back and forth due to their husband's deployment) and I look forward to being there and learning more about the language, since Germans have always fascinated me.<br><br>I feel Avicus has not seized any of the opportunities given in order to grow. The advertisement is bare bones and even though we were told again recently that advertisement is real and will happen this time- there's nothing on here to advertise. We have the same exact games that we had before on MCZone, except less, and that's not going to attract players. They left for a reason. If we can't keep people interested, there's no point in advertising and I wish this resonated with the senior staff.

Stratus is hands down the best experience I've ever had with people, mapmaking, friendships, workload, organization, consistency, and everything I could really list off that I've had struggles with other servers with in the past. Stratus might not look that big on the surface, but that's just the tip of the iceberg. They're a fantastic community with a lot of talented individuals, and there's <i><b>always &nbsp;</b></i>something being developed.&nbsp;<br><br>This, of course, isn't meant to undermine Avicus, since Avicus has been the longest time I've been staff on a server, but maybe I'm biased towards Stratus because it's a fresh &amp; unique experience. Avicus hasn't had that for a while but if we did then I'd play &amp; work here a lot more.

A promotion for every month- getting junior, mod, &amp; ref all within 3 months of each other. Wish you could've continued the rainbow and went all the way to the top. Never had any problem with you and I really liked how you worked with other staff.

Salzburg I &amp; II are my favorites, spent a lot of time on them and they're very pretty.

Didn't get along with you a majority of the time I was on the staff team, and we never agreed on anything. I got exceedingly frustrated with incompetence or stubbornness coming from all different levels of the spectrum in the staff team when I was staff, and you somehow got caught in it. You weren't as bad as I remember, and I apologize for the rudeness. When you try to be progressive and get everything knocked out from under you (at least the entire duration of my mod+ career trying to fix things) you'd understand how I felt. You had good ideas and you were a good moderator, just needed to improve hack detection. We never really spoke but looking back on it I was exceedingly harsh on you.<br><br>You were pretty much my punching bag at the time, to be honest. You were mod at the most difficult period of time of Avicus.

No need to apologise. I was the one in the wrong most of the time, so I'm hardly in a position to judge. Honestly, I don't think either of us tried to work at our full potential, though I always respected you for being so outspoken.&nbsp;<br><br>Just so you know, you're not the only one who had issues with being prevented from fixing things. See you around. :)
