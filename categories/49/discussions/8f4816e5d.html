Opinions?<br><br>And just so you know, the senior's have a lot of experience with applications and different members of the community. They made their decision because they felt you weren't ready to be a moderator. Just so you know, I got denied from moderator many times, and I used that opportunity to learn from my mistakes. I suggest you do this to. They give you reasons to improve. The staff team wants to see you succeed. If everyone posted something about their application being denied, the forums would be filled and Keenan wouldn't be able to pay the bill for the extra ram. So please, try to be mature and think about the implications of you actions before you do them. Use the reasons the senior's gave you and use it as a chance to improve. I garantee that 90% of staff got denied at least once each.<br><br>-Koja<br><br>PS - remember we are here to help you :) pm me with any other advice or questions you want or have.

Dw about your app getting denied, a lot of current moderators had their applications denied before they finally got accepted/referred.<br><br>So just apply again next time and try to improve on the points the seniors denied you on.
