I don't really know where to start this off but my time on here has been awesome, or, at least until I got falsebanned... But that doesn't matter and I can't do anything about it. I know some of you, or maybe alot of you may find me annoying, Im fine with that. You're usually nice to those who're nice to you back so yea.&nbsp;<br>Anyways, for those who actually did like me Im sorry to leave. You may see me around forums and ts and discord but that wont be as often. If you want to talk to me or contact me you can do it here:&nbsp;<br>Discord: Ciyh#4803<br><br>Im not really sure what to say, I've really enjoyed my stay and there are some people that I want &nbsp;to thank a little extra.<br><br><ul><li>Ted</li><li>Rocky</li><li>Lokigh</li><li>Totte</li><li>Celestial</li><li>Patrikano</li><li>poofy</li><li>Mongul</li><li>Nemo</li><li>Borrah</li><li>Clijmart</li><li>C4ncer</li><li>Xtra</li><li>Tintin</li><li>Jonathan</li><li>dev_revs</li><li>Mucky</li><li>Phil</li><li>Mep</li><li>Cian</li><li>Bro</li><li>Prodigy</li><li>Alpp</li><li>KomodoLord123CarryGod1</li><li>Merp</li><li>Ghost</li></ul>I probably missed quite alot of people.&nbsp;<br><br>Anyways, for everyone who still plays this server I wish you the best and I really hope Avicus can get a bright future with well experienced staff.<br><br>Thanks and Goobye!

&lt;3 Now how are we gonna lose on foundry in 30 seconds? Jk:)<br>You were always a nice person to me. False bans always happen. I believe if you keep trying to get unbanned you will. Maybe this is a chance for you to leave avicus, then maybe minecraft. I wish you wouldn't get banned. Good luck in life, we will still keep in touch!
