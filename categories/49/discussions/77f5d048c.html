I had one on the old website so I might as well make a new one. &nbsp;<br><br>Hello. I'm higger. I'm still pretty new to this whole Avicus shabang, but not to MC pvp. I played on OCN for two years and kinda got tired of it. There were words of another server, one like OCN, and I decided to venture out and see what it was like.&nbsp;<br><br>I love Avicus. What can I say? Although it has seen better days, it's something new to me and that's all that matters. I like the maps, very good for bow practice. I also&nbsp;<i>love</i> the community.&nbsp;<br><br>In my first two weeks of being here, I was accepted into two established teams. The first was the 12th Coalition (RIP in peace Nutella), and the second was the Rage INC build team. Both teams have the nicest people who are super fun to play, fight, and build alongside.&nbsp;<br><br>Finally, ask me some questions. I like it when people do that. :)<br><br>I may see you on Nebula most of the time, and occasionally on Teamspeak, when I have more privacy. Avicus is really cool, and there is something about the way my first AMA brought emoticons of smiling faces and big capital "Welcome!"'s with fifty exclamation points that made me like it. I may just stick around. ;)<br><br>~higger

Definitely Yogscast, but I have dabbled in Tobuscus, but I hate the aftertaste of Smosh.
