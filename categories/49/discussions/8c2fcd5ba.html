Hello,<br><br>I'm PieZ, or Kyle if we are going with formalities and welcome to my yearly AMA thingy. Over the past year I have been promoted to Ref, Official, Slack admin and moderator after retiring for 3-4 months. In real life I have been going to college for Broadcasting Radio where I would probably spend most of my time in the week. I am known as a mentor for certain moderators as well as a very honest person about my opinions, even if they don't seem to match what the server is looking for. kk bye.

You are the best senior (Out of a very inactive team of senior mod team). but your leadership needs some work. I find that when discussing problems with you say with the Map Developers you start blaming others instead of trying to find a solution. Other than that you are a very talented builder of maps as well.

</div>
2 main reasons why.<br><br>1. People were messaging me to come back because I am usually on when staff are not at a point in the day<br><br>2. (This one might be a bit of a bad reason to return) It is no secret that there are people in the staff team that I do not agree with nor can I say I like their character. I do know I have a temper when dealing with people that I do not like. I wanted to improve on my temper while transitioning into the real world where I deal with people I don't like all the time.

There were huge reasons why I wanted you on the staff team. Really you were the only Spanish person who was not salty and had the requirements to be a moderator at a time we needed Spanish moderators. You have time and time again proved your leadership skills to me and I have a lot of pride to say I was the one that introduced you to the moderator team.

I think you have grown the most out of all the moderators in terms of leadership and being a good mod.

Haven't seen you really as a referee since I became an official with no tournaments happening and all. Learn from your mistakes is the best thing I can tell you<br><br>Someone (Do not remember the username but they claimed to be Gonzo's girlfriend and posted a lot on the forums about it) went into the OCN forums and started declaring war on OCN saying that if both servers went into a DTM match Avicus would win no problem. I laughed, checked out the server and made a inflammatory post on the forums about the idiotic nature of the forums and defenders and left for 3 months until I tried out for competitive part of the server with Immortality and soon Immunity (Now PPB or Team Allah). Senex was the first map I ever played.

Right now I am on the sidelines a bit learning how the senior team does certain activities and soon after when I feel comfortable I will be pitching some ideas out. I would like to see some change on how the staff team works behind the scenes, fix up some organization problems and try to interact with the community more to make the seniors feel that they are not some people high in the mountains that no one can talk to. <br><br>I find you can be mature and the voice of reason in some cases and immature in others. What annoys me is that sometimes you do not try to see the other point in arguments are and laugh at time calling them stupid without going into reason why you do not believe it is a bad reason or even knowing why people think this way.
