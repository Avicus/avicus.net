Did I say that? Get on topic and stop flaming.<br>This thread was made by AmbiBOT and it's his AMA. If you would like to watch again who's the creator of the post you can see it by the first post on the thread, instead of accusing me of making this thread? First, calm yourself and don't try to flame. Then, after you are calm, watch the creator of the thread which is AmbiBOT, and not me. Thanks.
