Hi! Im MisteryCAB<br>i really like avic.us... so i would like to be a mod!<br>I can speak English perfectly.. and i can also speak spanish! because im from Argentina &lt;3<br>I think it might be a good moderator because it could understand what the people who speak Spanish says!...<br>I'm not very active because I had a problem with internet..but now I already solved the problem and I can play avic.us every day!<br>I play minecraft for 3 years and I consider myself a very good fighter (in PVP )<br>Also ... I have a channel with 250 subs ... and those subs could enter the server and be active members of the community :) [&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.youtube.com/Theneocraft1">www.youtube.com/Theneocraft1</a>&nbsp;]<br>I was a mod of many servers, so now I know how to make this work!<br><b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;[Personal Information]<br></b><b>Name: MisteryCAB (Gabriel Ramos)<br></b><b>Age:now I have fifteen (15) years<br></b><b>Interest:Minecraft and youtube<br></b><b>Playtime: like 8 hours (or more) every day...<br>languages:English And Spanish&nbsp;<br><br></b>

Another thing, players aren't ranked to Jr. Moderator based on PvP skill.<br>Just make sure that you have a good application and are confident speaking, and you will do just fine.

Good luck in the future. I'm looking forward applying too. (By the way, my stats don't say anything, &nbsp;I joined waaaaay before this summer, they just reset :/) Anyway, I'll try to look into my infractions, I think I need to control are myself a bit before applying. &nbsp;<br>Also, you should know that applications are not open right now, and some people already told you above. Whilst applying make sure you don't lie and such, that will most likely not help you.<br>My main language is also Spanish, so nice to meet someone that speaks the same language as me. c:

The native language on Argentina is spanish, normal people like me start studying and trying to speak english at the age of 12, so imagine that we have only 3 years understanding english, how much time did it take to you to learn perfectly your OWN language?

Well yeah, but maybe he just should help a bit around, being nice and helpful instead of asking directly "for mod". Not trying to be rude or anything, I totally like this guy, but when I want to be a mod on a server I just don't say I want to be one although I try. &nbsp;Just my opinion about that.

He is not directly asking for a moderator position. He is new to the forums (from what I infer), and he did not know how to application system works.<br>As MissCarmel said, this was just a simple mistake.
