I felt like I had to disconnect myself from technology, social media and everything. There are times when I want to but i just needed a break so I'm really sorry for not replying.&nbsp;<br><br>With regards to my opinion on you. Eric you genuinely are one of the nicest most genuine people I've met online. I remember my first days on Avicus where you'd get triggered by me playing defensively and me calling it "strategic" lol. To be honest I initially thought you were one of those unnecessarily toxic people that think theyre the bees knees for being toxic but of course as i got to know you I realised it was all in good fun, for the most part anyway haha. Getting to know you, I respected you more and more as you werent afraid to voice your opinion. Although I didnt expect anyone to, you cared and supported me through my situation. All in all youre a real down to earth guy. Oh also youre a pretty skilled mineman haha

Hey Rilo!<br>Damn I really didn't realise that I disconnected myself from yoy when I got Senior. Looking back at it I guess I became less active in game as a whole which may be the main cause for it. Hope you didnt think I was some elitist SrMod or something haha.<br><br>As for my opinion, I'm not going to be giving opinions to people as a player because I feel like i have moved past that stage and really believe that opinions on how good someone is at a game is hardly a definition of who they are (lowkey highkey that got deep xd). But anyway, Rilo, in the time that I've known you you've been an extremely chill person. You were a great person to talk to at like 3am my time when I decided that mineman pvp was more important than sleep xd. You always seemed enthusiatic about everything, whether competitive or just chilling on public or on Hypixel. You're always a good laugh that doesnt person my eardrums at 4 in the morning so thats a plus. I've never been known as a 'squeaker' so I wouldnt know what it was like but trust me, I've heard worse, and your accent is sexy af. Anyway yeah I'm rambling at this point xd. To conclude, u r c00l! Pce out

Wassaaaaaaap dude.<br><br>Maaaate I am loving university. I'm really damn glad that my situatio didnt set me back much at all, particularly during my first year of uni. Met a lot of really cool guys that really share the same personalities and outlook on life as I do so I'm loving that. It makes the next 4 years of university sound half tolerable xd<br><br>Nope! But yeah we gucci&nbsp;<br><br>I may be Irish and eat potatoes but at least the delivery costs to here arent double the price of the item I want to buy (cough cough mic cough cough)<br><br><br>I really do not wanna ramble on with my opinion on you forever because lets be realistic I genuinely could so I'm gonna try to limit myself. Youre such a nice guy. Theres no other word. Youre funny, hilarious in fact, youre actually not as, as you would say "retarded" as you say you are, youre genuine, optimistic, and you speak your mind. Youre one of the people that I met through Minecraft that I felt I could open myself up to and talk about IRL problems that bugged me, and Id like to think you could do the same with me. Once people realise that your toxicity is all bants youre a very loveable dude. You make light of every situation, I respect that so much! And yes, youre #underrated babes
