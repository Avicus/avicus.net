Good player, mature at times but you can be very immature on TS and stuff but it's minecraft so I don't really care. We used to be brothers and had so much in common but we've drifted a lot after Insidia but I still like to call you a friend eyyy

A friend I respect a lot. You're a really nice guy whom I enjoy taking to. I<br>we had beef before Mutilation, but that's all gone now. You're a really top tier player who got treated unfairly with Grim. You have great comms and I think a leader in the making. In glad to call you a friend.

As a person you were extremely toxic to me for a long damn time. You attacked me at every opportunity which was unneeded. But, you made an apology post which I still don't know whether to accept but you seem to be alright now.<br><br>Good player with a sword, can't remember the last time we fought and.talented objective player.

A lot of reasons. The team was filled with OCN players who couldn't give a shit about Avicus, timezones were fucked up which made us really inactive. No one was hungry to win and basically the team only looked good on paper.

Im so glad I picked you up for Camel because you are such an underrated player. You're a bit shy in scrims but that's okay, you'll grow out it soon (hopefully). I still don't understand how you weren't in any top tier teams. Your play style is similar to Spooks with a lot of potential so ye, gg
