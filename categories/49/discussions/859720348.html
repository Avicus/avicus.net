Hi to all that read this. I'm spanish player that get banned from [Removed] for do nothing. I decided to leave minecraft, but i know that avicus can give me all the things that overcast network gives to me. And also i have so me question about the server:<br><br>- There are here any tournament or special event?<br>- There are spanish players active on avicus?<br>- And for the end, how i can help in this server, beacuse i think that all the staff is english and if there are some spanish players, they need a mod that helped him in their native languaje, and i have experience on some servers and matured.<br><br>Thanks for see this, regards =D

<br>There are tournaments, just not nearly as often as OCN.<br>There may be a few Spanish players, but I wouldn't call it a community.<br><br>There's no point in deleting something that wasn't breaking any rules, dooz.

Welcome to Avicus! The best way to help is to just make a map! You can submit maps at the forum post Map Releases!
