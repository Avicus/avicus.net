<b></b><span><b>Does your mouse work okay?</b><br>Mostly- it's cord broke about half way through last year, which is unfortunate because logitech products are high end and the chances of a malfunction are low. I did not have a receipt, so I couldn't take it back to the store I bought it from, I could've contacted&nbsp;Logitech&nbsp;because they have amazing customer support, but&nbsp;didn't&nbsp;particularly&nbsp;feel like it so instead bought a soldering iron.<br><br>I got a cord from another&nbsp;Logitech&nbsp;mouse, opened up my mouse, cut the cord&nbsp;on both mice and soldered the respective wires inside each together. This fixed the problem of the broken cord, but then sprouted the problem of me&nbsp;accidentally&nbsp;breaking a ribbon cable that connects to&nbsp;the three thumb buttons on my mouse, and&nbsp;accidentally&nbsp;using&nbsp;the wrong sized screw driver and wearing down 3 of the main screws on the mouse. Problem now is that I have A) no functioning thumb buttons, but the side buttons next to my left click work fine and I use those for dpi changing, and B) the base of my mouse at the front occasionally&nbsp;separates&nbsp;from the top due to the lack of screws, which&nbsp;makes&nbsp;clicking&nbsp;harder but is easy to fix, by simply pressing them&nbsp;together and only happens once a month or so. I also removed the teflon feet during repairs and havn't yet replaced them but they dont reall impact much other than getting the occasional hair in the sensor. Here's a pic of the bottom of the mouse.<img alt="" src="http://imgur.com/SOnViki.jpg"><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></span>

Probably anyone on the internet that were to die suddenly. The fact that they one day might stop responding without any explanation is disturbing to me.
