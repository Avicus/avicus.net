<div><b>What is your IGN and team?</b> Muharnmad/InBlox/InLoc and my team is Bulldogs/PureDogs.</div><div><br></div><div><b>How many tournaments have you participated in?</b> This will be our first avicus tournament!</div><div><br></div><div><b>Any team in particular you'd like to face off against?</b> Apollo. I'm curious how we would do against them because I see them as a benchmark for invitational-level teams.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Any team you don't want to face off against?</b> Not really. I guess I just don't want to be up against anyone that no-shows. It's really disappointing to get 8 players and think you're about to play only to find out the other team didn't show up.</div><div><br></div><div><b>How do you think you'll do this time around? </b>I expect we will definitely make invitationals. The goal is to reach the finals, maybe win them.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Any teams you have a rivalry with? </b>Not really. I guess the closest thing would be Team Allah because their roster is pretty similar to yirang (on OCN) and ours is pretty similar to PureBlox, and those two teams had a little bit of a rivalry.</div><div><br></div><div><b>What do you think is your team's best strength, and your best strength alone?</b> I think our best strength is our pvp. Mine is probably that I know everyone on the team and their abilities, so it should be pretty easy to lead them.</div><div><br></div><div><b>What do you think is your team's worst weakness, and your worst weakness alone? </b>A lot of us haven't played since OCN shut down, so communication and rotations might not be super easy. Mine personally is that when my team is losing I play too recklessly and overall a little worse.</div><div><br></div><div><b>What have you done to prepare? </b>We've played a couple scrims, hopefully some more before the tournament.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Anything you'd like to say to your opponents?</b> Woof</div>
