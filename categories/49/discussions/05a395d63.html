To be honest, you are not my favorite person and you cause unneeded trouble. But you have good sides like organizing scrims and stuff. Just a little advice, don't continue to break the rules...

<div><b>Opinions?</b></div>You are a cool guy! I like that you are active on slack and always try to bring yourself in. Sadly I don't interact with you that often ..<br><br><b>How do you practice your english?<br></b>Mainly through avicus and school. Actually the reason why I know that much English today is avicus. It introduced me to the "English web". Before I only visited website that were in German, now I only use site that are in English.

<b>Opinions on me?<br></b>A true leader! At first I was kind of pissed about your replies on the forums about the staff team, but after we talked a bit about the community&amp;staff meeting idea, I liked you. As you joined the staff team I was still a bit skeptic but after some time you opened my eyes. There were major flaws and you pointed them out, you never tried to sugarcoat it, just the straight facts. To be honest you are one of the reasons why I decided to search for flaws and speak up. I'm looking up to you and I'll continue to do so. Please be how you are!<br><b><br>What direction do you want the staff team to go?<br></b>It should go in a more chill direction. Right now there are policies for everything and one mistake means that you have to worry about a staff warn. When I was promoted to junior everyone had fun. We trolled each other and stuff. Now it's kind of frowned to do so. The gap between the senior staff and the mods is growing bigger, at least that's how I see it.<br><br><b>How is being Slack Owner?<br></b>It's not that different to being an admin, but you get some pretty nize perms :D It's still fun to be an admin.<b><br></b>

Well, it's a good system, each state has it's own "government" but they still have to listen to the overall government.

<div><b>Opinions on me?<br></b>To be quite honest I hated you when I wasn't a staff member, I thought you were annoying, but I have to say your maps were good. Well, since you joined the staff team I got to know you better and I have to admit you are a pretty chill guy. It's nize to talk to you :D<br><b><br></b></div><div><b>Reactions when you first became a staff member?<br></b>I was hyped AF and still shaking because of the interview. I wasn't really confident that I did it, but in the end I passed the interview stage. I had to take a shower because of the sweating xD</div>

<b>Out of Avicus, who do you think is the most addicted player? (Who do you think plays the most on Avicus)<br></b>Wow, I have no idea. According to the games tab I would say _Vouch.&nbsp;<br><b><br>Who is the most active forum user next to Blaze?<br></b>Straight out of my head, I choose you!<br><b><br>Do you believe that you can make it to Sr. Mod?<br></b>Nope, with the current system and seniors I'll always be a moderator. Maybe that's a good thing, it's more fun and you are closer to the community :D<br><br><b>Will you ever retire/when do you think you will retire as a moderator?<br></b>Of course I will retire at some point, don't want to wait for my demotion. I hope I still enjoy minecraft in the next year or until my 17th birthday. We'll see :D<br><b><br>Opinions?<br></b>You were always a friendly person, at least how I see it, but in the last time you were pretty annoying, especially the controversial forum topics. Well you got punished and therefor it isn't that important anymore. I loved to talk to you on TS, I should be able to come on again xD<b><br></b>
