&nbsp; &nbsp;Hi, i'm David. I've played on Avicus for a while now but didn't know that it had a forum until recently. I just wanted to introduce myself and say hi to all of the members of the forum and let everyone know that the player report section is about to get spammed with all of the new threads (from me :D). I have noticed a lot of hacking client users on the server lately and how they can be very annoying to the innocent players who just want to have fun. I plan to rid of these players from the server and scare future players from hacking or using hacks. I think the odds of winning should be even between players instead of being unbalanced. I would be grateful if a few individuals would help me to reach my goal.

So... I heard rumors that there was another David around here... those rumors also told me that he loves bacon <i>faaar</i> more than I do. How dare he come and undercut my bacon-loving madness?!<br><br>Lol, just kidding! Welcome to the Avicus Network, glad to meet you! :D
