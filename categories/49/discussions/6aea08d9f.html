- I decided to come back because I felt like I was missing something in my life. (As lame as that sounds) I decided to put a lot of effort into league of legends and soon reliezed that I wasn't playing games for fun anymore and I was playing them just to win at something. Same for CSGO.<br><br>- I quit because the game just got boring at the time. When I came back, I did'nt do much but I was rushed with 3 ish years of memories.
