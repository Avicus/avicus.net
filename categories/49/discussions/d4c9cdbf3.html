It'a hilarious when you take a dump on people with this name.&nbsp;<br><br>You're pretty cool, a piss-off (or as the English would say, a piss-take) like I am. Sometimes you don't know when to stop, regardless of whether you're fucking with someone or not and it puts you in shitty situations with people.&nbsp;<br><br>I've used like two a year or more ago.

Chill, nice guy. Good player, but a bit quiet in scrims. My main issue with you as a player is that you rarely comm and a lot of communication is needed in 5v5 scrims (which we are forced to play a lot of the time).

Believe it or not, I think you're pretty chill from when we talked in TS. I don't really want us to have a bad standing because you actually seem like someone I'd bother talking to more. To clear things up, I literally said to Lego over Skype PM that there was a possibility of you cheating, but I was on my phone so I couldn't confirm anything or say anything for certain. I later looked through the video later on my PC and it looked fine in terms of autoclicking. I never accused you. That is complete bullshit and Lego escalating things far past what they were. I'd be happy to pull up logs if you don't believe me. just add me on jackson.stim.

You used to kb modify pretty blatantly, but I can't really say you cheat now. I haven't really looked into you as you aren't particularly sketchy. You've always been alright with me in TS and you seem to have really good game sense and are a smart player. You're the same as most of Apollo IMO, chill and nice individually, but extremely arrogant and cancerous together (with exceptions of a few players like zero).&nbsp;<br><br>TGC days were so bants and I loved it. I remember when Lego only used to TNT run on SSB and it gave me a chance to get into contact with the EU community on Avicus.

I think you're a really nice guy and fun to speak to on TS. Can still be a bit immature, but I like you. Yeah you meme, but you aren't really cancer. You've improved miles as a player without, at least, using something really blatant (I automatically doubt everyone is legit given this community, so don't take it as an accusation) and that deserves some respect.

Super chill and funny on TS. I really like playing with you and chatting with you. You're relaxed attitude also helps stop every person on our team playing from tilting as well, which is invaluable. You're quite a good player, but you need to improve at melee a bit.<br><br>Cyclops, BmB, Loo, Applez (if he was active), Cyclones, DaGoldBrick, wylt, Moro (insane strats and very good player). Some people I played with in DS were absolutely amazing players, but they didn't shine much due to inactivity.<br><br>Since I'm a newer player:&nbsp;<br>Epsilpha, Cyclones, Loo, DaGoldBrick, Applez, wylt, Kyle, Moro (his strats literally could almost single-handedly get him on). The people on this roster are all really cool, have some good memes and can be serious when we want to win games

I'll copy my post from slack:&nbsp;<br><br>"Hey guys, same as vo, I'm retiring (only temporary), but not because of Michael. I was thinking of retiring for a while, and now I have. I don't feel like moderating and I feel like moderating has become a burden rather than an enjoyment. &nbsp;Only things I were really sticking around for were perms and banning cheaters. I'm taking a break to reinstate interest. I like being staff, but I just don't want to bother with the bullshit that has been happening for a while in the staff team. I kinda want to wait and see how the staff team evolves and hopefully improves, then come back. Thanks for the opportunity to be staff, but at this point I feel more like a burden than an asset. Keep an open mind to Michael becoming senior, honestly I'm half-half on it. Congratz to all the recent additions to the mod team. When OCN players come around, we really need to step it up to get players and hook them. We can do this and if you ever need help with hack detection, I'll gladly help. My Skype is jackson.stim if you guys ever need anything. Peace and thank you all for making this an amazing roller coaster of a ride.'

I like chatting with you in TS and you're chill, but you showed a lot of signs of bias and quite frankly were an awful manager due to the way you tried to manipulate and lie to people. You were a good mod before that and at this moment in time, that is where I'd like you to stay. One of the main reasons I said I'd rather not have you back was because of how you [and Sli] literally lied to the entire staff team and some of the community as to what I said about a player's appeal, and that really isn't someone or something I wanted back. I really hope you prove me wrong and the mentor team and clean up your act.

Tl;dr&nbsp;<br>I kinda got tired of the bullshit of the staff team and the drama. I'm not really interested in pubs on the server atm and want to wait until the staff team changes a bit before I return.<br><br>Michael is one of those changes. I think was a good addition now since he won't have the same power as before. Peachy is his puppet tbh and since he was admin at the time, Michael kind of abused that to get his way in the staff team last go.&nbsp;<br><br>In 1.8 specifically, when someone is autoclicking their swing pattern/sword animation changes. In 1.8 the animation for hitting nothing is the same as for hitting a player. In 1.7, your pattern changes when you start hitting a player. Basically if you autoclick, you sword swing pattern behaves and interacts like the 1.7 animation, with the animation even being very similar to 1.7's. People don't realize it, but it's actually really blatant when you autoclick in 1.8.

you've got a lovely personality, but you probably do get taken advantage of because of it and you're only good because you don't take kb

You can be really nice and mature at times, but also be immature and childish at others.

Cool person, trustable, loyal, but also stubborn. The stubbornness I can relate to and I see a few of the traits you showed in myself. You got pretty impatient after a while and I really don't blame you, I got the same way after the incredulous amounts of bullshit that happened within the staff team. It's easier like this tbh.

To come across as randies on a frenchie server and do 2v2s together and basically pull a Kiro.<br><br>(Kiro was a shared account between multiple top-tier pot pvpers which were Verzide and Kyzuko that randomly started shitting on everyone in lot PvP including people like Stimpy, Dualzz or even Drummer, so pulling a Kiro is basically making people think you're a randie and then shit on them).

Basically I changed my name to something randy first because Splade and I were planning to do it for a while now and I said fuck it. It's just kinda funny when you faceroll people or do well with a name like SuperGiraffe66 or Nerdygirl29. Makes people call you out a lot and it tilts them pretty hard.&nbsp;<br><br>Entire reason was to piss people off tbh.
