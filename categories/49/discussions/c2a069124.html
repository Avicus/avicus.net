Hey guys! Today I have my introduction :D<br><br>I started back in September or October when it was MC Zone. When Avicus came out, I was initially impressed. However, it was still on 1.6 and I was too lazy to change it just for Avicus.<br>&nbsp;<br>Finally it came for 1.7. I played off and on to go on another server. I still played a lot. Finally, I left for a while. I played on this "other server" for a while and didn't come on. By then, I had gotten bored of Avicus.&nbsp;<br><br>I finally made a forum account in March. I asked a couple questions about Avicore and made a few posts. I still checked the forums every once and a while, but little-to-none played in-game.<br><br>Finally, the announcement came out with the date. I returned after that and played. RIGHT before the update went through I purchased Gold.<br><br>To this day, I have made over a 100 posts on here. I recently got Emerald and am trying to become closer to the community. I hope you guys enjoyed! Also, feel free to ask me anything as long as it is not too personal and is appropriate.
