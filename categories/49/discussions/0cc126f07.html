You're a good player who cares quite a bit about his K/D. As a person, I don't know you as well as we have only talked a few times xd But you certainly seem like a decent person.

Well, i see it certainly still here. I don't know if we would still be in the same boat or a bit better off. If all goes to plan then i certainly see it in a good position, nothing like it use to be but better off than right now. I'm going to try and stay here for as long as possible, so hopefully in a years time I'll still be here.

Thanks<br><br>Well on Competitive Minecraft it's certainly one of the more hidden aspexts when you think of Minecraft, usually you assosiate Minecraft with Blocks xD But it's fun as hell lol<br><br>In regards with Avicus, increasing Competitiveness to me is to fix the hit detection, the knockback and about every other glitch on this server. This in itself will be a tremendous task, but it's doable. I personally think that, right now, Avicus is a half way point for Compeittive Minecraft. It's inbetween OCN and Mineplex (LOL), it's like for people who are new to the competitive scene and want to start playing seriously but don't have enough experience to play competitive minecraft on netowrks like OCN.<br><br><br>I love Pizza XD (The food, not the senior moderator)<br><br>Ah well i can't really remember xD You seemed like a decent guy and a good candidate for moderator. Well now that i know you a bit more i know that my hunch that told me you would be a good moderator was right.<br><br>Team Allah

Thanks<br><br>Well on Competitive Minecraft it's certainly one of the more hidden aspexts when you think of Minecraft, usually you assosiate Minecraft with Blocks xD But it's fun as hell lol<br><br>In regards with Avicus, increasing Competitiveness to me is to fix the hit detection, the knockback and about every other glitch on this server. This in itself will be a tremendous task, but it's doable. I personally think that, right now, Avicus is a half way point for Compeittive Minecraft. It's inbetween OCN and Mineplex (LOL), it's like for people who are new to the competitive scene and want to start playing seriously but don't have enough experience to play competitive minecraft on netowrks like OCN.<br><br><br>I love Pizza XD (The food, not the senior moderator)<br><br>Ah well i can't really remember xD You seemed like a decent guy and a good candidate for moderator. Well now that i know you a bit more i know that my hunch that told me you would be a good moderator was right.<br><br>Team Allah
