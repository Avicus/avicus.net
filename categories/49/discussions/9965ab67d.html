When you grow older you will understand<br><br>I'm going to a coolio restaurant today, im celebrating with family tomorrow, and with friends on saturday<br><br>I've heard &nbsp;a lot of people talk about how you are a bad staff. i could agree with their points, but nonetheless i think youre a good staff member and you do your job properly. other than this, youre a nice person to talk to on teamspeak from time to time. i think youre spiderman because you were bitten by 20 of those you probably eat them after you catch them as well i dont even wanna know.

One of best friends alltime. We speak a LOT less nowadays which saddens me cause we don't have our retarded times together like long ago, where we come to talk not just for scrim, where we just play hypixel or fuck around and do fun shit. i truly miss those times, but i guess you are a lot busier than you used to be :-(<br>I love your personality, although you have your shit sometimes but so does everyone. You are very straightforward which i like and would like to see in a leader, and you are very confident and not too serious. i wish you were more active in apollo, i think you could make a great leader. As a player you are very good at sword but on the other hand..... we can say you will not be a hanzo main.<br><br>Chocolate &amp; Oreo<br><br>Dove something<br><br>i dont have one now, but buy one and we will use it together

I used to speak to you lots in last summer, which was quite fun. youre a fun guy to play with but sometimes you can really get on my nerves and be quite annoying as well. youre a laggy fuk and its hard to fight you, and you learnt how to abuse your bad ping in a way that no one is used to fight against, and i believe its a big part of your playstyle.<br><br>NO<br><br>Cool and good

Hands down best friend overall in all my online time. You're the person i enjoy speaking the most to along with ryan, i can trust you with anything. as one that gets memed quite a load, i feel bad for meming you sometimes and &nbsp;i can be very insultive sometimes and i dont think you deserve it. youre not a ginger i know for sure yet i still believe deep in my heart you are. i love you lots, i love playing with you, laughing with you, and doing everything with you. i want us to keep being friends for long after you quit minecraft sooner or later and us to stay in touch.<br><br>~4<br><br>i think we already went over the fact i AM your doggo<br><br>Apollo for friends, wang gang for scrimming activity<br><br>I hATE pizzas for some reason on the other hand i cant imagine living my life with shnitzels not being existent.

HELLO AND THANK YOU<br><br>You used to be the most active person ever I have ever seen apart from myself; you were on all the time which made me get closer and closer to you. i could call us good friends by that point. if you had a mic and could speak id guess we would be even closer. i used to talk with you about irl shit and you really helped me get through some times last summer, so im thankful for that<br><br>I enjoy plaiyng and meming with you. the fact that you got 0% game sense as an offender (sorry :P) makes it so fun to meme with you on not serious scrims<br><br>Stratus is a much better server overal. the only problem is they are only compatible with 1.7, the pvp mechanics are still 1.9, and with people with bad ping like me it lags and makes the pvp minecraft experience very shit. however they made an eu recently and i get around 80ms which is great for me so im gonna see ;d

HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!!<br><br>opinions? Favourite shnitzel?
</blockquote>
</div>
THANK YOU KO JAPAN !!!!<br><br>Very friendly guy. recently started getting pretty close to you as you have joined Apollo. you are underrated as a player i feel - people dont seem to appreciate your performance well in scrims good enough and i believe its a crucial part of evolving as a player and a trial especially - is being given positive feedback when you do good. So if you do feel like this, im letting you know youre improving quickly and youre in the right way. some tips would be to comm a little more, listen to callouts and stuff. you take feedback well so i expect you to improve upon that ;)<br>As a person i relate to you so much cause of the same sort of parents we have and just in general. i enjoy talking and laughing with you and i hope we can remain friends :D<br><br>My favorite shnitzel is the one my grandma make, or the one they sell from "Mamounia Blue Castle"

One of &gt;&gt;BEST FRIENDS&lt;&lt; u happy now shitter :D<br>You are the most similar person to me on here that i know and i think thats why we became good friends<br>We share the same sense of humour, same role in game, same kind of playstyle, and some other things.<br>It can be annoying sometimes too because that creates lots of arguements between us since we both cant take a meme sometimes D: but im trying my best !<br>also as a player i think youre a fucking god at offense and pvp. i always enjoyed playing with you. im happy that i vouched you into apollo and see what player we made you. i think you could easily play for a team like team allah/darn like you always wanted. i always felt bad for you when you made lfts on OCN, since you have the same skill level as top teams but the fact that you're from avicus always got your reputation fucked, which saddended me.&nbsp;<br>As a person i love talking to u ur on everyday and we fuck around everywhere and do our memes and shit and i hope i go to delware one day and meet luigi i love the damn cat he's really fit.

yes, when you grow older you will understand, young boy.<br><br>nice guy. youre funny sometimes and its nice :) youre a cool leader. youre confident in what you say. although your team was not anywhere close to top tear, i still joined, without really knowing that magnace (at that time my friend from spectre) will be there. i made some lfts before, and you always suggested me to join and i always declined looking for another offer. i decided to join for the tm, and we did really well ;)<br>im also happy cause i got close to mag and lorys from that team, and now we're pretty good friends<br>i believe i did good in the tourney and i enjoyed playing with u guys, ill hop on ur discord sometimes and u can always msg me to sub ;)<br><br>never been to there, heard its a nice looking country with nice nature. if youre asking because your'e german it's weird cause i was sure you are dutch :o)<br><br>I like lots of genre's range from EDM to Folk to House really anything. i just like specific songs so i cant really tell :p

Thank you<br><br>Nice guy, improving quickly player. You're very cocky and annoying to other people most of the time. You're also attention seeking a lot, and I hate the fact you constantly bitch about being banned, even if it's a meme, just appeal it and wait honestly<br>To me personally you were nice for some reason. You also support my channel and my videos and i appreciate that

Nice kid. i think you dont really deserve all the hate u get for being a shit player i think most of it is a meme in all honesty i joke about it too but youre a good player now rather than what a year ago or something. I used to talk to you on ts, we dont do that anymore :c youre a good player though and youre always up for a scrim, except when u bamboozle us fuck u :(<br><br>Squadcat is a good team with very nice roster. iirc this isnt very similar to the ocn squadcat, correct me if im wrong. it just looks from 3rd pov that u guys are very unorganized &nbsp;for some reason, like your main leader mukmuk black man comes only for the tournies and some other people played in the group b matches that ive never seen scrim at all. you guys are p good though and i wish you good luck in the semis/whatever round you are going to play :)<br><br>Yes, once and i dont wanna do that again

Very good friend. we share kind of same sense of humour. youve been the best official on the team for long, despite some retarded &amp; biased decisions and i think you'd agree with me now since you've retired. Similar to posighdun's admin situation - you were not the best official, but no one could do it better than you.<br>As a friend as i said i enjoy talking to you although you're almost never on anymore. i love meming with you and just talking in general about stuff. in the past ive helped you out a lot as much as you have helped me. i appreciate the fact you found me some work to do for your server and the rewards i get :)<br>I hope you can become active again as i miss talking to you regulary :(

Thanks !<br><br>Super nice guy. maybe too nice (i mean you need to be harsh sometimes). i think you are good at what you do, and by that i mean is being staff. but i dont think you are very decisive and confident enough to be higher rank, which is also fine. youre one of kind of people that if i were admin, if leave you at moderator and not promote any higher cause you are at the sweetspot imo, i mean you wouldnt do better any higher and you still need good people at the role of mod.<br>as a player youve been at some teams before but i dont think, or at least it doesnt seem like youre very focused niether interested at the comp scene atm<br><br>I dont believe there are people at the mod team who are, or were (as lft and bader got recently promoted) ready for the role of senior. the closest one i believe is koja.

I think you are a pretty good player. Youre actually a bit of opposite of what you present yourself to people as (assuming 'im one of the best rushers in this community' isnt a meme). Youre better at pvp than i thought, but i dont see you offend as much or being exclusively good at it as you say, again, assuming it wasnt a meme :d<br><br>And of course its clear as fuck that if youre a jake paul fan you should desreve to be at the top of the minecraft pvp scale, the immortal, the unbeaten.
