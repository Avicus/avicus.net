Hey. If you don't remember me, I've been on Avicus since like 2013 and was a really active player until took a break this past year due to some school stuff. I've been part of the staff team and was a mapdev until I retired and left last summer. After finishing a ton of summer homework, I thought I'd come back and visit for a while. AMA.

Hey Marcuz!<br><br><b>Have any IRL pets?&nbsp;</b>Yeah, I have a two-year-old Maltese puppy who follows me around wherever I go.<br><b>Have any siblings?&nbsp;</b>A younger brother and an even younger sister.<br><b>What are you studying?</b> I'm hoping to major in Computer Science with a minor or double major in physics.<br><b>Favorite sport, food, and film?&nbsp;</b>Favorite sport would probably be swimming, but I kinda quit a while ago due to lack of time. I still enjoy it though. Can't really decide on a favorite food, but I love any Taiwanese and Japanese food, especially sushi. I don't really watch movies but I watch a ton of anime, so my favorite right now would probably be&nbsp;<i>No Game No Life</i>.

Favorite map was probably Ravaged; sucks that it was removed two years ago. All the McZone maps were good before they were changed though. I haven't played much so I don't know many of the new maps, but CherryLand is pretty fun to TNT on.<br><br>I don't know you that well, but from what I remember you're a really skilled player who constantly maintains a positive attitude both in-game and in general.

First, I'll just tell you what my typical day looks like. In the morning, I usually wake up at seven and go to school at eight. School ends at 3:30 in the afternoon and I usually head straight to the library or nearest coffee shop to do homework and study. I spend a few hours there and get home at around seven or eight, and eat dinner. Then I'm left with a few hours to do whatever I want, and I usually use this time to practice music or work on programming stuff.<br><br>I'm gonna assume you're an incoming freshman. First of all, realize that your grades do matter and don't make the same mistake as I did by fucking up your freshman year. People say that colleges don't care about your freshman grades, but that's not true. Public schools, such as the UC schools, only look at your 10-11 GPA, but your grades all matter. People like to stack up on AP classes because it makes them look smart, but that can hurt you more if you're not careful. If you're just doing it for the college credits, you can also self-study the subjects. I self-studied six AP tests in my junior year and I found it much less time consuming than having to take an actual course, and I actually scored higher than my friends who took the class.<br><br>Second thing is don't procrastinate. In middle school, I was used to getting everything done the night before it was due, or even that morning. That won't work for high school, especially since you're taking those AP classes. Manage your time wisely. For English classes, make sure you read the literature thoroughly and not Sparknote it the lunchtime before the exam. For math and science classes, make sure you actually understand the content and not just memorize formulas and facts. KhanAcademy is a great resource if you ever get stuck on something or just need further clarification.<br><br>If you're like me and can't concentrate at home because of siblings and parents watching TV, do homework everyday after school at a coffee shop. It's a really chill environment and usually has fast wifi, and if you go there often enough and have a membership they'll usually let you get unlimited refills. I found it to be much more productive than just trying to work at home. If I need to study with a few friends for an exam, it also helps mainly because my parents don't allow me to have people over.<br><br>Last thing is to not spend all your time on schoolwork. You only have four years of high school, so be sure to live a life outside your room. There's a lot of social events such as football games, dances, and concerts that most schools offer so take advantage of those. I'm really tired right now; just got off a flight a while ago so I might not have Englished correctly. Good luck with the next four years.

Hey Samuel!<br><br><b>Opinions on Avicus right now?</b> Seems a lot more peaceful and definitely less laggy than before. Looking forward to seeing what Atlas has to offer.<br><b>Do you remember me?</b> Of course.<br><b>If so, opinions on me?</b> I feel like everywhere I go on the&nbsp;<i>Introduce&nbsp;Yourself</i> section all I see are people asking for opinions on themselves lmao.

Hey! Yep, of course I remember you. I don't play Minecraft at all besides Avicus. I did play a little bit of OCN and Kohi a few weeks after I left, but I stopped playing altogether. I do play CSGO, but nothing competitive, just an occasional casual match when I'm bored.

@Jackson eyy what's up, long time no see.<br><br><b></b><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>What have you been up to?</b> Not much, just schoolwork and some programming side-projects.<br></span><b></b><b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Any advice for junior year?</b> Pretty much all the stuff in the essay I wrote above applies, but (not sure how exactly the Canadian college application system works) start your college apps early. Don't wait until the month before to start your essays&nbsp;because it won't work. I started in like June and I feel like I won't have&nbsp;enough time either. Also get your teacher recommendations early and not wait until every other student is in line for a rec.<br><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>Any advice on how to stay motivated?</b> I'm a perfectionist as well and I'm OCD as fuck when it comes to schoolwork and stuff, which actually helps me focus on what I need to get done. I keep all my stuff on lists, and to me it just feels really good to be able to cross everything off a list. When you study, alternate between subjects. I'm a math/science oriented person, so I have no problem studying those subjects. However, to me, English and History are boring as shit so I alternate between them rather than studying math first and putting English until the end. That way I motivate myself to finish studying English because I actually want to work on the next chapter of math.<br></span><br>@Sev<br><br><b></b><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>Opinions?</b> Don't know you that well but you seem pretty nice in-game and on the forums.&nbsp;<b><br></b></span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>Will you at least be active on forums for a small while?</b> Yeah, I'll still check it every once in a while but I'll check it more the next week or so.<br><br>@99<br><br><b></b></span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>How you doing?&nbsp;</b>Am doing fine, you?<br></span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>Still into Apple products?</b> Yep, although not as much as I was before. I actually want a Galaxy S7 now instead of an iPhone.<br></span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>Opinions on me if you got any.&nbsp;</b>I've known you pretty much ever since I joined Avicus back in 2013, and you're a really great friend whom I've enjoyed talking to for the past three years.<br></span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>Favourite memory on Avicus?</b> Damn, that's hard. Probably the day of the Avicore update, when we all got in this huge Skype call and waited hours because stuff screwed up with the server.<br></span><b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Still doing music?</b> Yep. I still play cello and I've&nbsp;recently started experimenting with piano and guitar, and I really enjoy them.<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><br></span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>Do you still have the logs from that one ToD game?</b> OMG yes, completely forgot about them but they're saved in my Google Drive and will be there for as long as I live.<br></span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b><br></b></span>@Jess Goddamn I miss you as well. Pretty active on Skype in the sense that I read everything, but I just don't talk in the chat much.<br><br><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>Favourite song at the moment?</b> Probably "Controlla" by Drake.<br></span><b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">I'm totally your favourite right?</b> Yep, of&nbsp;course.<br><b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Am I the truth or dare master?</b> Omg fuck those games, I still have the logs from every game and the Skype chats probably&nbsp;ruined my reputation with like five different people lmao. Good times.<br><br>@Lokigh<br><br><b></b><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>Will you add a new pic to the 'show your face to the world thread'?&nbsp;</b>Maybe, but I want to remove my existing photos first because they're from like three years ago.<br></span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>Have you kept in touch with Avicus (like about updates and tournies by checking the forums) while you were gone, or did you completely quit for that year?</b> I'm still in a Skype chat with current and former Avicus players and I read the stuff in there often, but I checked the forums probably once in December and that was it for the past year. I only learned about Atlas yesterday.<br></span><br><b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Bring back Quintus Hacktivism Edition?&nbsp;</b>Gameplay was pretty shit on that map though; Quintus&nbsp;doesn't work well with CTW from what I learned. But it was fun while it lasted.<br><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>If any chance u remember but probs wont i was iTerraCubist back in early 2015.</b> Don't worry, I definitely remember you.<br></span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>Opinions on Avicus on its current state?</b> Not completely sure how it is currently but it seems a lot more peaceful than when I left. I remember leaving in the middle of a shitstorm that happened on the forums against the staff team so I'm glad that stuff's resolved.<br></span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>You into any kind of hobby, sports or music or (dont kill me pls forums) anime?</b> I'm really into programming and I put a lot of my spare time into that. I don't play a sport but I used to swim a lot and that was fun, but I'd rather put time into other stuff. I love almost any kind of music (with the exception of jazz and country) and I have headphones on pretty much 24/7, and I play a few instruments so music is a really big part of my life. I love anime (some people will remember how much I hated it two years ago) and my favorite, as I already said before, is probably&nbsp;<i>No Game No Life</i>.<br></span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>Ever had a place in mind you want to travel to?</b> Holy crap yes. I really want to visit London and Paris, and a trip to Tokyo would be nice but I've been there before.<br></span><br>@Iron<br><br>If you're still mad at me about that, I completely understand and I'll now say that I'm sorry for the shit that I caused you. At the time I had a monochromatic perspective and could not see the events that occurred from a staff member's point of view, and I couldn't grasp the concept that everyone makes mistakes and that sometimes it's okay to forgive someone. However, seeing that you're still part of the staff team after all that, I guess my judgement was not as flawless as I had thought it to be, and I'm sorry. Talk to me in private if you want.

My teacher for AP Statistics didn't teach at all though, so I basically self-studied that as well. I don't recommend trying to teach yourself Calculus BC since I started in September, but if you're really interested in math and are willing to devote a lot of time to it, then go for it. For Physics, make sure you fully understand concepts and not just memorize equations. Keep doing practice problems in a&nbsp;<b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">textbook</b>, not a prep book. The test is conceptual and there was probably one problem that involved numbers, and it wasn't even an FRQ. Environmental Science is pretty straightforward; just memorize everything in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Smartypants-Guide-Environmental-Science-Exam/dp/1411644778/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1471961139&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=smartypants+environmental+science" rel="nofollow" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">SmartyPants Study Guide</a>&nbsp;and you're set. Government was doable since I follow politics very closely, but the Crash Course videos will teach you everything you need to know for the test. For statistics, just go through the Barron's book and you'll be fine. For every test, make sure to do practice FRQs. It's mandatory if you want to achieve a high score on the test.<br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>Do you recommend taking naps?&nbsp;</b>Yes! Take naps if you're tired. It helps way more to do homework after waking up from a two-hour nap than to sit through your homework not knowing what you're doing.</span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>Also, I live in a suburb and I do my homework on a loud af bus for 2 hours.</b> Coffee shop.</span><br style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>How do you solve the problem of Internet distractions?</b> Coffee shop.<br><br>@Clock<br><br></span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><b>KFC or Popeyes?&nbsp;</b>Probably KFC since I've never tried Popeyes.</span>
