There will always be the guys who says "I dont care about this" but just imagine that.<br><br>I know the friends of my sister. When i was a little boy i was playing with 'em and my sister. Now imagine that.<br>The mother of one of this friends have been killed and threw to the rails.&nbsp;<br><br>Now imagine that person (20 years old) with the parents divorcied. He doesn't have any parents right now.<br><br>RIP. Why the people do that? She was a worker person...<br><br>:(

Those things will keep happening. They could be decreased of course, but some people just aren't nice...<br>You can't go back to the past but we can take this terrible moment as a lesson for the future and try to stop any further death.<br>By the way, I'm really sorry for your loss. I hope her family is okay (the best they can; you know what I mean) and I wish them the best future. My condolences to them.

I feel you, 2 of my relatives have died recently, one killed himself with alcohol overdose, and the other (diabetic) with sugar overdose.<br>It's a sad world we live in.<br>Or was it 3 that killed themselves, i can't remember, they seem to keep dying so fast i can't even keep up.<br>But it's alright, i never even saw or really knew them.
