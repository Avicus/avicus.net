I did a terrible lie back in old Avicus and MCZone, saying that I was 16, but... I'm actually 12.<br><br><b></b>Me:<br><br>Well, my name is Spritmage123 and I am a short little boy who is 12 and I'm turning 13 in 23rd of April.<br><br>I was born with a condition called <a href="http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/hemophilia" rel="nofollow">Hemophilia</a> and I was born in London, and I still am there. I've always been intrested in aviation, but I lost interest. I have experience with all kinds of programming languages, but I've mastered the arts of that basic language <a rel="nofollow">Scratch</a> (that's my account), but I know fluent CSS, HTML, C#, C++, Visual Basic, Batch and Python and RoR.<br><br>Recently, I've decided what I'd like to do with my life... I want to be a Law Judge, y'know, them guys with them funny wigs who decide whether the defendant goes free or not? Yeah...<br><br>Anyway, here is my real self, I apologize for the lies. I'm sorry for the screwups, I'm starting anew and hoping to apply for Moderator!<br><br>Plus, I am soon getting a Debit Card, and I'm obviously going to obviously donate obviously to Avicus (obviously).<br><br>About my cat who broke her leg:<br><br>Well, she ain't dead... I thought she was. She has recovered without surgery and we gave her and her brother away to a friend.<br><br>Anyway, see ya around, I'm being more active now.

very cool work and its pretty good that you have skills in all that computer techno stuff<br><br>judges dont really decide whether someone is proven guilty instead of dictating the fine or time spent in prison if the person is guilty. thats just a real simplistic run down because judges and law in general is super duper confusing and i dont want to go there.<br><br>gl on applying or being hand picked or whatever is happening with staff apps.<br><br>debit cards are pretty dank.<br><br>happy to hear about your cat

ARM had never been a sort of intrest, but I would be happy to try it out...<br><br>ARM is to make mobile apps, and x86 is 32-Bit stuff, should be easy.
