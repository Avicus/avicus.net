I think you are a very nice person. You might be getting picked on quite alot which I think is very mean, but you are taking it like a champ. You have improved alot in alot of aspects aswell,including pvp. One thing where I might be wrong, but that I have only noticed through observations, is that you shouldn't act mature to proof yourself to others.
