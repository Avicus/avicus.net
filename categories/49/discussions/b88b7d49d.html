<p>Hi, I am Geordstar_DE. I am new to this server, But I really like it. FrozenSolstice told me how to get here. He helped me&nbsp;a lot. In real life I like to play basketball, play games such as: Minecraft, League of Legends and watch youtube. I have been playing minecraft for 2 days and I really like it! This is the first server I joined because my cousin told me about it. It's really fun and I think I will stick around. I also want to become a pro at this server so I can beat my cousin. xD I like the nickname: Geo or Geord. And if I ever change my Minecraft Username in the next month. It will most likely be Geordstar123. or Geordstar______. Anyway I will continue to play on your server and have heaps of fun on it. Thank you and goodbye!<br><br>P.S Thanks so much FrozenSolstice for helping me out so much. I hope you read this!</p>
