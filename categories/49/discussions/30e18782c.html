Salutations fellow players! I am Davish of Minebattle. I just recently discovered this server on the Overcast Network forums in the shutdown announcement thread. I've decided to come see this server. I started playing minecraft because of one gamemode however, Destroy the Core. I saw a YouTuber making videos playing it on Minebattle.com and checked it out, though sadly that server shut down last year. I hope to meet new comrades on this server, and if you'd like to know a bit more about me, please feel welcome to ask.

It's alot like OCN actually. I'm playing on Throwback right now and I'm getting back to sniping like I used to in the glory days. It's not like DTC with TNT cannons and everything but it's like OCN's Destroy the Monument, so far it's a thumbs up.

Thanks m8. Pardon me but I recognize that skin of yours, one of Minebattle's Co-owners had it, he always said he was the only one with it, everytime I told him I saw people with it on other servers he'd just deny it like the complete boss he was. Cheers man, thought you might have a good laugh about it xD
