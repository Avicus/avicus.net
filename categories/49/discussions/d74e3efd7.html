<div><b>What is your IGN and team?</b> &nbsp;Rockyyyyy - NewDawn</div><div><br></div><div><b>How many tournaments have you participated in?</b> As a team none, but we all have seperate experiences.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Any team in particular you would like to face off against?</b> Probably Xenarch as during scrims always one team needs at least 2 subs so i would like to play them with there and our players.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Any team you don't want to face off against? </b>Team Allah xD</div><div><br></div><div><b>How do you think you'll do this time around? </b>&nbsp;I have a really good feeling that the practise has paid off and we can surprise ourselves, im sure they will make me all proud! If they turn up xD</div><div><br></div><div><b>Any teams you have a rivalry with?</b> I wouldn't call it a rivalry but i think Team Rocket as they always manage to beat us, yet we haven't scrimmed in a while so i would be excited to see where the practising got us.</div><div><br></div><div><b>What do you think is your team's best strength, and your best strength alone?</b> Everyone on the team, is &nbsp;very strong in a 1v1 situation and has the knowledge and skills to know what to do. My own strength is to be able identify what we need to improve on and how we can accomplish that.<br><br><b>What do you think is your teams worst weakness and your worst weakness alone?</b> &nbsp;We sometimes don't call out information that could help other teammates resulting in overall miscommunication. My own is that i can forgot to tell my players what they did well resulting in me always giving negatives.<br><br><b>What have you done to prepare?</b> We are doing it this weekend and it is a super confidential secret.... pretty much were playing the maps.<br><br><b>Anything you'd like to say to your opponents?</b> If i quit mid game it means my wifi crashed. So i will see you tommorow. As &nbsp;my wifi takes years to come back up... :c<br><br><b>Anything else you'd like to say?</b> Don't underestimate us i think we will surprise people.<br></div>
