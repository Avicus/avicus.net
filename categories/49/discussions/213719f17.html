cause everyone makes an AMA when they leave mc (for a while)<br><br>I accomplished my mc life goal, being no1 ranked on ocn and got a busy rl plus I fucked up my&nbsp;morality and empathy browsing dark web and gore forums, so I have had enough internet till I am mentally stable again.

when I'm able to care for other life's again. I've seen so much violent that I literally don't feel&nbsp;slightly bad anymore seeing any other Mexican or Syrian execution.<br><br>so I just need to fix my empathy as I already said.

You're always there when someone needs help which is pretty nice of you. I also remember when we used to make a team with avicus players and play abstract/wrap against grim. We actually won breaking their record on abstract.<br><br>Since your playing for a german team, I would learn german in your situation as you're really active on mineman and it would be a waste for all the hours.
