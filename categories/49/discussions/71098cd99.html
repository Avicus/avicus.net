<div>Today is my 18th birthday and I think this is a good occasion to create my Avicus AMA!&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Just to clear things up:</div><div>As many of you know I was appealed earlier this week after being banned for "anti KB and safe aura". It took me over a month to appeal this but now I am back and I am willing to answer any questions relating to the ban.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Some of the AMAs are getting a bit repetitive and impersonal so I thought I would write a little about myself so you have something to ask about, you don't have to read from here onwards! I'm 18 and I live in the uk doing my a levels and hoping to study civil engineering at Loughborough uni. I&nbsp;probably won't be that active in public nebula games until my a levels are over. Ask me anything :)</div><div><br></div><div>One last thing!!! Thanks so much to Ryan who is giving me his diamond rank for free! That's one bday present banked ;)</div>

Life is good on the whole, but I did really badly in recent exams so I have a lot of work to do in the next couple months :/ thanks for asking<br>I haven't really seen you in game that much but judging from stats pretty average xd if I fight you enough to make a better judgement I'll let you know!<br>I think I have improved a lot at pot pvp in the last months. I would rate myself as an all round pvper but I'm trying to get better :))

<div>Thank you!</div><div><br></div><div>What do you think about the Avicus staff?</div><div>There are a lot of great staff members but personally I have not had such good experiences with the staff team as far as all my false bans are concerned. I have been falsely banned for trigger bot, safe aura, and most recently for safe aura and anti kb. In the last case, most of the moderators were sure that I was hacking and dealt with my appeal in a closed minded way. Blaze, et, and awesomerp made a video to try to prove that the mod they used was inaccurate and Vobase used this as an opportunity to rant about my ban, even though the discussion was not directly related to my ban. <a href="http://imgur.com/iVoe0Ch">http://imgur.com/iVoe0Ch</a> in the same discussion Stimulating talked about how I was clearly hacking and that a screen share would be a waste of their time. In ts Iron told me that I should just admit to hacking and that I should stop making appeals. These comments made me feel like I would be wasting my time by appealing because it seemed like they were going to be stubborn about it anyway. After asking about 5 times over the course of 2 weeks I was eventually linked to the replay mod file that contained the evidence. It did not take me long to find out that the anti KB was actually delayed KB but the fact that the mods didn't spot this shows that they were too lazy to make sure I was hacking and they just wanted to ban me as soon as they had any incriminating evidence. Even after seeing my delayed KB, Vobase still thought I was hacking. I was appealed by Iron last week, but it did not seem very conclusive. I have seen Vobase in game since being appeal and have tried to say hello in a friendly way but he just ignores me. Even though he has falsely banned me twice, he has never apologised, nor has any moderator for that matter.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I got a bit carried away there sorry but to answer your question I think that the staff team are quite unprofessional, I'm sure they're all nice people irl :)<br><br>Opinions on you: from what I have seen you are a good defender and a friendly player. Next time I see you in ts I'll say hi :D</div>
