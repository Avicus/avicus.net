Yes, registrations on the site are finally working again...<br><br>So, like, yeah... I'm MasterProX, or Master for short — or Andrew, if you prefer calling people by their first name. My profile (with its spectacular K/D ratio) says I joined over a month ago, though I never really started playing on the server and checking my statistics until last week; I'm just new to the forums, not the server.<br><br>Even though an introductory thread like this tends to be the social protocol and I see myself as more of an introvert, I decided to type one anyway because the communities on the server and the forums seem to have been brimming with exuberance and positivity lately. Hopefully the replies on this thread can rub some of that onto me.<br><br>Oh, by the way, I've been infamous for writing incessantly long posts that use a relatively sophisticated vocabulary — refer to the rest of this post — and having an astringent, perfectionist attitude; don't feel disconcerted because of that. Ideally, I could try bringing some of my associated "wisdom" to the Avicus Network. Let's see how that turns out.<br><br>That aside... hai.

Haha it's weird because aagrant99 has a pretty good vocabulary and his name is Andrew, and you have a good vocabulary too and your name is also Andrew. Anyways welcome to the forums! XD
