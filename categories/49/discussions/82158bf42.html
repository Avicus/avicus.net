I'm making this post 'cause I'm getting pretty seriously into playing music, and wanted to see what instruments any of you guys played!<div>If you do play something, you could also share some songs you play :D<br><br>I'm intermediate/advanced in piano, Mozart is my favorite composer because I like his flowing style.</div><div>I just finished learning Sonatina in G Major by Thomas Attwood (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeBxF-5cYV4" title="Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeBxF-5cYV4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeBxF-5cYV4</a>)</div><div>I'm also learning Gerudo Valley from the Legend of Zelda (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWuYNz1SoHQ" title="Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWuYNz1SoHQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWuYNz1SoHQ</a>)<br>I'm also learning "You're a Mean One Mister Grinch" and a "Moonlight Sonata" / "God Rest All Ye Merry Gentlemen" crossover (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fu5IQE3mAdw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fu5IQE3mAdw</a>)</div><div>None of these people were me playing, btw xD I'll take videos some other time<br><br>(I'm also a beginner in Guitar and want to learn Violin, Banjo, and Ukulele)<br><br>So who shares a love of music :D?</div>

I play piano and have played it for over 7 years now, but quit lessons about two years ago. My skill is slowly dieing :(<br>Hopefully I can start piano lessons again :D<br>Right now I am trying to play Two Steps From Hell-Strength Of A Thousand Men, and Dark Star Core(From Mario and Luigi Bowser's inside story).
