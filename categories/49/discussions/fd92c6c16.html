I have been back for awhile now but have not been on the forums in a very long time.&nbsp; I use to post a lot back in the early avicus days right after the mczone switch.&nbsp; This would be a third introduction post as I am not new. This is a reintroduction.&nbsp; Some may remember me from those days and some may have never heard of me. Some of my threads are archived from the old avicus website. I have improved a lot in pvp since my earlier days and am continuously working to improve.&nbsp; I am pretty busy and cannot guarantee continuous activity like I used to back in those days, but when I am active I can be on for many hours on end.&nbsp; Next time I need to be inactive I will announce it before hand.&nbsp; My primary skills lie in archery but I am working and improving in my close combat. I have always and continue to enjoy to socialize with the Avicus community. Whether it be expressing my thankfulness for the community through the poem "Ode to Avicus" or just pvping and talking with others I have always enjoyed the player based interactions I have experienced here. I really hope you enjoyed this reintroduction and have a great day.
