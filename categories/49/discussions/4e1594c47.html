Since there is already a clusterfu*k of AMA's on the forums, I might as well make too. I can sense Steven waiting to make another hide AMA's topics already. Anyway ask me what you want I'll answer it with full honesty.

Hi Poker! :D<br><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; "><b>When will Berzerk have a full roster?: </b>Probably not for a very, very long time. Vlad is kinda forum banned ATM and will be away most of the summer so rip. I still haven't gotten my computer fixed, so I couldn't play or PvP if my life depended on it. :c Plus we haven't found enough players that fit the criteria we're looking for. ;-; Possibly some point during the summer we may have enough to do scrims.<br></span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; "><b>Opinions on me?</b>: Great team leader &amp; amazing teammate. Serious most of the time but you would still joke around. Don't really talk to much anymore but from what I remember you were a great person to talk to. Always a great rusher. :p</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; "><br><br></span>

We haven't actively talked since after the first tournament. still a very good pvper and person to talk with from what I remember. Hopefully you come back to the Legacy chat soon.
