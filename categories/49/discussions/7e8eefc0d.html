No. Email support@avicus.net if that still exists, or just appeal in the 'Appeal An Infraction' under the 'Policy' section of the tab. Good luck. :)

No. Buying a rank will not get you appealed or get you closer to being appealed, although we do appreciate your consideration.<br><br>ninja'd cx

This is not the place to appeal your infraction. Appeal under the "Appeal an Infraction" tab.

Hello.<br><br>I'm really not sure how you are unable to find the subforum. To make it clear and easy for you, I put all my effort together and got <a href="https://avicus.net/forums?topic_id=50" rel="nofollow">this link</a>&nbsp;that will automatically lead you to the subforum, without losing any time in seaching it!<br><br>Then, you will see a big green button called "New Discussion" where you'll need to click in order to create your appeal. Then the title should be something like "My Appeal" and in the body of the thread, explain why you should be unbanned, why were you banned, any alts you have used to evade if there are, who banned you, and when.<br><br>Then wait for staff to respond, and voila!

Okay, the question has been answered multiple times, hence I'm going to <u>lock</u> this thread as it shouldn't be really open anymore for comments at all. I'm briefly going to sum it up in one sentence:<br><br><i>Buying ranks will not unban you or increase your chances of so at all, you can still buy it if you wish though.&nbsp;</i>
