College aye? I finished my college apps a couple months ago and waiting another two months to get my responses from them. I am hoping for the best, there's two I really want to go because the beach is literally your backyard because the campus is located on a beach. Other than that, my social life has been ok, not the greatest or like how it used to be in the past. I just been working a lot of hours at my job and school; if I do get to do something else, I usually watch youtube, listen to music, or play overwatch lol.
