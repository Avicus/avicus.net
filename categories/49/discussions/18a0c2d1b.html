I kind of figured that I am not the most known person on this network so this is should help I guess. I am also the head of the social media team. I will also skip the "What do you think of me" questions because I don't know most of you. &nbsp;Hope I get more than one question &gt;.&gt;

to what extent do you believe the official team is disorganized, and what would you change if you were head of officials (which i hear isn't a thing right now...)

The map dev team is pretty isolated from the rest of the server, to be honest. Yes, you guys come on the server once and a while and set some maps but the interaction is very minimal. I am a sole believer that if this server is to get anywhere, it will be because of the map dev team. This means the roles of you guys must be bigger to the extent you are well versed in the building community, More events is a sure and easy way to get you guys closer to the community and get tons of new maps. Look at dev_revs event. That generated 8 CTW maps in a span of a month. You guys need events to keep your server alive and to get people happy to play here.&nbsp;<br>Another issue is the direction you guys are going. I really don't get what direction it is if you guys want any direction at all. I really don't believe I will be explaining this well but you seem to go on steps 4,5 and 6 when 1,2 and 3 need a bit more work before you move on. I can explain more tomorrow.<br>Fuck forgot the animal part. Pandas cause they are so fucking adorable.

It's obvious that your Officials are not well versed in the art of screen sharing. As stupid as that sounds it's true. Get them to screen share each other before a tournament. Anyone would know that a little guide will not help them in the fact they are going to be shared shitless to do it once.
