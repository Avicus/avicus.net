hey look some normal questions.<br><br>ok so I haven't actually met you personally, but from what I've seen you wouldn't hurt a fly and you're as nice as they come :)<br>also I think South Korea is awesome, I'd even go as far as to say it's like the US of Asia. Greece is fine too, good food, nice language, nice buildings, just not someplace Id ever consider visiting.<br>I don't know what the atlas update is, all I see are the new leaderboards and stuff (still on the kills front page lol)<br>Hillary because there's no way either one or them is getting through 4 years without being impeached, assassinated, or killed from natural (or from toxic spray tan, unnatural) causes

@strucken sorry I don't really know you, unless you're just asking for the definition of the concept of thought, which is too deep and I'm not answering.<br>@macandmarchese it's perfect here but I still like going west sometimes. also I think I know who you're talking about and if so I haven't caught up with her too much but she's probably the smartest person I know for the record.<br>@juan so first of all I'm done with mc because it's boring and frustrating, also I had some shoulder surgery done so I can't even use a mouse with my dominant hand. oh and yeah you should know my feelings on you by now. come on man, you know I love you.
