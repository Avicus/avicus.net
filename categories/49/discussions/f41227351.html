1 - Youre kinda cool I guess, never really talked to you but whenever you came into our channel before/after tourney matches you were chill.&nbsp;<br>2 - In tourney 2, the underbridge! and I didnt really play much in T3 but it was the final match, we didnt really take it seriously but we still won, we played to have fun and meme and we still end up winninng which just makes it all the much better.<br>3 - GrapeSmoothie<br>4 - nothing much man, how about you?
