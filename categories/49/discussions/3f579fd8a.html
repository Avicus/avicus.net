1. Ye<br>2. I pulled an all nighter once<br>3. Yes, it hurt :(<br>4. Making other people happy makes me happy<br>5. I usually start a conversation by kind of listening in to what the person is saying and if I know about the topic, I'll contribute my knowledge.<br>6. A bit of pop, alternative, dance etc. Anything but metal and country lmao.<br>7. You were so funny when I talked to you and so friendly &lt;3<br>8. Someone said I was smart when I had just changed schools and no one knew me.<br><br>Thanks Aura &lt;3

Thaaanks!<br>I chose to leave because I needed to catch up on school work and I came back because I've caught up.<br>Some were memes, and this one was stolen. DingDeLaDoggo is the name of a facebook meme page xD<br>Caramello Cadbury chocolate &lt;3<br>I can't even remember how I discovered Avicus TBH, but I decided to apply for staff when I was just getting back into Minecraft and I used to play on this server quite a bit a few years ago. I applied for staff because I wanted to contribute to my favorite server.<br>For me, you seem to be everywhere on the forums and nowhere in game lol. Still a cool guy tho.
