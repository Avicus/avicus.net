@raging Rugby obviously ;)<br><br>@Steven I think you're bloody hilarious, a good builder and an excellent banter. Keep up the good work.<br><br>@Blaze because yoavkippee didn't like saying awesome or apricot so he said April and I called him may and Theo was March but I never used that. Mine stuck.<br>Ingi is quiet, but funny when you know him. He's a good lad and a good friend.<br>I live in Leicester (up the city!). Some areas are good but most is a shithole. Wouldn't recommend, unless you like sport. We have basketball, rugby and football champions in the last 5 years. Also Loughborough.<br>Avicus should go for a competitive scene. Otherwise I see no future further than 2017.<br>Never will straightline you again.<br>I love apollo. I'm still active in slack and would have played the tourney if it wasn't for my laptop going poop a week before:(<br><br>You seem a decent lad and a good member of the community!&nbsp;<br><br>@elemental seem like a nice guy, community regular and seem relatively polite<br><br>@juanno don't really know you but I respect someone that says what they think whenever so +1. Good Pvper in your own right so don't change lad&nbsp;<br><br>@sayah good lad, lotta love here :D good pvp gg<br><br>@Delicious good mod, nice around here, doing good shit for everyone which I appreciate if it doesn't look like I do favourite colour is green and future wise I don't see one unless competitive is pushed hella lot
