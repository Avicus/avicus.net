Hello.<br><br>The name's Hornet. Many of you may have heard of me through McZone, due to my demotion from staff on that server in the past. There was a little confusion as to who my "previous" account was. However that account was given away, and is now compromised. Considering my old account was banned, I asked ever so politely to be unbanned, however I was told I needed to come back on a new account. I changed the name of the compromised account. And now,<br><br>I'm back.

Well, hornetjumper isn't recorded in the Avicus database so he's free to play.

MCZone bans didn't carry over though... treated like a new server.

Didn't I clearly state that this account is compromised..? This is coming off of Jake41901, the account in which was given away. So I don't see why posts wouldn't remain the same. It makes sense.

I am not the only one with knowledge of the password, nor will I ever be the only one to know it. If Jake41901 wants his account back, he'd need to find out the password and change it. Other than that, he's basically screwed.

Well I no longer have any access to Jake41901, so the password was obviously changed. Anyone could own it at this point, because I did give it away. However, I don't believe this is the real hornetjumper at all. Probably just some forum troll.

I did not directly give it to this player. I gave it away to a player I trusted, however he must've shared it with various other players. So at this point in time, I have no idea who this is.
