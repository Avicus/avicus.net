OK WHERE DO I&nbsp; START OMG. I met u when I said i wanna die so i gave you my address and everything LOL and thats how we started talking. It was like 3 years ago or so during some random scrim. I really love having you as a friend no matter how annoying to me you are(yes youre very annoying LOOOL but ily). You helped me with many shits even irl problems especially the ones xddd(u know which ones) and I appreciate that so much. We dont talk as we used to but still we do and recently we're talking much more about srs stuff. Anyways ye u can be annoying over the time with your gay memes or however you call them xd but I'm fine with it, I got used to it. You're very mature most of the times but I still find u funny even when your dead serious. I've nothing else against you because youre such an amazing friend and bf xdddd<br><br>Fuck yeah we have to no matter what

Alrighty sammy youre a nice guy and i like you but sometimes youre a <i><b>bit&nbsp;</b></i><b></b> annoying when ur clipping people(thats just my opinion dont go hard on me people) and then youre getting hated and shit and I dont want it since youre fun and chill to talk with. On competitive scene you became legend once you came back(it was ages ago) and people think u cheated. imo u did look muy sketchy on my pov when we fought on avi but when we 1v1ed u looked completely normal(again dont go hard on me ://// im not callin you out im just sayin) idk what else to say mate, hope we can do more 1v1s and talk in future

Annoying little canadian person that legit spams the fuck outta ts chat every day&nbsp;constantly(by passes everything like ZUIY), on a serious note youre a fun twat to play with and talk(i just talk to myself since ur muted). I like ur memes and roasts. You remind me of andrea way tooo much LOL, you both never talk, you just spam ts chat yet you're both deadly in game(rape series). Idk when youre planning to get a mic but it better be before i quit this shit game.<br><br>Not ur&nbsp;business wtf back off kid LOL

Old friend of mine, toxic shitter for sure ngl, sometimes salty like half of the community. We had many many fucking beefs between each other(like always every week cuz of ehoes mate) but forget that, we're chill now and ur letting me play for ur team which it weird cuz u still dislike me. I enjoy talking to u cuz every convo gets very weird and way to far. Playing hcf with u is something hilarious(i eat spawners grrr). Overall chill but sometimes immature but thats fine. I still love you downson<br><br>Boiii english class here sucks, mc basically&nbsp;taught me how to speak it LOL

I can be very serious once its needed like during tournaments as player or ref, during scrims and sometimes in a normal talk but depends with who I talk to. I get mad easily but I dont show it too much cuz if you show your weakness some people might use it for their own good to annoy u shit ton and provocate you. Also sometimes i say some weird wise words and stuff like that beacuse its nice and sometimes helpful. I like to make memes with friends and screw around. As a player I think I'm somewhat decent but not amazing at all. I have the worse pc and setup in general on avicus probably and thats my only excuse. Playing with low fps during team fights and stuff like that is very hard and annoying but I'm used to that. I improved a bit but still not good enough and I think i can probably be better if i have decent setup.

You recently came back again after a break and thats nice. I have feeling you're gonna quit again for few weeks or days sadly. I hope you're doing pretty good irl with schools and other stuffs. As a player, was good defender and pretty good with a bow, your frontlining skills are pretty nice. Hope you wont quit any time soon :(</div><div><br></div><div>Also, what do you like to do in your freetime? - I used to make a lot of packs but I lost motivation now, I cant be asked to make a pack all by myself :( I need someone to make packs with me ( <img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/5770cbba386a452e92a9ca9f17a8d2ba?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/paulna.html" style="color: #FF5C5C">paulna</a> <img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/58b9ab0f83cf43c1b53baecd64ed2838?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/twopump.html" style="color: #FF5C5C">twopump</a> ).

I still consider you as my close friend even if u hate me and dont talk to me. Anyways you're very kind mineman woman to have a normal convo with(unlike with gayvid). I simply cant hate u but I can just get a little bit mad at u over the time but thats normal. You roasted the shit outta me and that annoys me a bit but idrc its minecraft so ://.

I just do it so I can look like I'm funny and chill guy. I dont know is it working or no. I find myself pretty communicative and approachable person even tho I dont look like I am. I can be very serious once its needed like during tournaments as player or ref, during scrims and sometimes in a normal talk but depends with who I talk to. I get mad easily but I dont show it too much cuz if you show your weakness some people might use it for their own good to annoy u shit ton and provocate you. Also sometimes i say some weird wise words and stuff like that beacuse its nice and sometimes helpful. I like to make memes with friends and screw around. As a player I think I'm somewhat decent but not amazing at all. I have the worse pc and setup in general on avicus probably and thats my only excuse. Playing with low fps during team fights and stuff like that is very hard and annoying but I'm used to that. I improved a bit but still not good enough and I think i can probably be better if i have decent setup. Idk what else to say about myself but I'm overall nice guy if u get to know me well and even if u dont but once u make me mad a lot I dont promise I will be nice, ill most likely be toxic towards u, sorry :(</div><div><br></div><div><img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/9116d3fa14004adaaecd2eae1d73e383?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/Xuph.html" style="color: #009396">Xuph</a></div><div><br></div><div>My closest friend on avicus.

Alrighty sammy youre a nice guy and i like you but sometimes youre a <i><b>bit&nbsp;</b></i><b></b> annoying when ur clipping people(thats just my opinion dont go hard on me people) and then youre getting hated and shit and I dont want it since youre fun and chill to talk with. On competitive scene you became legend once you came back(it was ages ago) and people think u cheated. imo u did look muy sketchy on my pov when we fought on avi but when we 1v1ed u looked completely normal(again dont go hard on me ://// im not callin you out im just sayin) idk what else to say mate, hope we can do more 1v1s and talk in future

i mean how am i "annoying" by clipping people ?? i mean people aren't gonna think im good if i clip combos of bad people. i mean the way to show off myself is to do it on the good people ??<br><br>edit: just realized i said "i mean" in all three sentences
