I've decided to exhaust all my services from Avicus. I've been here for over 4 years, I've experienced almost every staff system that has been in place from when Howsie was Director; and it certainly has been very interesting to see the revolution of ideals from a management perspective.&nbsp;<br><br>Main reason for this sudden decision was the amount of work I am anticipated to complete for school - as I just entered my final year. The expectations were much higher than I thought it was, so I need to focus on that. Besides, I want to play enjoyable games (Overwatch + Elsword, not Minecraft since it's boring now) in my own free time without being obliged to fulfill a responsibility.&nbsp;<br><br>I'm quitting Avicus, and Minecraft. I don't see myself logging into Minecraft much anymore, although I may pursue a development approach to the game if I'm interested. That being said, I want to thank a few people who have been most influential in my Avicus experience - and I'm not going to list everyone since I would be going on for days.<br><br><b></b><img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/06e0e1734a9346549769fa7c216e353f?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/Howsie.html" style="color: Gray">Howsie</a> Without you, I wouldn't be the person I am today. I wouldn't have confidence in my leadership skills, and I would have not been able to cope with responsibilities such as administrating a complex network. Your guidance in the early days still influences my decision making; I often wonder what you would do in a situation. I know there are some people here who look down on you since you like to be (apparently) pessimistic on the forums, but I don't care. I'm happy that I was able to be around when you were in charge. Adding you on B.NET and hearing from you put a smile on my face again - back to the times of the Sistahood prime. Let's hope we remain great friends, play competitive together (carry me please) and eventually greeting each other in real life.&nbsp;<br><br><img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/be49b1a8600e47519725a8aead777363?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/izjust4fun.html" style="color: Gray">izjust4fun</a> I will never forget you lol. Genuinely nicest person I have ever met online, and probably in real life (quite sad when you think about it). Alongside Howsie, you were my role model here on Avicus for over 3 years. You won't see this, but I hope you and CC are still together. I still need to hear all about it!!<br><br><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/212396fbcb92c0f72681063facd79772?s=20&amp;default=mm" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/_Gill.html" style="color: Gray">_Gill</a> Tinychat parties were the best, and you knew how to make the mood in the community lift. Stay in touch on snap, keep sending my drunk pictures because they are certainty reminiscent of the days where you took interviews while being tipsy.<br><br><img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/52e69c89f13c416b97afd12838659ffe?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/DoctaPop.html" style="color: Gray">DoctaPop</a>&nbsp;<img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/7f054339a0c347ba8fca0ab2074b7d82?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/NolanDalton.html" style="color: Gray">NolanDalton</a>&nbsp;<img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/578434bc303048548e6b8e60df523412?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/UnkelBen.html" style="color: Gray">UnkelBen</a> As moderator, you guys were absolute legends to me. Always there to talk about random shit, great friends where we had so many memories (such as when we were promoted to senior mod). Pop I remember when we played The Forest in skype calls... I miss those tbh. We still need to continue our saved adventure! Nolan, I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to remind you: "Well, um, so, you basically got mod". Hardest working mod/senior I've worked with, shame you left so early - but we need to catch up somehow... :P<br><br><img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/9116d3fa14004adaaecd2eae1d73e383?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/Xuph.html" style="color: #009396">Xuph</a> Continue to love nightcore, and I won't forget the skype music sessions we had - it sucks we randomly stopped. I trust you wholeheartedly, and you know why. Thanks for being a great friend.&nbsp;<br><br><img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/8242e55ecc6a458ab272a2b34918045f?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/keenanjt.html" style="color: #E77400">keenanjt</a> You inspired and motivated me to start developing. Thanks for helping me when I was stuck, and your efforts and dedication to Avicus is exemplary. Even when the odds are against the network, you've somehow managed to continue the project. Even after the life of this community has died out - I believe you will go on to be one of the top programmers. I'm looking forward to read your name in an awesome project... and I hope one day I can join you. (I'm pursuing computer science majoring in robotics and web development).<br><br>Yoav. What can I say. Best friend on Avicus by far - and I still have your good luck charm of a dragon, on my bedside table. When you're out of boarding school please come back to chat, so we can have a video chat once more (but please wear a top).<br><br>Thanks everyone,&nbsp;<br>You can ask anything here; what really happened behind the scenes; some secrets I didn't tell anyone (within reason) etc... but I won't be treating this as an AMA.&nbsp;<br><br>Noodle God &amp; Rock Lord signing out.

Wow this is saddening. :( Anyway good luck in life, I always wanted to get to know you better. Even though we didn't talk much I've always looked up to you. You've always been a good role model and someone that I knew I could trust if I needed help with anything.&nbsp;<br><br>How can I improve as a:<br>Moderator-&nbsp;<br>Person-<br>Player-<br>(Yes I'm not a Mod right now. xd I'm going to re-apply though, and hopefully do better than before.)<br><br>What are you planning to do with your future/career?<br><br>Also where is the Retired rank? &lt;3

Choose to focus on life than to play a block game. That's what I've chose since I got banned and I'll say life is great from then on.<br><br>One of my good friends on here, good luck in life and have fun, jozz. Keep in touch brother.

Hands down one of the&nbsp;<b></b>best staff members this network has ever had. Hard-working, an outstanding leader, someone who expected and drove his staff to be as precise and dedicated as he was, truly an amazing job.<br><br>I'm sorry our friendship ended roughly after I retired. Sometimes I wish I hadn't left but Avicus had literally become 90% of my life and I knew at the end of 2014 that it was time for me to get off Minecraft and face the real world. Crazy to think that in 2 weeks it'll be 3 years since I got Junior Mod. You Yoav and Pop were some of the best friends I've never met in person. Even after you got promoted to Director and became our boss you still treated us as friends but&nbsp;<br><br>It's amazing how dedicated you've stayed to this server and community despite all the administration changes and negative times that this server has gone through, I had to stop at some point but you've kept going and kept at this server through all these years. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We need to get a Skype call or chat at some point with the original Sistahood cause I haven't talked to y'all in years. Good luck in life Jozz, seeing how dedicated you were towards Avicus, I feel you'll have no problem at all in the real world.
