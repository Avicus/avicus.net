Ah, honestly, it's actually probably a bit easier, since we aren't required to moderate as much but having said that it still demands certain skills, like leadership, and our time. Life of a senior moderator is just handling appeals, questions, applications and overall helping the Administrators in their role.&nbsp;<br><br>Lets just put it this way, if it wasn't fun i would have already left the staff team. That being said it can definitely be difficult at times, demoting staff members, waking up at 5am for meetings and having to come up with solutions under alot of pressure.
