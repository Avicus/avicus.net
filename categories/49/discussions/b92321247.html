Note: As this is my first post, don't hate if it is horrible. Enjoy!<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Hey friends, I know some of you have never seen me on here before, so I
 would like to share a bit about myself. I am usually seen on the 
amazing PvP type games. I love the PvP on this server, for the great 
amount of ping I get from living in North America. I get called hacks 
once and awhile for that reason so often. Anyways, I usually play 
Nebula&nbsp; (lvl 46), Walls (lvl 20), and Nexus (lvl 35-40ish). I can't wait
 to get to know more of you online. Well, I will see you guys around! 
&lt;3<br><br>Btw: Can someone tell me how to send screenshots, because 
it hasn't went so well for me. If the screenshot below worked, than nvm.<br><br><img src="http://file:///C:/Users/Don/Desktop/2015-01-31_18.44.36.png" alt="">

Welcome to the forums!!<br>To post a screenshot, simple copy the URL of the .png or .jpg image (or any "picture type" file extension), and then click "insert image". Once you clicked that, paste the URL of the image into the text box, and click "Insert Image". :)<br><br>EDIT: Make sure to upload the screenshot to gyazo, imgur, or any image-uploading website before uploading the image on the forums.
