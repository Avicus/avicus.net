Hey all! It's nice to see what a great community avicus has. I would like to introduce myself, so you can get to know me better. Well, for starters, I love to help others out, in terms of difficulties, or a person that they can talk to. Secondly, I love to play with friends, both IRL and on the internet. The few years that I have been playing minecraft was great, meeting lots of wonderful people in different servers. But one day, I found avicus, typed in the server IP address, and bam, here I am today.&nbsp;<br><br>So I hope to see you guys in the Avicus Server, take care! :)
