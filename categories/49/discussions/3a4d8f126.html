Heyo,<br>My name is CubeRoot, or Mike if you don't like maths, and I've only recently started playing Avicus. I had joined once or twice on my old account, but never really played. I'm from the Overcast Network, and saw a few fights between our two servers, got interested and logged on.<br>I'm a map-maker, and I currently have my first Avicus map in-dev after being asked by ParaSpider to make one.<br>I recently started shopping things again, and started doing GFX for people, such as YouTube banners and thumbnails. Here are a few examples of my work.<br><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/MEAhGtY.jpg"><br><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/H7NG1UF.jpg"><br><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/nyQonsW.jpg"><br>I also like photography. Here's some Macros I took, hope you like em.<br><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/FQhvXMM.jpg"><br><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/H2Sr1AW.jpg"><br>I am a type-one diabetic (not to be confused with type-two diabetes, which is caused by overeating or other lifestyle issues). I have overcome depression and anxiety.<br>I like public speaking, gaming, pretending to be a moron in-game, GFX/photoshop and photography.<br>I joined the servers on this account while Overcast has been down, and it's a nice change. It was quite a thrill to be reported by so many people I rekt in one game that a mod came on. :D<br>I am editing a montage of my gameplay from today right now, might link it when I'm done.<br>I hope to see you guys online sometime!<br><br><br><br>

Welcome to Aviworld! Sorry if those so called "wars" with OCN bothered you. Just ignore them. I promise I'll try my best to help you have a great time and I'm sure the Avipeeps agree. If you are unsulted for being from OCN, ignore them. You seem like a great guy, Cube. :)

<i></i>Heh, nah :P The only thing that I found I didn't like with Avicus was the site; looked a lot like OCN's, but it's changed now, and in my opinion, it looks so much sexier than OCN's.<br>
