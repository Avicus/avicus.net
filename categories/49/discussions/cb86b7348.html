I think its a good way to get a lot of projects done in a quicker yet more effective manner, and it also brings new faces to the map dev team. Im excited to learn a lot more about how Avicus maps work, and I am really looking forward to making maps with people, and creating a better experience for Avicus players<br><br>If I could change one thing it would probably be to have public players have an easier time getting into the community, to hopefully increase the competitive population.<br><br>I think you are a really really good senior mod. You are trustworthy and you are always there to help.
