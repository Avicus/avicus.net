So, you're probably going to think this is some formal post where I announce something that means nothing to you until I explain it&nbsp;(see how I didn't say the "Hello" at the beginning), right? Well, not exactly.&nbsp;<br><br>I've been sitting here as a staff member for almost three years, and all you've most likely come to know me as is "Peachy, the Admin." Just the guy who sits up in his little TeamSpeak office, acting like he's doing things for the server? No? How about the guy who seems like he runs the show behind the scenes, but you actually don't know anything about him or what he does? A bit more likely.<br><br>Well, let's start simply. My name is Ryan, and I live in the USA. I am currently a sophomore in High School who enjoys playing tennis, researching medicine, and competitive PvP. Okay, basics done. Let's move on to specifics. My job here? Well, my main priority is making you guys mad. Minor things that I do include handling promotions/demotions, executing changes to policies/rules, setting priorities and goals for the server, managing senior staff, listening to Zac in the support room, etc. The list goes on. Anyway, isn't this exactly what I told you I was? One of the guys who runs the show behind the scenes? Well, yeah. Nothing special, most of you could probably do it better than I can. Let's move on though, there will be time to trash talk me later.<br><br>Avicus. You've heard that name before, but you're not sure where, right? Well, yeah, probably from some advertisement on TV or something like that. What is Avicus, though? Is it a business run by a corrupt Senior Staff team trying to gain a ton of power on a Minecraft server? Sounds strange, right? Let's try again. Is it a metaphor for how there are lots of greedy and selfish people in the world whom you can't trust, but also how there are people who try their best to do good for the world? A bit farfetched, don't you think? Alright, one more time.&nbsp;<b>Avicus is a community, upheld by unique and welcoming people. Avicus is a place for friendship, safety, and most of all, fun. Avicus is a place where NO ONE is left behind, ostracized, or purely disregarded, and also a place where EVERYONE has a voice and recognition.&nbsp;</b><br><br>So, why don't we all work in cooperation to fix the problems that are blocking our path to prosperity? Put away the differences, accusations, and arguments in order to put this place back onto its position of glory.&nbsp;<br><br>Now that I've turned off Gandhi mode, I'm sure you either think I'm crazy and should be demoted, or that I should just be demoted. That may be true, but I told you there will be time to trash talk me later, didn't I? Here are my final questions for you, though:<br><i>Who are you, and what makes you unique?<br></i><i>What is it about Avicus that makes you stay with it?<br></i><i>What, in your eyes, is the best path for the server at this moment?</i><br><br>THAT IS ALL AM DONE WASTING TIME

This post truly enlightens my Avicus experience. The mere thought of a user being able to exquisitely craft such thought provoking pieces of Avicus literature is beyond my mortal drain of thought. Your allusions to great historical figures who have stood the test of time and proven themselves as true monuments to the human ideology of peace and cooperation is baffling to me, and frankly... Unfathomable. As you stated, prosperity is but a step away, we must take hold and charge forward into the unknown. For this unknown is one that will remain ever-present in this unavoidable future that lies ahead. So I state, we must forge forward through all uncertainties and cast aside our sore eyes, but accustom ourselves to the glorious and masterpiece that is the Avicus eye. Your integration of common Avicus goings truly has raised my level of satisfaction with this piece. The thought that a user of such power could see down to his pupils as peers is revolutionary. I see Avicus has finally sought to appease its Socialist roots. Hence I say, be gone with this democracy, behold the sovereign state that is Socialist Avicus. Welcome my friends, the Russians may have failed, but we will not.<br>When we look to our Glorious Nation we are only left in a state bewilderment. Unique... What makes Avicus so unique? Its exquisite attention to detail. The unbelievable detail that goes into Avicus truly enlightens the experience of a user. I for one, am really honored of avicus' uniqueness when it comes to its staff. Never have I seen a user named Ryan dedicate so much time towards the Avicus Network.&nbsp;<i></i>However, I am not Avicus. I am Iron, I am your comrade in action. For this is not a petty democracy with an admin like yourself reigning your iron hand. No. This is communism, the mere thought that all individuals are equal and shall be just in social status.

It does not need guidance, under our socialist rule, Avicus is well on its way to developing into the prosperous nation is has always sought that status of. However, in this time I state. Let our focus not be silly and malicious people. LET IT BE, to invoke the fires stored within all of our hearts.

Definitely can agree with everything said in this post.<br><br>We NEED to work more as a family, rather than fighting each other constantly. We all need to work together to help rebuild Avicus (as my<br>phone corrects Avicus to avocado), and im sure you all are aware that we aren't in a good situation at all.&nbsp;<br><br>In the 3 months I've been administrator, I've noticed that there are A LOT of problems<br>piling onto the Administrators, and it gets hard for us to carry anything out. If any of us want to rebuild Avicus back to the way it was during the MCZONE time period, we need to work as a family towards ensuring a better Avicus, rather than fighting each other and causing problem after problem for each other.

But the problem is, for a long period of time past admins/staff teams didn't care and that hurt the server badly. If work would have been done continuously for the past 6 months or year we wouldn't be having problems with player count. Lots of feedback was given months ago but was all set aside. There is sooo many ways to make Avicus better just look around the forums...<br><br>The real solution I can think of right now. Is to get a bigger team of devs, make the server better but don't update versions (PvPers don't want 1.9). Fix problems that are happening I can think of dozens only on the forums. And get youtubers it will save the server only after its fixed.

I just typed up this really long essay and it timed out so I am going to do the best to copy what I said in shorter context. People play on this server for nebula, plain and simple. why not the other fun game modes they have? tbh because they are not fun. You need to make them fun, have a meeting or something maybe a post about what can you do to improve the playtime on those games. I definitely &nbsp;all the game modes could use some renovation&nbsp;so that is something to look into. How can we become more like family and friends? Have tourneys monthly, put all your staff members in a random generator and each month one person gets pick to host a tourney of their choice.(if the staff member chooses to pass on it so be it)&nbsp; This will improve the staff&lt;&gt;player communication in my opinion. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, for those people who host tourneys add more room for TONS of players. The slots usually fill within 30 mins to an hour and for me it's always been a disappointment missing the tourneys with my team so it would really be generous to open it up for more teams to enter. Commenting on what 99250 said, I honestly agree, when I first started playing, staff would tell me to f off and&nbsp;I would be like, wait..what??. Another thing, give players more chances If someone tells you to f off out of anger don't always come on targeting them or wanting to harass them because maybe they are having some family issues or not the best day. Tighter chat rules I believe will also help a more friendly community. Whatever you do, don't update to 1.9 or your server will rip. Players do not want it and they do not like it. When I go to MineCon I will be rioting that. I hope you took time to read this. Thanks, Soccer.

This post truly enlightens my Avicus experience. The mere thought of a user being able to exquisitely craft such thought provoking pieces of Avicus literature is beyond my mortal drain of thought. Your allusions to great historical figures who have stood the test of time and proven themselves as true monuments to the human ideology of peace and cooperation is baffling to me, and frankly... Unfathomable. As you stated, prosperity is but a step away, we must take hold and charge forward into the unknown. For this unknown is one that will remain ever-present in this unavoidable future that lies ahead. So I state, we must forge forward through all uncertainties and cast aside our sore eyes, but accustom ourselves to the glorious and masterpiece that is the Avicus eye. Your integration of common Avicus goings truly has raised my level of satisfaction with this piece. The thought that a user of such power could see down to his pupils as peers is revolutionary. I see Avicus has finally sought to appease its Socialist roots. Hence I say, be gone with this democracy, behold the sovereign state that is Socialist Avicus. Welcome my friends, the Russians may have failed, but we will not.<br>When we look to our Glorious Nation we are only left in a state bewilderment. Unique... What makes Avicus so unique? Its exquisite attention to detail. The unbelievable detail that goes into Avicus truly enlightens the experience of a user. I for one, am really honored of avicus' uniqueness when it comes to its staff. Never have I seen a user named Ryan dedicate so much time towards the Avicus Network.&nbsp;<i></i>However, I am not Avicus. I am Iron, I am your comrade in action. For this is not a petty democracy with an admin like yourself reigning your iron hand. No. This is communism, the mere thought that all individuals are equal and shall be just in social status. This is the case with Avicus, and hence I am able to state&nbsp;<i>Who I am.</i> I am Iron, unknown on the server till January of last year I was a mere wildflower in the winds of change.

It does not need guidance, under our socialist rule, Avicus is well on its way to developing into the prosperous nation is has always sought that status of. However, in this time I state. Let our focus not be silly and malicious people. LET IT BE, to invoke the fires stored within all of our hearts. Together only together, can our fires forge the path ahead that Avicus strives for.</span><i style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; "><br></i>
