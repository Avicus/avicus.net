I haven't done one of these in a while.<br>Ask me almost anything and I'll be as honest as I can.<br><br>Whether it's about the staff, the community, or anything controversial, I want to see how far I can go without getting told off xD<br><br>Ignoring 'Opinions on me' questions as always because as a collective I think you're all a bunch of knuckleheads.

It's fun being the only kiwi mod, the unique Timezone gives me a slightly different outlook on Moderating than others because I often find myself Moderating by myself for several hours before any other mods can come on. <br><br>Which is fine, but it's a mixture of awesomeness and stupidness that my Timezone is perfect for the 2-4am EST time slot.&nbsp;<br>Its either hella quiet or completely full of hackers, there is no inbetween xD<br><br>Favourite Avi meme is Snowlas because I'm in it xD<br><br>You're a 10 because you're one of the better Moderators on the team. I can count on you time and time again and we always have each other's backs. You're also a stand up guy.

I felt that the staff team of old knew what they were doing and had more of an idea overall of how to moderate.<br><br>Today's staff team are full of new people who have little moderation experience, so a lot of our Moderators today are still learning as they go.<br><br>But I say that with two different perspectives.<br><br>I viewed the old staff team as a baby-faced junior mod who didn't know anything.<br><br>I view today's staff team as someone who's done this three times already with almost 12 months of experience.<br><br>So that could have something to do with it.<br><br>The old staff team felt more like a family.<br><br>But this staff team feels like it's internal communication will get extremely better over the coming weeks and months.<br><br>We will see.

I don't have anything to hide. <br>It's literally just 2 videos of suspicious movement that Para and I deemed impossible at the time.<br><br>As soon as the seniors took over lunacy's appeal a few weeks back with the hand cam and all that, my involvement with the appeal stopped there.<br><br>I'm not really sure why people keep roping me back into it. <br>I wasn't even involved in the final decision.

If he wants to be unbanned, he can make an appeal or talk to a member of staff. It's not our place to start passing judgement, so back off and let them do their jobs.&nbsp;<br><br><br>I still love you, by the way. &lt;3
