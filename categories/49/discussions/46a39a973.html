I went to the doctor with my parents and the doctor asked me to go to the hospital. They did a scan and they found out that I have a early stage cancer and I might not be able to recover from it. I have at least 2 months before the cancer spreads to my whole body and I will obviously die. I appreciate all the support and all the hate that you guys have given me.

Damn, I have nothing to say. dilpickel pretty much ninja'd me, however, I'll try to be make this as comforting as I can.<br><br>I'm surprised at the lack of continuous comments on you getting well. Come on guys, lets have some humanity :(<br><br>My piece of advice to you is to never give up. Keep fighting the cancer and always hope that your body has a chance. The doctor said that you might not survive, however focus on the other percentage and strive for it. Never give up and grow ill over this.<br><br>Whatever you wanted to do, do it now. Its summer and you have a full time ahead of you.<br><br>Because if you are ready to give up then you have already lost. Keep fighting and you have a chance man. Don't give up.<br><br>I feel that after this, despite your infraction you should be given a pardon for the mean time to have fun on the server. I never got to know you and I would like to do that now if you are willing.&nbsp;<br><br>Here, if you have a skype my skype name is Zintenka Brimem. We can talk and get to know eachother over there.

You can do it, I never knew you, but have faith. Whatever you believe and wherever you go, someone will be watching over you. Just fight it and fight it until you can be a survivor. Now, more people survive cancer than die from it, so just stay as fit and healthy as you can while doing everything you have ever wanted to do. I believe in you! Add me on Skype if you need to talk about anything. Good luck!!!

Also nerfgun, I watched a movie about a year ago and I would like to recommend it to you.The movie is called "The Bucket List (2007)".It's a movie with people in your situation, no matter how much you have to live left, you should live and enjoy your life before you die.Duration is 90m.
