Hey guys, it's me, also known as Diamondman989, Spritmage123, UnstableExplosion, Tails_Prower_ and all that cringy stuff. It's been almost 3 years. Nice. I used to play here everyday until I noticed the server's popularity dissipating, and I got bored of Minecraft, and moved over to Steam. I left Avicus for well over a year, and I was web-banned during that period due to the ridiculous idea of spamming Zalgo text onto the forum, clogging up the page. Sorry for that. Well, many things have changed, I haven't touched Minecraft for a year and a half, and I've been hooked onto Overwatch on the PC since its release.<br><br>I'm fourteen now, I still live in London, I've received 2 GCSE qualifications, and I have dropped my interest in programming and tech-related stuff, it's really only a hobby now.<br><br>I still have my YouTube channel, and I stream occasionally for charity. And I hope things can be different now with new people, new staff and a new me. I hope to see you guys soon, ask me anything, and I'll be sure to answer.
