Did you factor in the smell of an unlettered aristocrat? Because if you did, then I might have to kill you.

Although you claim there to be 23 letters in the quadratic solarius, that doesn't affect the color of the peacock, or it's diameter. So the answer to that question is: The peacock is golden. I think, that's just my analysis. ;p<br><br>Anywho, back on topic. What's your favorite thing about Avicus, and why? When did you discover Avicus? How long have you been part of the Avicus Community?

I found out by watching walls videos. My favourite thing is getting the monument while the defenders are there. I've been part of avicus since when the Ip for walls was wallsmc.com and it sent u directly to the game (Maby a bit before that)
