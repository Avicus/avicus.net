Don't worry I will have fun :)<br><br>I have actually survived two sharknados, one when I was fishing in the Bermuda Triangle and the other when I was skiing down Mt. Everest.<br>My favourite colour is red, I'm not sure why, I just like it.<br>I like my potatoes to be served cooked.<br>My favourite season would probably be summer because you go out and do so many things, and also because daylight savings, so it doesn't go dark until 9pm.<br>If I was a food I would be a Tic Tac, just because I'm eating one now :)<br><br>So that's my life story, I hope you enjoyed!

I like the hotdogs so far they're pretty 8/8, but seriously Nebula is my favourite game mode and on the forums I like how everyone is friendly and how they have a sense of humour.<br>:)
