i first saw you on spectre which made me remember your name. then you went LFT multiple times and contacted you on like 99% of the time. then you joined us for the stratus tm and we know the result.&nbsp;<br><br>good pvp, listens, not salty, can carry and talks not too much, not too less either. nice person - its fun to play with you :3 id say you are the kind of player that benefits every team in a way except when a roster is full xd

yo sam. so where do i start? well you trialled for oktgang and you played many scrims with us - thats for sure. in the beginning your playstyle kinda annoyed me, but you adapted really well. as a person you sometimes slightly annoyed me bc youre an ambitious person, but i appreciate that kind of player :3 you became nicer everyday we played. if you wanna play more stratus scrims or need a team tell me boi :-D

hey gitano. i dont really have an opinion on you, but from what i've heard you get memed alot. even though i told the ppl from my team that said "omg dont tryout gitano" that ima give the persons that apply an equal chance. whatever, you seem to be a mix of nice, crazy, but much to naive... a little hint: try to find the real intention of what people say to you. dont believe everything you are told if cant be atleast 80% sure.

first of all you still dont get what an AMA is. im going to explain it to you now: AMA (=<b>ask</b> me anything, or so). you just flamed the shit out of this thread which is not on the topic and belongs to the #off-topic channel. (preferring the stratus discord for that to make amactus happy)<br><br>the second thing is that i never said that there is a context in between the language i consider to be your foreign language and the lack of understanding of the word "asking" or "to ask". srry that i dont explain everything step by step for people that need explanations, but your name gives some information about your language.&nbsp;<b>you&nbsp;</b>now said that if you dont understand something your whole language doesnt which is pretty stupid. please activate your brain now (if you have one) and think carefully before posting shit into other ppls ama's. thank you!

ich schreib das mal auf deutsch:<br><br>hallo erstmal. eigentlich kenn ich dich ja nicht wirklich, aber die tatsache, dass du als deutscher spieler kein bedwars spast bist, macht dich einfach schonmal extrem symphatisch. warst auch immer ganz chillig im discord und du kannst auch über dich selber lachen :&gt; als spieler hast du zwar noch verbesserungspotential, aber als person bist du echt mega korrekt.
