Pie, you're a great friend, a smart kid, and a great leader. You will do great things in life.<br><br>The focus of avicus? I'm not too into being in a fame position so if you mean like being admin or something, I'm not interested. I prefer to help avicus from the inside.<br><br>Well for the moderators, hack detection. For the senior staff team, communication and problem solving.<br><br>I believe you and rese have done a great job with the community slack. Keep it up!

It's tough at times, but it feels good to help out and ban those hackers.<br><br>Again tough at times, but lots of fun. Mostly tough when you ban someone and there's backlash.<br><br>Sure!<br><br>Yes!<br><br>Like I mentioned above.
