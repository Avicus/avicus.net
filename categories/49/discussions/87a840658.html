You seem like a pretty cool nerd but you seem to get pissed sometimes. I haven't really spoken with you but I would speak with you in game lol.<br><br>For your pee fee pee skills i would rate 7.8/10 because I feel that you still have a lot of space for improvement.<br><br>Celestial...where do I begin. The team is actually pretty good, player wise, but communication is our main problem preventing us from being a "good" team. Myself to blame because I don't have a mic lol...<br><br>I have no opinions on cuish other than it reminds me of weed...

Your communication is on point and your pvp skills are op...for some reason you still deal me so much kb even though I have like a quarter of your ping xD. I feel that you have come very far as you used to be shit at pvp and you literally could not aim properly, but now you're a g0d on CelestiaL. You're a very chill person but sometimes you have a pretty bad temper lol. You're a great friend and human and Megan is very lucky to have you.

i haven't really played with you on the same team but based on what I hear about you, how you play in tm's, and how you perform when we 1v1 I would say that you are a great player and you carry basically any team that you play on besides public but who really cares about public lol. You are a very strong and reliable pvp-er with really sketchy double hits because of your ping, but you seem very legit to me. Well that's about it, good luck in the next tourney if you're participating.

Hey Koja, I haven't really talked to you all that much by voice, but we've talked a couple times in game. You seem to me like a really chill person in general and as moderator I find that you do your job well and that you aren't super sweaty to go that extra mile to give an infraction. However, to be honest, I kind of feel that sometimes you get triggered and say things in chat that mods probably shouldn't say to be a good example but idk if you're joking or not.&nbsp;<br><br>On on the other hand I remember playing with you on Necromancy a long time ago as xSped and it was actually quite fun lol, but then I decided to quit for like 6 months so idk what happened...I don't remember much but I remember that you were a really easy to kill player but now that you have improved, you are much harder and kill and i think you'll grow to be a very strong comptivite player if you increase in skill the way you are increasing. Anyways, good luck in the competitive scene and good job collecting ranks like Posighdun xD

<p>HIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII CIANNNN</p><p>I haven't really spoken to you all the much during your time at Celestial but mostly because I don't have a mic but I have played with you and I'd say that you're an incredibly experienced player who is very reliable in scrims and doesn't casually fall into the void like me :3. I remember a couple months ago I thought you were so easy, but now that you have improved, you're actually a great competitive player. On the other hand, I have always found your play strategy to be pretty skillful, but I find that sometimes during scrim, you would get easily frustrated and that would affect the performance of you and the team. However, when you're optimistic, I find that our team did well with you as our carry. </p><p><br></p><p>Discord because I can actually talk on it and make memes. :3</p><p><br></p><p>I put Milk first because that is the right way @lolHenry</p><p><br></p><p>P.S. Nice job getting into Apollo. All the best :3</p>

<p>HEY OKIBAAA (Nate)</p><p>I used to play with you a long time ago like I think 2015 or early 2016. I remember you used to be really bad, but now you've improved vastly and can peeveepee good. I used to find you incredibly annoying, not because of who you were, but because of your kb that you deal lol. You deal so much kb ;3. I don't really talk with you all the much now, but you seem to be a pretty chill and funny guy with good memes. Also, I basically stole your last name change. Ty for that lol... Anyways, pce</p>

I'm not banned because there is nothing offensive about my name. I don't believe that homosexuality is correct, but since it's legalized in a couple of countries, I assume it should be allowed. Also, I checked with multiple staff and none of them said no<br><br>Nice....<br><br>Yes I like memes

<p>I have not spoken to you ever so I wouldn't say I have opinions on you as a person, but your mineman skills are pretty good. I find that you are actually a competent player on this server and not a casual. It's fun to do scrims against you and your team...</p><p>I honestly haven't eaten ice cream in more than 8 months so I don't know lol.
