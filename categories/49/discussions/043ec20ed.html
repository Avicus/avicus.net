you're a good friend and pretty much always nice to talk to. you're learning fast and probably one of the best defenders i know.&nbsp;<br>sometimes you can be a little bit mean but you also say it's a joke but when you say it im not sure if it's a joke or if you actually mean it lol. but yea ur probs just joking with me when u say that kinda stuff.<br>im not really actually sure what to say more about you but i guess it's because we havent talked to each other in a while but yea, overall good pvper &amp; defender and rlly nice friend.

one of my best friends on minecraft &amp; avicus. when we talked recently (like more of a private talk and not in a scrim) we had really fun. you've improved alot when it comes to pvp which is good. when i first joined celestial &nbsp;// newdawn i didnt really like you as a leader. i believe i thought you were quite bad at strating and that we pretty much used to lose when you lead, i never told you anything cus ye know :). now, i think you're a great leader and it feels like you know what ur doing (which i dont lol). it feels like you can play most positions apart from actually defender.&nbsp;<br>overall you're a really good friend and pvper, also really nice to talk to but i guess i havent talked to you that much lately either but i guess when we've been talking it's been really fun but i guess it's because of my ban etc.

don't know you at all, i've seen you sometimes in discord but only talking about Walls. i remember i was in your team NewQrysis a couple of months ago but then it disbanded because you got banned or something i believe.

you're a really nice person, also really chill. you're a good pvper and also really good at strating. I haven't talked to yiu lately probs cus you joined jala and cus of my ban but i guess from all the times we've talked it's been fun apart from all the shit scrims. You're a very chill person overall and i dont think ive ever heard you rage or actually get angry lver something which i guess is good ?<br>we'd talk more tho<br><br>not rlly sure, your ping is both an advantage and a didadvantage so ill say 7:10

Havent actually talked to you apart from in scrims. You're a great player and same as poofy very chill. You dont get angry xd. A legit team carry here imo, i remember back in the days when ur ign was WenaErmano or something i used to think you cheated but i guess you were just good. Still can't actually tell but its up to you. If you say you dont cheat i trust you :) Also a really nice person and you're also fast improving like alot of other players here minecraft. Not rlly sure what to say more :o

you're a very nice person overall. but i find / found you quite annoying since you kept making weird posts on the website, like lft's for all the good teams when you were banned. you also kept spamming me on discord literally every single day which also was pretty frkn annoying. i dont really know if you're good at pvp or not because i havent fought you that many times. i haven't played with you many times aswell. but i guess you're pretty good at pvp etc.
