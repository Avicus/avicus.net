When I first saw you become a junior mod, I was very, very, very confused. I had no idea who you were and was astonished that they had given the rank to you. Then, later on, I got to know you a little and regretted disliking that you had become junior and realized that was pretty dumb of me. You aren't my friend, and i dont mean that in a bad way at all, but I think it'd be fun if we did talk more. I still don't really know you well, but I hope that changes soon. :]<br><br><br>good good

I don't know, to be honest. I remember you being immature back when you were sheamus14414 or whatever, but thats certainly faded away now. I think you do a nice job as a senior, but don't personally see you standing out from the rest.<br><br>I don't have any goals anymore. If the new xp thing their bringing is good, i may come back and try to reach prestiges, but other than that, my goals have long since disappeared. I'd like to become a mentor though, so there's that I guess.

A lot of times you act too professional and it annoys a lot of people. I think this is the main reason a lot of people think badly of you, and I feel if sometimes you just laid back a little it would help.<br><br>Vanilla chocolate-chip cookie dough.

I'm going to be 100% honest, I liked you better before you started minimodding. It's not that I hate you now, I just tend to dislike it when anyone changes who they are to increase their chances of becoming staff. But, considering you're a junior now, I was probably wrong to judge so quick; with the couple of &nbsp;hours I spent moderating with you in-game, you seem determined to learn and you take feedback quite well. Keep it up. I'd also like it if we could talk more, as both friends and staff members. :]

I don't like you, and I'm pretty sure most of thr community could say the same. You spend all this time on the forums, slack, and server just to troll and it tends to get on people's nerves. I hope you can change for the better some time soon.
