When I first saw you become a junior mod, I was very, very, very confused. I had no idea who you were and was astonished that they had given the rank to you. Then, later on, I got to know you a little and regretted disliking that you had become junior and realized that was pretty dumb of me. You aren't my friend, and i dont mean that in a bad way at all, but I think it'd be fun if we did talk more. I still don't really know you well, but I hope that changes soon. :]<br><br><br>good good

I don't know, to be honest. I remember you being immature back when you were sheamus14414 or whatever, but thats certainly faded away now. I think you do a nice job as a senior, but don't personally see you standing out from the rest.<br><br>I don't have any goals anymore. If the new xp thing their bringing is good, i may come back and try to reach prestiges, but other than that, my goals have long since disappeared. I'd like to become a mentor though, so there's that I guess.

A lot of times you act too professional and it annoys a lot of people. I think this is the main reason a lot of people think badly of you, and I feel if sometimes you just laid back a little it would help.<br><br>Vanilla chocolate-chip cookie dough.

I'm going to be 100% honest, I liked you better before you started minimodding. It's not that I hate you now, I just tend to dislike it when anyone changes who they are to increase their chances of becoming staff. But, considering you're a junior now, I was probably wrong to judge so quick; with the couple of &nbsp;hours I spent moderating with you in-game, you seem determined to learn and you take feedback quite well. Keep it up. I'd also like it if we could talk more, as both friends and staff members. :]
