Oh, god, Adrian xD<br>Classic Goldie questions, go!<br>1. What's your favorite color and why?<br>2. If you had one wish to benefit yourself (No donating to charity or anything), what would it be?<br>3. What do you think the meaning of existence is?<br>4. Can you easily do 56/24 in your head? (In under 10 seconds)<br>5. Is your power level over 9000?&nbsp;<br>6. If you were a food, what would you be and why?<br>7. If you were to use a common household object to fight in the zombie appocolypse (Microwave, chair, et cetera), what would it be and why?<br>8. If you could choose to be an animal and still had the power to morph back into a human any time you wanted, what would it be and why?

Actually, that happens alot! :O<br><br>See, my eyes shift on a fine line between gray and blue. Usually, my eyes will be blue if I'm outside or taking a shower, that kinda stuff, but if I'm inside all day on a computer, or sleeping, my eyes are pretty much steel gray.<br><br>MIND BLOWN

Now say brown eyes are the dominant trait and gray eyes are the recessive trait. You have gray eyes and you marry a brown-eyed hot Asian. She is a oriented dominant. You are purebred recessive. Now say you have a child. What is the chance of having a gray eyes child?<br><br>If you don't get it I'll tell you what the chance is.
