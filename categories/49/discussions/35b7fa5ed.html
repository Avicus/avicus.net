Hey.<br>Im going to cut straight to the point. I'm sorry. I'm apologizing to the entire Avicus server and community. I sincerely am from the bottom of my heart. The last few months I've been doing nothing but trolling. Mainly I've been just angry at everyone. I was emotionless throughout school and life. &nbsp;I really want to say sorry. I've offended numerous players (I'm well aware) and I see that my past actions are intolerable. Ill write it out as many times as you want until my fingers start to bleed. I've tried to change over the course of the month. I have no idea if you've noticed a difference, but I've tried.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>For the most part, this may or may not continue. If I do something that is offending someone and I'm not aware of it, link me to this post and tell me to shut my trap. I don't know what other people see me as, which is part of the issue. If you have any suggestions to help me improve my character, I'd be immensely grateful.&nbsp;<br><br>Also, I've decided to attempt to go back and delete all of my offense posts. If there are any objections, Id very much like to know. Also, If there are any mods that would care to volunteer in helping me do this, my skype is mlgtino and we can discuss a time to meet and start cutting down on my bullshit. I need lots of help since I am overly active on the forums, therefore I have many pages of posts to go through.&nbsp;<br><br>Anyways, I really am sorry. Whether or not you choice to accept it is your option. Just know that I understand my own issues and will be trying to change for a better future. If this doesn't happen, I'll just leave.&nbsp;<br><br><br>Thank ink you for your time and understanding. If there's anything else of importance that I feel I missed, I'll add it in right away. How about we start over? Great :)

See, when I apologize all I get is a bunch of hate and people telling me I'm cocky and arrogant. Sure I did a fair share of trolling and I'm sorry for that but seriously what's the reason? Is it because my skin is brown? If that's the case then lol... Anyways it was nice of you to apologize Tino, hopefully you don't get as much hate as I did.

He doesn't have an attitude, the reason why people dislike you is because they think you're arrogant and you get overexcited when you do something. I'm not saying <b><i><u>I </u></i></b>think you're arrogant I'm just saying others are.

One thing I like about this post, is it reminds me of a thread I made somewhere else. Same structure, same.. word choices. If your words are as genuine as mine were, I'm happy to see this. You're a chill guy, so this'll just make ya even more lovely. :P<br><br>Don't disappoint me &lt;3

He does act really cold In-Game and towards me, regardless of my attempts to be chill and friendly. I've given up until he can show that he's changed a bit. I've legitimately done nothing to him and still get treated so poorly.&nbsp;<br><br>And that had nothing to do with that comment whatsoever. Thousandth time you've said that
