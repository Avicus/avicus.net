</h1>
I'll give a quick rundown of who I am and then you guys can ask me questions :)<br><br>So I am StaticFaultz (otherwise known as "Coby" [irl name]), and I've been playing Minecraft for around 3 or so years. I am nearing 13 years of age and it's been fun so far, playing Minecraft. The most notable server I've joined so far is the Overcast Network. No, I did not come from the Overcast Network because I was demoted or banned or anything. I just wanted to try out Avicus (its been nice so far). Speaking of demotion, I am actually a moderator on the Overcast Network.<br><br>Some of the things I do outside Overcast, Avicus, and Minecraft in general include photography, graphic designing, tiny bit of coding (still on the simple HTML5 stage), swimming (recreationally because I have a public pool nearby) and hiking. I live in Hawaii (more specifically, Oahu).

Awkward comparison, but I'd rather be a fish because of its' "liveliness". You get eaten as a pie. Fish do get eaten, but you die first. Pies don't even live.

You are under a lot of pressure when you're moderating a big network like the Overcast Network. In ways it is hard (like having to deal with tons of reports and appeals), but it still is fun.

@Thecalined: Frontline (offensive defense). I played for Wolves in Quebec on Overcast, and it was essentially my job. I start up skybridges, knock out opponents before they get to my teams' objectives.<br><br>@_CubeRoot: I had art as an elective period/class during 7th grade. Since it was a lot better than my previous schools' art classes, I was inspired to do stuff on my own with what they taught me.
