That's hard.<br>I'd rather get a million dollars and send in an application for mod than just become a moderator altogether. I want to prove to myself I can get to moderator.

Hostile-- you get most of the good stuff you need from them.<br>You could play a whole world without the need of peaceful mobs because all they give you is food.<br>If you have skeletons and no pigs, you could just kill the skeletons, make bone meal, make a farm, and have a surplus of food. You also need a blaze rods and ender pearls to beat the Ender Dragon, sooo.. xD<br>Always live half the time in complete sadness and half the time in complete happiness, or never feel happiness or sadness?
