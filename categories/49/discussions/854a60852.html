Opinions: Hi Koja! For opinions as a player I think you actually know how to play the game and are a great player on Apollo. You've improved so much since the old Necromancy a long time ago. However, I feel like you still have quite a lot of space for improvement, so make sure to work hard (if you want to continue minecraft).<br><br>Opinions as a person: You're a good mod who is able to be chill and funny but also able to be serious and make sure stuff gets done. I hope promotion soon :p<br><br>Favourite pizza topping: PINEAPPLE....jk I like pepperoni and Italian sausage<br><br>Predict for T7: I'm going to throw the entire tournament;-;

Opinions: hey Allen! I think you’re a pretty good competitive player but you could use some work on your team fighting skills + comms. I know a lot of people say you hack but I know you’re legit lol. As a person, I’d say you’re pretty cool and it was fun snapping you random stuff.<br><br>I changed my bitmoji so now it has headphones

Opinions; hey squid! I think you’re a decent player in terms of competitive, but there is still a large space for improvement. As a person, you seem really chill and laid back, but when you have to do something as mod, you actually do it.<br><br>What you can work on to get better at pvp: I would say that you should strafe more and click and aim properly...but you’re probably already doing that. My advice is to practice....or you could just move to Canada and get like 20ms like me :))<br><br>I actually really like onions...green onions, red onions, white onions...well it depends what the onions are in but I don’t mind them
