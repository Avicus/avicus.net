You said AMA, so I'm going to ask you straight up, and give you a reason for my question. :)<br>Before I start, welcome back!<br><br>1. How do you learn the maps in 3 days? x-ray? I have noticed that the new maps, that were added while you were gone, you know them better then anyone, and I've gotten VERY suspicious of you. This is not made to hate on you, or how good you are, but at the same time, you know the maps MUCH better then anyone who's been playing these maps for months, and you've been playing 3 days. You've been calling yourself the "walls god' but I personally 100% disagree, you're not a walls god.. I'm sorry to say. You are good, I can't disagree with that, but you're not a god. ;p Plus with my suspicion of you having x-ray makes this harder for me to think about. I would also like to point out that these maps are harder to learn then before, the maps that you used to play on were not that hard to learn, if you played enough, but the new maps are <b>much</b> harder to learn and take a lot more time.&nbsp;(I picked this first because I've been wondering since you told me that you were un-banned, and you'e been playing 2 days, at the time, and you knew the maps better then I've seen anyone know them.)&nbsp;<b><i><u>This was not made for a hate/report. I am just&nbsp;curious,&nbsp;</u></i></b><i><u></u></i><u></u> &nbsp;;) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>2.

I got one of your alts banned (ban evading) and there is I think I've hear about 4 other alts, (ban evading). Why is that not an instant ban? And I have a very good reason to beleive you have x-ray, and I explained why. I'm not harassing you.

<b><b>This is not meant to flame or harass, I'm just genuinely curious.</b><br><br></b>first off, welcome back :) I got to talk to you the other day in teamspeak a little bit, and you sound like a nice enough guy :)&nbsp; what I would like to know is why you would take someone asking a question on an AMA is harassment? He did give his point, and while I disagree about how long it takes to know any map that is as small as the ones I've seen recently, but he did give his opinion. You could have just given a general response that you aren't using xray (which I believe you aren't) and explain how you know the maps as well as you do. <br><br><br>As to continuing to argue on the accusation, I would just suggest to stop responding to it, as they will only continue to argue. People have their opinions, and it will always be based on what they know and what they assume. Just provide them with accurate true information and let them take it as they will, knowing you can't and shouldn't put more effort into it since it is just a game after all.<br><b></b>

So you said your getting harassed, yet he said in his post that he isn't harassing you like 3 times. I don't know how you got that idea. I just want you to know that we are NOT harassing you, and that the past is the past. All of us make mistakes. Just look at my infractions page .-.<br><br>No one can deny that humans are curious as hell. This is proof. We just find it weird that you got unbanned after ban evading a lot. That's all.<br><br>@OP Welcome back Sheep ;)<br><br>I'm bad at asking questions for AMAs so brace yourself xD. Plus I'm a computer nerd.<br><br>PC specs? xP

Look, you hardly know anything about the reason for his ban. I suggest instead of harassing him for reasons that don't concern you at all, you either stay on topic and ask a question or just stay off his thread.

You can stop, now. If you have a problem with someone being unbanned, then instead of arguing on a topic meant to introduce someone, talk to an admin. Thanks.

First, don't call my friend an idiot<br><br>Secondly, He made a deal with an admin. DaGoldBrick got banned 11 times (Altogether web bans and in game bans) generally ingame bans. Dawson has been banned <b>once </b>and ban evaded an equal amount of times as DaGoldbrick has. Its perfectly fair in my eyes.
