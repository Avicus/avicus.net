yes :P I did't realise until now xd<br><br><br>So far I'd say it feels ok, I'm not overly sure since I had to log off like a half hour after getting it and I didn't get to do much since it was just getting training.

Hi, I'm dcstarwars. I played on avicus a long time ago, and now I came back to help with tournaments and have been lucky enough to be accepted by the staff to help them moderate servers as well :) If you want to learn more about me you can always poke me in teamspeak, and assuming I'm not overly busy at that time I'll have a chat with you :)

IDK, I honestly think that I can do a good job helping the community. I put myself out there for staff to decide, and they decided to give me a shot. Do I think I deserve it? Probably, I applied, so doesn't that mean that I thought I deserved it by applying in the first place?

You have a day spent on Avicus and before sending in your application you struggled to meet the "1 day playtime" requirement. Do you think you know the community well enough to be a moderator on this server? Don't you think that it's unfair for regulars?

if you have an issue with it then bring it up elsewhere. I have played avicus a lot more than the web says, as well as having spent a lot of time assisting with things other than playing on the server. just because someone doesn't physically play on the server doesn't mean that they aren't any less deservant of positions. I applied, the senior staff team had every right to deny me, but they obviously saw potential in me and gave me a shot. If this is stemming off of you not getting accepted or something I had nothing to do with it, but its not like i just applied -&gt; insta jr mod. I had to go through the same process as every other staff member.

I apologise if what I wrote sounded rude or like I was hating on you. I didn't intend to cause any harm or salt. Anyways, congrats on junior mod! :)
