Pretty good. Exams are over and about to break up for holidays but laptop went into kamikaze mode so no more games for me for a while. Should set up a charity for a new one. :'(

Tazz<br><br><i>Opinion</i><br><br>Never really liked you. First time I met you I didn't really know who you were. When I joined the staff team, I really began to dislike you. You came off as arrogant, bitchy and fairly bratty (yes, I know the first one is pretty much kettle calling the pot black). You also seemed to have an extreme superiority complex, where once you knew how to do something no one else could possibly know how to either.&nbsp;<br><br>Rockyyyyy<br><br><i>Opinions?</i><br><br>Awesome guy, pretty good at PvP.

Joe! It's been way too long! How have you been? :D<br><i><br></i><i>Opinions</i><i>?&nbsp;</i>Honestly, you were my favourite staff member and still are one of my favourite people on this server. You're a really nice guy who's not afraid to stick up for yourself and stand up to people when you think they're wrong, but you're also really laidback and know what to take seriously and what not to. You also have a great sense of humour.&nbsp;<br><br>Negative things about you? You don't have Snapchat. Sad now. :( ;)
