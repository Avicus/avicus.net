I don't think we have talked that much so i can't really say much, sorry :(<br>It's quite interesting how it will end up, i hope for the goodies but anything can happen.<br>The community is the core of this server, so the community!<br>The only thing i mislike about Avicus is about the atlas update, the kills doesn't count. :(<br>Yeah, but it will take it's time, but certainly it will grow!<br>I don't know, win a tourney would be amazing!<br>I'm not really checking and such but Eric is a good candidate.
