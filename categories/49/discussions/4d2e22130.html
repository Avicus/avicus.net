Hello everyone, my name is OPTOBAT.<br>Some of you will know this, as i am currently working hard on a YouTube channel<br><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad0ID1R2iak">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ad0ID1R2iak</a><br>That link is my passion. To many, MANY people it's just an ad, but this small trailer could be the key to a success that just seems impossible nowadays.<br>I am trying to start my channel unique; with Nebula. Before each and every series i do, a trailer comes before to build up excitement. That is how i would like to operate my channel and hopefully create a buzz to my fans :)<br>Sitting at a mere 3,4,5 subscribers does put doubt into my mind, and LITERALLY every 1 subscriber refuels my hope, so please, click the above link and insert hope into my channel and i promise you, your name will not be forgotten if my passion escalates.<br>Thank you everyone - OPTOBAT

No that makes sense, the thing is, it wasn't that i was asking for the NUMBER of subscribers, i guess i was just asking to have some people show their backing for me, but thanks for the advice, ill try to just earn my subs now :)<br><br>Oh and by the way can you please subscribe?<br>Haha, just kidding XD

You're starting to spam the forums with all of your youtube links and stuff ._. If you come out with a video, then post it under media, but please stop posting links to your channel for seemingly no reason.&nbsp;<br>Thanks.

A subscriber has to look forward to your videos, a returning subscriber will only stay and return to your videos if you have something he or she is looking forward to. A person you beg to subscribe will not stay or even look forward to your videos, that's what you have to work on. An example now, if you record a lets play of Minecraft and I've looked on one or two videos, at the end of your video I have to think "What will happen next?" and be interested of what actually will happen, a returning subscriber will look forward to every video.<br><br>Remember, there's over thousands of Minecraft channels, you have to be unique. If you are able to make your channel and lets plays unique, I will subscribe :)

I realise now, that you are completely right, and tests why i make a trailer before every series; to get the level of excitement rising and to have something to look forward too, but i guess you're right about the mistake i made, where i actually ASKED for subscribers, but it wasn't really like that for me. I wasn't asking for a NUMBER, i was asking for people to show me that they would have their support during my journey on YouTube.<br>So ill take your advice and ill try to make my channel with more excitement, rather then asking, thanks - OPTOBAT.

Can you please stop commenting about your YouTube. If people cared then you would only need one thread. If you want subs I recommend recording a&nbsp;<u><b>good&nbsp;</b></u>video unlike your trailer which was compiled from bad footage pieced &nbsp;together badly. And uploading it in the media section. If it is good enough people will check it out, subscribe and like.<br><br><br>no offence intended :)<u></u>

ahahaha, no offence intended? Well, man you did a pretty bad job of THAT part, and secondly i stopped making discussions about my channel days ago, this was my last one, the only reason its still on the page is that people keep posting replies, and i don't ignore everyone, which is why I'm replying to you.<br>I personally thought there was room for improvement in my trailer, but i didn't think it was just "bad footage pieced together badly", but if you would like to be negative and sound miserable, then go ahead :)<br>Have a good day - OPTOBAT

I think there was offence intended, just you want to sound logical. His trailer was good, and you are just hating. Go home build_high, you're drunk.

Isn't this your channel?<br>OPTOBAT said in an earlier post that he was advertising for his friend miningflamingo's channel.<br>&nbsp;Why can't you do your advertising yourself or balance it? And his trailer wasn't good, there have been a whole load of trailers from small you tubers like cinnamon croc who used good footage using f1 for displaying maps. I would insert a link to it but I can't post after I insert a link.also I am at home and 100% sober so...
