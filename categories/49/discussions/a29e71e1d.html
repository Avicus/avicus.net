ok guys so i just checked to see if my original name (my 1st name on this server and in minecraft) was available and it was so ive pretty much decided to name myself back to iTerraCubist for a few reasons which im guessing you guys would know but lemme just tell you how i lost the name before, it was pretty much due to getting my 1st acc with that name getting hacked and i couldnt recover it so yeah, after being out of the name for 8 months i actually wanted to bring it back like the old days.<br><br>Now ill just be having an AMA for now for my somewhat "Return" i guess you could say idk xD<br><br>Feel free to ask me anything, probs maybe about resourcepacks since some of you know me as a pack maker for youtubers like Solrflare, ImToxic21, Unfuggetable, BiboyQG, etc.
