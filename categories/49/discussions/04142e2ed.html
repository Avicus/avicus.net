Hello, I'm NewVoltdrive, a new series of robotic blaze that is twice as swaggy, twice as hot, and twice as bad at Minecraft. And, just like modern technology, looks exactly the same as the previous version.&nbsp;So, without further adieu, I shall answer some probably-going-to-be FAQs. Feel free to ask questions that aren't addressed here.<br><br><br><b>What happened to OldVoltdrive?<br></b>WE DON'T TALK ABOUT DEFECTS.<br><br><b>How old are you?</b><br>As of typing this, 447,864,230 seconds old.<br><br><b>How ez r u?<br></b>ERROR. Lowest value exceeded.<br><br><b>How long have you been on Avicus?<br></b>Ummm...I logged on in MC Zone b4, and I have a double-digit ID number.<br><br><b>Face reveal?<br></b><img title="Image: http://www.firecrackercommunications.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Gordonramsay.jpg" class="mainImage" src="http://www.firecrackercommunications.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Gordonramsay.jpg"><br><br><br><br>

A good first attempt. It's plenty dank... I can tell it's got some thought behind it... lots of quotable material... But memeing isn't all sunshine and rainbows, kid. You're skilled... that much I can tell. But do you have what it takes to be a Memester? To join those esteemed meme ranks? To call yourself a member of the Ruseman's Corps? Memeing takes talent, that much is true. But more than that it takes heart. The world-class Memesters - I mean the big guys, like Johnny Hammersticks and Billy Kuahana - they're out there day and night, burning the midnight meme-oil, working tirelessly to craft that next big meme. And you know what, kid? 99 times out of a hundred, that new meme fails. Someone dismisses it as bait, or says it's "tryhard," or ignores it as they copy/paste the latest shitpost copypasta dreamt up by those sorry excuses for cut-rate memers over at reddit. The Meme Game is rough, kid, and I don't just mean the one you just lost :). It's a rough business, and for every artisan meme you craft in your meme bakery, some dumbass at 9gag has a picture of a duck or some shit that a million different Johnny No-Names will attach a milion different captions to. Chin up, kid. Don't get all mopey on me. You've got skill. You've got talent. You just need to show your drive. See you on the forums...</span>

What's this you've said to me, my good friend? Ill have you know I graduated top of my class in conflict resolution, and Ive been involved in numerous friendly discussions, and I have over 300 confirmed friends. I am trained in polite discussions and I'm the top mediator in the entire neighborhood. You are worth more to me than just another target. I hope we will come to have a friendship never before seen on this Earth. Don't you think you might be hurting someone's feelings saying that over the internet? Think about it, my friend. As we speak I am contacting my good friends across the USA and your P.O. box is being traced right now so you better prepare for the greeting cards, friend. The greeting cards that help you with your hate. You should look forward to it, friend. I can be anywhere, anytime for you, and I can calm you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my chess set. Not only am I extensively trained in conflict resolution, but I have access to the entire group of my friends and I will use them to their full extent to start our new friendship. If only you could have known what kindness and love your little comment was about to bring you, maybe you would have reached out sooner. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now we get to start a new friendship, you unique person. I will give you gifts and you might have a hard time keeping up. You're finally living, friend.
