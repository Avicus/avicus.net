As a person u r a really nice and chill. I really enjoyed talking to u back when avicus we like still a thing lol. But tbh u seem really toxic to random people in game that u don’t know which is actually pretty funny sometimes xd.&nbsp;<br><br>As as a player u r a really good defender who understands how to make good defenses based off the meta, terrain and resources. Pretty much all of ur defenses follow the meta tbh. U r able to melee really well but ur weakness is u lag so like if u get comboed u really just can’t get out of it but of course the opposite can be said as well. I don’t really think u have any weaknesses as a defender except u lag quite a bit so maybe that makes shooting difficult and building defenses because block lag.

As a person ur pretty nice and fun to talk with . Ur pretty funny as well back when we talked so much shit about fouled which was hilarious&nbsp;<br><br>as a player u r a really underrated offender. After watching some of ur montages I think u r really good mechanically u pretty much can click fast and accurate but I think u need to react to the knock back to get the double hit quicker especially when u have eu ping. If u r able to do that u will legit be unstoppable like u don’t even need to strafe and u will shit on everyone. Also keep in mind that u have over 100 ping which means if u hit people from a certain distance they wouldn’t be able to hit u because of lag. I really don’t think u will lose a 1v1 against anyone if u can remember these two things tbh

As a person i think ur quite social like u go to parties and shit and ur pretty cool maybe thats a thing in the uk but no one in australia does that and if they do that then they would be smoking bongs and taking e so that shit a little too g for me. why do u never post on ur story is that also a trend in the uk or something i have no idea lol. Otherwise ur quite nice<br><br>As a player ur above average but could get better at pvp. u r a really good leader and can hold the team together really well. Although celestial usually underperforms for some reason, i still think its a good team that can reach the top soon enough. imo u should try to recruit more randies who r dedicated to the game and r willing to improve through badlion pug games rather than trying to get experienced players although this is just my opinion.
