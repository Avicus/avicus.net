The time of the tournament today is really inconvenient for anyone outside of the EU. For US player's it's pretty early morning. (Especially California and Vancouver). My team, UbeR probably won't be enough to participate or be 7 for the entirety of today. GL to the all EU teams.&nbsp;<br><br>I don't see why the timing is so fucked up but whatever. Whoever picked it is pretty inconsiderate :)!

The reason the timing is the way it is is because of the people with Asian timezones and Australian timezones. These are the only real times to cater for all the timezones. I do agree with this tho, but it just happens that these are the best times for the majority of people.

No, the times can´t be changed 45 minutes before the start of the invitationals. The officials know that, some officials are from USA and they can be there. Also, are teams like Team Allah where mostly of the member are form USA and the´ll show up. The officials said the times more than 1 month ago and now you are traing that the official change it?

Yes unfortunately Australian timezones have to suffer :'( but that's only because the Australian competitive player base is the smallest out of all the other competitive player bases. For me, I'm Asian timezone, it's 11pm to 3am (But I don't mind tbh).

so what your saying is the only place that doesn't "suffer" is UK timezone / EU timezone which is still difficult since it's midday on the Weekend and people might be busy :D

Unlike servers such as OCN, Avicus has a huge Asian/Australian player base so we do have to cater for all time zones. If you cared enough for this tournament I'm sure your players would wake up early for it.

How about 5pm BST? That way you could cater NA/SA/EU and some parts of Asia and Australia
