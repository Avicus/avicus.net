Ranks are required to buy multiple trails, badges and gadgets?<br><br>This is bs. As a server, you are just asking for more people to donate, and I can assure you this is not going to happen.<br><br>Can't everything be attainable for everyone? Say if you have saved 100k for the Omega badge, only to find you can't get it because you have not donated.<br><br>If there's ONE thing that could improve this update, scrap that idea, it's pointless and biased.<br><br>Myv.

People pay to get services that are not available for normal users! That's how a business works. Out of all the cosmetic things, this shouldn't really be that much of a complaint.

When did you join? Avicus had donor perks like these since the beginning but they were taken out because of the dumb EULA. Do you not recall donors getting grenades in nebula?

If the omega badge is really so much of a problem then maybe make it available for non-upgraded users but with a steeper price? I don't really think it's needed, but if people want it...
