So, about a week and a half ago, I saw this thread and I saw that the staff team were working on contacting youtubers and more. I don't know where I got this from, but I saw a comment that said "We are starting to advertise in the next week". It has been nearly 2 weeks now and I would like to know when these things are going to happen or are they happening right now behind the scenes. Also I made a new thread on this because I couldn't reply to it since it was in the "Ask the Seniors" section, anyways, thankyou for reading. :D

I think it's weird how they're focusing on advertising&nbsp;<i>after&nbsp;</i>Atlas has been released.<br><br>If they were this serious with advertising before Atlas came out, they could have used the update as a point of interest to garner new players.<br><br>But they've missed that opportunity and the player count hasn't increased at all since the update.<br><br>Which is what was supposed to happen, apparently.

I suppose they could have planned to have a new update released so that when new players would join they would get hooked without having to wait for any improvements.
