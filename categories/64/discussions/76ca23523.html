<div>Hello! dev_revs and I have created an unofficial tournament called 'The Summer Round'. This is an unofficial tournament; further information is below.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Gamemode:&nbsp;</b>CTW</div><div><br></div><div><b>Server:</b> Avicus</div><div><br></div><div><b>Tournament format:</b> There will be a round robin in the group stage. This means that each team will play each other once in a bo1, instead of a bo3 due to a bo3 taking too long and players may like to not participate in too many matches in a long period.</div><div>After this, will be the final stage where 1st and 2nd will play each other in the finals and 3rd and 4th will play for 3rd place. The matches in the final stage are a bo3.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Match information:</b> 6 players minimum must be fielded. 8 players maximum can be fielded. Each match will be 45 minutes long.<br><u></u><i>Challonge:<br></i><a href="http://challonge.com/avicussummertourney">http://challonge.com/avicussummertourney</a><i><br></i><i>Captured wools table:&nbsp;</i><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11eAa-8P8PDDKv5DsU6dVets2BmVU25TjCSiGZsupEhs">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11eAa-8P8PDDKv5DsU6dVets2BmVU25TjCSiGZsupEhs</a><br></div><div><br><b>Team registration:</b><br></div><div>Registration <b><u>closed</u></b> on the 6th of August.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Spectating:</b> Event-staff in this tournament may watch the match if they're not doing anything. Players (who are not playing) who are in one of the teams which are playing, may spectate but must have their mic muted in their teams' channel. There will most likely be a livestream for people who'd like to watch the matches.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Starting times:</b> Teams will be given a maximum of 10 minutes after the starting time. If there are not enough players after 10 minutes, the other team will have the win, counted as a 'no show'.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Disqualifications:</b><br></div><div>Teams who are given tactical information, will be given a warning and the player will be suspended from the next match of the tournament. If it continues again, they will be disqualified from the tournament. If a team uses someone who is not on their roster, they will be instantly disqualified. If a player is banned during their match from their team, the team will also be instantly disqualified. All avicus rules still apply as we're using an avicus service. When a decision is made, it is final. We will not disqualify a team without there being solid proof.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Tiebreaking:</b> If two teams are tied, it will be decided by another scheduled match.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Map Pool:&nbsp;</b></div><div>The maps which will be played during the tournament are the following:</div><div>Wahiz CTW,</div><div>Rendezvous CTW,</div><div>Senex CTW,</div><div>Sunbeam CTW &amp;</div><div>Drought Stand (New)</div><div><br></div><div><b>Important dates and times:</b></div><div>Saturday, August 13th: Group stage matches and pre-matches show before by dev_revs and thechosenguy1</div><div>Sunday, August 14th: Group stage matches</div><div><br></div><div>Saturday, August 20th: Group stage matches</div><div>Sunday, August 21st: Group stage matches</div><div><br></div><div>Saturday, August 27th: Final stage (finals and 3rd place matches).</div><div><i>How many matches that each team will play and the times will be decided after the registration.</i></div><div><br></div><div><b>Points:</b></div><div>Match win = 3 points</div><div>Match draw = 1 point</div><div>Match loss = 0 points </div><div>If your team captured a wool but you lost your game, you earn a point for capturing one wool. However, this is only if you lose .<br><br></div><div><b>Veto process: </b></div><div>Bo1: A team will be given 5 maps and will be asked for one map they would not like to play. The other team will then be listed with the remaining 4 maps and will be asked to choose one they would like to not play. The remaining 3 maps will be placed into a randomise generator. The map picked from the randomiser generator will be played .</div><div><br></div><div>Bo3: A team will be given a list of 5 maps and will be asked to be pick a map they would like to not play. The other team will be listed with the remaining 4 maps and will also be asked to choose a map they'd like to not play. The two maps will be removed from the list of maps. Then the first team will be asked for a map they wish to play. Next, the other team will be asked for a map they'd like to play from the remaining maps. Those two maps will be played one after another. In the situation of a 1-1 draw, the last map that has not be chosen or removed, will be played to decide the bo3.</div><div><br></div><div>To choose who goes first in the veto process will be out of luck. Myself or dev_revs will pick a number between 1-10. Whichever leader guesses the number or has the closest guess, starts the veto process.</div><div> </div><div>You must have all players that are participating in the match on the Avicus teamspeak.<br><br></div><div>Thank you so much to dev_rev who is the main host and came up with the idea and helping with planning. Thank you to Mqderator, Jahaj, Nathy and DaFrozenBlaze for volunteering to help. If you'd like to ref, please contact me on Skype (jy31492).</div><div><br></div><div>Regards,</div><div>The Summer Round tournament staff.</div>

Nice, I'd suggest not using Babylon or Sunbeam though I understand why you've done it as it would mess up vetoes. However those maps will most likely just be vetoed first.<br><br>Good job though, let's hope this doesn't collide with OCN tourney because this could fuck it up.&nbsp;<br><br>Good luck!

We were very limited on CTW maps that worked, it came down to having to use them.

Thank you! I'm already discussing about prizes. They weren't confirmed, so I decided to not to mention it but if we do bring prizes in I will announce it. I can't use challonge because it messes up the tournament format.

This sounds good but if you cap a wool and lose you get as many points as you would of you drew.

But then you would have conceded more. The game is not only about attacking. The aim should be to get more objectives than the other team, not just as much as you can without giving a crap about defending.

Umm, it will take so long time but people will enjoy more and it will be fair. As there are only two wool rooms on each maps, two captures aren't enough for a win.

Basically. We had a long discussion and came to the conclusion to allow them to due to us wanting teams to play rather than no show. It was also a drastic and quick change in the team which wiped out basically their whole roster in the registration, therefore we had to do something. If the same situation happened to another team, it wouldn't have been any different.

A good day today! Tense and exciting matches. Challonge has been updated with Saturday's matches. Thanks for everyone showing up today except Xenarch who have been disqualified. Hype for Sunday's matches! :)

A good weekend with some very tense matches. Thank you for participating this weekend and the times for next weekend will be announced sometime this week. Challonge has been updated and all teams against Xenarch have been given the automatic win since they're disqualified.
