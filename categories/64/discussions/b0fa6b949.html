Hello there users!<br><br>Manny might not know me, or maybe you do!<br>Ive been with avicus since the birth, ive seen our keenan build a skywars server at the age of 14, creating one of the finest skywars server arround. but what made the Mczone skywars so great?<br><br>Well i can explain all of that.<br><br>1. easy.<br>&nbsp;The map wasnt fancy, nor was it hard to get used to, it was a plain part of minecraft land lifted up into the air. combined with a few biomes.<br><br>2. Speed.<br>Due the map simplicity the gamestyle was, chaoticly fast. people had 30 seconds to choose a kit and go!<br><br>3. fun.<br>No one cared if you used an enderpearl and smashed into the void, Everyone did it! we used this gamemode to have some fun, try trickshots! if you failed, you just went into one of the other 15 server and try it again!<br><br>So maybe if we can recreate this feeling, our community can return to its old glory!<br><br>So, hereby i present :<br><br>Skywars 1.0 Mczones finest gamemode!<br><br><img src="http://i730.photobucket.com/albums/ww306/CVG_Shiro/Skywars%201_zpslaxsguuc.png" title="Image: http://i730.photobucket.com/albums/ww306/CVG_Shiro/Skywars%201_zpslaxsguuc.png"><br><img src="http://i730.photobucket.com/albums/ww306/CVG_Shiro/sk12_zpsizzfoqma.png" title="Image: http://i730.photobucket.com/albums/ww306/CVG_Shiro/sk12_zpsizzfoqma.png">

I remember this, and that map too. See, the newer maps, and kits..ect weren't that good, but the main problem is getting people to play it, most players only like Nebula, CTW..

The maps where not the "Skywars" Feeling.<br><br>All the old players will remember this, its nostalgia. like i said. if we might be able to recreate this fast moving pvp skywars, after that the players will come with new maps with the same feeling, creating more content for players. im sure that if the server fills up again, the word will spread.

If we can't get this popular again, can we turn this into a KoTH map or something? I'd hate to see it be wasted

I polled to make the Sky Wars gamemode this map/variations of this map and it fell behind... the community majority voted standard FFA and it ended up failing. I don't really want to try to revive it, because we have already had failure in adding new games.

I had the download from the old MCZone map repo Keenan gave me at one point, it's on my old dropbox but I forgot the email/password. I'm still missing Checkmate, though, and it seems no mapdevs have it.

Whenever we have added new gamemodes, nobody played them.<br>Just look at Frenzy, Skywars and Deathmatch. All pretty much dead. It's a waste of mapdev work and we should focus on destroy and more popular gamemodes more in my opinion.

remove DTM and maybe people will play em, DTM is shit anyways. KOTH, CTW, CTH, and Deathmatch are much better IMO. I liked frenzy but I prefered blitz rage cuz better maps and DTC is aight I guess but ocn maps still better

Give me a reason why should I play skyward here when I can play on tons of other servers who focus on that e.g hypixel and get a much better experience<br><br>you got a unique game mode, focus on it. Stop focusing at all other game modes other than nebula .

Definitely better than "modern" sky wars; I didn't know how to play too well back then, but it felt very unqiue from all the other servers that had it. But sky wars was dead when we brought it back, so I don't think we should try again.

DTM is the only game mode that is causing Avicus to still be alive.&nbsp;<br>Why would we delete our best game mode and not delete our game mode that is not causing people????

IMO the way they should do it would be like DTM, DTC, CTW one rot, Deathmatch, nexus, CTH, KOTH, CTF on one rot. And mix shouldn't be just CTF CTW and DTM, add some Deathmatch or KOTH maps as well. I myself am not the biggest fan of DTM and would like to play something besides it, I have like 700+ something mons across my accounts and don't even care to go for them anymore I just wait for people to come to my side so I can fight em (I haven't seen any KOTH maps on yet but from what I remember it was said that KOTH would be added, still waiting on that).
