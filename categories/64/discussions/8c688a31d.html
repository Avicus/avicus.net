getting MVP means you did something else than others that stood out so most likely you already got extra ex for what you did<br><br>exampLe<br><br>you capped a wool<br>+30 xp<br>got mvp(^that is your reward)

Pretty much what shootingbambi said<br><br>You already got the xp for doing the thing which got you mvp (tons of kills, wool caps, etc), so there's no need for extra xp.

<u></u>disagreed with both of the above<br><br>you can win a match by capping 2 wools, however the one later in the match will recieve same amount of xp. therefore if ur teammate caps the first wool 5 mins into the game but u cap it 30 mins into the game you both will get the same amount of xp, but you will get the mvp.<br><br>extra amounts of xp is needed to make people want to work for mvp since its a visual title in the end of the game.

yeah so what u said doesnt make sense because if someone on the enemy team destroys a monument and then u destroy the last one needed 5 minutes later you wont get any better of a reward

+1 it doesn't have to be much, but at least 15 XP would be nice

I feel as though there's bias on the MVP system or something&nbsp;<br>Like there was this one match on one of the CTW maps that have 4 teams<br>I join in and then kill a few people, then I leave to check something<br>A player triple caps&nbsp;<br>And then I get MVP (Even with my name in the spectator color)<br>So yeah
