They are, but last I checked they don't work, unless that was fixed recently. I'd wait for someone who knows more than me to respond though. :p

They used to work in walls, I assume the work in Nebula maps. A while back they stopped working in walls maps, although I believe that was fixed as Seth told me that he could test Grotto Arena (A walls map that uses villagers). So I assumed they either think they have fixed it, or they are trying to. It could add a ton of really cool maps if they get it fixed, if it's not already. :)

Last time I tried Groto, the villagers spawned in perfectly. The only reason that it the map was never used was because of Cookiemonster. One of the villagers sold 16 cookies for 1 emerald so it was too op until my recent removal of that kit so the map is better.
