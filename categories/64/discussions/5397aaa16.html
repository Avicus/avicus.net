<b></b>From my personal experience, this tournament was a disaster from the event staff point of view.<br><br><ul><li>&nbsp;One official showed up... If you're going to plan a tournament maybe make sure more then one can come, ya I heard that something popped up last minute and that's why others couldn't come. They attempted to solve this problem &amp; promoted an old official who I believe was interested in returning before hand. Moving on, he was a big help actually, this tournament wouldn't run without him. But... I had no clue this as happening until I woke up and saw the rank, so my suggestion would be possibly, tell the event-staff or and let us introduce our self and get communication running, or let us know before hand.&nbsp;</li></ul><br><ul><li>Official servers broke... Let's be honest.&nbsp; There was an issue with inviting certain teams, it took us a little bit to get on our feet and problem solve, but it was a ton of just sitting around and waiting for a dev. We tried scrim servers,.. those also didn't work. So then we waited for an admin to come on, this is why we need to check servers, but from my understanding they were working about 5 hours before, so they did indeed test them. So my suggestion, have a dev on all times during a tournament, or think of these problems before, maybe check the servers an hour before, anyways, that was out of the officials control.</li></ul><br><ul><li>From my knowledge the streamers or streamer was very good, good commentary and did a good job +1</li></ul><br><ul><li>Referee's were pretty good, some did not know what they are doing and that was up to the officials and senior refs to do.&nbsp; Seniors refs need to be constantly double checking before tournament days to make sure everyone is ready.</li></ul><br>All in all, this tournament I feel was not very well , it took 8 hours in total which is way too long and the organization was struggling. From my experience as a referee, the officials aren't very cooperative and more do this do that, the team communication is no where and it is honestly hard to work with. How do you guys think it went from the community point of view or as a player?<br><br>And ya, I did get demoted from senior ref.

The only thing I enjoyed was&nbsp;<img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/47b15675a0484e8f863a0cbf86ba22dc?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/profbananaslug.html" style="color: #009396">profbananaslug</a>'s streams. There was 1 Official and Vice. Very little referees. The matches were delayed and then they removed everyone from the registration and had everyone register again. I hope the next tournament/mini event isn't this poorly planned

I'll address this point by point.<br><br>1. I can't run a tournament on my own, so we invited vice and he accepted to help us run the TM. As for the other officials, it wasn't something last minute. But yeah, we should have informed the event staff beforehand.<br><br>2. /TM register didn't work for aura and primal for some reason unknown to us, meaning that we had to use scrim servers for them. There was an insane delay which was fixed by coco and I booking scrim servers to run matches which included those teams. Other matches were run on the official servers just fine. When we messaged Smit about it, he told us to unregister the teams after tweaking some things, but that didn't fix the issue unfortunately, and caused an unnecessary reregistration.<br><br>3. Streams were good<div><br>4. There was confusion regarding vetoing with some refs, but that's to be expected even with training. It was quickly solved and the refs were able to take matters in their own hand just fine. Then there were issues with refs having to leave mid tourney, but that's fine as well, they have lives and things planned. We also retrained all the refs before the tourney, and created the senior ref rank for them to mentor the newer refs to give us (officials) more space to focus on other things.<br><br>From an official's point of view this wasn't simple as well. Issues with the discord bot along with constant pings asking for team ranks (which you guys had 3 days to ask for after registration .-.) were very frequent, free agent system got messed up and we had to step in many times, along with other random issues which popped up here and there. After a while things calmed down and went smoother, but I had to go to sleep 5 hours into the tournament and didn't get a chance to see it end, so I can't comment on that.<br><br>As for a player's POV, I can't say much so we'll just wait.</div>

We played 1 bo1 match then sat in discord for 1 hour and 45 minutes without any reason as to what was happening. Then there were small 15 minute delays until about round 3. However straight after this the Losers Bracket was still at round 2 and again we were sat waiting for 40 minutes while they caught up. We were told we had 4 official servers (and I know there were problems with them) however it's just still a bit dissapointing to be playing another tournament on scrim servers. However the veto time, referees and streamer were definitely a lot better!

(this is my opinion)<br><br>I can totally agree about the staff.<br><br>We had a problem in the first match and there was only one official who didnt even come on for like 10 minutes.<br>Servers not working.<br>Bad decisions from officials.<br>Tournament didnt start for like an hour.<br>There were only 1 or 2 matches at the same time but it could be 4.<br><br><br>T

Supervising multiple matches when we're 2 is hard especially when each match comes with its own small set of problems which need to be dealt with. There also weren't enough refs to be running 4 at once, so we stuck with 2-3.<br><br>It was a situation where it would have been better to run 2 matches and run them fine, than run 4 matches but in a messy way (+ not enough refs as well)

I understand what you mean but that problem is solved by having enough Officials/refs. However that was a problem too.
