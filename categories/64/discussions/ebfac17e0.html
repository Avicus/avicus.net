I know I made one in the Avicus Lounge, however the number one response was CTW which is plan stupid. We just had a CTW tournament, so no, next tournament will not be CTW.&nbsp;<br><br>The most probable gamemode options at the minute are Mix or TDM, however the officials have not yet spoken about the gamemode for tournament 3 in detail.<br><br>Instead of having a possibly rigged strawpoll, please post below and join in the discussion. Please do not post with 'TDM ALL THE WAY'. This does not help us. Instead, please give reasons for your answer - pros and cons are good.&nbsp;<br><br>Regards<br><br>The Official Team

Mix because there are more gamemodes which makes it more fun and interesting as teams may have different strengths in different gamemodes.

TDM ALL THE WAY!!<br><br>I think a mix of CTW DTM and TDM is good. I dunno if this would work but koth could potentially be quite cool.

Imo Mix, mainly because it makes u think and make strats in more and different maps. Also it should be more competitive coz a team can be better in DTM but the other &nbsp;one in TDM and that should be very interesting.

I think that we should have a DTM tourney but instead of mining each others objective and killing each other like savage animals we see who can build the best house in the time given. This will help the teams co-ordination and overall it will raise happiness levels. What's more, a tournament like this would be just as competitive, but would also be easier for smaller teams to have a go at. This idea would not just draw in current players, but lots of new ones as a tournament like this would be quite unique and original which lots of players now days look for as big servers all seem to have the same gamemodes. This originality would hopefully attract players, and keep them. This idea would 100% re-shape the way professional minecraft teams view minecraft&nbsp;competition completely. A tournament like this is absolutely guaranteed to be a success. When I first heard about minecraft tournaments, all I heard was PvP, PvP and strategies. &nbsp;A tournament about building houses in a gamemode&nbsp;which normally revolves around strategy and PvP symbolises the modern era where we as human beings no longer need to fight, but we make peace on the battlefield. &nbsp;What's more, this idea is not only 10x better than, say, a build battle tournament as its building where you're not supposed to, where you go against the common belief and unite, but this idea need not be limited by simply houses. A range of other peaceful structures could be built as well. Maybe a zoo, a swimming pool, a collaborative map built within the map and many more. For those of you not swayed by this exceptional idea, surely it is a much more moral thing to do than to kill each other and to demolish other teams prized blocks?&nbsp;<br><br>Seeing who can build the best house on a DTM gamemode&nbsp;is surely the best idea we've had in a long time. It will increase the player count and in doing so Kylo will ve overwhelmed with money and with it he will hire 27 devs which will fix all the problems Avicus has within a few minutes. The combined total of 31 devs &nbsp;will not just rest at fixing the problems, but they will expand Avicus to a ginormous empire where there are thousands of content, peaceful loving house-builders playing on Avicus at any given time.&nbsp;<br><br><br>But seriously, can we have a DTM house building competition? c:

<p>TDM. While some state that we simply do not have enough good TDM maps at our disposal, this is simply because map authors have not had&nbsp;a significant enough reason to develop them. Due to the lack of a TDM tournament ever occurring in Avicus history, a lack of competitive maps was built for them. Given the opportunity, motivation, and significant notice, mapmakers will be able to construct successful and well designed maps. As well, we are currently already doing a mixed tournament of sorts and I would frankly not like to do two tournaments with the same gamemode back-to-back.</p>
