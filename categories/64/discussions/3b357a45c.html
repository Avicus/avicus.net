I was wondering what the fuck happened yesterday that in the finals the official decided to play TDM instead of the gamemode choosen. Why? It seems to biased. Just want to know.

Pretty obvious, after a match was over, all Avicus server were (d)dos'ed and this for exactly 10 minutes. Website, Server and TeamSpeak were very laggy at the same time

Pasa que allah y sagre quedo empatado 1-1-1, pero por el tie decidieron de la nada que jugariamos TDM donde en ningun lugar dice que para desempatar se jugaria pero en fin, espero que para el proximo tm alla porfin organizacion

<div>I wasn't calling bias, but a poor decision considering they signed up for a CTW and DTM tournament. What could be bias is allah winning the TDM tourney, and playing a tdm map.</div>

It says nothing about a tiebreaker, we were not expecting one at all. We were unprepared, we agreed on a TDM map as second tiebreaker after monument/wool difference.

That one of the officials who chose that map, maybe the only one, (Tazz) is on Team Allah, and won the tournament because his team was better on the map he chose for a tie breaker? In what world is that not bias?

That's completely irrelevant<br><br>They shouldn't even have 2nd place, one of their players wasn't even trying to hide his hacks and it's not just allah who agree on that

lol. you seriously think it was my decision? i gave officials 2 options on the possibilities, i then let them make a decision without my opinion. I basically had no significance in the choosing of the map. In fact, I was in favour for the other option.

I don't get the decision they made at all... Yes, they needed a good way to prevent another tie in the tiebreaker, but there are other ways to do that.<br>It's weird to do TDM as the most important match in a DTM/CTW tourney.<br>It's like telling 2 football teams to play basketball as their finals... It just doesn't make sense.<br><br>A better way to do the tiebreaker would've been a map simular to Fort Aqua, a map with Percentage Monuments.<br>This has a really small chance of ending up in a tie. Lot's of players suggested this at the time, but the idea got ignored, ofcourse.<br><br>Next time I suggest them keeping the gamemodes the teams signed up for, instead of making them play different ones.<br><br>Anyways, nice tourney!<br>Hope the CTF/KotH one ends with Skywars :D
