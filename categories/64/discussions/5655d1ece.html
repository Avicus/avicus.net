<p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px;  font-family: '.SF UI Text'; color: rgb(69, 69, 69);"><span style="font-family: '.SFUIText'; ">So since there is a CTW tournament I would just like to voice an opinion. So ocn was the competitive server I grew up with. However once it closed I migrated here and learned to love it. However Avicus does not have things called Safety Wools or Proximity (?). So this Tm is CTW and probably doesn't want to create what was t5. I would like to think that they should implement safety wools. If Avicus allowed safety wools in scrims or tms it would allow for easier gameplay. It could help worser teams to cap against better teams and allow for second chances. Safety wools also allow for easier tms. Safety wools also introduce the idea of Prox. I don't know how Avicus run CTW tms, but what I have heard is that Prox does not occur. Avicus should implement proximity in all CTW tm matches&nbsp; via safety wools. I believe that it would be easier to&nbsp; eliminate ties between teams. These are all just my opinions but yeah. What do you think?</span></p>

it's a map maker choice atm (to enable safeties)<br><br>The Only issue is that Avicus has infinite wools (grab as much wool as you want such as 6 stacks of it) instead of regenerative wools (chests start with wool but once it's empty, the wool reappears every x amount of time) which can affect safeties. I don't know if there's a way to disable that other than using the glitch when wool chests are double chests and they don't refil so you're limited to the 54 wool blocks (unless there's more chests)<br><br>procimity exists but i don't know if it calculates a win (touches don't affect score either last time I played ctw)<br><br>hope this helps and it's not hard to understand what I'm talking about<br><br>we can only sit here and wait for the map department of the official team to release the maps and give us 10 days of preparation (and hopefully they don't edit the map and change the whole thing 2 days before the tournament)

Personally think avicus should stay with no safeties. It's hard to make a switch after we have been playing for so long without it. If you make it a map makers choice then you are confused on which maps you can which you cant.

Personally have no safeties is not good, people focus in the guy with the wool so the 60% they got him so what's the point of having alot of wool, safeties are needed but we need less wool in the wool room so it does not get spammed

Competitive people is finally getting skilled and believe it or not it is such a problem now you need to be like 2 guys in the wool in order to have more opportunities to get it back
