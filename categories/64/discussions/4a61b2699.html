<p class="MsoNormal">Hi everyone,</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I believe the community needs an explanation on everything
going on with tournaments and the official team, so this is what this post will
be about. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Tournament preparation I would say is almost complete, but
things have been running slow, especially with the recent demotions/retirements
of 3 officials. Although this should not be an excuse, we are doing the best
with what we have to work with.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><u>Battle of Eternity
II:</u></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">As you may be able to tell by the name, the next tournament
will be a TDM tournament. However, due to the recent disbanding of three of the
largest teams (Allah, Horizon, PureBlox) we have decided to host this
tournament with a 5v5 format to give smaller teams the chance to develop while
still attempting to retain the competitive atmosphere Avicus has had in
previous tournaments. </p>

The maps will most likely be Crossfire (without scoreboxes),
Actrix, and Injustice.<br><br>Some of the issues causing us not to have the tournament released yet are:<ul><li>Dates of the Badlion tournaments.</li><li>Maps have not been optimized for the tournament.</li><li>Implementation of new features.</li><li>General slow progression.</li></ul><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><u>New Features:</u></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">During this time&nbsp; I have been experimenting with
possible new features to enhance the quality of the tournaments. I will give a brief explanation of each of the ones listed below.<img src="https://imgur.com/a/EJhEo"></p><ul><li>Map Veto Visual Representation</li></ul><p class="MsoNormal"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/kS5a5bu.png" title="Image: https://i.imgur.com/kS5a5bu.png"><br></p><p class="MsoNormal"><img src="https://imgur.com/a/EJhEo">As you can see in the picture there is a redstone lamp wall and some levers in the front along with visual representations of the maps. The idea is that when you pull the red lever, the lamps in the back will turn off indicating the map which has been chosen to be banned. The idea for the green lever is that with the help of XML, in chat it will display a message saying which map has been selected. The main purpose of this is to make the veto process more organized to avoid doing the vetos through messages. It also enhances the livestreams.<br></p><ul><li>Advanced Statistic Tracking</li></ul><img src="https://i.imgur.com/UMe5oVJ.png" title="Image: https://i.imgur.com/UMe5oVJ.png"><br>This is just an example of how a match page with statistics would look like (disregard the names and numbers). As long as there is a stream/chat logs with full evidence of all the pvp encounters, this can definitely be a possibility.<br><br><b><u>Event Staff Applications:<br></u></b><br><u><b></b></u><b></b>We have received all applications and are under the process of reviewing them. We should be wrapped up with this in a few days.<br><br><b><u>Official Promotions:<br></u></b><br>There definitely will be official promotions, still debating on who to be promoted.<br><br><b><u>Questions?<br></u></b><br>If you have a question about something that wasn't addressed, feel free to ask!

You need to build specific maps if you want 5v5 to work, not use old ones from 8v8

5v5? Avicus has ran 8v8 for years don’t use a bad excuse of “teams disbanding” those teams didn’t disband they just formed into different teams. You have ZERO maps for 5v5, and the maps you chose are maps from last TDM tournament and are 8v8.. you plan on hosting a tournament with no new maps, a team setup that will not work and we have never used before, Scoreboxes are what made the last tournament interesting and fun, &nbsp;I hope this is re thought because right now it seems the officials have zero sense of the competeive scene on minecraft.

Got to agree on this with you. Avicus always was 8v8 so what reason is there to make it a 5v5? Because some teams disbanded and became new teams??? Not much sense in that.<br><br>Also wasn’t there a vote on what gamemode we want the next tournament to be? TDM definitely wasn’t one of the top 3, so why are we doing TDM? If you want to improve the competitive side of Avicus, why not listen to what we want?<br><br>Also, a big part of tournaments are the new maps that come with a new tournament. So what’s the point of playing the same old maps as before?<br><br>Theugh +1 to the cool idea about match info.

Here comes my thoughts boys:<br><b><br></b><b>Gamemode:<br></b>We specifically held a vote for the <b>COMMUNITY&nbsp;</b>to decide the gamemode, which was <b>DTM/C</b>.

I don't understand why you guys think this is such a bad idea. First of all, this is an&nbsp;<b>extra&nbsp;</b>tournament. We still have plans to have a "big tournament" with 8v8 as that is when most people are on school break. Second of all, if you guys like competition, don't you want more teams? 5v5 matches would allow for smaller teams to participate and bigger teams to create multiple teams. As long as the maps are edited to suit a 5v5 match, this shouldn't be a problem right?<br><br>So far, I have not heard of any reasons that prove that this 5v5 format for one tournament that wasn't even supposed to happen will negate the competitive scene on Avicus.<br><br>I will be making a separate post for a poll later on.

I read over all of them. For example, the reason of "not having 5v5 maps". That is true, but we will be editing the maps to suit 5v5 so it would work out. List them down for me then.

I like the veto system and the analytical statistics system, so +1 for that.&nbsp;<br><br>I feel like the only way a 5v5 tournament would work would be if we made 5v5 versions of maps, but that would take a LONG time and time is of the essence. I think for this tournament we should keep it 7v7 or 8v8 and use the community poll which was announced a while back.&nbsp;<br><br>For the next tournament, it might be good to make it a 6v6 CFTH or TDM and have special maps made for the occasion. This would take a lot of early planning, but I think you guys can pull it off.&nbsp;<br><br>So basically, listen to the community (aka the poll) and keep it 7v7 or 8v8.

All teams have disbanded for a reason(s), find the reason and then fix that instead of ignoring issues that are killing the scene

Here comes my thoughts boys:<br><b><br></b><b>Gamemode:<br></b>We specifically held a vote for the <b>COMMUNITY&nbsp;</b>to decide the gamemode, which was <b>DTM/C</b>. I can understand why you'd switch the gamemode as it wouldn't play well in a 5v5 scenario, however it should have been brought up with the community on what they want to do. It should have gone <b>Tournament 7 (DTM/C, 8v8)</b>, <b>Tournament 8 or Mini Event I (TDM, 5v5),&nbsp;</b>then from there decipher what direction you want the tournaments to go into. Also, I know I was the one to suggest switching to 5v5, however I didn't expect it to be implemented into the first tournament. I also don't think the reason 'The top 3 teams disbanded' is a good enough reason to switch the&nbsp;<b>gamemode</b> and&nbsp;<b>players on field</b> for a tournament.<br><b><br></b><b>Maps:<br></b>As stated by&nbsp;<img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/54964b606ce749229a4c2b981d8c2ed7?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/Spoookeh.html" style="color: #009396">Spoookeh</a> &amp;&nbsp;<img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/3feb57900603446c9bbfd5fb40759f41?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/dev_revs.html" style="color: #009396">dev_revs</a>, Avicus currently has&nbsp;<b>ZERO</b> 5v5 maps, and using 8v8 maps in a 5v5 scenario is horrible. I even said when I was Official, to make <b>NEW</b> maps if we wanted to do a 5v5 tournament.<br><br><b>Map Veto System:<br></b>Been in the works for roughly 2 tournaments, so hopefully its finished by this one.<br><br><b>Advanced Statistic Tracking:<br></b>Its a cool concept, but is it really necessary?<br><br><b>Official Promotions:<br></b>Don't promote any of the Refs or Streamers (no offense to any of you guys). There is <b>ONLY</b> 1 person capable of being an Official from the event-staff team and that is&nbsp;<img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/3feb57900603446c9bbfd5fb40759f41?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/dev_revs.html" style="color: #009396">dev_revs</a>. I know, crazy right? But, hes the only one who has actually proven themselves capable of doing their job and showing their willingness to help. As well as, all of the&nbsp;<b>GOOD</b> referees have only been a Ref for&nbsp;<b>ONE</b> tournament and its too early for a promotion. I would personally look at community members and see who actually is willing to give feedback, suggestions and overall try to help the Official team out from a player standpoint.
