I'm not sure what the official term for these are, but it would be neat to have a tournament winner flair/badge. (the thing after your name). This would show that they won the tournament while playing ingame.<br><br>Plus it would be one of the cool exclusive things you get for winning that no one else can get. Expect more winners of course

1st: -Tournament Winner (lets use ToC as an example, it would be called 'ToC Winner') rank that has the same permissions and perks as a Diamond rank (for all players). This would last a month<br><br>2nd: Tournament 2nd Place (using ToC as an example again: it would be 'ToC 2nd Place') rank that has the same permissions and perks as an Emerald rank. This would also last for a month.<br><br>3rd:&nbsp;Tournament 3rd Place (using ToC as an example again: it would be 'ToC 3rd Place') rank that has the same permissions and perks as an Gold rank.

You should bold the player's name or change the color of it so it can identify as a tournamemt winner. There could be a different color for each of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place.<br>Also, give 20k credits to each team member.<br>And a forum tag indicating what place they got from the tournament.
