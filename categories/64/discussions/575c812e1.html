[Discussion] Should Officials play in events?

</h1>
Greetings,<br><br>So ever since it became apparent that officials started to participate in the events they organised there has forever been discussions to determine if the player body agrees with this. It's no secret the <b>community has lashed out</b> due to unfair decisions being made because of this and worsening the relationship between the event staff and community. Now the third tournament's roster size has been announced it has <b>sparked the issue</b> once again; with such a varied amount of strong opinions there will for sure be outbreaks of flame.<br><br>You (official team) cannot continue to push aside this matter just because&nbsp;<b></b>it&nbsp;<b>makes your situation awkward</b>, because it's either being an official and not play or retire and play with your team. I'm not accusing those who are in teams of making bias decisions on purpose, because you're human and even if you believe you are being as fair as possible you're not, you will forever be bias because you are connected with your team, it's just being human. So now we've established the problem isn't fixable the officials have make the decision, because I thought you <b>wanted the best for us</b>.<br><br>I know only four officials are in competitive teams - excuse me Greg.<br><br>So what are you opinions on this matter?<br><br>N.B: If any of you think this an invitation to start an argument then leave.

I don't know of a single competive environment that allows the officials that host an event to participate and play.<br><br>Officials really shouldn't be playing in events when they're the ones who plan them, and officially: make them. The events are for the community, and tweaking can be a factor to meet a desire of an official's needs more than say, another team's needs, and in my experience it was already controversial when I was in the team myself. Officials are to oversee matches, oversee referees, help referees, help the media team, and overall do anything to make the event run smoother.<br><br>Your responsibilities don't magically disappear because you decide to play.

I think it's better that officials don't play. I mean, if you look at any athletic association, do you ever see the refs joining the game? The purpose of the official team is to spectate and coordinate matches. By becoming an official, you commit to its required duties, such as planning and watching the tournament as a whole. If you wish to play instead, you shouldn't join the team..

Yeah, it's strange that this is even a problem. In my opinion it's obvious that the officials should not be able to play. Now, since it seems to be a problem,&nbsp; maybe we need new officials? Please don't hate on me for saying that because I honestly do not know much about the officials and them as people.

They can please the majority though. That's what any tournament is about.<br><br>If people aren't in favor of them playing (which is the majority), it should be considered.

Bad idea...?<br><br>If you're talking about determining rulebreakers, silencing someone just off that will not work because they might have actual valid points or need to defend themselves/their team, and you're essentially breaking off the voice.<br><br>If you're talking about determining planning, how do you find out? That will not eliminate bias in the least.

Ok now that I am on a computer let me make a real answer. Yes I do believe officials have the right to play in tournaments. Now let me tell a little about myself. I have been in a position like the officials for different servers. Or a different server since it has been on one server. I worked with 4 other people of my rank to produce 3 tournaments and they were beyond success.<br><br>Now first off look at your Official team. You have 9 officials and 4 of them are on a tournament team. Same with my "Official" team with 5 "Officials" and 2 of them are on a team. I put "Officials" in quotation marks because we do not call them Officials. They call us idiots :o. <br><br>Now with the situation with the Officials is that there has been too many shifts in the official team for the next tournament. This will make working together a little harder and there will be little problems. I believe the officials are making the right call when making a safe tournament with the 8v8 16 players.<br><br>What I believe is a structure where the 5 non-playing are more in the foreground and interacting with the community. They should be the ones showing they are the leaders to the community instead of Tazz, Cyclops, or Fouled(They show the most leadership to the community in their official role). The problem is that the other 5 have not shown the leadership they need to show when addressing the community.&nbsp;<br><br>The community also needs to calm down quiet a bit in these situations though. I was very disappointed with my fellow mods and a few of my friends in their actions on the thread that released about new information of the tournament. First of all. How could Tazz out vote 8 other officials. &nbsp;2 of which are in the team that mostly complained. We do not need this silliness when addressing serious issues and as a moderator, I do not like to see that when given criticism. If it was up to me I would ignore the person until they give mature criticism.&nbsp;<br><br>So if you do not get what I am saying. The official team should be restructured to fit the concerns of the community. There are some issues to be addressed and I feel they should be addressed more publicly.

I understand that if the official attitude is "If I can't play, I won't bother hosting" then they shouldn't be an official in the first place,<br><br>But at the same time anyone knows that there's nothing more boring than watching someone else play a game (Anyone get that reference?)<br><br>So long as they can't make bias decisions (Not being able to vote on decisions affecting their own teams) and as long as there are enough officials to keep the tournament running while others play, then it shouldn't be an issue. But if there are only 2 officials online and both have teams playing, then they shouldn't play.<br><br><br>Example: 6 officials are online, its the last match of the day, Cacal vs New BC, Tazz should be allowed to play, but any complications in that game are decided upon the other 5 officials on.

Officials should be there to facilitate and supervise the entire tournament. If I remember correctly, there was a time when an Official was needed, he was playing. I think it happened, can't really confirm. But to be honest, I don't care whether they play, as long as the things that needed to be done are done.

Alright here is my response:<br><br>I simply disagree that officials should play in tournaments. If you're going to get offered official or try to reach for official, don't be in a competitive team. Officials are meant for organising tournaments, not playing the tournaments. I'm sorry but if you are official and you play in the tournaments, just retire from official. There is no part of the role of official to play in the tournaments.&nbsp;<br><br>The reason for my argument is:<br>Officials are simply biased to their team, and I don't give 57 shits if you say officials won't be biased, they are just not meant to play.

No. I don't see why they can. I feel like it raises concerns like bias. It should be one or the other. They should be able to play&nbsp;<i>or&nbsp;</i>host a tournament.<br><br>What happens if the team an official was in wins the tournament? That sounds a little biased to me (this could not be the case, but...). What if there was an issue to arise, and the official choose not to do his job because he wanted the play in the tournament more?&nbsp;<br><br>If you'd rather play in a tournament, why did you join the events team?<br><br>EDIT: And yes, I get the whole "but they took time to plan it, let them play" idea. But I'll go back to my last point, if you want to play, don't bother joining the events team, that&nbsp;<i>runs</i> tournaments.

You do understand it's not that easy, correct? Plus I don't really see a ton of people in this community worthy of Official and/or who can organize events and stay committed.

Could you elaborate on that? Referees played in the league and as far as I'm aware, there weren't issues.

I'm pretty sure most people who aren't selfish and care about the community would host for others.<br><br>And an official should generally have that selfless attitude

As well as they need a good attitude, it isn't the only thing to become an official. I'm pretty sure that there are different aspects.

To be honest, the previous officials back in T1 were terrible (sorry if you were one of them and reading this) and now the officials like Tazz, Cyclops are actually good and they both know what they are talking about and how to manage an event. Furthermore, both of these officials are leaders of teams and they are the best officials Avicus has had so if you tell them that they can not play then it sort of sucks for them. They can organise and play at the same time if another official is there on the scene - I mean what we have like 7 officials? and some of them are not on a team I think so say Tazz was playing a match as an official and another official was there seeing the event then I guess this is fine. <br><br>However, in the position where there is only 1 official on (this is rarely the case) I do believe the official should not play and should oversee the event because they need to know what is happening and they need to structure the event and make sure everything is in place. :)

With Robin's current behaviour I don't think he'd really be suited for Official, plus knowing him, I'm sure he'd prefer to play over anything. Peachy hasn't been so much as a ref, nor have I seen much involvement in the competitive scene from him.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Other 2 are fine, but that's not enough to replace most of the official team</div>

Officials should be allowed to play in the tournament they're hosting. I don't understand exactly how they could mess up the game though.

No more than 50% of officials will be able to play in the next event. 50% of 9 is 4.5, and 5 is more than 50% so 4 officials will be allowed to play. However, they will always prioritize their official job over their team.
