Hey there!<br><br><b>We'd like the streams for the invitationals to be as professional and as high quality as possible so we'd like as much feedback from you, the community, as possible.</b> <br><br>Firstly<b>&nbsp;</b>we'd like to ask your opinions on what channel we should be streaming on. Would you prefer streams of &nbsp;ALL the matches on multiple channels or one main streamer on AvicusOfficial (<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/officialavicus" title="Link: https://www.twitch.tv/officialavicus">https://www.twitch.tv/officialavicus</a>)&nbsp;allowing more viewers to engage with one stream?<br><br><i><b></b></i><i>AbusiveUser</i> has also&nbsp;generously created a new overlay to use (<a href="http://imgur.com/a/J9DZK" title="Link: http://imgur.com/a/J9DZK">http://imgur.com/a/J9DZK</a>). If you'd like any improvements to be made to this including team logos we'd be happy to make adjustments.&nbsp;<br><br>This might come across as fairly controversial but we have been discussing the use of mods such as enlarged nametags and damage indicators to give viewers a better idea of what is happening in the match. Personally I would love to see this in team fights, checking the player's HP and guessing who might come out on top. I understand the argument "If media are using it why can't we?" might pop up but it's not like streamers will be allowed to go in-game and play&nbsp;with these modifications enabled.&nbsp;<br><br><br><b>Feel free to discuss the points made below and anything else you might have to help us improve the streaming quality</b>. <br><br>See you in the invitationals! ;P

Please visit team rooms before matches and do something like team interviews: Things like how do they think the match will turn out, what maps do they think they'll do well on, thoughts on their opponents etc.

I think that if just are 1 stream per match is better than if are 2 or 3 medias streaming the same match, because you if are 2 or 3 medias for match the players can get confused. Also, i like so much the new overlay the old one was horrible IMO.<br><span>

I can't remember if all the invitationals are going on at the same time, but if they are and if there's not enough media to cover all four games then hold a vote for the stream watches to decided who they'd like to watch.<br><br>Don't just commentate the whole game, move about and go into team channels.<br><br>Try to aim to stream with 2-3 commentators so there's less pressure to talk. This also lets people take a moment of the mic to gather thoughts for high quality commentating.

Here are the ones we made. We're still in the process of choosing which one to go with. They would need to be resized though I believe.<img src="https://i.gyazo.com/1ee1d7b50d6cd82cc34cb6968ac4c92a.jpg" title="Image: https://i.gyazo.com/1ee1d7b50d6cd82cc34cb6968ac4c92a.jpg"><img src="https://i.gyazo.com/2da9235927b3c44a094108c86dd08050.png" title="Image: https://i.gyazo.com/2da9235927b3c44a094108c86dd08050.png"><b><img src="https://i.gyazo.com/8d238eb589ea4f0c9225c034259b2d3b.png" title="Image: https://i.gyazo.com/8d238eb589ea4f0c9225c034259b2d3b.png"></b>
