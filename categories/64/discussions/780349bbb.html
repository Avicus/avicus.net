Hello everyone!<br><br>Today we are rolling out a new feature that will allow teams to track overall statistics for all of their members.<br><br>Each team page now has a "Team Statistics" tab which will display the combined stats of the team's member,<br>Example:&nbsp;<a href="https://avicus.net/teams/24#statsTab">https://avicus.net/teams/24#statsTab</a><br><br>Hope you enjoy!<br>ALM

not memeing this time, but the first time you go to a team's page, the statistics thing appears at the bottom of their about tab. if you switch to any other tab and then switch back to the about page, it goes away though. not sure if it's just me, but yeah.

Remember your thread about Avicus copying OCN? <a href="https://oc.tc/teams/pureblox">https://oc.tc/teams/pureblox</a>&nbsp;Coincidence? Doubt so.

Can't really say anyone is copying anyone because both servers have had similar things for several years now. Most of the things being added now that are similar to what OCN has would have been added earlier but the server had no devs putting effort in until recently
