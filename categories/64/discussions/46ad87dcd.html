Well, apperently we are 9th because we couldn't get enough players on for 1 match. That was only because most players had to go for dinner. As heartclaw showed up to all of there matches, they are going against the challonge and putting them 8th. They are still discussing it though. So its undecided so far.

Don't say it like we didn't turn up to the whole thing. It was 1 match we no showed. Also "first tourney" does mean something as it shows we don't know how these events happen we don't know what to do. We didn't know what happened if we did no show. Also you said im getting salty over not getting into the invitationals. I said its our first tournament why would i get salty? I didn't expect to get into the invitationals. So why would i get salty about it. I can send you images of multiple times you took delight in saying we didn't make it. If your pissed that we couldn't make one match, grow up its minecraft. Me and my team have more important shit to worry about rather than putting a minecraft tournament first in front of all other life activities.
