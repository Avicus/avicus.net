<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/290932243139133440/290966435973562379/Castle_Edited.jpg" title="Image: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/290932243139133440/290966435973562379/Castle_Edited.jpg"><br>Hello, i would like to announce our first unofficial tournament, The Desolation Of Gamemodes.<br><br>My co-hosts during this tournament are: &nbsp;LythureIsBack, iwishbro, Coco_stag and poofywoo. (The Dev needs to fix tags there not working again...)<br><br>We are all new to this tournament making, however I do believe we are all excellent organizers.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Gamemode:</b> Each round the gamemode will change:<br><br>Round 1: &nbsp; Destroy The Monument (40 minutes max)<br>Round 2: &nbsp; Team Death Match (15 minutes max (most kills at the end wins))<br>Round 3: &nbsp; King Of The Hill (15 minutes max (team with most controlled area wins))<br>Round 4: &nbsp; Capture The Wool (45 minutes max (team with most touches/caps wins)<br>Round 5: &nbsp; 5cp (15 minutes max ( team with most control wins))<br>Round 6: &nbsp; Frenzy (15 minutes max)<br>Round 7: &nbsp; Capture The Flag (15 minutes max ( team with most captures wins))<br><br>If only a few teams sign up and there is only 2 rounds, then only round 1 and 2 gamemodes will be played. On the other hand, if 25 teams sign up and there is more than 7 rounds, the rounds will just cycle.<br><br>An extra 10-20 minutes will be given when a tie occurs.<br><br><b>Format:&nbsp;</b>The format is a round robin, meaning every team will play each other. Due to the way the gamemodes work you may play different teams for different gamemodes. Please also bear in mind this will take up a lot of time depending on the amount of teams signing up.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Match Information:&nbsp;</b>A minimum of 6&nbsp;players must be fielded, but a maximum of 8 players can be fielded, These may differ depending on gamemodes. You may switch out players if the replacing person is part of the team. A win is 3 points, a lose is 1 point and a tie if it rarely occurs will be 2 points.<br><br><b>Rules:&nbsp;</b>You must follow all rules that apply to Avicus:&nbsp;<a href="https://avicus.net/rules" title="Link: https://avicus.net/rules/en">https://avicus.net/rules</a>&nbsp;, Official Avicus tournaments rules apply.<br><br><b>Apply here:&nbsp;<a href="https://goo.gl/forms/cxP7wYG3bOSmlgj22" title="Link: https://goo.gl/forms/cxP7wYG3bOSmlgj22">https://goo.gl/forms/cxP7wYG3bOSmlgj22</a><br></b><br>Deadline for applications is 2 weeks from now, 28th of March.<br><br><b>Map Pool: To be Determined.<br></b><br><b>Important Dates: Will be In April 3rd-25th, Will be more exact when i get an idea of how many rounds there will be (due to team size)<br></b><br>If you would like to Stream/referee please contact me on discord: &nbsp; Rockyyyyy#8427<br><br><b>Streamers:</b><br><br>Rockyyyyy<br>Zic_e<br><br><br><br><b>Referees:</b><br><br>Kojapan<br><br>Jaystre<br><br><br>Thank you for your time, i would love to hear feedback or question, as this is my first time doing this. Tell me if i need to add something and i will do!<br><br>Regards, Rockyyyyy.

instead of having to play each and every single game mode you should just make it as a bo7 of the game modes you play since matches will most likely take forever

We won't play each and every single gamemode, Say if there are 6 teams there will be 5 rounds. Meaning the first 5 gamemodes will be used the rest won't, hence why the most unpopular are closest to the end. Anyways yes some gamemodes will take a while but the rest will go quickly.

You would have to be in an official team (on the forums) You have two choices, either make an lft post and hope a team needs members or is interested in having you. However you could make a team but you would have to be very quick as the apps close in a week and a few days.

I was wondering instead of doing 1 point for a win and 0 for a loss it would be better for 3 points for win 2 for draw and 1 for loss or 2 for win 1 for draw none for loss, makes a bit more sense as they are likely to be draws.
