<b></b>I have had some ideas regarding BoE so let's discuss them!<br><br><b>Points Limit:<br></b><b></b>As we all know, the points limit for every TDM TE map here is set to 100. I see this as an error. <br>You may ask why. Now imagine this situation: Team A has to face Team B in the last match of their Bo5 in the loser bracket. The one who loses will get knocked out of the tourney. There are still 4 minutes in the match. The score is tied in 90, so whoever gets a kill faster will win , maybe ending in a 100-96 for Team A, which having completed all 12 minutes could have seen a comeback for Team B ending in a 112-108. Such a random event as a single kill in a push in which your team may have even won, but you were losing 98-92 and even though your team killed 5 of them, in the middle 2 of you died, so you lose. Concluding, <i>in my opinion the only limit for this tourney should be time.<br></i><br><b>Seeding:<br></b>This is more a question than an idea. How will seeding be? In my opinion it shouldn't be neither completely random nor completely hand-made. Seeding being completely random will lead to groups full of top-tier teams and other groups full of not that good teams, who would be knocked out by top tier teams who have lost because they were in a very difficult group. Anyway, seeding being made by who Officials think is better, will not give much opportunity for underdog teams.<br><br><b>Team Names in-game:<br></b>In previous tournaments, the scoreboard featured the team tag only. Having full team names instead of tags will help new players who are watching the streams knowing which teams are playing. Also, many teams have a name tag who has nothing to do with their full name. Maybe a command like /team name red TEAM X would be useful.<br><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; "><i><u><br></u></i></span><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px 0px 12px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; "></p><br>Suggest any more topics and I will put them.

Point Limit:<br>I never really thought of this as a good idea. It makes less competition and doesn't feel as good as a full timed match. TDM is a simple gamemode but sometimes the simple part of it makes for more competition.<br>&nbsp;<br>Seeding:<br>This is speaking from someone who has hosted tournaments in the past but I find one way makes the weeks very exciting. Say if you have 16 teams, you split them up into 2 groups at the beginning. Seeding 1-8 and seeing 9-16. It would go:<br>1vs8<br>2vs7 and so on and the same with the second part. 1 would be a team considered the best while the bottom teams are teams that are considered not as good. This will make rounds more interesting instead of the top team constantly beating up the lower teams. Now these groups can merge in standings depending on what is what but then again, I usually count on Challonge to automate my seeding

There are points for each team, as I know. So, in total A gets 45, gets 43, C gets 39, D - 36. The end.

I was reffering to the invitationa,s not qualifiers. Anyway, I've already talked about this with an official and he already solved it.
