<b>p.s this is not an official post</b><br><br>Hey boys, ready?<br><br>The whole procedure of the ban was messy. I wasn't there that night Zaoki got screenshared, so LFT didn't know if what he found was an autoclicker or not. It turned out it pretty much was, however we couldn't 100% confirm he was autoclicking, as only an autoclicker was found. This however, was defined as a punishable offence in the ruleset, whether we could prove he was using it or not. His autoclicker also matched up with the many alerts he set off in 1 match x)<br><b><br></b>Therefore, officials were unsure of what to do as PureDogs had got in their heads and they were unsure whether what had been found was an autoclicker. This was because the officials were still waiting for my confirmation on what was found, so PureDogs had time to type and make up explanations.<br><br>Nothing was being done after a few days, Zaoki was unable to go on his computer to attempt to prove himself.&nbsp;<br><br>Kyoal then decided with Posighdun it would be a good idea to create a vote. This vote was an experiment for the officials, by Kyoal. He likes to impress Posighdun. Kyoal instantly voted for no dq, pressuring other officials to do so as they want to make what seems to be the right decision. &nbsp;Then I woke up and they were getting disqualified whatever I voted.<br><br>Kyoal thought it would be a good decision to make an experiment on the officials, when he was one of the only ones stopping a dq from happening earlier that week. &nbsp;And still to this moment, some officials are not aware of the vote being an experiment by kyoal.<br><br>After the decision was public, and it had been announced, there was (rightfully so) a shit storm created by the community. &nbsp;This lead to officials who voted for no dq either feeling 1 of 2 things:&nbsp;<br><ul><li>realising the decision they made</li><li>wanting to change their decision, although it was too late, because of the shitstorm created</li></ul>This made everyone realise we as a team messed up, causing everyone to post why they voted for no dq publically. Most people did, Kyoal didn't however, and was refusing to even tell the official team.<br><br>Hope this clears shit up<br><br>*ps* LFT was the ONLY official to vote for a DQ.<br><br>Tazz (not offiicials)

Why did only 1 person vote for a DQ? It makes no sense.<br><br>Although you can't fully justify the autoclicker, Zaoki is still banned.

it's possible that LFT only voted for a DQ because it would benefit him as a member of Horizon (who even played in a few tournament matches), bringing in that old official bias everyone's been talking about

Tbh if that was the case, this form of bias (which it is imo still) is far more serious and ridiculous than LFT's potential bias.

The vote was called because it took 5 days to even talk about it and no decision had been reached so I called a vote, as I thought they would all vote for DQ as it made sense to dq them. &nbsp;I only found out about Kyoals experiment during the semi finals and it was already too late to do anything at that point.<br><br>&nbsp;Kyoal did make a mistake but we all make mistakes at some point, and that's probably one questionable thing he has done amongst 1000 good things. He is very passionate about this community and never meant for it to get out of hand like it did. I'm not condoning what he did, as he should not have done it but like I said it's already too late so we'll just have to learn from our mistakes.

this is EXACTLY the problem. You cannot let little ""mistakes"" slide by. He needs to pay for it, The tournament was basically decided by his dumb idea.

&nbsp;You can't judge someone based off of if they log into a minecraft server or not, there are tons of people doing things behind the scenes that enable this server to stay online. I'm not saying he shouldn't be punished or that he should but you of all people should know that you aren't necessarily going to see all the good work that is being done, you only see a small fraction of it.

Every TM? I don't recall it being every TM, after Battle of eternity (2 tms ago) there started to be problems. The only other mistake i recall is the officials false banning someone in tournament 2 but I don't think there was an issue every TM. I can't talk regarding the officials but i'm sure they're trying their best to make these things run as smoothly as possible. There just has to be more thought into all these decisions and people need to think of the repercussions of their actions.

it would be nice if kyoal would come down and have a nice chat with us himself but unfortunately he seems to be in hiding<br>and yeah, the whole official team deserves blame and i've been saying that for a while now, and some of them have stepped up, taken the blame, and faced the consequences (like our boy piez, MAD respect), but recently it seems like the majority of the blame lies with kyoal. none of this would have happened without that unnecessary vote, which kyoal started for reasons that are so absurd that i pinched myself multiple times while reading about them to make sure i wasn't dreaming. all of this is just made worse in my mind by the fact that kyoal seems to have vanished instead of maybe owning up to what he did and apologizing. instead, we've got you coming around here on his behalf to give us the whole "people make mistakes blah blah" spiel. at the end of the day, the official team needs a small major reorganization. frankly i can't believe they've gone so long without a leader, it seems like that's where a lot of problems are coming from.

No, he's legitimately busy this week. Exams are in EU. I do agree they need one leader tho but like I said kyoal doing this whole thing didn't really influence anything. He didn't pressure anyone into anything, he really just voted like everyone else. The others voted and ye that's what happened. Even if kyoal didn't do the test, and to be quite frank I don't know what he was trying to do, and legitimately voted to not dq for another reason, the outcome would be the same. So it really is both the Admins and Officials fault and not just kyoals.

I called a vote as 5 days had passed and they still hadn't reached a decisions. So I called it in order to hurry everyone up and decide what we were doing.

They didn't want to DQ the team because they were unsure whether he was using an autoclicker in the tournament (so I was told), but still went ahead and banned the player in question.

Then why was he banned with [Tournament] in the reason? This implies that he was using it during the tournament, and the team in question should be DQ'd. Simple as that.

He was banned during a tournament, for having an autoclicker found during a screenshare, as a result from alerts being set of during tournament match (correct me if I am wrong). Why wasn't the team DQ'd, as his ban is directly related to the tournament.

What the fuck are you talking about, we were only considered a good team because of OCN. The only reason avicus considers us "big" now is because we beat allah, and the whole Zaoki shit. We had no biased in the staff team, we didn't have a single fucking member of any staff team from avicus, while the other top 4 teams did.

Well I assume it's because there was no punishment outlined for finding an autoclicker in a screenshare, there was only one for using it (which he wasn't banned for). So we voted and the vote turned out in favour of don't dq.

I clearly said that I don't know how and why zaoki was banned in this post and my other ones if you'd read you'd know.<br><br>However it clearly states in the rules that in no matter what situation if ur team member is banned and the reason is LITERALLY "<span style="color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(249, 249, 249);">Autoclicker found in SS&nbsp;"&nbsp;<br>it makes sense that would be banned and you guys would be dqed. i dont think hes sketchy niether i think he hacked in the matches he played vs us, but if an autoclicker was found in ss and that was clearly in the ruleset its clear that u guys should be dqed.&nbsp;<br><br>it doesnt matter at all "how and why zaoki got banned", if the reason is "</span><span style="color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(249, 249, 249);">Autoclicker found in SS&nbsp;" u guys shouldve been dqed.</span>

it would be nice if kyoal would come down and have a nice chat with us himself but unfortunately he seems to be in hiding<br>and yeah, the whole official team deserves blame and i've been saying that for a while now, and some of them have stepped up, taken the blame, and faced the consequences (like our boy piez, MAD respect), but recently it seems like the majority of the blame lies with kyoal. none of this would have happened without that unnecessary vote, which kyoal started for reasons that are so absurd that i pinched myself multiple times while reading about them to make sure i wasn't dreaming. all of this is just made worse in my mind by the fact that kyoal seems to have vanished instead of maybe owning up to what he did and apologizing. instead, we've got you coming around here on his behalf to give us the whole "people make mistakes blah blah" spiel. at the end of the day, the official team needs a small major reorganization. frankly i can't believe they've gone so long without a leader, it seems like that's where a lot of problems are coming from.

no questions need to be answered, we want you demoted off the official team. we have gotten all the information we want. You had shown no respect to the other officials and to the teams of avicus.<br>yeah, now you have nothing to hide because the officials got tired of taking all the heat and finally spilled. this sound familiar?
