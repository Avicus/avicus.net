Hey!<br><br>So the Officials have been talking and have decided to let the community pick what the tournament style and gamemode should be for tournament 7. You have the ability to vote several times on the gamemode, but only once on the tournament style,so choose wisely!&nbsp;If you'd like to suggest any other styles/gamemodes let us know and maybe you will see them in future tournaments. The polls will close 2 weeks after Tournament 6 ends so, Sunday, August 20th.<br><br><b>Tournament Style:<br></b><a href="http://www.strawpoll.me/13629726" title="Link: http://www.strawpoll.me/13629726">http://www.strawpoll.me/13629726</a><br><br><b>Gamemode:<br></b><a href="http://www.strawpoll.me/13629698" title="Link: http://www.strawpoll.me/13629698">http://www.strawpoll.me/13629698</a><br><br>#hypetrain<br><br>Regards,<br>The Avicus Official Team.

The tournament currently going on (Race To Victory II) is Capture the Wool. Therefore, we decided to not add that into the poll by itself.

Could we do like a 5v5 tournament? So we can get more teams. Just make it so a leader registers himself and 6 more players and makes the team name. Then boom there registered. So 1 team could make 3 or 4 little ones. As long as the team has 4 leader and enough members to make a 7 man team.

im&nbsp;sorry but i think the straw poll is broken?? there's no option to pick hypixel zombies for the gamemode...<br><br>EDIT: Also on a serious note DTC is quite a bit different from DTM, it would be nice if they were separate&nbsp;options.

Regardless of what the strawpoll says, competitive DTC will never be feasible without dedicated practice servers for teams, preparation, and dedication.<br><br>&nbsp;Avicus teams already are so far behind OCN teams, I dont think having a tournament based around a gamemode&nbsp;thats basically completely unexplored competitively among Avicus players is a good idea. It would be one sided. Not the mention the map pool - all the maps on this server already pale in comparison to OCN, and with DTC being relatively unexplored competitively you're going to end up with garbage maps.<br><br>DTC on Avicus is literally CTW except even more stalematey. There are lanes leading to a fucking obsidian objective.<br><br>Play TDM, let the cheaters cheat so the good team(s) can have at least some sort of a challenge lol
