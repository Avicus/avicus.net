</h1>
A few things need to happen before the next tourney.<br><ul><li>Senior staff need to take responsibility for their tournies, not pawn everything off onto officials.</li><li>Maps need to better developed, and finalized before the tourney is announced to prevent last minute map updates or confusion regarding which map version will be played.</li><li>Officials need to all be demoted. Every single official has failed to make avicus tournies even somewhat respectable and competitive.</li><li>New officials need be competent hack detectors, unlike almost all the current officials.</li><li>Gameplay needs to reflect avicus not ocn.</li><li>Advisor rank needs to be removed. Even the advisors don't know what the point of it is.</li><li>Refs need to be decently trained.</li></ul>

SSing is pointless with this stupid temp ban for disconnecting rule, until that's fixed it's useless.<br>Officials have proven they can't do the job, gotta move onto the next batch to find someone who can.

I think the Advisor rank would feel like it had more purpose if it was changed to Official and Official was changed to Event Coordinator. Regarding the hack detection, I think plugins are the best shot at that.

What about event staff playing in tournaments? I think that's a main issue that's causing a lot of confusion inside and outside the event staff team. In addition, I'd like to add that plugin's are very limited, and we need a lot more to make something run smoothly and organised. We can be blamed for certain things, but it's not all down to us. We have to work with the tools we have.

If there is an excess of referees, then there is no reason for one not to play. As a consumer of Avicus, its not your moral obligation to commit to your duties 24/7. In the event an opportunity is presented, why not take it and play. Also, we have 20 refs, 6/20 is a mere 30%. Not to hard for that many to show up, especially due to the similar times matches have nowadays.

Refs are not part of the staff team. Nor does it make anyone unorganized, except for the official team. There is almost no problem in refs playing, however officials playing is another issue. It's not an admins job to host the tournament because they/he/she might not have experience with such an event. Hence, why we have around 8 officials. I said 6 as a hypothetical number, I wouldn't know which refs show up when.

I don't think it's feasible. Players should be forced to join with a specific client in my opinion.

You said "<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; ">But do the officials/staff team ever listen?" after you agreed that Zac be allowed to discuss it on TeamSpeak. It's a mystery to me why you think talking and typing makes a difference.<br><br><br>If you actually think the Tourney staff haven't improved from last time, then you mustn't be looking very well.</span>

+1, We should have a new batch of Officials and I agree that Sr Staff shouldn't give the Officials all the work.<br>Also Game play should reflect Avicus, Not OCN. Also Officials Team (I'm pretty sure, they had a chance to fix things) but they didn't so why should we tell them what needs to be fixed when they should know already..

I have played in all tournaments aswell as Leagues and have had 0 problems. My only concern is how the official team work as a group. Aswell as the communication between refs and teams. And obviously the server and the major bugs it have.<br><br>Edit: The maps aswell, they are quite bad<br><br>So overall there is maybe a bit to do, but the planning from officials I saw no problems in. There's a difference between having to wait for a team because the team is delayed and having to wait for the event Staff bc they are taking so long.
