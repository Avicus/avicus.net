Competitive Avicus

Let's be honest - the server receives an increase in players whenever a 
tournament or an official event is announced. This server needs to 
remember that competitive is what keeps this server living. I mean yeah 
there is public Avicus but that can get boring from time to time whereas
 a tournament actually motivates you to do well and achieve something 
good. <br><br>I remember in both tournaments the player count rose from 
when there was no tournament (about 50 players on) to 150-200 players on
 when a tournament was on or any type of official event. Now I'm the 
type of person that gets hyped up when an event is happening purely 
because it is <b>fun </b>to take part in or even just watch on streams as it is interesting. <br><br>So
 what I believe is that maybe the developers should focus equally on the
 public side of things on Avicus but also the competitive side of this 
and fixing problems like for example the scrim servers that disallow 
teams to scrim on and so they have to go somewhere else to scrim on for a
 start. Of course remember the problems such as the lag that occurs 
there and there but I think that has been reduced from what it was 
before so this does show the developers are making progress but we have 
to support them along the way. <br><br>The best ways of making Avicus' competitive popular is by doing the following (IMO):<br><br><ul><li><b>Create more tournament maps!</b>
 - Builders or Mapdevs, you seem to be creating public Avicus maps when 
public doesn't really need them but what we do need is tournament maps 
for either DTM, CTW or TDM. </li></ul><ul><li><b>Streamers/Youtubers</b>
 - These guys seriously help a lot I believe streamers are vital for 
when a competitive scene is around as observers would love to watch what
 is going on.</li></ul><ul><li><b>More teams</b> - Don't be afraid to 
create a team even if it is just a group of your friends in real life or
 even in the game. Even if your team is bad (most teams are bad from the
 start especially if they are only starting out) that doesn't matter 
because you can improve your team over time and see how you guys perform
 in a tournament and then judge yourselves and keep going. The best 
teams are the ones that stick together for a long time!</li></ul><ul><li><b>Organisation</b>
 - Organisation is key - if the organisation is sloppy and bad the 
players who are playing will get annoyed with you and they will just not
 want to compete again or even not even bother with the tournament. </li></ul>Finally,
 fix anything that goes wrong with competitve e.g scrim servers being 
down this is a major thing that developers should be onto ASAP because 
this prevents teams from playing and then having to go somewhere else 
which is annoying for players and teams.<br><br>Also comment down below if you agree or disagree or what your thoughts on competitive Avicus is - thanks for reading :)

Im agree with all that you said, the competitive is a ver importante side in Avicus, because new teams are created for play in the tournaments, so, Avicus get more people.&nbsp;<br><br>Like you said if you want create a team dont be afraid. Any team at their start were bads Or had their problems., for example, when i joined EC it has 1 Or 2 months old and we always play vs Cacal until we son their and se start play scrims versus Apollo, PPB and BC, in this moment we start be better.<br><br>Nice post Zegita.

I forgot give my opinión about create more TM Maps, than you said if the Builders/ Map Devs just do maps for the publics rotation when its the time to do a TM the users critizice the maps cuz all the maps on Avicus are for the publics, lastly more users than Bloodoh-PokerFace- Tomqss were doing more TMs maps than the MapDevs.

+1&nbsp;<br><br>Tournaments are what keeps servers like OCN and Avicus alive. They get the community hyped up and are just generally fun to play in.

You will always have a disparity between topics there will be those who agree and disagree however it is no doubt that competitive Avicus is what helps keep this server living and when there is competition going on an increase in player count is made.

True, but timezones are also a major thing. An example is the Evolved UHC. Lots of people can't make it due to different timezones. If players can't get the time to play for the reason they came here, the server won't be going as planned

For official tournaments everyone participates, even Aussie teams when its the middle of the night. It happened last tourney, and will probably happen again, but they will most likely participate.

Zegita,<br><br>I like your thinking here of acknowledging many aspects of Avicus. This is very thought out well and I believe should be put into action immediately. Competitiveness is the whole idea of the game play for most of us here, as well as, organization (many posts regarding this that we're still lacking, but hopefully make an improvement).<br><br>Nice job, nothing more to be said, just implemented.

Tournaments are good, but what about players, who don't view forums. They don't know about tourneys, updates, maps, about all this blah blah blah here. They come to AV and see, ppl play dtm only, they come next week - no changes, next month - no charges. And they think wow, it is becoming boring, and they find Other Cool Network to play there and never come back :(<br>My suggestion: more maps, mix 'em all, open "coming soon" gamemods eventually.

Perhaps that when a tournament is announced like for example the Walls tournament that is happening right now, in the chat they can put something like "Avicus is hosting a tournament check out the forums" they click on that and they see and they get an idea :)

tourneys are happening enough for us to get an increase in players. This means that the players who join are looking for competitiveness. I myself do like comp matches from time to time but am generally more casual because of my inability to PvP lol. But, I think it's ok in terms of maps right now. Quality has improved.
