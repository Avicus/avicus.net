Please note, this is probably not going to happen, however I would like to see everyone's opinions.<br><br>Well, I was recently presented with a way to have a 99.9% cheat free tournament. Basically, you are required to have something launched in order for you to launch the server. It could be a jar file, which acts as a remote file that tracks statistics and you can only be on the server if you have it open. On the other hand, it could be a launcher where you have to be using something specific to join the tournament server and you can only join it with that.&nbsp;<br><br>I think we can all agree, a lot of people closet cheat. There is no way to catch every cheater, there never will be. A cheater will always beat any form of anticheat in the long run. It will always be like that. I don't think a lot of people would play a tournament with this because it could be potentially dangerous to a person's security, however please take in to account how much this would grow us as a competitive community, and how little cheaters you will be playing with and against.<br><br>Remember, this is only a discussion, and nothing here is announcement. Please, don't expect anything out of this if you are for this idea.<br><br>Regards<br><br>Tazz

It's a good idea, but why not make an anticheat instead of doing that?<br>I know that Avicus have an anti-cheat but why not improve it like Badlion or Kohi? I mean, make updates very often.<br><br>If your idea can prevent autoclickers, I would say that is the best idea ever.

Cheaters will always beat anticheat, however a server side anti cheat can only do so much. Whereas a client side anticheat can scan for lots of things. Look at ESEA's (CS:GO PUG Service) anticheat for example. There is little to no cheaters, because it is a client and it looks for cheats by looking at the person's computer. It would prevent most autoclickers by the scans.

No it doesn't stop mods from working. It just tells us if you have any specific and suspicious mods. So you could use all the allowed ones.

Yes! I would certainly like this, but as stated in the OP, there are some concerns with security. I'd would want to see a full report on how safe it is, because you never know, some people can load rats on it. It can even do damage if an inexperienced developer worked on it.&nbsp;<br><br>Also, it should be compatible with Optifine 1.8-1.9 &amp; some other legal mods, and able to detect irregular files in it (I presume that's the idea though lol).

If it was written by Keenan who I presume when making this website had to follow data and privacy laws, and when you download the client to play the tournament you are abiding to Keenans responsibility of your data and the fact that it would be private, then I would be all for it. Without proper documentation I think a lot of people would be sketchy.&nbsp;<br><br>For instance I wouldnt download and run if there was no statement of "avicus takes responsibility for this product" "it is safe to use this because (insert why here)"<br><br>Having said that I think this has been brought up before, and no discredit to Tazz, this idea needs to be implemented, but properly.<br><br>To anyone that wouldn't download it and run it with proper legal docs for its use then im sorry to announce to the community that you have something to hide!!

If it was a global competitive client I'd do it, but because it's just avicus, I don't really want to as it has no other uses especially since there's 2 days before the tourney.. If ocn and badlion gathered to use it too, I'd do it.

As long as there is no threat to your account/PC using that client then I am honestly all for it. This creates the tournaments to be more fair and anti cheat can only do so much to catch hackers but cannot catch everyone so this is probably the best. If you can also make it so that when you download this client it's easy to dl and there are no complicated steps like optifine used to have 2/3 years ago where you had to delete the meta inf file which took long and now it's just installing simply.

I don't see how this can invade any privacy, if people call a document in a minecraft folder privacy than they really need to get a life.<br><br>Besides, autoclicking will indeed be a thing with or without this, but if you guys do this it's obviously gonna reduce the amount of hackers, so saying there will be autoclickers is no valid argument against having this new ''launcher''.<br><br>Recently started playing a bit of avicus, and this kind of stuff makes me impressed as a new player here.

Creating a client-side AntiCheat measure to help assist the process of detecting cheaters is certainly possible, most popular eSports have something like this.&nbsp;The ideal solution would be to have a combination of both client-side and server-side measures, being able to go more in-depth with the client solution but also being able to regulate public matches and such with server-side ones.&nbsp;<br><br>However, it would require a competent individual with a solid understanding of what they're working on in order to effectively implement something like this. It's important to design a system that minimizes the amount of "point of entries" that would grant any 3rd party the ability to manipulate payload data, or modify it in any way that renders it ineffective.

I dont know why you all think its so unsecure, i see this like a version that you choose exactly like forge or optifine but youd had to have a certain mod or version installed, avicus iant associated in any way with the data of your pc in thjs solution imo, it just makes sure you cant connect with clients. If what i think is right then it doesn't prevent people from using injection clients or autoclickers
