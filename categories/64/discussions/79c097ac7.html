Hi everyone, I'm going to try my best in order to introduce this idea I'm sorry if I have some grammar errors.<br><br>As the title of this topic says the next step in competitive minecraft, I'm looking for relations between servers with our gamemodes (CTW, DTC, CONQUEST), our community is not only avicus but also every minecraft server with these gamemodes, for the majority of us when a server is hosting a tournament is probably the best feeling, we (the community) don't <b>play</b> tournaments for ''Avicus'' or ''Stratus'' we play them because we want to see new maps, new game styles, clutches, in our favorites <b>gamemodes</b>.<br><br>What is the whole point?<br>-We need to get every minecraft team interested in these and maybe get new ones, how? advertisement, some servers such as Avicus or Stratus don't allow this, but let's be honest we are basically the same competitive community, we need avicus and stratus teams to be the same and go for tournaments without looking at the server name.<br>-We need good relations between servers with the same ideas, we need good relations with servers with the same focusing, <b>tournaments</b>.<br><br>I do this topic in order to see your opinion, and discuss in a mature manner hopefully we can reach what we want as a competitive community and it's get it grow.<br><br>(If you didn't get my point it is: advertise tournaments how? maybe a discord where our communities can be together and post every unofficial and official tournaments.)<br><br>Hola a todos.<br><br>Como el titulo de este topico dice, el proximo paso en minecraft competitivo, basicamente estoy buscando por comunicacion entre los servidores con nuestros modos de juego ( CTW, DTC, CONQUEST), nosotros la comunidad no somos solo avicus, somos todos los servidores con los modos de juego que nos encantan, para la mayoria de nosotros cuando un servidor anuncia un torneo probablemente sea una felicidad enorme, nosotros la comunidad no jugamos torneos por ''Avicus'' o ''Stratus'', nosotros jugamos porque queremos ver los nuevos mapas, nuevos estilos de juego y los muy conocidos ''clutches'', en nuestros modos de juego favoritos.<br><br>Cual es el punto de todo esto?<br><br>-Nosotros necesitamos tener todos los equipos que podamos en los torneos, viejos y nuevos, como? con anuncios, algunos servidores como Avicus o Stratus no permiten esto, pero siendo honestos, basicamente somos la misma comunidad competitiva, necesitamos que los equipos de estos servidores sean los mismos que vayan juntos a ambos torneos, sin desigualdad, sin escoger por el nombre de un servidor.<br>-Necesitamos buenas relaciones entre los servidores con las mismas ideas, con el mismo nivel de importancia en torneos.<br>Hago este topico para ver las opiniones de los demas, y discutir de una manera madura, para asi lograr alcanzar lo que queremos como una comunidad competitiva que es hacerla crecer.

It seems like a good step in order to improve tournaments and I agree with the point "we play them because we want to see new maps, new game styles, clutches, in our favourite gamemodes". Working together to make the entire aspect of the minecraft competitive scene better results in more improvements, allows more involvement and generally is a more fun experience, which is good to see.

Completely agree. Whilst all servers that host competitive team based gamemodes are businesses and compete with one another there's no doubt that right now all of us are only scratching the tip of the iceberg, especially when it comes to competitive minecraft. Most people who haven't heard of it would probably laugh at the idea of competitive Minecraft but most of us here know that it's more than possible.<br><br>The first step should really be about finding like minded people; leaders, team members, advertisers, people who are serious about competitive based gamemodes such as CTW as a whole and not just on one specific server. From there it's just about working together and getting the scene out there.<br><br>It's quite obvious working together will get us further than just trying to individually introudce competitive Minecraft to specific servers.

Competitive Minecraft as a whole is too broad and should be narrowed down and I think that discord is more discussion and showcase than actually <b>doing</b> something about it.

I don't think joining together is necessary as both Stratus and Avicus are completely different in their own respects but at the very least servers like Stratus and other team based gamemode servers should think about working together in some aspects in order to get Competitive MC out there, that is if they are serious about Competitive MC.<br><br>As for the discord it should be out very soon.

It is a competition but in the end, we can't allow any of the servers to fail. We grow as other servers grow and when other server's players get lower. It sometimes does not work like that but it usually does once a server breaks out of its honeymoon stage. Avicus is a newer attender of the CTW gamemode&nbsp;(Stratus has staff members from OCN so it doesn't count) and looking at what the other servers do well and wrong is always important. Not just for getting players but to improve the gamemode&nbsp;itself. If we do that people will be more invested into our servers as a whole.<br><br>EDIT: If I get a kiss from Archy I will be very compliant.

You have a good point and it is a nice idea but in reality there are reasons why some people dont play avicus and some dont play stratus, for example people might not play stratus because of it being 1.9 or people may not play avicus because of the reputation of avicus.<br><br>if it could be done then thought it would be a massive step in the right dorection

He doesn't mean like playing it on a specific server. What he means is he wants to get competitive CTW out there, regardless of who hosts it. This is about competitive CTW as a whole, not about Avicus or Stratus or any other server for that matter.

I agree wholeheartedly that we are basically the same community with Stratus, etc... The name doesn't really matter, its like tennis, there's the Aussie open, Wimbledon, Us open and French open. All run and played uniquely but they're all within the same tennising community.<br><br><br>We could possibly do deals with non pvp servers in terms of advertising. Servers that don't utilise gamemodes we use such as prison or creative servers may be open to advertising our pvp and competitive minded server, whilst we could advertise their more casual server. Possible partnerships like that could bring us new players, especially younger players, who seem to enjoy larger youtubers who play prison servers and we may be able to attempt group projects with other servers as we would have more resources to work with.&nbsp;<br><br><br>Good relations with other smaller PVP servers like Stratus in a coalition like movement could work. Maybe we could organise inter server tournaments or fortnightly competitions with Stratus and other small servers and make a combined effort to gain support and market share? We could possibly have seasonal tournaments where each server chips in money for a prize pot?

I agree however i want to comment about the point of getting new players is very hard<br><br>You see, back then when ctw wasnt such an evolved gamemode it was ez to get into it - make a team and compete.<br><br>however now, a new player to minecraft or new to ctw, cant make a team and compete so easily - he will get demolished by the very evolved meta of gameplay like skybridging, rotations and all the other good stuff. i mean we need to think together on how to make new teams feel comfortable because imagine if ur a new team and u keep getting fucked by experienced players.

So we want to play the tournaments on Avicus or Stratus to see our favorite gamemodes, new maps,and &nbsp;new maps? Well that was too interesting I love ctw my most favorite gamemode of all times because Im really good at bridging on ctw maps and always rush all the time. If someone is a defender I would help them like In Stratus Scrims I played with Billgrims and helped sharknadoseven he was a really great pal. Some of the pureblox members says I'm good at pvp and killed many players while I helped sharknadoseven.

I'm not sure about that, of course new teams won't be super competitive at the start, but in Badlion teams like ''Ominous and Rift'' did very good in their first CTW tournament, even better than other OCN, Stratus, Avicus based teams, in order to improve in this section, Posighdun and I are creating a youtube channel where we are not only going to post videos about good moments or funny moments but also introductory videos to the gamemodes so everyone can learn the basics and improve their own play style.

So we want to play the tournaments on Avicus or Stratus to see our favorite gamemodes, new maps,and &nbsp;new maps? Well that was too interesting I love ctw my most favorite gamemode of all times because Im really good at bridging on ctw maps and always rush all the time. If someone is a defender I would help them like In Stratus Scrims I played with Billgrims and helped sharknadoseven he was a really great pal. Some of the pureblox members says I'm good at pvp and killed many players while I helped sharknadoseven.
