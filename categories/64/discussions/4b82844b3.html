I'd like to suggest having the roster sizes for the League Season 2 the max they can be (30) just because it's a league and spans about 12 weeks. Because of this, not everyone will be able to attend and different people will want to play. Leaders might find it difficult to tell players that they won't be able to play for their team for a pretty long time.<br><br>Just a suggestion, ty for reading :)

The hardest part of entering a tournament with a limit is telling a member of your team that they cannot play. The simplest way of getting rid of this problem is to remove the limit. The officials need to be more mindful of the teams, and the team leaders. It would be very easy just to increase the player count by 5 or maybe even 10 - a lot easier than telling a player that they cannot play in the league.

Tournaments need a cap of 18 or so. The league should have a very high cap of say 25-30, due to the nature of games being played weekly or bi weekly, you need back ups for back ups. You can then have maybe 3-4 portions of the seasons which are in effect like transfer windows - but maybe on 3 transfers or so, so teams dont change too much.

My point is, you do not need 12 backups. You need to field 6 people, 8 at max. The minimum has a 3.33. ratio. That is very high which I do think you realise. 12 backups is already way too high. If you have 20, active members (unlike myself xd) then you should not have a problem fielding 8. The two most active teams have 10ish players on a matchday.

It should be 30 because it is a league, not a tournament. In a league, everyone is meant to play and participate for the team. I'd understand why the tournament roster for an actual tournament might not be 30 but this is not the case. All the players in the team should be able to play in matches and feel part of team. How'd you like it if you were excused from a league because of another player? You may think it is a tournament but because of the layout of this, it is a league.

If I was excused then I would go and find another team and improve? Like I said above, people shouldn't have more than 20 people in their team who are active and who play, because they know that they will have to 'excuse' them for the tournament.

If I was excused then I would go and find another team and improve? Like I said above, people shouldn't have more than 20 people in their team who are active and who play, because they know that they will have to 'excuse' them for the tournament.

But we arent OCN. Why cant we try and implement new player caps? They are trying 5v5, why dont we try making it higher? Having more people on field would be SO MUCH more interesting than the current 8v8. What people are suggesting, is that you make the LEAGUE either 30 or 25 players because its a League.... In a tournament sure, let the roster be 18. Its a tournament, you only take your best players (thats how it works). Also, you are allowed to have more than 18/20 players. A team is supposed to be your friends, so what if you have more than 20? As long as you have fun as a group its still a team. Having to tell people to stop playing and leave is terrible. You would know this. The fact that Avicus has larger teams than OCN is one thing, however, we have so many fewer teams. Making a team on Avicus is not easy. If all the excess on apollo was to leave that would be 4 players.... What if they can't find any friends to play with, because they are all on Apollo?

I think that the fact that the league is over such a long period of time compared to the tournaments, means that I should be raised. People in a tourney are picked because they're the best in your team. You play a couple of matches over 2-3 weeks and then its over. With a league it disables people to play competitively over a long period of time.

Roster sizes are 20. You play with 8. Tbh, I don't care that you have too many players on your roster. If you haven't realized. the sizes for T1 and T2 were&nbsp;<b><i><u>18.</u></i></b><i><u></u>&nbsp;</i>Now it is 20. &nbsp;It's not my fault that you have a gigantic roster when the sizes for the first two tournaments were 18. Furthermore, the ratio for players on field to roster sizes is 2.5. That is very big.&nbsp;<b>I</b> (no, i'm not leaking, this is my opinion) want the roster sizes for tournament 3 to be less than 18.

I say we make the next tourney 5v5 or a 6v6, we'd get more teams.

Although team sizes may decrease, we will not go anywhere as low as 5v5.

Avicus doesn't currently have maps to support 5v5s / 6v6s anyway. Even if it would happen, it would take a while.
