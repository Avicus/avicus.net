1 players can be banned without them being disqualified. If they have two players hack, they get disqualified. That's what I know anyway.

The players that were banned during our games just got banned and we played on. you cant have different rules just because your team is considered "top tier". Your matches should all be counted as losses, he played most/all?

A player from The Crazy Beaners was also banned so it makes sense that the matches wouldn't be counted as losses. If TCB and Apollo were both given losses for the matches those players played in it would result in them pretty much being disqualified, since they couldnt regain enough wins. Much as I agree with that it should be counts as a loss, it can't really be changed... they should both be deducted a win each tho.

You can't say that. Its not a matter of if you would/wouldn't have. If you won illegitimately then you cant count it as a win. From an observers perspective the match is always 50/50. Its probable that you would have beaten them but there is also a chance that you wouldnt. You cheated your way through that match, not your whole team, but one of your players, So you cant count it as a legitimate win.

How did Ingi make that rule, lol. And yes, I agree. we shouldn't have a cheater on our team. But how could we know? I agree with all of the points that you made except for the ones that we should have lost all the matches which isn't right because the staff &nbsp;didn't make the rule clear.

can someone explain to me why he wasn't screenshared? Apart from having "evidence" from an autoclicker detector. Because as we know the Ingibot has been falsely banned before by such mechanisms in place.

i doubt that if ingi wasnt autoclicking/another player was playing would've made a difference of 50 points (or in your case us winning over 100 points) lmao, one player can't make that much of a difference

There was probably no need for a screenshare as he also got GCheat banned on JD7 which was the same day as this tourney, they practically had a double check by looking at that. If he has been detected by 2 autoclick detectors then its pretty obvious he is cheating.

Ok, first off, you guys do not understand the rule set. The rule set states that the match the player is banned will be made a loss, not every match he played on. However, he was banned after matches so we can not make him lose one particular match. I believe we have came to a conclusion so wait a minute so I can finalise it.

Ok.&nbsp;<br><br>The officials have come to the conclusion from the evidence of the bans that Apollo will lose their match against Varsity, and The Crazy Beaners will lose their match against Team Allah. However, on the latter, Team Allah already won the match so nothing is changing there. We came to this conclusion by timing the evidence that we have for respective players and timing that to the match they were playing at time that the evidence was created.
