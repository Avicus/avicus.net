So I was playing Avicus today, and I got a kill and had no golden apples so I died instantly since I was low. What if we had kill perks? For example if you get a kill you get regen for 3 seconds or if i get a kill you get absorption hearts for 3 seconds or resistance for 3 seconds. This is what i came up with:<br><br>Regeneration for 3 Seconds After Kill: 50,000 Credits<br>Absorption for 3 Seconds After Kill: 40,000 Credits<br>Resistance for 3 Seconds After Kill: 40,000 Credits<br><br>This way credits will be more useful and would prevent getting cleaned up in some cases. Thanks for reading!

you're supposed to get golden apples from kills already. If you don't, it's a map bug that you can submit to <a href="http://Avicus.net/issues" title="Link: http://Avicus.net/issues">http://Avicus.net/issues</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://avicus.net/forums/discussions/5671b2f86">https://avicus.net/forums/discussions/5671b2f86</a><br><br>For the suggestion itself, it's not a bad idea but we need devs for this to happen

mate, Avicus is practically rip right now. I don't think they're going to add new features for the 30-100 players they have.

Actually, ad ös <img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/47b15675a0484e8f863a0cbf86ba22dc?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/profbananaslug.html" style="color: #009396">profbananaslug</a> said, thats not a good idea due to that if you are stacked, maybe full diamond, and get the perks ur even more stacked and its going to be really hard to kill that person.<br><br>Anyways +1
