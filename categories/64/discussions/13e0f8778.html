Suggestion the Official Team

This is a suggestion made out of desperation- and I know that for a fact, this would never be approved because the people who run tournaments would be the ones who need to improve it, and typically would ever voluntarily remove themselves from power (not saying that this is comparatively bad to a complete control over a team, per-se, but it's just what I'd believe).<br><br>I was thinking that we need to contact literally any server that's not ourselves to pull people who know how to run a tournament. Running a tournament requires a whole foundation, and if any of the pillars are broken, it won't be successful. I notice that complaints get lodged against the officials, and realistically, that's going to happen- but it shouldn't happen for the same and/or basic things for every tournament.<br><br>Meeting the desires of the community is crucial for survival. Being that competitive is one of the few features of the server that lets it stand on its own two feet, we need to take drastic measures in every way possible to preserve our teams, players, and reputation. As a disclaimer from many players, myself included, we feel that compared to any other server that offers competitive Minecraft and similar gamemodes- they are objectively better than what Avicus does. We've been doing tournaments for a long time now, and I can't really find any more excuses to use anymore.<br><br>I am suggesting that we contact people who have flourished in developing tournaments to run our own tournaments, and have the officials essentially just help supervise/plan it with them. We need improved communication, better planning, more marketing, better reliability, improved staff quality, and a lot more that could go down the list- and honestly I can't expect the officials to bring all of that together and stop the problem at the source, while other servers have been able to do that quite easily.<br><br>Rather than tripping on our own mistakes, it should be possible to contact someone from RMCT/Stratus/OCN/Badlion/RFW/etc. to help us work out the kinks in the tournaments, even if it's only a temporary solution.<br><br>I apologize if it seems like I'm frustrated- I've just poured my heart out in feedback for 3 years and I feel like now it hasn't really been listened to or even considered. This has been the first feedback I've delivered since 2 months ago.

I mean it goes from who they promoted, no offense they&nbsp; promoted some people who have zero experience in this field. It's been like this for a while now, we haven't seen progress

I personally don't see a problem in this, but I wouldn't like some of us to be completely removed from power.<br>&nbsp;I also have an idea for after the tournament when it comes to the Official team and more, but that won't be mentioned just yet.

I'd just like to see the Officials follow their own rules and not vote on them.

denial? Almost every competitive player says the tournaments here have not been the best lately and the same problems arise. Haven't heard one official since PieZ step up and say they fucked up.

My man LFT is actually an amazing official, can't blame him at all<br><br>He actually approached me of these issues and any suggestions, which to my memory no official has done voluntarily to take time out of their day and actually listen to my problems. He acknowledges improvements and is actually willing to do something.<br><br>Wondering now if he's the best official :thinking:

Oh I totally agree, he has done everything in his control since T4 to make them better, some things he just cant fix himself, but I just don't see him that often answering players complaints or suggestions publicly for tournaments.

This sounds like a good idea. With what happened last tourney, its worth a shot.
