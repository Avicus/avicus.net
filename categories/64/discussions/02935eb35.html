I think that to make the league more competitive and to attract more people from other communities, some changes should be added to the next seasons.&nbsp;<br>My suggestion is two (or more) divisions of the league, with a promotion and relegation systeam being added. Also to make this more attractive, the league should be shorter in time and in number of teams per division (i think 8 or 10 would be good).<br>Well this is pretty much my idea.

The first problem with the league is participation, there needs to be a way to accommodate each time zone so then each team can play.<br><br>Originally the two teams were required to agree on a time, which was cool but there are some flaws with it, maybe a set time, but if the leaders can agree on a different time, then let them play then?

It happened once when we faced Cronus, since both were around Aussie timezone. We had the matches like 6 hours before the actual league started.

imo, it would be good if teams before the league say the times when they are able to play, some teams have european time, others aussie, others american.

The officials are still discussing what this league's prizes will be but I'm pretty sure it'll be something different than before
