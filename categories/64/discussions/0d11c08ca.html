Avicus has a small competitive community, it doesn't make any sense to have large team sizes. I think to increase competition, reduce teams sizes to 5 or 6 and and have a maximum of 12 players, similar to OCN. This will make games more interesting and more teams. It'll also make scrims less rare since you don't need 10 players

It's &nbsp;8v8 at the minute, and we definitely are not going lower.

I like the idea but 5 or 6 members per team is to low. I think that the team rosters should be reduce to 16 member per team. So, if the Official Team do it we'll have more teams=more competitive.It's just my opinion.

I would rather have it maximum 8v8 for tourneys, but we still need to have 5v5 maps cause many people cant get enough players in scrims.

Tbh i think it depends what kind of tourney.<br><br>DTM and CTW are mostly 10v10 so minimum 8 players max 10, 18 registered<br><br>TDM is 8v8 so min 6 max 8 with roster of 16<br><br>somethibg small like lanes would be like 5v5 or 6v6 so the roster size would be like 14 or 15<br><br>i think varying the amount of players (at least on field) would be cool dpeneding on the gamemmode

DTM and CTW don't have to be 6-8.; the maps can be smaller. But I agree with the lanes idea.

I am not talking about the Tournament sizes, iÂ´m talking about the sizes for a competitive team should be 16 IMO

We didn't even have teams show up for this tourney, Reducing it will just lead to more of that.

umm, sorry but where is the logic in that young man. Reducing team sizes will lead to more teams being created meaning more competition

More teams being created, which leads to less players on a team, which also means the chance of players making a tourney time are reduced. Yes, it does bring more competition but also if a team that has 16 players on it, and only six for example show up for a tourney, how do you expect the smaller teams to?<br>

5v5 gameplay is really boring and I don't think we should copy OCN, it didn't exactly work out for them, did it?

It's the 'large' and 'successful' teams' fault if they are unable to split their team.
