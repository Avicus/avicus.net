Now that the tournament has been announced i just want to remind everyone and make it clear that from this point onwards we won't be appealing punishments or shortening them just so you can play. What i mean by this is if you have or you get a temporary ban or a permanent ban inbetween now and Tournament 3 we won't be appealing them or shortening them just so you can play your match, even if your ban was to expire the following day or a few hours after your match. Basically just follow the rules and note that if you decide to break them then you run the risk of missing out in playing the Tournament. And if you are banned please DO NOT ban evade to play your match, it isn't worth it. We will be doing random ip checks and making sure people aren't using alternate ips to try and elude us, we have a few tricks up our sleves for getting past VPNs and determining if you are ban evading or not.<br><br>Apart from that, later on in the week i'll make a post about Screensharing. Since the majority of us don't know much about how it works and i am sure we will be doing it quite a bit during the tournament.<br><br>Good luck to all the teams who are planning on participating.&nbsp;<br><br>Administrative Team
