hello it's your boy <b><b>L</b></b>egoche and im back with a new post<br><br>but in all seriousness<br><br>we need to talk, as a community<br><br>look at how avicus' competitive scene has been over the past 2 years, it was at it's peak between the league and BOE, at least going off team count<br><br>so what has happened since then? why has avicus declined recently?<br><br><u><b>Lack of maps</b><br><br></u>Take a look at T1, there were 6 maps, all new and this was before there was any "meta" on the maps, so this was arguably the best time for maps, since it set the meta on this server. Recently, the maps have declined, look at project redemption, maps were just squeezed out and were rushed without testing. T1 and T2, even T3 had a little bit of testing.<br>Now, avicus' original maps have been removed - Rendezvous 3 DTM and CTW, Wahiz, SenexCTW. At the moment on avicus there are no teams that actively scrim on avicus scrim servers, Apollo and I think Allah haven't properly scrimmed seriously on avicus in MONTHS.<br>I know for a fact, I have only mega scrimmed recently and that isn't a good way to maintain a competitive scene. The lack of maps means a lack of scrims. T4 wasn't enjoyable to watch because it came down to pvp skill, and not about strategy since no teams practiced thoroughly.<br><br>Next tourney has a new gamemode, and let's just be honest, you aren't getting 8 good maps. Not until testing happens, and thorough testing, even then, the lack of keen map makers on the server is little now, with mainly mapdevs making tourney maps. <br><br><u><b>Lack of teams</b></u><br><br>At the moment there are no active teams that scrim, due to the lack of maps. Majority of active teams have to resort to OCN scrim servers now. Project Redemption had the most amount of teams that signed up, and yes, they may not have shown up but it showed some hope of growth, but since then nothing has happened. There is no advertisement, which is one of the main reasons nobody has decided to move here from OCN - it was a prime time to advertise, and take players and teams from OCN, but the chance has flew by now. <br><br><br><br>They are the two main reasons, for me at least, why the competitive scene here isn't active or enjoyable at the moment. I think for this server to stay alive, advertising needs to happen. But advertising can't happen until there are new maps that are enjoyable. Honestly, something needs to happen, and fast, before everyone gives up.<br><br><u>I intend no hate with this post</u> and it's <u>just to spark discussion</u>, <u>not flame war</u>, and to hopefully give the high staff/officials ideas on what to do next.<br><br>so what are your opinions, people of avicus????????<br><br><b><u>TL;DR</u></b> lack of maps and teams are the problems with avicus competitive scene

I agree with pretty much all the points made here but just find it extremely stupid and irritating that the sr staff, officials or mapdevs haven't done what the competitive scene here needs.<br><br>There is an extreme lack of good, competitive maps on the server. Ever since ryan, eric and para have decided to remove their maps not enough have been submitted. Along with this the mapdev team apparently finds it very difficult to look at a map and decide whether to implement it on the server or not, not rocket science. But for me, I find it stupid and pointless removing your maps if they're gonna go to waste, why rub salt into the wound of an already dying competitive scene?<br><br>The lack of teams is purely because very little has come from mainly the officials/sr staff in attracting them. Where are the map testing events we were promised? Where's the advertising we were promised? It's not hard to contact a youtuber with 1k+ subs and ask them to record on the server, there's so damn many of them. Map testing is also non-existent, but this is partially to blame on the lack of maps coming to avicus (especially competitive). I'm sure if the officials made a post saying something like, "Map testing event Saturday 7pm GMT" then teams that are pretty much dead in the scrimming department such as apollo and allah would show up. The only way to explain the lack of new players AND teams is the tremendously low effort shown from the staff.&nbsp;<br><br>There's plenty of people to blame so it's hard to force them to do anything about the dying competitive scene. But I'll say it for the one millionth fucking time; get more maps, advertise and create map testing events. It's not hard.

on a serious note, there is no motivation for me as a map maker to make maps for this network. no one takes care of them, no one puts effort into xmling them and the mapdev team are lazy af and all blame responsibilites on eachother. until this is not fixed all my maps will remain removed and i wont be making any maps for this server

I agree with the general idea to be honest. I still think that the way to get more teams would be to advertise more, not through YouTube but through the actual server. As most players don't even know about the competitive community i think the devs should change broadcasts to say about teams and scrims. As only the older players and players with experience really know about the "competitive scene" but this could easily be changed.

I agree with everything other than removing my maps. I did it and they will remain removed until I see that advices starts learning from their mistakes and doing shit<br>the amount of time I have put into mapmaking on this server is huge I only know little others who put that much time into this . I also don't feel like it's going to waste like you said. I can bring them back anytime as soon as they start doing shit

We should have advertised the fuck out of this server when OCN shut down.<br>Instead, all Avicus (staff and community) was concerned about was the racism rule.<br>Priorities&nbsp;man..

This is something that I did not expect from you, well I agree that lack of maps and lack of active teams are the problem of avicus competitive escene. First, for map devs guys you should focus or have people only for tournament maps because imo they are easier to make. Second, lack of teams, I invite people from teams to do videos of them playing tournaments or scrims I used to love videos from Eric aka Xuph and you Legoche but nowadays I think you do not upload anything to that platform, minorities make the majority important as soon as i restart my pc for completly i will do some videos for this community! lets get a hope!

Waiting too <i></i>long, need to have more tournaments and <i>better </i>prizes. Yeah, I understand you have no money due to low donations and such, but if you have more tournaments and maybe a decent prize, that will attract more players and more teams which leads to possible more donations and other fun money-making senerios. Maybe have a certain tournament where it costs to enter and there being a cash prize pool?? idk just throwing out ideas on how other competitive games and servers run things.

I think that prize pools alone aren't the way to grow in players, sure it makes it more competitive but advertising is still needed and better quality in maps before people play for money

Imo if I decided to create a map that usually takes 2 days if you are active as fuck and I don't know how to do xml the less thing that avicus can do for my time is create a xml so both sides work.

The lack of compeitivenss is pretty much everyones fault, there is no one person or group of people to blame. We can all do something to try and contribute to the competitive scene but we don't.&nbsp;<br><br>Advertising is our fault, as a senior staff team, but lets be honest a 1k youtuber wouldn't magically bring 100000 competitive players here and it wouldn't be all fairy tales. The problem with advertising is it costs money, something we don't have.<br><br>I do agree with you on the lack of maps and also the quality of the maps. But you cannot blame that souly on the mapdevs. When it comes to tournament maps, it's the officials in charge of the maps that deals with this kind of stuff, not the entire mapdev team. That being said you can't blame the officials either, if there are a lack of maps then why don't you all start making some maps if you're concerned about it.<br><br>tbh It isn't maps, advertisement or any other random reason why competitive has shrunken. Those are all smaller things that has contributed to a much larger problem which has caused the majority of this, that is the attitude change. Right now the attitude is "Lets not scrim because no other teams are active" or "the maps are shit so lets not scrim". That isn't the inactive teams fault or the maps fault, that's your problem fo holding that attitude. If you don't like the maps then give feedback to the map dev and improve them, if you want to scrim then don't just presume no other teams will scrim you because they will. Sag and Horizon are two teams that scrim on Avicus every week. Encouraging other teams will also help. It's really an attitude issue rather than a map or activity issue.This attitude/idea of well things are shit right now so instead of helping I'll just complain and waste my time. "All the other maps are bad so I'll just remove mine from all the rotations". Seriously, it isn't this much of a deal and it certainly isn't dead. If some of you actually helped out rather than just complained we might be somewhere else right about now. And this also goes towards advertising, most of you have friends who are decent size youtubers. Why don't you talk to them instead of just complaining? Well because of this attitude.<br><br>Where I am trying to get at is, if you want to fix competitive then the first thing you have to do, we all have to do is get rid of this ridiculous attitude.Even if I got a 50k youtuber to advertise, if this attitude stayed the same nothing would change except more players would join who could of played competitive but didn't because they were put off.

That isn't the inactive teams fault or the maps fault, that's your problem fo holding that attitude. If you don't like the maps then give feedback to the map dev and improve them, if you want to scrim then don't just presume no other teams will scrim you because they will. Sag and Horizon are two teams that scrim on Avicus every week. Encouraging other teams will also help. It's really an attitude issue rather than a map or activity issue.This attitude/idea of well things are shit right now so instead of helping I'll just complain and waste my time. "All the other maps are bad so I'll just remove mine from all the rotations". Seriously, it isn't this much of a deal and it certainly isn't dead. If some of you actually helped out rather than just complained we might be somewhere else right about now. And this also goes towards advertising, most of you have friends who are decent size youtubers. Why don't you talk to them instead of just complaining? Well because of this attitude.<br><br>Where I am trying to get at is, if you want to fix competitive then the first thing you have to do, we all have to do is get rid of this ridiculous attitude.Even if I got a 50k youtuber to advertise, if this attitude stayed the same nothing would change except more players would join who could of played competitive but didn't because they were put off.

For the first time i kind of agree with you<br><br>but still the mapdev team is not doing shit, when i was a builder you could see that. Also they just throw responsibilities at eachother, unorganized and such. As a mapmaker i would want the mapdev team to take care of my map, fix bugs and such

If you make a map for a server, and you give it to them, and you all the sudden want it removed, I do not think you should be able to do that. You are giving a minecraft map to a minecraft server, if you don't want them to have it anymore, too bad. It's like donating money to a charity, you can't just ask for it back when its been used. A map dev told me "its how we pay respects to them for giving us their map, by removing it if they ask"... I am a bit salty because five frenzy maps were removed and now I have three for my tournament. oh and wahiz is gone.

Also just thought I say that some of these teams don't mean to be inactive. Team Allah haven't in a while, yes, but that doesn't mesn to say they haven't tried. Just last week we organised one, the timing didn't work but the intention to scrim was there.&nbsp;<br><br><img src="https://crafatar.com/avatars/7dcb1605a6414f6f99efea04278b6f7c?helm&amp;size=20" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/lgmatias.html" style="color: none">lgmatias</a> I'm sure my man lg can vouch that we did try to organise one.<br><br>When it comes to scrimming you have to do more than just your LFS. You may need to contact a team leader and organise a scrim in advance, so if we change our attitude from "oh well I put lfs but no one responded because their all inactive" and actually went out of our way to scrim then I can guarentee you'll see an improvement in scrim activity within a week, if not less. Go and ask the teams that aren't so active to scrim, organise it. There is no excuse not to...

I'm like 50/50 on this. Whilst I do think it is a really dumb move to make to remove your map from a network for a real funny reason they did make the maps so technically they have every right to. I know when it comes to maps the whole ownership thing is a blur but on Avicus we do allow map makers to have rights. By Mojang, all maps/worlds belong to them, technically, so we could if we wanted to deny their request and keep the map. But on Avicus we do acknowledge that owners have rights and one of them is to remove a map for a valid reason.

I don't think you quite understand how it works. You won't see any positive change or any change for that matter without having a different look on the whole situation. Things aren't going to change with the attitude of "o well competitive is dead lets not do anything about it".

"All the other maps are bad so I'll just remove mine from all the rotations". Seriously, it isn't this much of a deal and it certainly isn't dead. If some of you actually helped out rather than just complained we might be somewhere else right about now. And this also goes towards advertising, most of you have friends who are decent size youtubers. Why don't you talk to them instead of just complaining? Well because of this attitude.<br><br>Where I am trying to get at is, if you want to fix competitive then the first thing you have to do, we all have to do is get rid of this ridiculous attitude.Even if I got a 50k youtuber to advertise, if this attitude stayed the same nothing would change except more players would join who could of played competitive but didn't because they were put off.

Sure, a map is your property, but really? &nbsp;You aren't gonna make any money off your map, so why ask to remove it? &nbsp;It just sounds salty to me, and counterproductive :/<br><br>Also, I do agree with map making as a whole. &nbsp;I lost all motivation to make maps after building multiple, and never even getting an accept or rejection. &nbsp;On top of that, maps that I made that actually got accepted never made it to rots, no communication with me if there was a problem, nothing was said. &nbsp;Pretty discouraging<br><br>Its sad to think that mapmaking was at its best for me when Polar_Express was mapdev for walls maps. &nbsp;There was ONE mapdev for walls, and he made it worth building maps for, cuz he tested and cared about making the gamemode better. &nbsp;I haven't had that experience with any other gamemode maps, including a tourney map, and they have multiple mapdevs :/

you seriously cannot blame us. you want to know why its died so much? one reason being scrim servers being shut down for so long when they were shut down. if that doesn't kill the competitive scene then who knows. don't blame us when you have most the power to do things to fix it.

The lack of compeitivenss is pretty much everyones fault, there is no one person or group of people to blame. We can all do something to try and contribute to the competitive scene but we don't.&nbsp;<br><br>Advertising is our fault, as a senior staff team, but lets be honest a 1k youtuber wouldn't magically bring 100000 competitive players here and it wouldn't be all fairy tales. The problem with advertising is it costs money, something we don't have.<br><br>I do agree with you on the lack of maps and also the quality of the maps. But you cannot blame that souly on the mapdevs. When it comes to tournament maps, it's the officials in charge of the maps that deals with this kind of stuff, not the entire mapdev team. That being said you can't blame the officials either, if there are a lack of maps then why don't you all start making some maps if you're concerned about it.<br><br>tbh It isn't maps, advertisement or any other random reason why competitive has shrunken. Those are all smaller things that has contributed to a much larger problem which has caused the majority of this, that is the attitude change. Right now the attitude is "Lets not scrim because no other teams are active" or "the maps are shit so lets not scrim". That isn't the inactive teams fault or the maps fault, that's your problem fo holding that attitude. If you don't like the maps then give feedback to the map dev and improve them, if you want to scrim then don't just presume no other teams will scrim you because they will. Sag and Horizon are two teams that scrim on Avicus every week. Encouraging other teams will also help.

Your advertisement argument is completely wrong. You have quite obviously not tried hard enough.<br><br>I know you don't know, but do you want me to tell you the youtubers I had lined for Equinox, how I got them, and how much I paid?<br><br>I had Hivlik, Avery, VadriFlash, Delta, wylt, with a lot more with 1k +. The reason I had this is because we were a 1.7 server. We supported 1.7. You can't use this as an argument anymore, because you also support 1.7. I paid nothing. 0 dollars. Your advertising argument is pathetic.

If you make a map for a server, and you give it to them, and you all the sudden want it removed, I do not think you should be able to do that. You are giving a minecraft map to a minecraft server, if you don't want them to have it anymore, too bad. It's like donating money to a charity, you can't just ask for it back when its been used. A map dev told me "its how we pay respects to them for giving us their map, by removing it if they ask"... I am a bit salty because five frenzy maps were removed and now I have three for my tournament. oh and wahiz is gone.

you seriously cannot blame us. you want to know why its died so much? one reason being scrim servers being shut down for so long when they were shut down. if that doesn't kill the competitive scene then who knows. don't blame us when you have most the power to do things to fix it.

Well it clearly isn't. You don't know our situation, you just assume it and hope you're right. We are not some famous million dollar business, if we were then I guarentee you there would be more youtubers than players on the server, and we aren't a business with a whole load of ties to the Minecraft youtuber community.

Equinox was nowhere near release and we had people come on the server, there was a shit ton of bugs. I don't think advertisement would actually help this server from those ties. This server has a terrible reputation from the OCN community, other than those with friends here who try it out. It just annoys me when you say you've tried so hard, when I honestly don't think you've tried so hard at all.

Then try to be a business, starting on improving the variety of gamemodes and maps. the next is changing the scrim servers and tournaments(because I participated in 2 tournaments, and they were so bad on hosting and in interest of the community), then changing the community and finally calling some youtubers. If you want this server to be good you will have to use some money for it, but when the server could run correctly, you will recieve all the money you expend on this and there more. So with this effort you could make avicus "great again". <br>But if you keep talking shit and not doing anything like now, this server will finish as OCN did.

It's never too late. Considering we use to average 3 players before hitting peaks of up to 2000 anything is possible and we certainly have a lot of time before anything really bad happens with Avicus so we might as well spend it productively then thinking about what could have been.

No. We got 2000 people 4 years ago. Stop using MCZone as a scapegoat for all of Avicus' problems. Its done, that dream has been beaten into dust. Now you average what? 20 players. Its been like this for over a year, so is 'anything' really possible? I also noticed that you&nbsp;<b>the admin</b> argue as if you do it purely to defend some sacred throne. Accept that the issues you have and build off of it. You seem to forget everyone you argue with has played on this server for the same amount of time as you (if not longer). You do not need to reiterate the same points every other sentence. Just take pride in your mistakes and move forward. Stop looking at the past, this nostalgic attitude avicus has holds it back. Constantly hoping for "the glory days" to come back is a serious issue. Its not going to come back, suck it up and keep moving forward. Instead of trying to counter every single point made in this thread record what people are saying and take it to discussion. By instantly arguing every point made on this thread, <b>by yourself</b>, you eliminate opportunities for conversation.<br><br><br>Thanks for making me waste a valuable 5 minutes of my night.

I never said the main problem with the network was your attitude, nor did I say we can get 2000 players. I am more than aware that those days are over. I was simply using it as an example that if we can do something like that then we should be able to fix competitive easily. People do make posts about improving things but it's one thing to post something and a completely different thing to do something about it. On top of that only a few people do these kinds of things, which is a shame. I never said the community has to have a positive attitude, I said we <b>ALL</b> have to. Please read what I say rather than presume and filling the gaps in.

Ok this is beginning to trigger me here.....<br><br>First of all, we need to clearly define that we need more players before some go competitive. Eg. We Advertise and get 100 new players, only 1/20 of them join competitive, so we get only&nbsp;5 &nbsp; competitive peeps, with 1000, it would be 50, etc. Now I'm just making those numbers up, idk the ratio of kids that stay and become competitive, but you get the point, some will.<br><br>Map problem:<br><br>Admittedly it would be a lovely thing if we had one or two lovely maps be added each week, but realistically that isn't going to happen. Why can't the whole mapdev team pick a few times a week and build a map together? There are 10 of you. Most maps have 2-4ish authors, why can't the 10 &nbsp;work together and release a new competitive map every 2nd Saturday/Sunday? Open it with a mega scrim or something, because those and tournaments seem to be the 2 times avicus hits more than the attendance in my math class.<br><br><br>Youtubers:<br>*You will be here for a while, so please be get comfy for several minutes of reading:<br><br>1. Drop the price of lifetime gold rank and just make it so it "Can join full teams". Until you can revive the server. no one wants to purchase the overpriced rank that literally does nothing. Just change lifetime gold to $5 that "Can join full teams" and drop the lifetime price of emerald to $30 and I'll explain why later.<br><br>2. Get a good public rotation together - Even if the amount of maps is not keeping up with Donald Trump's amount of racist comments, we still have some decent ones. Rend3 DTM and CTW (Put one at the start of rotation, one at the end, so no one remembers there are 2 of them in there), Wahiz, all 3 justices, Senex CTW, Formorgar 2, Rendezvous 1, Sector 6, Sunbeam Temple, Arizona and whatever the new luar is called. Now admittedly half of those don't play well as competitive maps, but some of the public players seem to like 35 people running around Rendezvous 1.<br><br>3. If there is enough money to pay developers and server fees, I don't know why there is not enough to pay for some smallish youtuber. Get one with 10k ish subs to start off with. Set a time with them when they will come on and record a game and tell some of us regulars and staff members when that is happening. That way we can have a decent skill level portrayed in the first video. But also it can stop stalemates - If we get all the regulars/staff playing into TS, We can "Rig" the game in a way. Youtubers like 15-20 minutes videos &nbsp;on average yeah? So if we have 29/30 people who are playing in TS, we can control that time. Now granted that isn't 100% fair, but it does stop a 3 minute game, that everyone rushes and it stops the "10 man defense on a team with 15 players, holy shit, we're really good defenders" game that goes for 3 hours. This way the youtuber, who is probably 12 years old, goes away having a really fun time and conveying the "This server is fun" attitude in his video<br><br>4. At the end of the video, get the youtuber to say "I will be playing on this server again next *Insert day here* at *Insert time here* They can have the IP show up on their screen as they say this. Next whatever time and day they pick, if they have 10k subs, I'm going to guess that at least 200 people show up. I imagine it could be a lot more, possibly up to 2000, but I'll be harsh in my numbers to show my point. &nbsp;Those 200 players will soon realise "Hang on I can't join the game" Thats when Kylo's clever coding of "Join full games for $5" or something of the sort pops up regularly if you are in spectators, we dont wanna spam players with it, but we want our 170 kids in spectator spawn to know about it.<br><br>5. Thats right, this is where our $5 actually useful and not terribly overpriced rank comes in to play. As I said earlier, the youtuber is probably 12, so his fanbase will be 9 years old on average. Mineplex and Hypixel love 9 year olds and so should we. And if its only $5, not the $50 it is on other servers:<br>"MUM I NEED $5!"<br>"What for sweety, we just paid $100 to Madlion, Mineplox and Hi Pixel"<br>"BUT ITS ONLY $5 AND I CAN PLAY WITH CREEPERLEGEND5 (Or any other 10k sub 12 year old name here)"<br><br>6. Lo and behold, by the time they have donated and 60 additional kids have donated and joined to make a 100 player game on wahiz, the youtuber is ready to finish the recording. That is the easiest $300 you will ever see, and remember, I was very harsh on the number of kids that turned up. Now that there are kiddies who know what avicus is and a youtuber who has an understanding of the server, its time to rescue competitive.<br><br>7. Out of nowhere a tournament pops up. Apollo or some team that will make it to at least 2nd (xD) can take the youtuber into their team so he doesn't get knocked out first round, ik he is 12, but just put up with him for a few hours. He can record his POV in the tourney. He can make a pre tourney video advertising it, he can include a tutorial on how to enter. Now an army of 9 year olds want to beat their lord and saviour in mineman are at out door. If even 800 of his 10k fans want to get into teams of 16, that is an additional 50 teams. We could have a tourney of 64 teams. I know it would be mainly made up of 9 year olds and 12 year olds but you get the point, we have a big tourney with a captive audience.<br><br>8. Now this step is optional and will probably recieve backlash, but we need money to keep avicus alive and because 9 year olds will likely pay us anyway. Add a new feature to teams called "Premium" which is a simple yes/no option. To play in this tournament, your team must be premium. The premium cost is $30, hey thats exactly what you said the emerald rank should cost, exactly! Or it could be made up of 6 players who have the gold rank:6 x $5 = $30. Now already existing teams will get around this as they already have $30 of donation in them, so they'll be premium already. Make this tournament premium and between 16 9 year olds getting the chance to play with their hero, we will get $30 from their team. 50 teams of 9 year olds x $30 = $1500. Not bad for our first tourney - with only a 10k youtuber.<br><br>9. By this stage we could go wild, we could buy a bigger youtuber, offer cash prizes for the next tournament, which of course would be premium too. We would be more well known in the world of servers and could look at doing deals such as contradeals with other big servers. I remember there was avicus merchandise somewhere, maybe we could offer that through our youtubers, maybe give them 20% of sales? So we have a variety of options here.<br><br>So by step 9 we have:<br>*A decent playerbase, probably better than decent.<br>*Youtuber/s who have a good relationship with community, whether we keep the small 12 year old or expand into a bigger youtuber who knows, but we have the funds for this.<br>*Possible way to make merchandise work<br>*Money<br>*New blood in competitive scene<br>*With several hundred more kids on, some of which will undoubtedly go on to become mapdevs, hey thats another problem solved<br>*Possible partnerships/contradeals with other servers who were before unwilling to deal with us because we were so small, but now are taking us seriously<br>*Ranks which people are actually willing to buy.<br>*No need for threads like "HELLO ADMINS, SERVER IS DED" or "How long do we have left" or this thread.<br><br>Thats just how I would do it, my 10c worth.

I used to be really competitive and want to scrim a lot, now I don't see the fun/time for it anymore. Mainly because teams are inactive, they rarely scrim and the maps wont work for scrims. I was wondering what happened to maps like Wahiz and Rend 3.5, sad they are gone. Seriously, something needs to be done regarding comp. We either need new maps or have regular scrims. Do these mega scrims happen that the sr staff hold?

Ok this is beginning to trigger me here.....<br><br>First of all, we need to clearly define that we need more players before some go competitive. Eg. We Advertise and get 100 new players, only 1/20 of them join competitive, so we get only&nbsp;5 &nbsp; competitive peeps, with 1000, it would be 50, etc. Now I'm just making those numbers up, idk the ratio of kids that stay and become competitive, but you get the point, some will.<br><br>Map problem:<br><br>Admittedly it would be a lovely thing if we had one or two lovely maps be added each week, but realistically that isn't going to happen. Why can't the whole mapdev team pick a few times a week and build a map together? There are 10 of you. Most maps have 2-4ish authors, why can't the 10 &nbsp;work together and release a new competitive map every 2nd Saturday/Sunday? Open it with a mega scrim or something, because those and tournaments seem to be the 2 times avicus hits more than the attendance in my math class.<br><br><br>Youtubers:<br>*You will be here for a while, so please be get comfy for several minutes of reading:<br><br>1. Drop the price of lifetime gold rank and just make it so it "Can join full teams". Until you can revive the server. no one wants to purchase the overpriced rank that literally does nothing. Just change lifetime gold to $5 that "Can join full teams" and drop the lifetime price of emerald to $30 and I'll explain why later.<br><br>2. Get a good public rotation together - Even if the amount of maps is not keeping up with Donald Trump's amount of racist comments, we still have some decent ones. Rend3 DTM and CTW (Put one at the start of rotation, one at the end, so no one remembers there are 2 of them in there), Wahiz, all 3 justices, Senex CTW, Formorgar 2, Rendezvous 1, Sector 6, Sunbeam Temple, Arizona and whatever the new luar is called. Now admittedly half of those don't play well as competitive maps, but some of the public players seem to like 35 people running around Rendezvous 1.<br><br>3. If there is enough money to pay developers and server fees, I don't know why there is not enough to pay for some smallish youtuber. Get one with 10k ish subs to start off with. Set a time with them when they will come on and record a game and tell some of us regulars and staff members when that is happening. That way we can have a decent skill level portrayed in the first video. But also it can stop stalemates - If we get all the regulars/staff playing into TS, We can "Rig" the game in a way. Youtubers like 15-20 minutes videos &nbsp;on average yeah? So if we have 29/30 people who are playing in TS, we can control that time. Now granted that isn't 100% fair, but it does stop a 3 minute game, that everyone rushes and it stops the "10 man defense on a team with 15 players, holy shit, we're really good defenders" game that goes for 3 hours. This way the youtuber, who is probably 12 years old, goes away having a really fun time and conveying the "This server is fun" attitude in his video<br><br>4. At the end of the video, get the youtuber to say "I will be playing on this server again next *Insert day here* at *Insert time here* They can have the IP show up on their screen as they say this. Next whatever time and day they pick, if they have 10k subs, I'm going to guess that at least 200 people show up. I imagine it could be a lot more, possibly up to 2000, but I'll be harsh in my numbers to show my point. &nbsp;Those 200 players will soon realise "Hang on I can't join the game" Thats when Kylo's clever coding of "Join full games for $5" or something of the sort pops up regularly if you are in spectators, we dont wanna spam players with it, but we want our 170 kids in spectator spawn to know about it.<br><br>5. Thats right, this is where our $5 actually useful and not terribly overpriced rank comes in to play. As I said earlier, the youtuber is probably 12, so his fanbase will be 9 years old on average. Mineplex and Hypixel love 9 year olds and so should we. And if its only $5, not the $50 it is on other servers:<br>"MUM I NEED $5!"<br>"What for sweety, we just paid $100 to Madlion, Mineplox and Hi Pixel"<br>"BUT ITS ONLY $5 AND I CAN PLAY WITH CREEPERLEGEND5 (Or any other 10k sub 12 year old name here)"<br><br>6. Lo and behold, by the time they have donated and 60 additional kids have donated and joined to make a 100 player game on wahiz, the youtuber is ready to finish the recording. That is the easiest $300 you will ever see, and remember, I was very harsh on the number of kids that turned up. Now that there are kiddies who know what avicus is and a youtuber who has an understanding of the server, its time to rescue competitive.<br><br>7. Out of nowhere a tournament pops up. Apollo or some team that will make it to at least 2nd (xD) can take the youtuber into their team so he doesn't get knocked out first round, ik he is 12, but just put up with him for a few hours. He can record his POV in the tourney. He can make a pre tourney video advertising it, he can include a tutorial on how to enter. Now an army of 9 year olds want to beat their lord and saviour in mineman are at out door. If even 800 of his 10k fans want to get into teams of 16, that is an additional 50 teams. We could have a tourney of 64 teams. I know it would be mainly made up of 9 year olds and 12 year olds but you get the point, we have a big tourney with a captive audience.<br><br>8. Now this step is optional and will probably recieve backlash, but we need money to keep avicus alive and because 9 year olds will likely pay us anyway. Add a new feature to teams called "Premium" which is a simple yes/no option. To play in this tournament, your team must be premium. The premium cost is $30, hey thats exactly what you said the emerald rank should cost, exactly! Or it could be made up of 6 players who have the gold rank:6 x $5 = $30. Now already existing teams will get around this as they already have $30 of donation in them, so they'll be premium already. Make this tournament premium and between 16 9 year olds getting the chance to play with their hero, we will get $30 from their team. 50 teams of 9 year olds x $30 = $1500. Not bad for our first tourney - with only a 10k youtuber.<br><br>9. By this stage we could go wild, we could buy a bigger youtuber, offer cash prizes for the next tournament, which of course would be premium too. We would be more well known in the world of servers and could look at doing deals such as contradeals with other big servers. I remember there was avicus merchandise somewhere, maybe we could offer that through our youtubers, maybe give them 20% of sales? So we have a variety of options here.<br><br>So by step 9 we have:<br>*A decent playerbase, probably better than decent.<br>*Youtuber/s who have a good relationship with community, whether we keep the small 12 year old or expand into a bigger youtuber who knows, but we have the funds for this.<br>*Possible way to make merchandise work<br>*Money<br>*New blood in competitive scene<br>*With several hundred more kids on, some of which will undoubtedly go on to become mapdevs, hey thats another problem solved<br>*Possible partnerships/contradeals with other servers who were before unwilling to deal with us because we were so small, but now are taking us seriously<br>*Ranks which people are actually willing to buy.<br>*No need for threads like "HELLO ADMINS, SERVER IS DED" or "How long do we have left" or this thread.<br><br>Thats just how I would do it, my 10c worth.

If Avicus is going to host another tourney, it needs to consider the following:<br>Player Count: If only say 4 teams are going to participate, then obviously the tourney isn't going to happen. When I log on to Avicus in my timezone, max players I see on weekday is 50 and weekends is around 65. If you know that you aren't going to have enough players/teams, then lets work on advertising, as suggested by a few players. Avicus has social media like twitter, instagram, youtube. It needs to constantly use it to at least try reel more players in. I get that Minecraft is dying as a whole, but with all the millions of players out there who have never heard of avicus, try get their attention, persuade them to join,and see what happens from there. If really needed, I know a few youtubers who could potentially play and maybe even record. We just to have to try our best with player counts, and see what we can get from that.<br><br>Maps: Good maps means good gameplay. Regardless if it is public or competitive, we want maps that have good gameplay. Meaning: decent space for pvp, mon or wool rooms in areas which can be defended well, and decent sized height limits. While these are based on both the community and mapdev team, the community has to have an input in deciding whether those made maps have potential in either public or comp servers, or neither.<br><br>When: If you are going to host a tourney right when school starts, expect only a small amount of players. If you do it in the summer holidays, expect more. Basic common sense point, no need to explain further.<br><br>Prizes: Make prizes better, a forum tag looks cool but really isn't worth winning a tourney for. (If anything else is included, lemme know). (Only modify this if you know you are successfully hosting a tourney)

Im agree with you in that, but you could be agree with me that this is not going to happen because the most part of the community is not interested in solvingg the problems of the server. They just play and then they are complaining about how bad the server is, but without contributing in solving the server problem´s,<br>So that is why I think it is easier what I said in the last post.

But by helping the server, it may reel in more players, making possibly a vast diversity, probably with some competitive players. It could also bring more determined players that could donate, make teams, and win some tourneys.

It's never too late. Considering we use to average 3 players before hitting peaks of up to 2000 anything is possible and we certainly have a lot of time before anything really bad happens with Avicus so we might as well spend it productively then thinking about what could have been.

<div>please explain how the competitive teams came back after scrim servers were fixed. they didn't. If they never were down, this "attitude" thing wouldn't be a problem.</div>

Im agree with you in that, but you could be agree with me that this is not going to happen because the most part of the community is not interested in solvingg the problems of the server. They just play and then they are complaining about how bad the server is, but without contributing in solving the server problem´s,<br>So that is why I think it is easier what I said in the last post.

</div>
It shouldn't be the community's burden to help solve the server. They can't really do anything besides give feedback. The best you can do is leave it up to higher staff. I haven't seen any of this being done and it would really help the server if it did. If it really was that bad, the administrators and high staff etc. should take note of it. The lack of effort put in to the server is what's making it die, along with the competitive scene.<br><br>@OP<br>If you really had a problem with your maps being in the rotations and
 removed them, you really don't have anyone to blame about competitive but yourself for 
that. While it's your choice to do what you want<b>, <b>consider the complaints about lack of maps, </b></b>did you ever consider the reason competitive isn't played because of this all leads back to <b><b>you?</b></b><b><b><br><br></b></b>

If you take a quick look without knowing anything about the game, you can see some of the top players, upcoming matches (would be useful for tournaments), results (to review past matches), news (such as roster changes), and more all on the home page. Now I think that if Avicus had a page of it's own similar to this, it would definitely encourage people to strive to be the top. For example, let's say from the TDM tournament I have a K/D of 0.95. I look on the leaderboards and I see that someone above me has a K/D of 0.96. I would do my best to pass that player and even get a positive K/D.

Considering that there are &lt;2500 weekly Avicus users, you won't be able to expect too many teams signing up. Especially with the fact that you can sign up about 18 people, it limits the amount of teams even more. As I'm sure most of us remembered, OCN pulled off a similar idea to what I suggested, but there is one reason why it didn't work out, their player base was big enough already so the team sizes they had were appropriate at the time and therefore they angered the community. Simply saying, if you change a 18-man squad to a 9-man squad for tournaments, you can expect many more teams to sign up. You would have double the amount of teams plus many smaller teams that could never acquire a large amount of players. We could easily be seeing 32, maybe even 64 teams. With more teams comes more flexibility, and matches could be scheduled by region to suit each team's needs during the tournament.

If Avicus is going to host another tourney, it needs to consider the following:<br>Player Count: If only say 4 teams are going to participate, then obviously the tourney isn't going to happen. When I log on to Avicus in my timezone, max players I see on weekday is 50 and weekends is around 65. If you know that you aren't going to have enough players/teams, then lets work on advertising, as suggested by a few players. Avicus has social media like twitter, instagram, youtube. It needs to constantly use it to at least try reel more players in. I get that Minecraft is dying as a whole, but with all the millions of players out there who have never heard of avicus, try get their attention, persuade them to join,and see what happens from there. If really needed, I know a few youtubers who could potentially play and maybe even record. We just to have to try our best with player counts, and see what we can get from that.<br><br>Maps: Good maps means good gameplay. Regardless if it is public or competitive, we want maps that have good gameplay. Meaning: decent space for pvp, mon or wool rooms in areas which can be defended well, and decent sized height limits. While these are based on both the community and mapdev team, the community has to have an input in deciding whether those made maps have potential in either public or comp servers, or neither.<br><br>When: If you are going to host a tourney right when school starts, expect only a small amount of players. If you do it in the summer holidays, expect more. Basic common sense point, no need to explain further.<br><br>Prizes: Make prizes better, a forum tag looks cool but really isn't worth winning a tourney for. (If anything else is included, lemme know). (Only modify this if you know you are successfully hosting a tourney)

When you think about it, some people like to get competitive in games, due to the prize outcome. Now I agree, I play for the fun, but some money prizes would definitely lift spirits in putting more time into it.

Like I said. We have to work together in order to fix the competitive scene. There isn't much else I can do by myself, which I'm currently not doing, that can fix the problem. There is a whole bunch of stuff that, if everyone helped out, could easily bring the competitive scene back and make it flourish like never before. But we all need to have the right attitude, we have to start working together as a community and we have to start <b>now</b>.&nbsp;<br><br><img src="https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e01b7bc6ccce273cc73a8d8590832678?s=20&amp;default=mm" class="m-0"> <a href="/users/Legoche.html" style="color: Gray">Legoche</a>

Also these months 2 active teams were dissolved (Spacedeepers and Jalapenos) and two teams merged, avicus lost many teams that used to play. Probably the activity in the competitive one can be solved making more frequent the tournaments so that the players are encouraged to create equipment and to participate.
