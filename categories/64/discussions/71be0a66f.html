Hey i have been thinking lets ramp up the server and make it more popular and fun by adding in more creative gamemodes and tournaments. We need&nbsp;publicity&nbsp;and for everyone to be onboard the server isn't going anywhere its just making it funner and cooler. I ask that u youtubers and staff to work&nbsp;together&nbsp;to create a amazing community.<br><br>If your with me say yes if not I understand.<br><br>By ShoxyPvP

Lets get Atlas through and then we can start planning from there with all the bugs that will come out with it to be fixed.<br><br>But seems like a good idea

We are adding new gamemodes in Atlas, and the Officials are planning the next tournament already. Also I know we have tried to contact YouTubers and I think we are continuing to do so, it's hard to find one at the right price though.

You have to apply for Ref in order to have a high chance to get official, you have to be a Dev to help with the new gamemodes, and the YouTube thing is for Seniors only, meaning you have to get Mod before you get Senior. Basically you have to put in hard work if you want to help. But good luck getting a YouTuber to actually respond, I've tried many times before.

Cool story but I don't think we could make it a world-wide thing.<br>It's notorious for being a kids game so chances are it will never get majorly big.

This seems like a cool idea as this server has a competitve side to it. Sports are commonly competitive against other teams, so it could be a cool thing to have in my honest opinion.
