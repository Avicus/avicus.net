Since a lot of Avicus players seem to have issues finding teams on OCN, this is partially due to people not knowing how to break into OCN and partly due to the fact that OCN competitive is hard to break in. Due to this, I figured I'd make a guide on how to break into OCN competitive. &nbsp;<br><br>Here it goes:<br><br>a) don't be picky with teams, take what you can get. &nbsp;<br><br>It doesn't matter if you are by far the best player on the team, take what you can get. Don't be picky when choosing and applying to teams. The whole idea is that you will get your name out there, that is what you want. If you're the best player on your team, it actually means you will stand out more, so it's not all bad. Take the best team you can get ofc, but I really stress not to be picky, you aren't going to get into SS first thing. Also, OCN gameplay is different from Avicus, the meta is different, different maps, strats and you need to learn the map knowledge before anything. I went from Implosion, which was the meme team of OCN, to JagPass and Eclipse because I got my name out. Be patient.&nbsp;<br><br>b) go searching, be proactive. <br><br>Make a good lft, put effort into it. Give things like timezone, videos of you playing, positions, stats on different servers, description of your personality is optional but helpful and your Skype. Apply, go out and apply, teams will not go out searching for randoms to be quite honest. Link your LFT in your app, usually at the bottom. &nbsp;<br><br>c) don't be toxic.&nbsp;<br><br>What makes you even less likely to be tried out than just being a random is being a toxic random.&nbsp;<br><br>d) don't give up.&nbsp;<br><br>You may not find a team right away, but keep on, keep searching.&nbsp;<br><br><br>Finally, when you get into a team, make sure to take notes and learn.&nbsp;<br><br><br>If you're interested, I can link some of my LFTs/LFOs as examples, just ask.
