Poll: Regarding the next tournament

</h1>
Question: Would you be ok with a 5v5 TDM tournament?<br><ul><li>A) Yes (list reasoning) (4)</li><li>B) No (list reasoning) (6)</li><li>C) Depends (list reasoning) (1)</li></ul>My reasoning for having it as a 5v5 is because if it were to be a regular sized tournament, there would probably be only 6 teams (from Avicus) who would be able to meet the registration requirements. If it were a 5v5, this would give smaller teams the opportunity to play, make it easier for people to create teams, and the big teams can split into multiple teams. Would you rather have a small tournament with lots of teams or a big tournament with a lower amount of teams? We will have the maps edited to suit a 5v5 so after all of this, if you still disagree with the decision, leave your vote and a detailed response as to why. Please keep in mind that we will still have 8v8 for the next tournament. This tournament is to mainly be used as an <b>extra&nbsp;</b>tournament and an incentive for smaller teams to develop while still giving everyone a competitive environment.&nbsp;<br><br>When voting, please include the letter of your choice in your response. Submit your vote through a forum response.

B<br><br>I feel like 7v7 could work, but not 5v5. 5v5 is just too small for DTM and it would be really hard for maps to be optimized for that reason.

Yes.<br>As you stated, only a few select Avicus teams can actually meet the requirements of 8v8.<br>What would be best to include as much of the community would be to have it 5v5 atm.&nbsp;<br>As you said, it would allow smaller teams to participate as well as split bigger teams up, thus creating more teams &amp; a broader range of selections for newcomers to the community.<br>Having it an 8v8 will only restrict the amount of players from the community that we include and only condense the amount of teams and diversity of play styles in the community.<br><br>Because lets be honest, these new teams won't allow just anybody to join their team, and nor will they actually play every person they have on their team.<br>If you want to only please a select few, then 8v8 is the way to go, but to actually please the whole community and get them involved, a 5v5 would be 100% the better choice.

Yes<br>Stop listening to poor reasonings, doing this 5v5 tournament you allow competitive teams (serious, good, decent) to come to Avicus, I don't dislike the idea but I completely hate how you guys say ''We are working on something'' for soo long expecting hype or ''Yeah finally something'' and then you do nothing for example maps sadly Fouled is the only one capable to actually fix some maps for a 5v5 competition, DTM is something I hate just because the gameplay is completely trash but I guess some people from here like it so you should give them it.

B<br><br>More teams won’t necessarily result into a better tournament, and the chances of a team no-showing are just as likely in 5v5’s as they are in 8v8’s since the team roster sizes would shrink as well.<br><br>Stick to 7v7/8v8 and instead make a mini tournament that would have 5v5 roster sizes.

A. 5v5 is better because smaller teams can play without getting last minute players.&nbsp;<br><br>I think the map dev team should host a 5v5 competitive map competition. There are so many good map makers out there.

Btw, if you want your server to grow up and become important or playable at least forget about 8v8's pointless for top teams to play them ;)<br><br>Remember what you want is a competitive community, not a lot of friends doing a team of 9 to participate once and then leave it for other teams, you want teams to stay so you can't do 5v5 and then 8v8, you got to choose what you want Avicus to be so this is not that easy to go and make a poll

If i understand you correctly, I kinda agree with you. But avicus needs to stay 8v8 because that's the community we have here, you cannot just drop down to 5v5 because you need more teams, got to get creative with it.
