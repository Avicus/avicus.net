<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Because we don't really have too much to report on this week, Ethan and myself decided that we would focus on the tournament. Yesterday matches 1 to 5 kicked off and 10 teams battled it out for spots in the invitations. This update will go through the results and a few other stuff.   </p>

<h3>Issues<br><br><span style=" font-weight: 300;">Everything went perfectly, we were organised before hand and that organisation payed off. I'm sure the players that played can agree that so far this tournament is the best we have hosted. My only real issue is, which you could probably see from the above results, the no shows. It's not acceptable. If you don't show up I don't understand why you would register. I can't really say anything to Group A to change anything beause half the matches are already done but to Group B, China Baby Toes, La Vigen, Eternal Cross, Cronus, UbeR,  Team Ungespielt, Xenarch, Jalapenos, Sagrevyum and Black Hole I would kindly ask that you be prepared for your matches on the 18th and 25th of June and try to not no show. </span></h3><ul>

it says on the challonge that it was 2-0 to tcb<br><br><br>op: really well organised tournament so far and i'm really enjoying it. Just a shame that we didn't get to play 2 matches due to no-shows. Hopefully it is only those 2/3 teams and doesn't end up being half like last time.

We nearly beat it vs ScorpionS :c&nbsp;<br>The tourney is going great so far, the only problem is the no shows which you can't really do anything about.

honestly keep up the great work - the organisation was great definitely this tournament so far is our best tournament. gl to all the matches in Group B and yeah wish teams would not no-show that is the only downside which you can't hugely do anything about.<br><br>edit: these community updates are really good because it tells us what's going on and stuff really good guys keep it up :)

I agree this tourney went a lot smoother than the last ones. I'd say the no shows weren't an issue because it's not something the officials can change.
