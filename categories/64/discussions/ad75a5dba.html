<b>PLEASE NOTE: Nothing in here is confirmed or even planned. I just want to know how many people would be signing up and if anyone would be interested in helping us come up with a prize pool.</b><b><br><br>Survey:<br></b><a href="https://goo.gl/forms/In3eKp2qkjVQW0AY2">https://goo.gl/forms/In3eKp2qkjVQW0AY2</a><br><b><br><br></b>I can't stress enough, nothing is planned or confirmed. I just want to know numbers and if anyone would be interested in helping out.<br><b><br>How it would work:<br></b>There would be a crowd funded Prize pool for Tournament 5. I can't confirm any details except that the top 3 teams would recieve something from this prize pool. The officials and myself are also more than willing to start up the crowd fund with some of our own donations. Like I said I just want to know if anyone would be interested so, if we did decide to make a prize pool, then we could plan it out. If your interested please fill out the survey.<br><b><br><br>Since this post is only an informational post I'm locking it. Feel free to dm me on discord if you have any questions.</b>
