<b></b>Uhm, after watching Zegita' s post, I get the "inspiration" to give some suggestions, so here w' go.<br><br>We know, When a tournament is annunciated Avicus gets x2 or x3 more users than normal, But why? Because Competitive is what most people want.<br><br>How to get more people then?<br><br>-Advertise Avicus "públic" players about Competitive aspect, Broadcast messages like Walls tournament.<br>-Officials give more information about tournaments, give some new oficial information each week so the interest of the tournament will Increase, and not loose. (Example)<br>-Advertise Tournaments on Other PvP communities.<br>-Work on more TM maps and not on public ones, many people complain of the lack of variety &amp; gameplay of most Avicus maps.<br>-Better Prizes.. ( As Walls TM )<br>-Experienced Refs for Officials Events.<br>-Practice servers for teams that Register on tournaments ( Just the ones that really want them )<br><br><br><br>Hope this can be helpfull.<br>Ciya

As stated in my thread, you should add to your list, <b>organization.<br><br></b>This means that devs should notify us two to three hours beforehand of when the servers are going to be down so we could plan our time accordingly and not waste it.<br><b><br></b>I hope my concern will be heard among devs and staff.&nbsp;<br><b><br></b>Yes, I agree with Nova's points to make Avicus a much stronger, professional and encouraging community. Competitiveness and organization works well in pairs if done correctly by our staff to bring many new players into our community.<b><br></b>

The mostly of the points that you said are simular like the Zegita's points. But im going to give &nbsp;my opinión about everyone of the points:<br><br>-Its a good idea, with this the members of the Avicus community that dont play the competitive can know more about the TM.<br><br>- Im not agree with this idea, because the Official prefer do a post w/ all the information.<br><br>- Like Tazz said, is imposible do it without ban you from this server for spam.<br><br>- I gave my opinion of this idea in the Zegita's post:<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; ">&nbsp;If the Builders/ Map Devs just do maps for the publics rotation when its the time to do a TM the users critizice the maps cuz all the maps on Avicus are for the publics, lastly more users than Bloodoh-PokerFace- Tomqss were doing more TMs maps than the MapDevs.<br></span><br>- Its a good idea, cuz the prizes of the others tourneys were so poor.<br>&nbsp;<br>- If you want have experiencia refs &amp; officials they first should refering officials events.<br><br>-Avicus has privates scrims servers, now its has bugs but the staff is working in this.

Actually Seth, Sli, me, and a few others were working on a map earlier today. If the community pitches in too we will definitely have improved maps by the next tournament.

Officials have nothing to do with that. Developers are aware and I don't know why they aren't fixed.
