</h1>
There are a few issues in the upcoming tournament which i want to have a community discussion about and hopefully change some stuff we agree about to the better<br>here is a list of issues i want to discuss, and these stuff I consider issues you might not, therefore its a discussion. comment your thoughts. I tried to be very not biased since some of these issues i believe if they get fixed they would hurt my own team but i am for it cause im trying to be not biased and for everyone.<br><br>1. There wasn't enough time to prepare like ryan and seth said. it takes lots of time to learn a map and practice it, and earn chemistry. also the tourney consists of lots of new maps which are unknown not only to new teams, even to the old teams because the maps are new. it takes time to learn them and scrim on them. i think the dates should be delayed in order to let teams practice more.<br><br>2. Roster sizes are too big imo. shadowbladz made a nice post about this <u><b>(theres a TL:DR at the bottom cause the post is very long)</b></u> and i will quote it instead of writing on my own cause i think he did a good job describing the problem: "<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">It's actually retarded that people wanted 16 rosters on 8v8, I'll get to 14 in a second. That's literally merging two 8 full team squads together. You never need 8 subs, if your entire main roster possibly wont show up, you probably need a new main roster. Also the "we want to sub people in and out for certain maps" is stupid. It's not fun for players to be stuck into a certain role and only be played for that role, and it's also just not healthy for what's being called a "competitive" tournament. I've seen people using the comparison to sports, where players are only played in certain positions because that's what they're best at, but this comparison makes 0 sense. PGM players also have positions, that part is comparable, but the different maps of PGM and gamemodes ruins that comparison. PGM's gamemodes with their massive differences makes it difficult to be at a top tier level in a position in each of them, but this difficulty should be embraced as what makes PGM such a unique and fun competitive game, it shouldn't be worked around by huge roster sizes. The players who should win should be the best players, not the team that has the best frankenstein monster of players who are good at 1-2 things stitched together.</span><p class="western" style="margin: 0.16cm 0px 0cm; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; border: none; padding: 0cm;">14v14 falls into the same trap, needing 6 subs is a stretch. Let's say 2 subs don't show up, because they're the kind of people who like you said you never know if they'll show up, you now have 4 subs. That can replace half of your main roster, and that's only under the assumption some of your subs didn't show. If you really have the problem that 6 of your players can't say "oh yeah I can make it" and then don't show up, that's not a problem with the roster sizes, that's a problem with your shit ass team who can't organise themselves. Again the subbing people in and out of matches shit comes up, which again, is retarded. Saying a cannoner shouldn't try to turn himself into a well-rounded player incase it effects his cannoning is retarded. No other "competitive" game favours people who fall into such a small sub-role so hard. People shouldn't be allowed to be a one trick pony player and win tournaments with it.</p><p class="western" style="margin: 0.16cm 0px 0cm; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; border: none; padding: 0cm;">12v12 deals with a lot of these problems atleast to some extent, because the subbing in and out based on maps/gm is probably never going to stop, it's become a part of PGM tournaments. However just because it's become commonplace doesn't mean it isn't unhealthy to the community and the tournaments.</p><p class="western" style="margin: 0.16cm 0px 0cm; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; border: none; padding: 0cm;">And I sympathise with the argument of wanting to play with friends. Having to ask your friends to leave or kick them is stupid and annoying, but again, since this tournament is calling itself "competitive". It should to an extent, put the competitive health of the tournament before the social circles of its participants"</p><p class="western" style="margin: 0.16cm 0px 0cm; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; border: none; padding: 0cm;"><b><u>TL:DR for shadowbladz:</u></b> 18 roster sizes are wayy too big and should not be a thing because its a lot bigger than needed and eliminates the ability half of the players in a certain roster to play basically.</p><p class="western" style="margin: 0.16cm 0px 0cm; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; border: none; padding: 0cm;"><br></p><p class="western" style="margin: 0.16cm 0px 0cm; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; border: none; padding: 0cm;">3. This is not a big issue but the name doesn't make sense with the map pool. usually you call a next tourney race to victory 2 if it has similarities to race to victory 1. i know both are ctw, but itd make sense if there were half the maps at least were from there.</p><p class="western" style="margin: 0.16cm 0px 0cm; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; border: none; padding: 0cm;"><br></p><p class="western" style="margin: 0.16cm 0px 0cm; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; border: none; padding: 0cm;">4. Rei's minimap is allowed. according to raging and falcon, you can see players when using it on the map. it obviously shouldnt be a thing for ctw or any gamemode and i dont think this requires explaination. raging approved it around 5 mins ago when writing this post.</p><p class="western" style="margin: 0.16cm 0px 0cm; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; border: none; padding: 0cm;"><br></p><p class="western" style="margin: 0.16cm 0px 0cm; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; border: none; padding: 0cm;">5. I dont like the map pool. No offense to fouled, all of his maps are very good. i love slis maps, but they get repetitive. all the maps in the map pool that are sli-made feature almost the same gameplay. they are made same style. im not implying by any way the style is bad, not at all. it features good gameplay, but when you have lots of em the gameplay gets repetitive, which is the issue imo. im all for creativity and uniqueness so i suggest picking 2 or so of the best maps of sli which imo are sub urban and forestry, which are the best out of all of them. im for giving other players opportunities to get their maps on the map pool too. i would also like to see GD3, Wahiz, and RendCTW on the map pool since they all feature unique style of gameplay. if the map pool is 6 maps, id suggest by my own opinion: Golden Drought 3, Wahiz, Rendezvous CTW, Sub Urban, Forestry, Coral Reef 2. Here is a good poll raging made about the map pool where you can vote about it:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.strawpoll.me/13280293/r" title="Link: http://www.strawpoll.me/13280293/r">http://www.strawpoll.me/13280293/r</a></p><p class="western" style="margin: 0.16cm 0px 0cm; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; border: none; padding: 0cm;"><br></p><p class="western" style="margin: 0.16cm 0px 0cm; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; border: none; padding: 0cm;">Thanks and comment your thoughts</p><p class="western" style="margin: 0.16cm 0px 0cm; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; border: none; padding: 0cm;"><br></p><p class="western" style="margin: 0.16cm 0px 0cm; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; border: none; padding: 0cm;"><br></p><p class="western" style="margin: 0.16cm 0px 0cm; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Lato, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; border: none; padding: 0cm;"><br></p>

My opinion:<br>1. Agreed<br><br>2. 50/50. I personally think whilst having 18 people may be considered too big by some people its pretty much the norm. It works. Why fix something that isn't broken? Avicus is unique with its roster sizes and I don't really see any clear benefits of shrinking the roster size. At the end of the day it's still an 8v8, so a bigger roster size just means more people can have a chance to play. That depends from what angle you look at it though.<br><br>3. I wouldn't really call that an issue.<br><br>4. I've got no idea.<br><br>5. Disagree. Well I kind of agree and disagree. Maps are meh but I think it's better having new maps then bring repetitive maps like Wahiz and Rend, which have already been in at least 2 tournaments. As for GD3 I'm pretty sure the reason it wasn't in the pool is because the owner gave us permission to use the public version.

If the tournament is called: "Race to Victory 2" then where are the maps from "Race to Victory 1"?

I complained about the style being repeptitive if you'd read right. imagine a map pool with 5 maps that play the same style, that would be repetitive. a map thats been played in the past will not be repetitive in one tournament specifically its not like this map would be constantly played

The point he's trying to make is that all of the new maps are repetitive. They feature similar layouts, and the same gameplay but with a different look, but it'd be less repetitive if there's more variety in the pool. If you look at how different GD3, Wahiz, Rend 3, and the other maps are, they don't all play the same.

I read what you wrote, what I don't understand is why use those maps when you can just make a new, good map that hasn't been played and doesn't have a stale/repetitive meta.

Ofc I disagree with the roster sizes because Apollo have 19-20 players, it would not be very helpful to lower them. But the map pool? I see no point in playing the same maps for many tournaments as it brings the same gameplay and the same strats as before. I wouldn't be completely opposed to GD3 but again it's been played in many OCN tournaments before so teams already know how to play it. These new maps require practice and so interesting tactics are made meaning an interesting tournament for once

Ofc I disagree with the roster sizes because Apollo have 19-20 players, it would not be very helpful to lower them. But the map pool? I see no point in playing the same maps for many tournaments as it brings the same gameplay and the same strats as before. I wouldn't be completely opposed to GD3 but again it's been played in many OCN tournaments before so teams already know how to play it. These new maps require practice and so interesting tactics are made meaning an interesting tournament for once

I agree but as i said in relation to the sli issue that all the new maps are about to feature the same style of gameplay. if you want new maps, you need GOOD maps and you also need lots of time for map testing.

RendCTW and Zihaw stop trying to get trash maps into the map pool, why are these super bad? they are huge and skybridging is probably the only safe way to get in thet wool room but it gets super painlopy, a map needs diversity in the gameplay not only one, Sli's maps are good with a few edits they can be better, but rendctw and zihaw are just trash people trying to get these maps just because are the only ones where ''decent teams'' (if they are) are good it's stupid. Second, 18 man roster yeah that's big but it is not time to complain and try to get it lower why? because almost every time has their 18 people done I don't think everyone agree with kicking people this far if this is going to be reduce it needs to be next tourney.

yeah I've only played on those maps once but that's my experience so far. Forgot who I played against but both teams were heavy sky. Mainly on forestry. It was the only approach really made to the woolroom.

As I pointed out the maps made by fouled need edits all of them, why I want them to be in the map pool if they need edits, why don't use other maps? Super simple, you need brand new maps not the same ones over and over again, trailpoint is not being used anymore fouled said so I don't think it is an ''issue'' anymore.

I don't know why you guys are complaining about the 18 players maximum roster size, yeah it's big but if you think 10 subs is too much then just don't register 18 people. Use your brain people. And if you're can't handle the responsabilities of leading a team then just don't lead a team.
